On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) he was deprived of his sixth amendment right to confrontation when the trial court improperly admitted into evidence, over his objection, the prior testimony of a reluctant eyewitness pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>200 Conn. 743, 753, 513 A.2d 86, cert. denied, 479 U.S. 994, 107 S. Ct. 597, 93 L. Ed. 2d 598 (1986), (2) he was deprived of a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s knowing use of, and failure to correct adequately, the false testimony of a state\u2019s witness<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (3) he was deprived of a fair trial as a result of several alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts, which, because of the nature of the due process claim, we must set out in detail. On September 25,1997, the defendant drove his gold Oldsmobile Delta (gold Delta) to the home of Tracy Daniels in the Westville <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>section of New Haven and stayed the night. The following morning, the defendant drove Daniels\u2019 son to a day care center on Union Avenue in downtown New Haven, a short distance from the location on Congress Avenue where the victim, Dennis Carr, Jr., was shot and killed later that morning. At approximately 8:30 a.m., Curtis Hannans received a telephone call from his girlfriend, Delores Lopez, asking him to visit her at her home. Hannans, who lived with his mother and his brother, Jermaine Young, in West Haven, borrowed the keys to a blue Mazda MX-6 (blue Mazda) from Young. According to Hannans, the blue Mazda belonged to the defendant but was in Young\u2019s possession on the morning of September 26, 1997. Cellular telephone records indicate that the defendant placed a call to Young at 8:46 a.m. The day care center\u2019s records indicate that Daniels\u2019 son arrived at the center at 8:50 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">According to Lopez, Hannans arrived in the blue Mazda at her home at approximately 8:50 a.m. Lopez immediately borrowed the blue Mazda to take a short drive to a store and, on returning to her home, saw a gold Delta parked in her driveway. The defendant, Young and Young\u2019s son were waiting in Lopez\u2019 backyard and asked for Hannans. Hannans met the visitors outside, conversed with the defendant and Young, and retrieved the keys to the blue Mazda from Lopez. According to Lopez, Hannans gave the keys to Young. Hannans testified that the keys ultimately were given to the defendant and that the defendant and Young promptly drove off in the blue Mazda. Hannans had received the keys to the gold Delta from the defendant and immediately returned to his mother\u2019s house with his nephew.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m., a large group of people, including the victim and Stacey Footman,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> had congre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>gated in the driveway of 711-719 Congress Avenue. At the same time, Carl Harrison was relaxing in his parked car close to the driveway. Two individuals in a blue Mazda drove alongside Harrison\u2019s car. Roosevelt Green, one of the men in the driveway, identified the car as the blue Mazda that frequently was driven by the defendant in the neighborhood. The passenger of the blue Mazda pulled a mask over his face, revealed a gun and fired several gunshots. He shot the victim in the head, killing him. The blue Mazda drove off, and Harrison gave chase in his car. Police arrived at the scene at approximately 9:55 a.m. Harrison\u2019s August 12,1999 testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing was admitted into evidence at the defendant\u2019s trial pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753. At Young\u2019s suppression hearing, Harrison testified that he was able to see the faces of both men in the blue Mazda. He testified that he had recognized the defendant as the driver.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">According to Hannans, Young returned to their mother\u2019s house approximately one-half hour after he saw him depart from Lopez\u2019 house with the defendant in the blue Mazda. Young retrieved the keys to the gold Delta from Hannans and promptly left. The manager of an Auto Specialist body shop in West Haven, Russell Mansfield, testified that the defendant drove a blue Mazda into the shop during the morning hours of September 26,1997, in the company of an individual driving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>a gold Oldsmobile. The defendant requested that his car be repainted gold and negotiated all of the terms of the transaction. The defendant signed the work order form, but also wrote the name \u201cEric Dennis\u201d in parentheses. According to Mansfield, the defendant later returned to pick up the Mazda, now repainted gold, accompanied by the same individual who initially helped him drop it off and a third individual. The defendant paid for the work done to the Mazda.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">At trial, Dennis, who described himself as good friends with the defendant at the time of the shooting,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> testified that during September, 1997, the Mazda was registered in his name at the defendant\u2019s request, even though the car did not belong to him. He also testified that the defendant alerted him to the possibility that the police might contact him concerning some issue with the blue Mazda. Dennis further testified that he lied to the police on October 8,1997, when he told them that he was the only individual who possessed the car or had access to it around the time of the shooting. Moreover, Dennis testified that he fabricated, at the defendant\u2019s request, his entire October 8, 1997 statement to the police concerning his connection with the blue Mazda.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Finally, Eric Canty, an individual who knew the defendant from having spent time around the Congress Avenue section of New Haven, testified that he had confronted the defendant in prison in January, 2001, concerning the role the defendant played in causing the victim\u2019s death. According to Canty, he specifically accused the defendant of shooting Canty\u2019s friend, the victim. Canty testified that the defendant responded that Young was the shooter and that he merely drove the car involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">On the basis of the weight of the testimony elicited at trial, the circumstantial evidence, the consciousness of guilt evidence, the work order signed by the defendant to repaint the blue Mazda on the morning of the shooting, the eyewitness identification of the defendant as provided in the former testimony of a <em>Whelan </em>declarant and an alleged incrirninating statement made by the defendant to the victim\u2019s friend in prison, the jury found the defendant guilty of all three counts. The defendant was sentenced to a total term of fifty-five years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted under <em>Whelan </em>the transcript of Harrison\u2019s testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing, as well as photographs Harrison had identified during that testimony as being of the defendant and Young, thereby violating the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation. Specifically, the defendant argues that Harrison\u2019s repeated answer of \u201cI don\u2019t recall\u201d on both direct and cross-examination constituted a calculated effort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>on his part to undermine the integrity of the proceedings, and rendered Harrison not subject to cross-examination in conflict with both the sixth amendment right to confrontation and the requirement of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>supra, 200 Conn. 753. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. At trial, the state called Harrison to testify. On direct examination, Harrison recalled being present at the driveway of 711-719 Congress Avenue at the time of the shooting. He also acknowledged that his initials appeared on a sworn statement given to detectives and on photographs of the defendant and Young that had been used at Young\u2019s suppression hearing by him to identify those two men as the same individuals he had observed driving in the blue Mazda at the time of the shooting. He could not recall, however, meeting with authorities after the shooting to discuss the matter or testifying in court on August 12, 1999, under oath, about what he saw on the morning of September 26, 1997. As Harrison explained during direct examination: \u201cThe past is the past.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After direct examination had concluded, the state offered into evidence, under <em>Whelan, </em>Harrison\u2019s testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing. The defendant objected to the offer on the basis of the sixth amendment right to confrontation and <em>Whelan's </em>requirement that the wit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>ness be subject to cross-examination. The court admitted into evidence Harrison\u2019s testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing and the photographs referenced in that testimony. The testimony was then read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">During cross-examination, Harrison continued to respond to most questions with the answer, \u201cI don\u2019t recall.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When asked if a certain sentence modification pending at the time of Young\u2019s suppression hearing was subsequently granted in his favor, however, Harrison responded in the negative. When defense counsel returned to that issue later in his cross-examination, Harrison offered a terse reply: \u201cWhy would I want a sentence modification? I did all my, damn near all my time?\u201d Undaunted, defense counsel asked Harrison if he had made up the \u201cwhole story\u201d at Young\u2019s suppression hearing about having been able to identify the defendant as the driver at the time of the shooting in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>obtain a sentence modification. Harrison responded: \u201cI don\u2019t need no sentence modification. I know how to do time.\u201d When asked if he had told a detective that he had been lying down, asleep in his car, at the time of the shooting, Harrison answered in the negative. When defense counsel revisited that issue later in his questioning, he again drew a spirited response from Harrison: \u201cIf I told [the detective] that [I was sleeping], so where this come from that I said I seen him? If I told the detective that I didn\u2019t see him, where did this come from that I said I did see him?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">After recross-examination had concluded, the defendant sought to strike Harrison\u2019s testimony because his \u201cone sentence answers to every question\u201d on both direct and cross-examination deprived the defendant of a meaningful opportunity for cross-examination. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">\u201cThe issue of whether admission of the statement was proper revolves around <em>State </em>v. <em>Whelan, </em>[supra, 200 Conn. 743]. In <em>Whelan, </em>[our Supreme Court] adopted the rule allowing the substantive use of a prior inconsistent statement if: (1) the statement is in writing; (2) it is signed by the declarant; (3) the declarant has personal knowledge of the facts set forth in the statement; and (4) the declarant testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination. ... A <em>Whelan </em>claim is evidentiary in nature and, accordingly, the defendant bears the burden of establishing that the trial court\u2019s erroneous ruling was harmful to him in that it probably affected the outcome of the trial. . . . The admissibility of evidence, including the admissibility of a prior inconsistent statement pursuant to <em>Whelan, </em>is a matter within the wide discretion of the trial court. ... On appeal, the exercise of that discretion will not be disturbed except on a showing that it has been abused. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b821-8\">\u201cThe sixth amendment to the [United States] constitution guarantees the right of an accused in a criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>prosecution to confront the witnesses against him. . . . The primary interest secured by confrontation is the right to cross-examination . . . and an important function of cross-examination is the exposure of a witness\u2019 motivation in testifying. . . . Cross-examination to elicit facts tending to show motive, interest, bias and prejudice is a matter of right and may not be unduly restricted. . . . However, [t]he [confrontation [c]lause guarantees only an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense may wish. . . . Every reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court\u2019s ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Eaton, </em>59 Conn. App. 252, 264-65, 755 A.2d 973, cert. denied, 254 Conn. 937, 761 A.2d 763 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion and that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right of confrontation was not violated. The defendant was not denied all meaningful opportunity for cross-examination. See id., 266-67. Although Harrison was uncooperative with the defense as well as with the state in failing to recall his testimony at Young\u2019s suppression hearing, even after he was given an opportunity to review a transcript of it, he confirmed that he was close to the driveway at 711-719 Congress Avenue at the time of the shooting. He also confirmed that his initials appeared on a sworn statement given to the police subsequent to the shooting and on photographs he used at Young\u2019s suppression hearing to identify the defendant and Young.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Moreover, defense counsel\u2019s persistence on cross-examination yielded lively responses from Harrison on the subject of an alleged sentence modification. Overall, Harrison was clearly reluctant to testify at the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>dant\u2019s trial, another detail the jury could have used to ascertain his interests and motivations. In addition, Harrison responded to defense counsel\u2019s suggestion that he was asleep at the steering wheel of the car at the time of the shooting. In responding to that question, Harrison\u2019s reference to his testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing, read to the jury after direct examination had concluded, was probably more than defense counsel had hoped for.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">Harrison was present in court, under oath, and subject to cross-examination. On cross-examination, the defendant had the opportunity to demonstrate Harrison\u2019s bias, interest and motive, which were for the jury to assess. Furthermore, the jury had the opportunity to observe and to assess Harrison\u2019s demeanor. Given Harrison\u2019s claimed loss of memory, defense counsel was not without resources in his cross-examination because the jury might have been persuaded that Harrison\u2019s prior testimony was as unreliable as his memory arguably was. The defendant, therefore, was hardly reduced to cross-examining a written statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">The most effective cross-examination at the time of Harrison\u2019s prior testimony could hardly hope to accomplish more than was accomplished by the fact that he told a different, inconsistent story at the defendant\u2019s trial. See id., 268. Accordingly, under the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Harrison\u2019s prior testimony under <em>Whelan </em>and that the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right of confrontation was not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b823-9\">The defendant next claims that he was deprived of a fair trial by several alleged instances of prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, he argues that he was deprived of a fair trial because the prosecutor (1) improperly buttressed the false testimony of a state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>witness and failed to correct it adequately, and (2) infected the trial with several improper questions and remarks. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">\u201c[W]e first review the principles that govern our resolution of claims of prosecutorial misconduct. [T]he touchstone of due process analysis in cases of alleged prosecutorial misconduct is the fairness of the trial, and not the culpability of the prosecutor. . . . The issue is whether the prosecutor\u2019s conduct so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. ... In determining whether the defendant was denied a fair trial [by virtue of prosecutorial misconduct] we must view the prosecutor\u2019s comments in the context of the entire trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 571, 849 A.2d 626 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">\u201c[I]n analyzing claims of prosecutorial misconduct, we engage in a two step analytical process. The two steps are separate and distinct: (1) whether the misconduct occurred in the first instance; and (2) whether that misconduct deprived a defendant of his due process right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 572.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The parties dispute whether the defendant preserved those claims. To the extent that his claims are unpreserved, the defendant seeks review pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Our Supreme Court has recently ruled, however, that \u201cin cases like the present one, it is unnecessary for the defendant to seek to prevail under the specific requirements of . . . <em>Golding </em>. . . and, similarly, it is unnecessary for a reviewing court to apply the four-pronged <em>Golding </em>test. The reason for this is that the touchstone for appellate review of claims of prosecutorial misconduct is a determination of whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial, and this determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>must involve the application of the factors set out by [our Supreme Court] in <em>State v. Williams, </em>204 Conn. 523, 540, 529 A.2d 653 (1987). ... In determining whether prosecutorial misconduct was so serious as to amount to a denial of due process, this court, in conformity with courts in other jurisdictions, has focused on several factors. Among them are the extent to which the misconduct was invited by defense counsel or argument . . . the severity of the misconduct . . . the frequency of the misconduct . . . the centrality of the misconduct to the critical issues in the case . . . the strength of the curative measures adopted . . . and the strength of the state\u2019s case. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">\u201cRegardless of whether the defendant has objected to an incident of misconduct, a reviewing court must apply the <em>Williams </em>factors to the entire trial, because there is no way to determine whether the defendant was deprived of his right to a fair trial unless the misconduct is viewed in light of the entire trial.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 572-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">Knowing Use of False Testimony; Failure to Correct Adequately</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">The defendant first argues that the prosecutor improperly buttressed the false testimony of the state\u2019s witness and failed to correct it clearly and adequately, thereby depriving the defendant of his right to a fair trial. Because we conclude that the defendant could not have suffered any degree of prejudice in these circumstances, we need not decide whether the conduct was improper. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>213 Conn. 388, 400, 567 A.2d 1221 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of that issue. At the time of his August 12, 1999 testimony at Young\u2019s suppression hearing, Harrison had one motion for sentence modification pending. At Young\u2019s suppression hearing, defense counsel questioned a cooperative Harrison extensively on that issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On August 13, 1999, the day after Harrison had testified at Young\u2019s suppression hearing, his motion for sentence modification was granted. The prosecutor in Young\u2019s trial, the same prosecutor involved in the defendant\u2019s trial, appeared at Harrison\u2019s hearing on August 13, 1999, and addressed the court on his behalf.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>court, <em>Damiani, J., </em>granted the motion and suspended the unexecuted portion of Harrison\u2019s sentence, effective August 16, 1999. Harrison was placed on probation for a term of eighteen months. By September 10, 1999, Harrison was incarcerated for violation of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, defense counsel cross-examined a more difficult Harrison on the issue of the motion for sentence modification that he had filed before and that was still pending at the time of his August 12, 1999 testimony at Young\u2019s suppression hearing.* *<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Harrison perjured himself five times on cross-examination. Both he and the prosecutor knew that he had received a sentence modification on August 13, 1999. It also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>appears, however, that defense counsel was aware that Harrison had received a sentence modification before Harrison\u2019s cross-examination at the defendant\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">On redirect examination, the prosecutor asked Harrison: \u201c[Y]ou really didn\u2019t get any benefit out of testifying [at Young\u2019s suppression hearing on August 12, 1999], did you, in terms of the modification request, at that time, did you?\u201d After a short recross-examination by defense counsel, consisting of a single question regarding Harrison\u2019s ability to see out of his car at the time of the shooting, testimony concluded for the day. Before the jury was brought into the courtroom the following morning, the prosecutor notified the court that he intended to offer, as full exhibits, and by agreement with defense counsel, four motions for sentence modification that had been filed by Harrison.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The prosecutor also informed the court that he intended to offer for identification purposes only, again by agreement with defense counsel, a transcript of Harrison\u2019s August 13, 1999 sentence modification hearing. The jury was brought into the courtroom, and the prosecutor explained the significance of the sentence modifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>cation applications and orders that were admitted into evidence as full exhibits.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">\u201c[T]he knowing presentation of false evidence by the state is incompatible with the rudimentary demands of justice. . . . Furthermore, due process is similarly offended if the state, although not soliciting false evidence, allows it to go uncorrected when it appears. ... If a government witness falsely denies having [received a sentence modification after testifying for the state in a criminal proceeding], the state is obliged to correct the misconception. . . . Regardless of the lack of intent to lie on the part of the witness, <em>[Giglio </em>v. <em>United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S. Ct. 763, 31 L. Ed. 2d 104 (1972)] and <em>[Napue </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>360 U.S. 264, 79 S. Ct. 1173, 3 L. Ed. 2d 1217 (1959)] require that the prosecutor apprise the court when he knows that his witness is giving testimony that is substantially misleading. ... A new trial is required if the false testimony could ... in any reasonable likelihood have affected the judgment of the jury.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Paradise, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 399-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We conclude that the defendant could not have been prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s conduct. First, it is unclear whether the prosecutor attempted, as the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>argues, to \u201cbuttress\u201d Harrison\u2019s false testimony on redirect examination. The prosecutor\u2019s question was unclear, but it certainly can be read to have asked Harrison to confirm that <em>he had not already received, </em>at the time of his August 12, 1999 testimony, a sentence modification in return for his promise to testify in that proceeding. Read in that light, the question asked Harrison to admit that at the time of his testimony on August 12,1999, he had, at most, a mere hope or expectation that his sentence would be modified in return for his cooperation. It is also quite possible that the prosecutor\u2019s wording of the question, \u201cyou <em>really didn\u2019t get any benefit </em>out of testifying,\u201d referred to the fact that Harrison was back in jail less than one month after he had received his sentence modification. That interpretation of the question is supported by the fact that the prosecutor offered as a full exhibit, the following morning, a fourth application for sentence modification, which revealed that Harrison was incarcerated for violation of his probation on September 10, 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">Regardless, it was, or should have been, clear to the prosecutor that Harrison had lied several times on cross-examination, and that his ambiguous question on redirect examination could have added to the jury\u2019s misconceptions. The prosecutor, therefore, appropriately offered Harrison\u2019s four applications for sentence modification, and the accompanying orders, into evidence as full exhibits on the following morning. He addressed the jury and explained that one motion had, in fact, been granted. Harrison\u2019s perjured July 5, 2001 testimony was the last the jury had heard on that afternoon, and the prosecutor\u2019s explanation of the significance of the full exhibits admitted into evidence on July 6, 2001, was the first matter addressed to the jury on that following morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-7\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s attempt to correct Harrison\u2019s false testimony was unclear because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>the jury had no way of understanding that Harrison had received his sentence modification the day after testifying at Young\u2019s suppression hearing. We disagree. First, it must be noted that defense counsel had stipulated to marking a transcript of the August 13, 2001 sentence modification proceeding for identification purposes only. Second, the court had informed the jury on July 5, 2001, after admitting Harrison\u2019s testimony from Young\u2019s suppression hearing into evidence under <em>Whelan, </em>that Harrison had given that testimony on August 12, 1999.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Third, the sentence modification application and order at issue states clearly that it was granted on August 13,1999. Last, there is strong reason to believe, on the basis of defense counsel\u2019s own words, that he was aware of the fact that Harrison\u2019s motion had been granted when Harrison testified to the contrary during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Under those circumstances, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in correcting his witness\u2019 false testimony could not have prejudiced the defendant. Accordingly, we need not decide whether the timing and nature of the prosecutor\u2019s efforts to correct the false testimony at issue should be characterized as improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b831-8\">Questions Compelling the Defendant to Comment on the Veracity of Witnesses; Emphasis in Closing Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b831-9\">The defendant also contends that during cross-examination, the prosecutor improperly compelled him to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>characterize the testimony of other witnesses<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and then improperly mischaracterized that testimony during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>closing argument.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The state concedes that those questions and remarks were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b833-7\">Expressions of Opinion Regarding Defendant\u2019s Credibility; Singh<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Violation</p>\n<p id=\"b833-8\">The defendant next argues that it was improper for the prosecutor repeatedly to label the defendant a liar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>during closing argument.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> We conclude that most of the remarks were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">\u201c[A] prosecutor may not express his own opinion, directly or indirectly, as to the credibility of the witnesses. . . . Such expressions of personal opinion are a form of unsworn and unchecked testimony, and are particularly difficult for the jury to ignore because of the prosecutor\u2019s special position. . . . Put another way, the prosecutor\u2019s opinion carries with it the imprimatur of the [state] and may induce the jury to trust the [state\u2019s] judgment rather than its own view of the evidence. . . . Moreover, because the jury is aware that the prosecutor has prepared and presented the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>case and consequently, may have access to matters not in evidence ... it is likely to infer that such matters precipitated the personal opinions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>266 Conn. 440, 462, 832 A.2d 626 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">\u201cIt is not improper for the prosecutor to comment upon the evidence presented at trial and to argue the inferences that the jurors might draw therefrom .... We must give the jury the credit of being able to differentiate between argument on the evidence and attempts to persuade them to draw inferences in the state\u2019s favor, on one hand, and improper unsworn testimony, with the suggestion of secret knowledge, on the other hand. The state\u2019s attorney should not be put in the rhetorical straitjacket of always using the passive voice, or continually emphasizing that he is simply saying I submit to you that this is what the evidence shows, or the like.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 465-66. \u201cIt is not improper for a prosecutor to remark on the motives that a witness may have to lie.\u201d Id., 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">We conclude that all of the comments were proper, except the suggestion that the jury must determine, before finding the defendant not guilty, that the state\u2019s witnesses had lied.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It was improper for the prosecutor to assert that there was no evidence to substantiate the defendant\u2019s assertion that Dennis had lied to the police because he feared people other than the defendant. The prosecutor may argue that the jury can draw certain conclusions from the evidence. Id., 465. It was improper, however, for the prosecutor to state, \u201cin essence, that the only way the jury could conclude that the defendant [was not involved in the shooting] was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>if it determined that [seven] government witnesses had lied.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Singh, </em>259 Conn. 693, 710, 793 A.2d 226 (2002).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The rest of the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were proper. The prosecutor did not make a bald assertion that the defendant is a liar, detached from any significant discussion of the evidence. Instead, he argued that the jury could conclude, <em>after considering the evidence adduced at trial, </em>that the defendant had lied. Moreover, the prosecutor discussed a motive for the defendant\u2019s willingness to lie. Absent the <em>Singh </em>violation, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">Appeal to the Emotions, Passions and Prejudices of the Jury</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The defendant last argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors in closing argument when he discussed the significance of the victim\u2019s death to the victim\u2019s family and how a verdict of guilty would \u201cspeak\u201d for the victim.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We agree that the comments were improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>\u201cA prosecutor . . . may not appeal to the emotions, passions and prejudices of the jurors ... or otherwise inject extraneous issues into the case that divert the jury from its duty to decide the case on the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 473. The prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the jury had a duty, as members of the community, to convict the defendant was clearly an improper argument in that it asked jurors to consider matters not in evidence when deliberating the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Whipper, </em>258 Conn. 229, 271, 780 A.2d 53 (2001), overruled in part on other grounds, <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>269 Conn. 97, 106, 848 A.2d 445 (2004). It was therefore improper for the prosecutor to inject feelings of sympathy for the victim\u2019s family, and an inappropriate comment of the \u201cdo your part\u201d variety, into his closing argument. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Ceballos, </em>266 Conn. 364, 395, 832 A.2d 14 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">E</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Due Process Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">We arrive at the question of whether the established improprieties so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the conviction a denial of due process. We conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct did not deprive the defendant of his right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">1</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">Whether the Misconduct Was Invited</p>\n<p id=\"b837-11\">The state claims that the defendant invited the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions compelling him to comment on the veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and improper remarks highlighting that testimony during closing argument,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> with a theory of defense that all witnesses who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>identified him as the driver of the blue Mazda at the time of the shooting were either mistaken or lying. Specifically, the state cites defense counsel\u2019s closing argument highlighting the theory that Mansfield and Daniels could have been mistaken in their testimony, and that Harrison, Hannans, Lopez and Canty all had reasons to lie. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">The defense in this case was that the defendant had nothing to do with the shooting and that Hannans had driven the blue Mazda at the time of the shooting in an attempt to murder Footman. The defense claimed that all testimony elicited at trial to the contrary, therefore, was either the result of mistake or deceit. The court restated the defense\u2019s theory in its instructions to the jury: \u201cThe defendant denies that he\u2019s the person who was involved in the commission of the alleged offenses. The defendant raises either the issue of mistaken identity or of intentional misidentification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of that issue. During cross-examination of Daniels, defense counsel tested her memory of whether the defendant had driven the gold Delta to her home on the evening of September 25, 1997. Cross-examination of Hannans explored the details of his encounter with Footman and Hannans\u2019 interest in retaliating for the beating and robbery he suffered at the hands of Footman. With respect to Lopez, defense counsel's cross-examination focused on the fact that she had an intimate relationship with Hannans at the time of the shooting and an unsuccessful relationship with the defendant prior to that time. Cross-examination of Harrison focused on whether he had an application for sentence modification pending at the time of his August 12, 1999 testimony at Young\u2019s suppression hearing and whether he was actually lying down, asleep in his car, at the time of the shooting. Cross-examination of Dennis explored how often Hannans had used the blue Mazda. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>Finally, defense counsel\u2019s cross-examination of Canty explored whether he had lied in his statement to the prosecutor in order to get out of jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The defendant\u2019s testimony at trial contradicted the story described by the state\u2019s witnesses. He testified that he drove his mother\u2019s green Sable, not the gold Delta, to Daniels\u2019 house on September 25, 1997. He testified that he had called Young the following morning in order to arrange a ride home from the Supersonic Car Wash (car wash), because he had planned to drop off his mother\u2019s car for detailing. The defendant testified that after he had dropped off Daniels\u2019 son, he went directly to the car wash, was picked up by Young in the gold Delta, proceeded to his grandfather\u2019s house and spent the rest of the afternoon waiting for the work to conclude on his mother\u2019s car. According to the defendant, he did not retrieve the blue Mazda from Hannans at Lopez\u2019 house, did not drive it to the driveway of 711-719 Congress Avenue and did not take it to the Auto Specialist to be repainted gold on the morning of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Aside from the prosecutor\u2019s appeal to juiy\u2019s emotions, passions and prejudices, we conclude that the defendant invited the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. The defendant\u2019s entire theory of defense was predicated on the notion that Harrison, Hannans, Lopez and Canty were lying, and that Mansfield and Daniels were mistaken. It is especially significant that defense counsel reinforced that theory during closing argument, before the prosecutor\u2019s improper remarks had occurred. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>supra, 269 Conn. 593.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-8\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b839-9\">The Frequency and Severity of the Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">The defendant argues that the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct was both frequent and severe. We agree that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>misconduct was frequent. On cross-examination alone, the prosecutor improperly asked the defendant to comment on the veracity of the state\u2019s witnesses on eight occasions. We also conclude, however, that the misconduct was not severe. \u201cWe first note that we consider it highly significant that defense counsel failed to object to any of the [improprieties], request curative instructions, or move for a mistrial. Defense counsel, therefore, presumably [did] not view the alleged impropriety as prejudicial enough to jeopardize seriously the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 479.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">We first address the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the defendant had responded, \u201c[y]eah,\u201d to the question: \u201cSo, sir, everybody else was wrong but you, correct?\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In fact, the defendant had responded: \u201cI\u2019m not saying everybody is wrong.\u201d The question before us, however, is not whether the prosecutor should be reprimanded, but whether the remark deprived the defendant of a fair trial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 480. The jury heard the defendant testify that it was, in fact, <em>not </em>his position that all seven of the state\u2019s witnesses were wrong. Moreover, the prosecutor fittingly began his rebuttal argument with the admonition that \u201c[a]nother thing that you should not consider also, quite frankly, is testimony by an attorney as to what somebody is thinking or what they would have said or could have said.\u201d That warning echoed a similar message by the prosecutor that was given during his initial argument.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The court also instructed the jury that \u201cargu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>ments and statements\u201d made by the attorneys, particularly in closing argument, should not be considered as evidence.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">With respect to the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions compelling the defendant to comment on Mansfield\u2019s veracity, we note that Mansfield\u2019s testimony was corroborated by the work order form that was admitted into evidence as a full exhibit and published to the jury. Dennis\u2019 testimony was also corroborated by the work order, because the defendant wrote Dennis\u2019 name, in parenthesis, on that form. Of the eight improper questions challenged by the defendant on appeal, six pertained to Mansfield alone, and the seventh pertained to Mansfield and Dennis together. When faced with the eighth improper question, the defendant declined to comment on the veracity of seven state\u2019s witnesses. See footnote 14. We also emphasize that the defendant\u2019s theory of defense invited the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions and remarks. Moreover, the court\u2019s general instructions further tempered the misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Centrality of the Misconduct to Critical Issues in the Case and Strength of the State\u2019s Case</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">The critical issue in this case is whether the defendant was driving the blue Mazda at the time of the shooting. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>All of the key evidence elicited at trial, along with most of the improprieties previously discussed, related directly to that issue. In this case, however, the state\u2019s case against the defendant was strong, and the testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses was corroborated by the physical evidence, as well as the behavior of the defendant following the shooting. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">Cellular telephone records indicate that the defendant placed a call to Young at 8:46 a.m. on the morning of the shooting. The day care center\u2019s time sheet confirmed that the defendant dropped Daniels\u2019 son off at 8:50 a.m. Green testified that he recognized the defendant\u2019s blue Mazda as the car involved in the shooting. Harrison testified at Young\u2019s suppression hearing that he saw the defendant in the driver\u2019s seat of the blue Mazda at the time of the shooting. The testimony of Green and Harrison placed the defendant in the blue Mazda, at the scene of the murder, as the fatal gunshots were fired from that car. That testimony was corroborated by Auto Specialist\u2019s business record indicating that the defendant had dropped off a Mazda MX-6 to be repainted on the morning of the shooting, September 26, 1997. The form indicated that the defendant wrote \u201cgold\u201d as the car\u2019s color and paid $1160, excluding tax, for the work done. The defendant signed the work order and also wrote the name \u201cEric Dennis\u201d in parenthesis. The defendant\u2019s inclusion of \u201cEric Dennis\u201d on the work order corroborates Dennis\u2019 testimony. Dennis, the defendant\u2019s close friend at the time of the shooting, testified that he had lied to the police at the defendant\u2019s request concerning his relationship to the blue Mazda. The defendant\u2019s behavior on the morning of the shooting, paying a substantial amount of money to get the blue Mazda repainted, and listing Eric Dennis\u2019 name on the work order form, was consistent with consciousness of guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>All of the testimony, substantial circumstantial evidence and consciousness of guilt evidence was corroborated by the <em>Whelan </em>statement of Harrison, who testified, under oath at Young\u2019s suppression hearing, that he had seen the defendant in the driver\u2019s seat of the blue Mazda and Young in the passenger\u2019s seat at the time of the fatal shooting at the driveway of 711-719 Congress Avenue. The evidence, considered as a whole, although not overwhelming, was strong evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 482. Moreover, \u201cit does not diminish the probative force of the evidence that it consists, in whole or in part, of evidence that is circumstantial rather than direct. ... It is not one fact, but the cumulative impact of a multitude of facts which establishes guilt in a case involving substantial circumstantial evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 482-83. In the present case, as in <em>Thompson, </em>the physical evidence corroborated the incriminating testimony of the state\u2019s witnesses, and the defendant\u2019s actions and words subsequent to the shooting offered further corroboration of that evidence. See id., 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">Curative Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">The defendant did not object to any of the prosecutor\u2019s improper questions or remarks, and the court did not give any specific curative instructions. \u201cWe note in this regard, however, that the defendant, by failing to bring [the improprieties] to the attention of the trial court, bears much of the responsibility for the fact that these claimed improprieties went uncured. We emphasize the responsibility of defense counsel, at the very least, to object to perceived prosecutorial improprieties as they occur at trial, and we continue to adhere to the well established maxim that defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s [remarks and questions] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>when [they occurred] suggests that defense counsel did not believe that [they were] unfair in light of the record of the case at the time. . . . Moreover . . . defense counsel may elect not to object to arguments that he or she deems marginally objectionable for tactical reasons . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 483-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">In addition, the court reminded the jury in its general instructions that the arguments and statements of the attorneys are not evidence, and that the jury alone is responsible for determining the credibility of the witnesses. See footnote 26. The court further instructed the jury: <em>\u201cYou are the sole judges of the facts. </em>It is your duty to find the facts. You are to recollect and weigh the evidence, and <em>form your own conclusions </em>as to what the ultimate facts are.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">\u201cYou may not go outside the evidence introduced in court, to find the facts. This means that you may not resort to guesswork, conjecture, or suspicion, and you <em>must not be influenced by any personal likes or dislikes, opinions, prejudices, or sympathy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) \u201cIn the absence of a showing that the jury failed or declined to follow the court\u2019s instructions, we presume that it heeded them.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 485. In this case, there is no suggestion that the jury did not follow the court\u2019s general instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant was not deprived of his right to a fair trial by the prosecutor\u2019s misconduct. We also decline the defendant\u2019s invitation to invoke our supervisory authority in this case. The prosecutor\u2019s misconduct in this case was not \u201cso offensive to the sound administration of justice that only a new trial can effectively prevent such assaults on the integrity of the tribunal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b814-9\"> Although the claim is of the prosecutorial misconduct variety, the defendant chose to separate it from the other alleged instances of misconduct. We note, however, that because a due process analysis \u201cmust involve the entire trial, all incidents of misconduct must be viewed in relation to one another and within the context of the entire trial. The object of inquiry before a reviewing court in claims involving prosecutorial misconduct, therefore, is always and only the fairness of the entire trial, and not the specific incidents of misconduct themselves.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Stevenson, </em>269 Conn. 563, 574, 849 A.2d 626 (2004). Accordingly, we address all of the defendant\u2019s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct together under a single due process analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\"> Foolman had struck Hannans and had stolen the chain from around his neck on September 23,1997. Footman testified that he stole Hannans\u2019 chain because he recognized him as Young\u2019s brother and wanted to retaliate for a light that had occurred a week before between himself, Young and others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>at a nightclub.
