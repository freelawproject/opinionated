Because we find defendant's conduct was legally sufficient to constitute the separate, complete act of second-degree kidnapping and, moreover, that the kidnapping facilitated the accompanying robbery, we affirm the Court of Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The pivotal facts are as follows: Around noon on 3 July 2000, defendant, Jonathan Denard Boyce, later identified through forensic evidence and distinguishing features, gained entry to Amie Cobb Dunford's residence by fraudulently claiming to be soliciting volunteers for a neighborhood watch program and, thereafter, by forcing open the front door. Dunford, home alone and four and a half months pregnant, struggled to prevent his entry by pushing the door shut and biting his hand. Defendant continued to force his way into the residence. Dunford, realizing further resistance was futile, attempted to flee through the rear of the residence. She managed to open the back door and \"got a foot out of the house\" before defendant prevented her escape by grabbing her shirt. The victim \"reached around the door trying to hold herself out of the door and trying to escape.\" She also attempted to escape by trying to remove her shirt, which was still being held by defendant. Again, she was unsuccessful. Given the time of day, Dunford realized neither neighbors nor construction workers typically present in the area were in close enough proximity to hear her yell. She testified she was afraid defendant intended to harm her should she be pulled back into the residence. While defendant held her shirt, the victim repeatedly\n   screamed, \"Don't hurt me,\" and that she was pregnant. Defendant, holding onto Dunford's shirt with his left hand, pulled her back into the interior of the residence. Dunford fell as a result of the force, looked up, and for the first time observed defendant holding a handgun in his right hand. Defendant then demanded money. Dunford informed him she had no cash. Defendant agreed to accept a personal check for two hundred dollars. Defendant, after obtaining the check, threatened to kill her if she called the police. Undeterred, after defendant left the scene, Dunford immediately called 911 Emergency Response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Warrants for defendant's arrest were issued on 23 October 2000. The Forsyth County Grand Jury returned true bills of indictment charging him with felony breaking and entering, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and second-degree kidnapping, all of which arose from the above described incident. Defendant was tried at the 22 August 2001 criminal session of Forsyth County Superior Court. After presentation of the State's case-in-chief and again at the close of all evidence, defendant moved to dismiss the kidnapping charge, asserting that the State's evidence of confinement, restraint, or removal was insufficient to support the kidnapping count as it was inherently a part of and thus merged with the robbery. Defendant's motions were denied. A jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts and the trial court entered judgment accordingly on 23 August 2001. The trial court determined defendant's prior record level to be II and imposed consecutive sentences of ten to twelve months for felony breaking and entering, ninety-five to one hundred twenty-three months for robbery with a dangerous weapon, and thirty-six to fifty-three months for second-degree kidnapping. Defendant appealed his convictions, and a divided panel of the Court of Appeals found no error.\n   <em>\n    State v.
