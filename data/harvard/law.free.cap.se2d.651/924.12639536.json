Gen. Stat. \u00a7 14-27.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2005). Defendant was sentenced to a minimum of 384 months' and a maximum of 470 months' imprisonment. After careful consideration, we find that defendant's trial was free from error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The State presented evidence that tended to show that the victim, referred to as \"BH\" in this opinion, was spending the night at a friend's house. BH was sleeping on the floor next to her friend, TD, when defendant, who is TD's stepfather, entered the room. BH testified that after defendant entered the room, he dragged her to the door, took off her clothes, and \"put his stuff into\" hers. BH told defendant to stop. The only other person in the house was TD, and BH called to her, but TD did not wake up. After defendant left, BH testified that she was bleeding from her vagina.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately one month later, BH told her mother about the incident. Her mother called the police. Deputy S.M. Currin testified that BH told him that defendant \"tried to make me have sex with him.\" He also stated that BH told him that defendant \"was having sex with me when I didn't want to.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Dr. Vivian D. Everett examined BH and found nothing during that physical examination that would indicate that BH had been sexually abused. Dr. Everett also testified that, based on her examination of BH, a single act of intercourse could have occurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant's expert, Dr. Christopher Chao, had reviewed BH's medical records and testified that there was no evidence of trauma or injury to BH's genitals. Dr. Chao testified that if the trauma had occurred two months earlier, there would be no evidence of that trauma, and lack of trauma did not indicate lack of penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Vincent Harris (\"Harris\" or \"witness Harris\") also testified at trial. Three years before the trial, defendant's counsel had represented Harris in an unrelated matter. At the time of the trial, Harris was in jail on a charge of breaking and entering and had been indicted as an habitual felon. According to Harris, defendant told him that he had dragged BH out of the bedroom, pulled her pants down, and had sex with her. Harris also said that defendant admitted to there being blood on the floor where the incident occurred and that defendant cleaned up afterward. Defendant did not testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant presents the following issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the trial court erred in denying defense counsel's motion to withdraw; (2) whether the trial court committed plain error by not instructing the jury on the lesser charge of attempted first degree rape; and (3) whether defendant's trial counsel was inadequate by not making certain requests, thereby depriving defendant of a full and adequate appeal of trial errors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant's trial attorney filed a motion to withdraw as counsel because the State intended to call as a witness against defendant one of the attorney's former clients, Harris. The attorney had represented Harris three years earlier in an unrelated matter. The trial court conducted an inquiry and made a ruling to deny this motion. Thus, defendant's argument that the denial of his counsel's motion to withdraw was made without a hearing is rejected. Defendant also argues that the ruling denied his right to counsel. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"An accused's right to counsel in a criminal prosecution is guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution and is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, Sections 19 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Moreover, defense counsel had no recollection as to specifics of witness Harris's case aside from the bare fact that witness Harris had been convicted on assault\n   charges. Indeed, defense counsel told the trial court that she would review witness Harris's file, which she had in her office, to see if she could use any information in that file to help her current client.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   That statement establishes that defense counsel was committed to her current client's case and would not hesitate to use any information at her disposal to aid defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Although defense counsel's cross-examination as to witness Harris's past convictions may not have been as robust as it could have been,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the transcript reveals that defense counsel did make significant inroads to undermine witness Harris's credibility. She asked him about the fight defendant had with witness Harris in jail, in which witness Harris was knocked unconscious; how after that incident, witness Harris decided to cooperate with the police; and about what witness Harris expected to receive in terms of a deal on his own pending felony charges for informing on defendant. Accordingly, we hold that defendant's Sixth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution and his rights under Sections 19 and 23 of the North Carolina Constitution were not violated.

Although defendant presented evidence that BH's genitals showed no evidence of trauma, the expert witness also testified that lack of trauma does not indicate lack of penetration.

The State put on evidence from BH that defendant had inserted his penis into her vagina, which was corroborated by Deputy Currin who confirmed that BH had told him that defendant inserted his penis into her vagina, as well as evidence from Harris, who testified that defendant told him that he had sex with BH. Merely presenting evidence that no trauma occurred to BH is not sufficient to establish a conflict of evidence as to penetration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We find defendant's additional argument that BH's testimony that defendant \"tried to . . . have sex\" with her equally unpersuasive. At the outset, this evidence falls far short of the standard set in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   where the alleged victim told both the police and her doctor that no penetration had occurred. Moreover, the testimony does not create doubt as to whether the penetration actually occurred. The statement is consistent with penetration occurring as, according to BH's testimony, defendant did try to penetrate her and eventually was able to do so.
