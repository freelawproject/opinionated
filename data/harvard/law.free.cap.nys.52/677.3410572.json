The record fails to disclose any return or affidavit of the person deputed to serve the summons that he could not \u00f1nd the defendant, so as to serve him therewith; and from the uncontradicted averments contained in the affidavit of the defendant\u2019s attorney, which forms part of the amended return, such \u201calias\u201d summons was issued by the clerk without his having required such return or affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-14\">Section 1303 of the consolidation act, which applies to the municipal court of the city of New York (see Birdseye\u2019s Greater New York Charter, 45), in part provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-15\">\u201cIi the marshal or other person having the summons to serve cannot find the defendant so as to serve him therewith, as required by this title, he must so return, and the clerk shall, at the request of the plaintiff, continue from time to time to issue others until the defendant is served.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-16\">This enactment was evidently designed to prohibit the clerk of a municipal court from issuing an \u201calias\u201d summons until proof of inability to serve the defendant be presented. Langbein, Law &amp; Prac. N. Y. Dist. Ct. (4th Ed.) p. 161, citing Doughty v. Hess, 13 Daily Reg. (Jan. 26, 1878) No. 22. If this view is well founded, then, as the said court is one of limited jurisdiction, and could only exercise such power as has been specially conferred by statute (Schwartz v. Wechler, 2 Misc. Rep. 67, 71, 20 N. Y. Supp. 861; Hanlon v. Insurance Co., 9 Misc. Rep. 70, 72, 29 N. Y. Supp. 65), it is apparent that, under the circumstances, the \u201calias\u201d summons was issued without lawful author<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ity, and the court below never acquired jurisdiction to render the judgment appealed from. Therefore the judgment was void, but, although void, it is so far to be considered in existence by this appellate court that it may be reversed, and the parties restored to the position they originally occupied. Allison v. Preserve Co., 20 Misc. Rep. 367, 369, 45 N. Y. Supp. 923; Potter v. Society (decided June 6, 1898) 52 N. Y. Supp. 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">It follows from these views that the judgment should be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
