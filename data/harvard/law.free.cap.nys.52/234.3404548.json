That notice gave the defendant 30 days in which \u2022 to comply with its requirements, and it was served on the defendant -on the 7th of May. The street had not then been opened and worked, \u2022and was \u201cin an impassable condition, and had not been opened between the tracks of the railroad company and Erie street up to the 21st day of June, 1897.\u201d On the 7th of June, 1897, while the street was in the condition just mentioned, the common council of the city of Niagara Falls, by resolution adopted, \u201cextended the time within which said Tenth street should be carried across the tracks of the \u2022 \u2022defendant until the 7th day of July, 1897.\u201d On the 30th of December, 1897, the relator prepared a notice of an application at special term for a writ of mandamus to be directed to the New York Central -&amp; Hudson River Railroad Company, requiring the company forthwith ..thereafter to cause said Tenth street, in the First ward, in the city -of Niagara Falls, to be carried across the tracks of the New York Central &amp; Hudson River- Railroad Company. Pursuant to that notice of motion, the defendant appeared and read an affidavit in opposition, at special term, on the 7th of February, 1898, and the special term denied the writ, with costs, and the relator has appealed from .that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-19\">On the 22d of May, 1897, the legislature, by chapter 754 of the .'Laws of that year, provided, viz.: \u201cWhenever a new street, avenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>or highway, or new portion of a street, avenue or highway shall hereafter be constructed across a steam surface railroad, such street, avenue or highway, or portion of such street, avenue or highway, shall pass over or under such railroad or at grade as the board of railroad commissioners shall direct. * * \u2022' The said board of railroad commissioners shall determine whether such street, avenue or highway, or new portion of a street, avenue or highway, shall be constructed over or under such railroad or at grade.\u201d In the third section of that act it was provided, viz.: \"All acts and parts of acts inconsistent with this act are hereby repealed.\u201d In the fourth section it was provided, viz.: \u201cThis act shall take effect the first day of July, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven.\u201d Apparently the statute inaugurated a system by which the railroad commissioners were to be consulted and to determine the manner of crossing steam roads from and after the act tpok effect. When the application for mandamus was heard at special term, the statute to which reference has been made was in full force. Lazarus v. Railway Co., 145 N. Y. 581, 40 N. E. 240. Before issuing a mandamus, the court was called upon to exercise its discretion. It was properly said in the memorandum delivered by the judge who held the special term that granted the order from which the appeal is taken, viz.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cIt is now the settled policy of the state to commit the subject of the construction of railroads and the operation thereof over public crossings to the supervision and discretion of the state board of railroad commissioners, and the laws aimed at such result should receive a construction in harmony with the purposes to be effectuated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The order should be affirmed, with costs. Order affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
