Andrews and others. From a final judgment in favor of defendants, plaintiff appealed. Affirmed, with costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1146-10\">The following is the opinion delivered at special term (MADDOX, J.):</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1146-11\">Plaintiff, having recovered, on January 22, 1897, a judgment against Mary A. Andrews, as executrix, etc., of William D. Andrews, deceased, the surviving partner of the firm of William D. Andrews &amp; Bro., composed of William D. and George H. Andrews, for $205,960.70, because of the failure of said Andrews\u2019 firm to perform their contract with the plaintiff for the construction of a water plant, now seeks to be declared the equitable owner of and entitled to two certain bonds and mortgages, and also certain surplus moneys covered by one of said mortgages, and plaintiff asks judgment of foreclosure thereof. Said bonds and mortgages were given to the defendants Livingston, the Moores, and Flinn as indemnity, they being the sureties, with said William D. Andrews and George H. Andrews as principals, on a bond to plaintiff for $50,000 for the performance of said contract. The said sureties have been held, in Livingston v. Moore, 15 App. Div. 15, 44 N. Y. Supp. 125, to have been discharged from all liability under their said bond or obligation to the plaintiff, by reason of material changes made in said contract, without their consent, after the delivery of the bond to plaintiff. The city of Albany has appealed therefrom to the court of appeals, and such appeal is still pending; but that fact, in my opinion, offers no embarrassment in determining the questions here involved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1146-12\">Plaintiff invokes the rule that a creditor is entitled to the benefit of all securities or pledges in the hands of the \"surety, given by the principal, as indemnity against any charge or liability because of a breach; while the answering defendants contend that the security was given to indemnify the sureties only as against damnification, and hence that plaintiff has no right to subrogation, and they ask to be reimbursed for the costs and expenses they have been put to in Livingston v. Moore, and in this action, and also ask for the foreclosure of said mortgages. The defendant Man\u2019s attorney has, since the trial of this action, withdrawn his opposition to the recovery by the defendants the Moores and Flinn here of what they may be entitled to, and hence all questions may be determined in this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1146-13\">If the indemnity was against contingent liability, if the mortgages were given to the sureties, not to secure performance of the Albany contract, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1131\">*1131</page-number>to provide a fund for the payment of the damages occasioned by a breach thereof, but to save harmless the sureties from a contingent liability or loss against any damage that they might be subjected to because of that breach, then plaintiff cannot succeed, for that contingency must first come. The intent and purpose of the parties must be gathered from the language used and the bonds and mortgages so construed. The bonds and mortgages are alike in language, excepting only the descriptions of the property and am'ount of insurance; the condition of the bonds being that the obligors, the Andrews, and their legal representatives, \u201cshall well and truly indemnify and save harmless\u201d the said sureties \u201cfrom all and all manner of suits, actions, damages, charges, costs, expenses, or losses which they or either of them may sustain or be put to by reason of their so becoming sureties on .said bond to said city of Albany\u201d; and, further, that if \u201cjudgment shall be rendered in favor of the city of Albany against\u201d the sureties, or either of them, \u201cfor the payment of the sum of $50,000, then and in that case said sum of $50,000 * * * shall immediately become due and payable, and shall be a lien on the premises described in the mortgages executed with even date herewith.\u201d The mortgages also recite that they are \u201cintended to secure\u201d the sureties, according to the conditions of the bond, for all \u201ccosts, charges, expenses, suits, damages, and losses which they * * * may be put to or sustain by reason of their so becoming sureties upon said bond to said city of Albany,\" and if default is made, and \u201cjudgment is rendered in favor of said city of Albany or its special water commissioners against\u201d the sureties, then they may sell, and retain the costs, charges, and damages they \u201cshall sustain,\u201d paying the overplus, if any, to the mortgagors, their legal representatives or assigns. In my judgment, it was clearly the intention of the parties that the sureties were to be indemnified against damnification, and the last paragraph of the mortgages in no wise alters that conclusion; for, in effect, it provides only for the consequent result, that the conveyance should be void if the sureties were \"saved harmless,\u201d and it involves no obligation other than one for the sureties\u2019 benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1147-5\">Plaintiff further contends that the securities, the bonds, mortgages, and surplus moneys in question, are impressed with a trust in plaintiff\u2019s favor, because they axe the substitutes for a fund provided for by an agreement dated August 10, 1887, between the Andrews and their said sureties, such-substitution being due to the acts of the parties to that agreement, and being in derogation of plaintiff\u2019s right fixed thereby, namely, the right to have the sum so to be created applied in payment of any judgment it might recover against the Andrews or their sureties, upon the ground that such was the expressed intention and purpose of the parties. That agreement, after reciting the Albany contract, and that Livingston, the Moores, and Flinn had \u201cbecome sureties to the\u201d Andrews on said bond to plaintiff for $50,000, provided for the deposit in the Albany County Bank, \u201cto the joint order of the parties\u201d to that agreement, of certain of the moneys to be received on said contract until $50,000 was so deposited, the sums so deposited to remain \u201cas security for the faithful performance\u201d by the Andrews \u201cof said contract, the deposit so made being for the purpose of securing the said parties of the second part,\u201d said sureties, \u201cfrom any liability or harm from their so becoming sureties\u201d; also to \u201cmeet any claim the said city of Albany may establish against the parties of the first part herein, or their sureties, should said parties of the first part fail to perform said contract,\u201d and, upon said bond being canceled, the money so deposited to become and be the property of the Andrews. The intent and purpose is thus, to my mind, apparent to secure the sureties against liability or harm; not to secure the plaintiff, for it then had the bond for $50,000. Again, what was it to meet? Any claim the city of Albany may establish against the principals on that bond and their sureties. I think the word \u201cor,\u201d meaning, as it does,- \u201cone or the other,\u201d \u201cnot both,\u201d must give way and be replaced by the word \u201cand,\u201d so that it may read \u201cto meet any claim the said city of Albany may establish against the parties of the first part herein and their sureties\u201d; for, to recover as against the sureties upon such an obligation as the one held by plaintiff, it must be such a claim as may be established against both the principal and the surety, not one or the other. The agreement thus provided for security is personal to the sureties, and is not capable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1132\">*1132</page-number>of such an interpretation as sustains plaintiff\u2019s contention, nor does it create any trust in plaintiff\u2019s favor, and hence a consideration of the modifying agreements, leading to the security now held hy the sureties, is unnecessary. For the reasons above stated, the cases of Bank v. Bigler, S3 N. Y. 51, and Crosby v. Crafts, 5 Hun, 327, are distinguishable from the one under consideration^ *</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1148-5\">The defendants Livingston, the Moores, and Flinn are entitled to recover and have out of such securities their costs, charges, and expenses in the Livingston case, and their counsel fees and expenses in this action. Such expenses are fairly comprehended within the conditions of the bonds, were made necessary and were occasioned by reason of their suretyship. The defendant Livingston having -given to the defendants Moore an indemnity bond against damage or loss because of their said suretyship, and a mortgage, covering certain lands in Dutchess county, as collateral thereto, it follows that if the proceeds realized from the two bonds and mortgages and the surplus moneys in question here are insuficient to pay the defendants Livingston, the Moores, and Flinn what they are entitled to by way of reimbursement in full, then the share of such proceeds belonging to said Livingston shall be applied to the payment of the deficit, if any, due to the said Moores, and, if their claim he fully liquidated, that the bond and mortgage so given to them by said Livingston be delivered up and canceled. Any surplus of the proceeds of the securities here in suit shall be paid to the defendant Man, the owner of the equity of redemption. The question as to the claims of the sureties, respectively,\u2014that is, the amount allowable to each,\u2014having been reserved, counsel may he heard on the settlement of findings and decree as to the manner of ascertaining the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b1148-6\">Judgment should therefore be directed dismissing the complaint, with costs to the defendants Livingston, the Moores, and Flinn, and plaintiff to have its disbursements payable out of fund realized from the securities, judgment of foreclosure and sale to be entered, and the defendants, the sureties, to he allowed the amounts due to each respectively. Let findings and judgment be settled on two days\u2019 notice.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1148-7\">Argued before GOODRICH, P.
