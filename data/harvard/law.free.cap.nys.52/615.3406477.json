After answers, the cause was on the special term calendar, part 3, for trial; and by stipulation between the attorneys it was agreed that it should be referred,\u2014the attorneys to have five days to agree upon a referee, and, if they did not then agree, a referee was to be appointed by the court. The attorneys not having agreed, an order to show cause was obtained, returnable at part 1, to have some suitable person appointed as referee; and on the return day it was sent in to part 6 of special term, where it was heard, and disposed of by the appointment of a referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The main question here is one of practice; the insistence being that, as the case had been before the judge in part 3, he was the only one who could make the order. The stipulation of the attorneys required that the order should be made by the court; and while, seemingly, the better practice is to have the order of reference made by the same judge who presided in the part where the case regularly came on for trial, and was marked \u201creferred,\u201d this was not fatal to the order. The stipulation, in terms, did not provide for an appointment by any particular judge, hut provided that in ease of disagreement the appointment should be made by the court, which was finally done.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Some of the objections to the form of the order should be sustained. Where an- accounting in the supreme court is substituted for one under the assignment act, it is proper that the same rules providing for advertising for claims and notice to creditors should be followed. The provision that the hearing could he brought on upon 8 days\u2019 notice is improper, for the reason that, there being an issue to be tried, the Code provides for 14 days\u2019 notice of trial of such an issue. The further recital in the order that notice of such first hearing shall he given to the defendants or their attorneys, \u201cwhich notice shall be deemed sufficient, for the reason that the defendant May S. Earle claims to own by assignment all claims against the assigned estate,\u201d etc., should he stricken out. This is a mere assertion of a claim, and is one of the matters to he disposed of upon a reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">The order should he modified accordingly, by striking out the provisions referred to, without costs. All concur,' except VAN BRUNT, P. J., dissenting.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b632-8\">VAN BRUNT, P.
