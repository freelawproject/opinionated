Y. Supp. 203), it follows that the judgment entered upon the order confirming the referee\u2019s report must be vacated. It is not necessary to determine whether or not it was regular to enter a judgment upon such an order. We think, however, that rule 27 of the General Rules of Practice does not authorize the entry of a formal judgment in a special proceeding. That rule does not provide for the entry of a judgment on an order, but merely allows an order directing the payment of a sum of money to be enrolled and docketed as if it were a judgment. It seems to me clear that under the provisions of the Code, if an action is commenced by the service of a summons, the relief granted to either par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>ty is evidenced by the final judgment. Where the appropriate remedy is by petition, and the final order is entered directing a party thereto to pay a sum of money to the party in whose favor the order is entered, either party is entitled to have the order enrolled and docketed as a judgment; but a final order in a special proceeding cannot be the basis of a separate and independent judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">The order appealed from should therefore be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion to vacate the judgment entered by the petitioner granted, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
