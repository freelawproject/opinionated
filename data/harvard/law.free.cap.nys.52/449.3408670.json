Johnson, and filed in the office of the register of Kings-county; thence easterly, and again on a line at right angles with Richmond 'street, and along said northerly line of lot No. 464, 87 feet, to the westerly side of Richmond street; and thence northerly, along the westerly side of Richmond street, 107 feet, to the point or place of beginning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">On this property are six houses, inclosed, but the construction of which is not entirely completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">The first objection is that 17 feet of the southerly lot of the premises is included in Force Tube avenue, as designated by the commissioners appointed under chapter 670 of the Laws of 1869, to lay out a plan for roads and streets in the towns of Kings county. The avenue was originally laid out by the owners of a large tract of land, which included the premises in question. When the commissioners laid out the county towns, they retained this avenue as a street on the permanent plan for the improvement of those towns, but increased its width. No steps have been taken to open the avenue as widened, or to condemn the land required for the widening. The act of 1869 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-12\">\u201cIf any buildings shall be erected on the line of any avenue or street, as laid out on said plan after the filing of said map, no compensation shall be paid to the owner thereof on the opening of said street.\u201d Laws 1S69, c. 670, \u00a7 5.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-13\">This provision is unconstitutional and void, and the action of the commissioners in laying out the street created no incumbrance on the land. In re Rogers Ave., 29 Abb. N. C. 361; Forster v. Scott, 136 N. Y. 677, 32 N. E. 976. In several of the deeds found in the mortgagor\u2019s chain of title, the premises are bounded by Force Tube avenue, or by its side. If there were but one Force Tube avenue, this reference to it in the conveyances might constitute a dedication of any land of the grantors lying within its limits. But the dimensions given in the deed show plainly that reference was made to-Force Tube avenue as originally laid out-by the property owners, not as defined by the commissioners. This- objection is therefore not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>The second objection is that the dimensions of the premises on the southerly line are only 82 feet, instead of 87. In the conveyance to the mortgagor this line is described as follows: \u201cThence, along the northeasterly side of Force Tube avenue, 150 feet, to the lot No. 464; and thence again easterly, along said last-mentioned lot, 82 feet, more or less, to Richmond street.\u201d From this description the presumption is that the line is but 82 feet in length. As it runs between two fixed monuments,\u2014Force Tube avenue and Richmond street,\u2014it is undoubtedly true that it carries all the land between those two streets, even though the distance be in excess of 82 feet. The counsel for the respondent, in his brief, asserts that the distance is actually 87 feet; but I cannot find a positive allegation to that effect in the record. The nearest approximation to proof on that subject is a diagram or survey introduced in evidence, in which it appears that there is a distance of 87 feet from Richmond street to an oblique line in the rear; but there is nothing on the map to show that that oblique line is the line of Force Tube avenue, nor does the name of that avenue appear on the map. Further, there is no evidence in the case to show that in this respect the survey is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">The third objection is that the northerly wall of the northerly building on the premises stands, not on the premises, but on land to the north. The surveyors of the parties differed in their testimony on this question. The wall is but four inches in width. The purchaser\u2019s surveyors claimed that the wall was four and a half inches off the line. The plaintiff\u2019s surveyors claimed that the center-line of the wall was one inch off at the front of the house, and one-half inch south at the rear; and so the referee, to whom the court referred the matter, found. I doubt if this discrepancy between the surveys is very material. However, the question is settled in favor of the plaintiff. By the terms of sale, the purchaser did not buy any particular buildings or structures, but a certain plot of land with, the structures that were on it. Therefore, if he can get a good title to the land purchased, and the right to maintain the structures on it as they existed at the time of his purchase, he gets all he bargained for. The case falls, within that of Hendricks v. Stark, 37 N. Y. 106, and is to be distinguished from that of Spero v. Shultz, 14 App. Div. 423, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1016, where the contract was' for the sale of a specific house and lot. By the plaintiff\u2019s survey, however; it appears that only one inch of the northerly wall stands on the-premises,\u2014an extent, of course, insufficient to maintain the structure. If this was a party wall, the purchaser would have a right to the support of the whole wall; and, under the view I have expressed' as to the construction of his agreement to purchase, he would have no ground for complaint. But nothing of the kind appears in the-record before us. It is stated in the brief of the respondent that the mortgagor was at the time of the execution of the mortgage the-owner of both the mortgaged premises and the premises adjoining-on the north, and that she erected the buildings. If these are the facts, the wall was a party wall; or, even if it stood entirely off the line, the purchaser at the sale in this action would have the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>to its support for his buildings, and the whole difficulty would be cured. Rogers v. Sinsheimer, 50 N. Y. 646. But here, again, I cannot find in the record any proof of those facts. It may be they were conceded on the argument at special term, but this we cannot assume. The order appealed from must therefore be reversed, but the matter should be remitted to the special term for further- proofs; so that the plaintiff, if he can, may substantiate his statements as to the ownership of the property, the construction of the buildings, and the actual distance between Force Tube avenue, as laid out by the property owners, and Bichmond street. The amount paid the surveyors for expert testimony and maps was improperly allowed as disbursements in the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Order appealed from reversed, and a further hearing ordered before the special term, with $10 costs and disbursements to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
