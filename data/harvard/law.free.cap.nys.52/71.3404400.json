But we think that the judgment should be reversed for the reason that no demand is shown to have been made upon the defendant before the commencement of the action. Where an action is brought, as is the case here, for the wrongful detention of the property, and it does not appear that the original possession of the same by the defendant was wrongful, a demand must be alleged and' proved. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the case of the value of the property sought to be reclaimed which will suuport the finding of the justice fixing the same at the sum of $50. For these reasons the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
