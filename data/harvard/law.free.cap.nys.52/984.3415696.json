The plaintiff was thrown from her seat in a trolley car, in which she was riding, by a collision with another car following on the same track. The occurrence of the accident, in the absence of explanation, created a presumption of negligence, and, if plaintiff\u2019s story that she was bruised by being thrown against a passenger opposite her was credited by the jury, she was unquestionably entitled to some recovery. The immediate injuries received by the plaintiff were ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>parently slight, and no award for a large amount could have been made therefor. The serious question litigated before the jury was-whether those injuries had caused the diseased condition of the plaintiff which existed at the time of the trial. It was proved by the testimony of two physicians of standing that at this time the plaintiff was suffering from a prolapsed ovary and congestion of the womb, but neither of these physicians made any examination of the plaintiff until a year and a half after the accident. It appears from the evidence of these witnesses that such diseased conditions are not uncommon in women, and proceed from many natural causes. The evidence of a third physician, who saw and treated the plaintiff for her malady, was of a very unsatisfactory character. As we read the evidence, even he did not examine the plaintiff until some months after the accident. He testifies that there was an abnormal retroversion of the womb, which the other physicians disprove; and the condition of the ovary, which they consider the grave element of the plaintiff\u2019s present state, this physician neither recognized during his attendance upon her nor did he testify at the trial to its existence. While appreciating the gravity of the plaintiff\u2019s disease, we are of opinion that the proof on the trial was not sufficient to warrant the jury in attributing that disease to injuries she received at the time of the acci-' dent. At the same time it may be that on another trial further evidence on the subject may be given. . We therefore do not deem it wise to prescribe a reduction of the verdict (which, however, in any view of the case is very large, if not excessive) as a condition for the avoidance of a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-3\">The order denying motion for a new \"trial should be reversed, and a new trial granted, upon appellant paying the trial fee and disbursements of the trial; and, in case of failure to comply with these terms,, the order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-4\">Order denying motion for new trial reversed, and new trial granted, upon appellant within 20 days paying the trial fee and disbursements of the trial; and, in case of such payment being made, the judgment appealed from is vacated. In case of the failure of the appellant to comply with the terms aforesaid, judgment and order appealed from unanimously affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
