Lemieux v. English, 19 Misc. Rep. 545, 43 N. Y. Supp. 1066; Keavey v. De Rago, 20 Misc. Rep. 105, 45 N. Y. Supp. 77; Van Clief v. Van Vechten, 130 N. Y. 571, 29 N. E. 1017. He has failed to sustain this burden, and the judgment rendered in favor of the respondent Anna J. Lennon, the owner of the premises affected by the lien, must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
