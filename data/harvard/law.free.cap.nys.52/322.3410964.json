It is alleged in the complaint that in May, 1897, the defendant obtained the consent, in writing, of some of the owners of property on South Division street that it might construct a street surface railroad in said street, and that May 28, 1897, the board of assessors of the city of Buffalo certified that the signers of said consent represented the owners of one-half in value of the property bounded on said street, which consent and certificate were filed in the office of the clerk of the - county of Erie, May 28, 1897; which allegation is admitted in the answer. The plaintiff does not assert that these consents were not duly obtained, authenticated, and filed, but she asserts that the consent of the Ellicott Square Company was erroneously counted as representing on the assessment roll of 1895 property assessed at $683,700, while such consent should have been counted as representing- only $124,380. It is alleged in the complaint \u201cthat the total assessed land values on South Division street, from Main street to Smith street, is $3,813,478,\u201d which allegation is admitted in the answer. One-half of this sum is $1,906,739; so that, before the defendant had the right to build this road in this street, it was required to obtain the consents of the owners of property bounded on this street valued on the assessment roll of 1895 at $1,906,739, or, in lieu thereof, to obtain the consent of the appellate division of the Fourth department. It is alleged in the complaint that the defendant obtained written consents of the property owners on said street, including said Elliocott Square Company, whose property was assessed at $2,527,858. The aggregate assessment of all the property included within Ellicott Square on the assessment roll of 1895 was $683,-780, but the plaintiff insists that only $124,380 of this assessment should be counted as consenting property. Deducting $124,380 from $683,780 leaves $559,400, which the plaintiff insists should be deducted from the sum of the consents,\u2014$2,527,858. Deducting $559,400 from $2,527,858, the sum of the consents, leaves $1,968,458, or $61,719 more than one-half of the assessed value of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">If it be urged that this conclusion is contrary to the second finding of fact, not embraced within,the signed decision of the court, but found upon the request of the plaintiff and stated outside of the deci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>sion, it must be answered that, since the amendment of the Code of Civil Procedure in 1894 (Laws 1894, c. 688), a trial court or referee is without power to find facts not embraced within the decision signed; and in case a court or referee assumes to find and state facts outside of the signed decision, which are inconsistent with the facts admitted in the pleadings and those found in the signed decision, the facts found and stated outside of the signed decision will be disregarded on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The burden was on the plaintiff to prove on the trial that the requisite amount of consents had not been obtained, and the burden is on her to demonstrate by the record on this appeal that the conclusions of law of the trial court are unsupported by the facts admitted in the pleadings and by the facts found, and are unsound. This burden is not successfully borne.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur, except WARD, J., not voting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
