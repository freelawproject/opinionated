The policy stated that each of the underwriters had deposited with the attorneys in fact a specified sum, aggregating $22,500, which was to be held by the attorneys as a trust fund for the payment of claims and losses under the policy, and it declared them to be trustees of the fund as trustees of an express trust for that purpose, and that \u201cjudgment entered in an action against said attorneys as such trustees as \u25a0aforesaid shall be satisfied out of such trust fund in the hands of said attorneys.\u201d Judgment was rendered against the defendants as attorneys in fact. Upon this judgment an execution was issued, directing the sheriff to satisfy the judgment \u201cout of a trust fund held by the defendants as trustees,\u201d describing the trust fund mentioned in the policy. Upon the return of the execution unsatisfied, the plaintiff obtained the order in supplementary proceedings .for the examination of the defendants, \u201cto make discovery on oath concerning the said trust fund.\u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b643-13\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

A supplementary proceeding is a substitute for a creditors\u2019 bill (Pope v. Cole, 64 Barb. 408), and the case authorizes such a bill (Code, \u00a7 1371). It is objected that a supplementary proceeding is not available against a trustee, but the adjudications cited for the contention do not support it. In re Jung, 16 Wkly Dig. 563, the irregularity of the judgment was the ground of decision. In Collins v. Beebe, 54 Hun, 318, 7 N. Y. Supp. 442, the proceeding was held untenable, because the statute authorizes an execution, and nothing further, against the estate of a decedent. The argument in neither .case applies to the present. Lynch v. Johnson, 48 N. Y. 27, 33. The legal title to the fund is in the defendants, and they are the judgment debtors. The execution is in proper form. Code, \u00a7 1371. Here, then, is a fruitless exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>cution against the only property of the judgment debtors available to the plaintiff,\u2014a fund specifically devoted to the satisfaction of his judgment,\u2014 and it were manifest injustice to refuse him its benefit. A supplementary proceeding is a remedial process, and a liberal construction should be indulged to uphold it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">In accordance with the views therein expressed, the order appealed from should be affirmed, with 810 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
