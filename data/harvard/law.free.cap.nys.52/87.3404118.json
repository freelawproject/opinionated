The answer denies performance of the contract, avers that the work was done in an improper and unworkmanlike manner, alleges that the so-called extra work formed part of the work required to be performed by the contract made between plaintiff\u2019s assignor and the defendant, and sets up a counterclaim for $150 damages claimed to have been sustained in consequence of the alleged breach of plaintiff\u2019s assignor. Another counterclaim is set up, which it is not necessary to consider, in view of the conclusion reached respecting other issues presented by the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">In or about the month of May, 1897, the plaintiff\u2019s assignor submitted to the defendant the following estimate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-16\">\u201cMay 10, 1897.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-17\">\u201cMr. Patrick Divver\u2014Dear Sir: Propose to paint your cottage and barn, windmill, chicken house, and all other painting on outside at your Cedarhurst residence, and paint your kitchen wails, and kalsomine kitchen ceiling and entrance ceiling and one attic room and two 2nd-story rooms and back stairway wails, and varnish ceiling and sides of wagon room in the barn, for the sum of one hundred and ninety-five dollars and seven =\u00b0/ioo dollars added for the varnish; total, $202 = o/100.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-19\">\u201cYours, truly, W. S. Pearse,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-20\">\u201cEar Rockaway \"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b103-21\">The defendant testified that he unconditionally accepted the above proposal, while the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, on the other hand, testified that before entering upon the performance of the contract the defendant waived the varnishing of the interior of the carriage house, and the painting of a grape arbor, and that, with these exceptions, the paper waiting above set forth wTas the final contract between the parties. At the trial the plaintiff\u2019s assignor, wiiile claiming to have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>performed the contract, admitted his failure to paint the first story of the house, the end of the barn, chicken house, and grape arbor, and to varnish \u201cthe. wagon room and blinds, and boards on the back of the chicken house, where the duck pond is.\u201d The testimony adduced on behalf of the defendant tended to show a failure to. perform the contract in substantial and important respects, and such work as was done was finished in an improper and unworkmanlike manner. When both sides rested, the justice said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\">\u201cIt seems to me it is shown by the evidence that this work was not done in proper manner. The only thing is that there has been some work done that ought to be paid for. The extra work I will allow; that is, $18.50. And as to the other work, I did not hear any criticism of the work on the windmill or the chicken house. I think I ought to allow something more than was paid, but not a great deal. I will allow something like $49.50 to the plaintiff. Counsel for Plaintiff; Will your honor make it $50, as this has been an expensive proceeding, and one in which we ought to have costs. The Court: Judgment for the plaintiff for $80 and costs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">It requires no citation of authorities to show that the plaintiff, under these circumstances, cannot recover. The justice, having found that the contract, which was in its nature entire, in my opinion, had not been substantially performed in its important and essential elements, could not lawfully allow any recovery thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">For these reasons, the judgment should be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
