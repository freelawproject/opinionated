Issue had not been joined at the time of the motion; and the relief sought could, therefore, only Use-granted on the ground that the particulars were necessary in order to enable the plaintiff corporation to frame its reply. Indemnity Co. v. Bondy, 17 App. Div. 328, 45 N. Y. Supp. 267. Recognizing the rule that a bill of particulars granted by the city court is not reviewable by the appellate term unless it clearly transcends the power \u00a9f the court, as defined by the general course of practice in respect <em>i&amp; </em>bills of particulars (see Witkowski v. Paramore, 93 N. Y. 467; Lawrence v. Samuels, 20 Misc. Rep. 279, 45 N. Y. Supp. 743; Kreizer v. Allaire, 16 Misc. Rep. 6, 37 N. Y. Supp. 687; Howell v. Mills, 53 N. Y. 322; Livermore v. Bainbridge, 56 N. Y. 72; Cohn v. Baldwin, 141 N. Y. 563, 35 N. E. 1087), we must examine the affidavit to ascertain whether it was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>;to order a bill of particulars (Manufacturing Co. v. Lazzaro [Sup.] 43 N. Y. Supp. 1110). The affidavit is made by Sidney B. Bowman, the president and general manager of the plaintiff corporation, and states that \u201che has no knowledge or information sufficient to form a belief as to the items of damage and loss of revenue and expenses alleged to have been incurred by the said club.\u201d The counterclaim is not interposed against the president and general manager personally, but against the plaintiff .corporation. The absence of knowledge or information on the part of Mr. Bowman, who is one of plaintiff\u2019s officers, does not imply that some other officer or agent of the corporation may not be fully cognizant of all the matters that \u2022are alleged as the basis of defendants\u2019 counterclaim. The affidavit should go further, and state that the plaintiff cannot, through any -of its officers, agents, and servants, acquire the information. It should appear from the affidavit that the means of obtaining the information required are. beyond the reach of the plaintiff. Manufacturing Co. v. Lazzaro, supra; Constable v. Hardenbergh, 76 Hun, 438, 27 N. Y. Supp. 1022. While Mr. Bowman avers that he is advised by his counsel of the -necessity of being apprised of certain items by \u2022- a bill of particulars, in order to properly prepare a reply to the counterclaim, he. does not swear that he has fully and fairly stated the case to his counsel, nor does he give the name and residence of such - counsel. It must, therefore, be observed that the affidavit fails to comply with the provisions of rule 23 of the general rules of practice, which is to the effect that \u201cwhenever it shall be necessary in any affidavit to swear to the advice of counsel, the party shall ' * * * swear that he has fully and fairly stated the case to his - counsel, and shall give the name and residence of such counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">We think the moving affidavit is fatally defective, and insufficient \u25a0 to authorize the order for a bill of particulars. The order should be .reversed, and the motion denied, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
