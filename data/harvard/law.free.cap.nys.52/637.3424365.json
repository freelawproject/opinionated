We think that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>constituted a warranty that the goods sold were of that quality. Zabriskie v. Railroad Co., 131 N. Y. 72, 29 N. E. 1006. As all of the subsequent orders given referred expressly to the previous one, the warranty extended also to the goods thus sold. It appears that the wax in question was grossly adulterated, and was not prime Japan wax. The defendant was therefore entitled to recover such damages as it might be able to prove under its counterclaim founded upon the warranty. As it was not permitted to do so, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
