On this question the cases of Schenck v. Irwin, 60 Hun, 361, 15 N. Y. Supp. 55, and Franey v. Smith, 88 Hun, 215, 34 N. Y. Supp. 780, are decisive authorities. The rule under the old Code was to the contrary, but Mr. Throop\u2019s note to section 2458 shows that it was intended to change that rule. The cases cited by the respondents, which arose under the old Code, are therefore not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted, with $10 costs, all to be applied on plaintiff's judgment. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
