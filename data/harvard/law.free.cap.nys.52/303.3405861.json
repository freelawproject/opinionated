Society (herewith decided) 52 N. Y. Supp. 294, it is manifest that the allegations of the petition herein touching the interest of the applicant in the premises were wholly insufficient to confer jurisdiction of the subject-matter. The averment contained in the petition that the applicant is \u201ca lessee of the premises * \"\"\" * under an agreement made between her and \"the trustees of the said Tabernacle Baptist Church, by the terms of which agreement your peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tioner duly leased from the said Tabernacle Baptist Church the aforesaid premises, and by virtue of such agreement became entitled to and went into the possession of said premises\u201d is not a compliance with the provisions of section 2235 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which require the applicant to present to the justice \u201ca written petition * * * describing the premises, * * * and the interest therein of the petitioner.\u201d As was said by Pryor, J., in Fuchs v. Cohen (Com. Pl.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 236:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b320-5\">\u201cWhether the applicant was tenant for years, or from year to year, or from month to month, or at will, or at sufferance, is not indicated by the petition; wherein, therefore, \u2018is not a description of the interest of the petitioner, but at most an allegation that she had some interest which entitled her to the possession.\u2019 Schneider v. Leitzman (Sup.) 11 N. Y. Supp. 434. An allegation is not equivalent to a description of the interest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The respondent insists that, notwithstanding such defect, the court below acquired jurisdiction by reason of the general appearance of the defendants, and their pleading to the merits, before raising the' objection to the jurisdiction of the court. Had the court below acquired jurisdiction of the subject-matter, there might be some force <em>to </em>this contention, but, as it had not, the objection was not waived, and the defendants were not precluded from raising it. Potter v. Society, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">For these reasons the final order should be reversed, with costs to the appellants. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
