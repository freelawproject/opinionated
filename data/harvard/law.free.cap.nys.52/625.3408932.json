One of ftie conditions of the stipulation was that all of the goods should be returned by the plaintiff to the defendants,\u2014a requirement which does not seem to have been observed, as, according to the statement made by the justice at the close of the case, 169 articles were missing. Furthermore, the admission of the counsel for defendants was, not that $200 was due to the plaintiff, but that if the plaintiff had performed all the work, and delivered it properly, he would be entitled to $200, whereas he had damaged some of the goods to the extent of $23.70, and had also failed to return others, aggregating in value over $300. There was therefore nothing in the case, so far as appears from the return, to support a judgment in favor of the plaintiff for $200, or for any other sum.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Judgment reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellants to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
