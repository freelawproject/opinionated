The complaint contains two counts, charging the defendant with having on three different occasions uttered words imputing the crime of arson to the plaintiff. The answer contains a general denial, and also sets up facts mitigating the speaking of the words alleged to have been uttered. In the answer it is alleged that the defendant\u2019s barns were destroyed August 13, 1895, by an incendiar)- fire, and that the plaintiff had a motive for burning the bams. On the trial Charles Saxton testified that the defendant said \u201cthat, if the reports in circulation were true, he thought that Warner knew as much about how the fire occurred as anybody. * * * He said something or other about a man down where Warner kept his horse. He said somebody\u2014I don\u2019t know who it was now\u2014said Warner\u2019s horse was not in the bam at midnight, when he came home that night.\u201d James Cottrell testified that \u201che asked defendant, \u2018How did they [your barns] get afire?\u2019 and he s\u00e1ys, \u2018I suppose they were set afire.\u2019 * * I asked him if he had got suspicions about the fire; and he said Jim Warner was seen over on the south road that night. * * * He said he thought Jim Warner must know something, about it.\u201d On the cross-examination this witness testified: \u201cI asked him, \u2018How did they get afire?\u2019 and he said he thought they were set afire; and he said Warner was upon that road that night; that the horse wasn\u2019t home that night.\u201d Bradley Burnett testified: \u201cI said to defendant, \u2018It is too bad the horses burned up;\u2019 and he says that,-\u2014speaking something about the fire,\u2014 he said, if all the reports were true of what he heard, that Jim Warner knew as much about the fire as any one.\u201d Two other witnesses testified that the defendant said to them that, if the reports were true, \u201cWarner knew as much about the fire as anybody.\u201d At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence the court granted a nonsuit, on the ground that the words uttered did not charge the plaintiff with the crime of arson, to which ruling an exception was taken. The language which the defendant used should, as against him, be construed by the allegations in his answer. It is set-up in the answer, as before stated, that the barns were destroyed by an incendiary fire, and that the plaintiff had a motive for burning the barns. Construing the words uttered by the allegations in the answer, it was a question of fact for the jury to say whether the defendant intended by the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>spoken to churge the plaintiff with having burned the barns, and the court erred in granting a nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">The order should be reversed, and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
