L, and to operate the same \u201cby horses, mules, or dummy engines.\u201d It constructed its railroad, and operated it by horse power-In September, 1897, having obtained the consent of the owners of one-half of the property bounded upon its line of railroad, it applied to this state board of railroad commissioners for the approval by the hoard of a change of its motive power from horse power to the \u201ckinetic motor.\u201d After a hearing duly had, and evidence taken, the hoard refused its consent, assigning two grounds therefor: (1) That the-kinetic motor is \u201ca locomotive steam power,\u201d and its use prohibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>by section 100 of the railroad law. (2) It did not \u00e1ppear from the testimony \u201cthat the system has been demonstrated to be a practical or practicable one; on the contrary, it is wholly in its experimental stages;\u201d and that the relator \u201cis controlled by persons interested in this motor system.\u201d Section 100 of the railroad law (chapter 565, Laws 1890) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b925-3\">\u201cAny street surface railroad may operate any portion of its road by animal or horse power, or by cable, electricity, or any power other than locomotive steam power, which may be approved by the state board of railroad commissioners, and consented to by the owners of one-half of the property bounded on that portion of the railroad with respect to which a change of motive power is proposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Section 90 of the act subjects every existing street-surface railroad to the above provision, and hence the charter of the relator allowing it to use dummy engines is modified accordingly, certainly so far as substituting such power, after the railroad law took effect, for the horse power in use when said law took effect. In view of the power which the constitution reserves to the legislature to alter or repeal statutes creating corporations (article 8, \u00a7 1), the suggestion that the special act creating this corporation, and its acceptance of the conditions, created a contract, is not well founded. Whether, if the dummy engine had been in use when the railroad law took effect, it would have been necessary to procure the approval of the board to the continuance of its use, we need not inquire. We think, however, that the kinetic motor of the relator is not the \u201clocomotive steam power\u201d contemplated by the statute. The statute evidently contemplates the locomotive steam engine commonly employed upon other than street-surface railroads,-\u2014an engine obviously unsuitable and unsafe for use upon the surface of city and village streets. The relator\u2019s motor is so constructed and operated as to be free from the noise, smoke, cinders, and escaping steam of the ordinary locomotive steam engine. It is a steam engine, but the steam is generated from water heated in a stationary boiler, and transferred to a reservoir under the car and under the motor, and kept from cooling by a slow hard coal fire beneath the reservoir. It is a sort of dummy steam locomotive engine, forming part of the car, and is essentially different from the well-known \u201clocomotive steam power\u201d mentioned in the statute. It may be yet in its experimental stage, but the requisite consents to its use of property owners along the line of the road seem to afford some evidence that the property owners have no fear upon that account.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We think, when the board of railroad commissioners decided that the statutes forbade them to aive their approval, they misconceived the law. The relator had the right to have its application considered free from such misconception, and hence the determination should be reversed. We do not think that the statute requires the board to withhold its approval because the motor is still in its experimental stages, or because the relator is controlled by persons interested in this motor system. Unless the rights or safety of the public or of its members are exposed to danger, it is not unreasonable to tolerate experiments having for their object private gain through a new means of public benefit. These, however, are matters which the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>leaves to the discretion of the hoard of railroad commissioners, and the court will not revise or review its exercise of discretion in these-respects so long as no statutory rule or legal principle affecting the-rights of the relator is violated. The objection is taken in the return, and was pressed upon the argument, that the action of the board was-'not in its nature judicial, but was either legislative or administrative, and therefore not reviewable by the court. It was not legislative, since it was not lawmaking in its nature; it was not executive or ministerial, because the statute does not prescribe that the board shall approve the application or disapprove it, according as certain consents-shall he given or withheld, or certain formal proofs made or left unmade (People v. Bell, 119 N. Y. 175, 23 N. E. 533); but it was judicial, because the statute makes the board a tribunal to hear and determine-the matter (People v. Railroad Co., 134 N. Y. 506, 31 N. E. 873). There was a public trial, after due notice to parties interested; witnesses-were examined, counsel upon both sides heard, and judgment or determination pronounced. The statute permits, if it does not absolutely enjoin, such procedure. Laws 1890, c. 565, art. 6. Thus the-requirements of due- process of law are observed, very much as in People v. Jones, 112 N. Y. 597, 20 N. E. 577. The decision upon the-application has the force of a sell-executing judgment, since it grants- or withholds a privilege or franchise. In this respect it is unlike-such of the decisions and recommendations of the board as can be-enforced only by the aid of the court. Laws 1890, c. 565, \u00a7 162. It is a part of our state system to commit many governmental powers-involving judicial, executive, and ministerial functions to a single officer or a board or commission; the exercise of the executive or' ministerial duty being in some cases dependent upon the exercise of the judicial function. Our constitution, unlike that of the United States, does not commit the whole judicial power to the courts in the first instance; hence our system of review by certiorari of \u201cthe-determination of a body or. officer.\u201d Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 2120 et seq. If such a body, in the exercise of its functions, renders its determination in pursuance of a misapprehension of the law, such error should be corrected.
