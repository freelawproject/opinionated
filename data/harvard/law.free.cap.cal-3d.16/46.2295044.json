From March 8 through March 12, 1974, these plants were closed during a labor dispute between the City and petitioners.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a result in excess of 100 million gallons of raw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sewage were discharged into the waters of the state without any pretreatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">On March 8, 1974, real party in interest State of California on the relation of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay region (hereafter Regional Board and plaintiff) brought the underlying action for civil penalties against numerous defendants, including petitioners and the remaining real parties in interest, including the City, in the Superior Court of the City and County of San Francisco. On March 12, 1974, plaintiff filed its first amended complaint in said action and on the same day said superior court issued an order to show cause and a temporary restraining order commanding the City to provide proper treatment for sewage routed to and discharged from the four sewage treatment plants. On March 13, 1974, the City filed its answer and in addition thereto a cross-complaint<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> against petitioners for declaratory relief by way of indemnification for any civil penalties imposed on the City for waste discharge and for any compensatory and punitive damages awarded against the City by reason of the strike and picketing activities at the four sewage treatment plants. On August 4, 1974, by stipulation petitioners were dismissed as defendants on plaintiff\u2019s first amended complaint against the City but remained as cross-defendants on the City\u2019s cross-complaint. Thereafter on plaintiff\u2019s motion, the action was ordered transferred to respondent Superior Court of the County of Marin in which court it has at all times thereafter been, and now is, pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On March 17, 1975, petitioners (cross-defendants below) moved respondent court for summary judgment and judgment on the pleadings based on seven grounds,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the ground that the City as a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>entity was immune from liability for punitive damages under section 818 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On May 5, 1975, cross-defendants\u2019 motion was denied on the ground, as stated in the memorandum and minute order of the trial court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the Legislature has expressed its intention that municipalities be subject to liability for the sums provided for in section 13350.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Petitioners thereafter sought a writ of mandate in the Court of Appeal on the sole ground that the damages sought by plaintiff under sections 13350 and 13385 were punitive damages which could not be recovered from the City under section 818 of the Government Code.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeal issued an alternative writ of mandate and we ordered the cause transferred to this court (see Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 12; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 20) for decision in conjunction with <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, ante, </em>page 30 [127 Cal.Rptr. 122, 544 P.2d 1322].</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">In <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, ante, </em>page 30, we held that the liability provided for by section 13350, subdivision (a), may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>be imposed upon a public entity because the moneys-thereby collected civilly are not punitive damages within the meaning <em>of </em>section 818 of the Government Code. We reasoned that although such civil penalties are punitive in nature in that they are intended to deter persons from causing deposits of oil and waste in and upon state waters, they are not simply and solely punitive since they compensate the people of the state for the real but unquantifiable resultant harm and the moneys thus recovered are used to clean up waste and abate its effect on state waters. In the instant proceeding we are similarly called upon to determine whether the civil penalties prescribed by section 13385 for discharging pollutants are simply and solely punitive in nature or fulfill compensatory functions so as to remove them from the class of punitive damages covered by section 818 of the Government Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">In 1972 the Legislature added chapter 5.5 to division 7 of the Water Code (Stats. 1972, ch. 1256, \u00a7 1, p. 2485) consisting of sections 13370-13389 in order to comply with the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 et seq.).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The federal act applies to point source discharges of pollutants into navigable waters.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section 13372 directs that the provisions of chapter 5.5 shall apply to actions required under the federal act, and shall prevail over other provisions of the division to the extent of any inconsistency. Since in the instant case the discharge of the raw sewage was into navigable waters, chapter 5.5 is applicable. Section 13386, subdivision (c), provides that with respect to violation of waste discharge requirements the remedies under section 13385 are in lieu of civil monetary remedies under section 13350. Therefore the State of California is seeking to recover civil penalties from the City as a person who discharged pollutants in violation of section 13385.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>Since the moneys civilly collected pursuant to section 13385, like those collected pursuant to section 13350, subdivision (a) (3), are paid to the State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account, and since the water pollution proscribed by section 13385 similarly results in severe unquantifiable damage as described in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>we conclude that the liability imposed by section 13385 fulfills the same compensatory functions as the liability imposed by section 13350. Therefore, for the reasons set forth in <em>People </em>ex rel. <em>Younger </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>we hold that the moneys civilly collected pursuant to section 13385 are not punitive damages within the meaning of Government Code section 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">We uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling. The alternative writ of mandate is discharged and the peremptory writ of mandate is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The petition of real party in interest City for a rehearing was denied March 3, 1976.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b75-11\"> Section 13385 of the Water Code provides: \u201cAny person who discharges pollutants, except as permitted by waste discharge requirements, or who violates any cease and desist order, prohibition, waste discharge requirement, effluent limitation, water quality related effluent limitation, national standard of performance, pretreatment or toxicity standard or who refuses to comply with the requirements adopted pursuant to Section 13382 shall be subject to civil penalty not to exceed ten thousand dollars ($10.000) for each day in which such discharge, violation, or refusal occurs. Funds collected shall be paid to the State Water Pollution Cleanup and Abatement Account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-12\">Hereafter, unless otherwise specified, all section references shall be to the Water Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b75-13\">Petitioners are the following: San Francisco Civil Service Association.

I have read <em>California </em>v. <em>Department of the </em>Navv, 371 Fed.Supp. 82. There is no doubt, as the analysis in this case points out, that the civil liabilities provided for in Section 13350 of the Water Code have several aspects that are penal in nature. That they may \u00abinstitute the type of damages described in Government Code Section 818 is clearly a possibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-15\">\u201cHowever, there is no Constitutional prohibition which would prevent the Legislature from imposing liability upon municipalities for the sums provided for in Section 13350. I am satisfied from the consideration of the Legislative scheme set forth in the Water Quality Control Act that the Legislature has expressed its intention to subject municipalities to this liability....</p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">\u201cIt is therefore ordered that the motion of Cross-Defendants for summary judgment and for judgment on the pleadings be denied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b77-17\">Sinc\u00e9 the sole ground urged in the petition for writ of mandate is the question of immunity for a public entity pursuant to section 818 of the Government Code, it provides the sole ground for the issuance of the alternative writ of mandate and is the sole issue before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Section 13370 provides: \u201cThe Legislature finds and declares that since the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1151 et seq.). as amended, provides for a permit system to regulate the discharge of pollutants to the navigable waters of the United States and provides that permits may be issued by states which are authorized to implement the provisions of such act. it is in the interest of the people of the state, in order to avoid direct regulation by the federal government of persons already subject to regulation under state law pursuant to this division, to enact the provisions of this chapter in order to authorize the state to implement the provisions of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto, and federal regulations and guidelines issued pursuant thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b78-6\">The federal act proscribes \u201cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person . . .\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1311 (a)). \u201cDischarge of any pollutant\u201d is defined as \u201cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source . . .\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 (12)). \u201cPollutant\" is defined as including \u201csewage\u201d as well as \u201cmunicipal . .. waste.\" (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 (6).) \u201cPoint source\u201d is defined as \u201cany discernible, confined, and discrete conveyance, including . . . any pipe, ditch, channel, tunnel [or] conduit . . . .\u201d (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 1362 (14).)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
