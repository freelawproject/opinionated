At his request and pursuant to Education Code section 13443, subdivision (b), Turner was served with accusation and notice of hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">At the hearing, Miss Allen, head of the mathematics department, testified she had talked with Turner in late May or June 1971, telling him she understood he was not teaching algebra. He responded he was \u201cno longer teaching algebra, that he was teaching things that he thought would be of more use to the students at this point in their lives,\u201d such as health. He felt he had sufficiently covered the course content.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>The following year Miss Allen, who had a number of Turner\u2019s former students in her geometry classes, concluded they were inadequately prepared in algebra. Several told her they had not learned factoring and had never heard of ratios and proportions. Some of the advanced students had trouble solving equations with one or two variables, and a number indicated they listened to music in Turner\u2019s classes.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">On cross-examination, Miss Allen acknowledged she was not qualified to judge the competency of classroom teachers, and further, she was confused as to whether those not learning factoring were students of Turner. or another teacher. Her conclusions on inadequate student preparation were based mainly on student statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">Two of Turner\u2019s former students testified that during part of the winter of the 1970-1971 school year, they merely sat in class, talked, and listened to music for entire class sessions without receiving instruction in algebra. During other periods Turner assigned problems for the first 15 or 20 minutes of class but played music for the remaining time. Few homework assignments were given.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">During the latter part of Turner\u2019s first year, his teaching was evaluated by the school\u2019s principal. The principal\u2019s report of 3 March 1971 rated petitioner\u2019s teaching performance \u201ccommendable\u201d or \u201cacceptable\u201d in every category.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The hearing officer found Turner failed \u201cto give satisfactory instruction in algebra, when compared with the standards generally expected of other faculty, during the latter portion of the preceding (1970-1971) school year,\u201d and this failure related to the welfare of the school and its pupils.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The officer also found that Turner\u2019s performance in his first year was hampered by a malfunctioning air-cooler, an exceedingly hot classroom, late availability of textbooks, and personal problems, including difficulties in finding a residence. Further findings indicated his performance improved the next year.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">Adopting the determinations of the hearing officer, the board elected not to reemploy Turner for the 1972-1973 school year. The board\u2019s decision was subsequently upheld by the trial court, which found the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>board\u2019s action was supported by substantial evidence and related solely to the welfare of the school and its pupils.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">The Legislature has created a comprehensive scheme delineating the rights of teachers to their positions. Teachers are classified as permanent employees\u2014and probationary employees. In general, a teacher employed by a school district for three consecutive school years, if reelected for the next school year, becomes a permanent employee at the commencement of the fourth school year. (\u00a7 13304.) During the three-year period, a teacher employed for a school year is a <em>probationary teacher. </em>(\u00a7 13334.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Grounds for dismissal of a <em>permanent </em>employee are specified in sections 13403 and 13403.5.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The permanent employee must be given notice of the charges between September 16 and May 14, and he may demand a hearing. When the cause for dismissal is based on subdivision (d) of section 13403 (incompetency), the hearing shall be by a commission on professional competence, composed of one member selected by the employee, one by the school board and one a hearing officer of the State Office of Administrative Procedure. (\u00a7 13413.) Either the school board or the employee may seek court review of the commission\u2019s decision, and the court on review shall exercise its independent judgment on the evidence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (\u00a7 13414.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>Probationary employees may be dismissed <em>during the school year </em>for cause only, as in the case of permanent employees. (\u00a7 13442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">The school board\u2014by giving notice prior to 15 March\u2014may decide not to reemploy a probationary teacher for the ensuing school year. The probationary teacher is then entitled to timely request a hearing before a hearing officer who shall prepare a proposed decision. (\u00a7 13443, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Subdivision (c) of section 13443 provides that the school board shall make the final determination as to rehiring probationary teachers. Subdivision (d) of that section also reflects legislative intent to limit judicial review: \u201cThe governing board\u2019s determination not to reemploy a probationary employee for the ensuing school year shall be for cause only. The determination of the governing board as to the sufficiency of the cause pursuant to this section shall be conclusive, but the cause shall relate solely to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">At the outset we must determine the proper standard to be utilized by the trial court in reviewing a board\u2019s decision not to reemploy a probationary teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">In <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1964) 61 Cal.2d 93, 96-97 [37 Cal.Rptr. 194, 389 P.2d 722], this court stated that where \u201cthere is evidence to support the board\u2019s findings of fact\u201d and the cause for dismissal relates to the welfare of the school and its pupils, the reviewing court may not redetermine the facts or whether they are sufficiently serious to justify dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-9\">This court again recognized the applicability of the substantial evidence test to the board\u2019s findings in <em>Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 575, 589 [100 Cal.Rptr. 16, 493 P.2d 480], stating \u201cthe reviewing court must accept evidentiary facts shown by substantial evidence and the sufficiency of those facts to constitute a stated cause.\u201d These rules were quoted in <em>Lindros </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. of the Torrance Unified School Dist. </em>(1973) 9 Cal.3d 524, 533-534 [108 Cal.Rptr. 185, 510 P.2d 361], although the court pointed out that neither party had challenged the applicability of the substantial evidence rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>Prior to the decision in <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29], the substantial evidence rule was applied to review of local administrative adjudications. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 31-32.) In <em>Strumsky, </em>a dual system of review was established. A trial court would thereafter continue applying the substantial evidence rule in reviewing local-administrative adjudications not affecting fundamental vested rights. However, in reviewing adjudications affecting fundamental vested rights, a trial court would be required by the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers to exercise independent judgment upon the evidence disclosed in a limited trial de novo.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">The question therefore presented by the instant case is whether the right of <em>probationary </em>teachers to be rehired for the next school year is vested within the meaning of <em>Strumsky </em>so that limited trial de novo review\u2014rather than substantial evidence review\u2014is applicable. We conclude that the right is not vested, that the standard of review for determination not to rehire remains the substantial evidence rule, and that the holdings of <em>Griggs, Bekiaris, </em>and <em>Lindros </em>continue viable.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Although this court has broadly outlined the distinction between vested and nonvested rights, it has not drawn a sharp line of demarcation. In <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242], the court stated: \u201cAs we have noted, in determining whether the right is sufficiently basic and fundamental to justify independent judgment review, the courts have considered the degree to which that right is \u2018vested,\u2019 that is, already possessed by the individual. <em>(McDonough </em>v. <em>Goodcell, supra, </em>13 Cal.2d 741, 753 [91 P.2d 1035, 123 A.L.R. 1205].) In cases involving applications for a license, the courts have largely deferred to the administrative expertise of the agency. (See <em>So. Cal. Jockey Club </em>v. <em>Cal. etc. Racing Bd. </em>(1950) 36 Cal.2d 167, 174-178 [223 P.2d 1].) Courts are relatively ill-equipped to determine whether an individual would be qualified, for example, to practice a particular profession or trade. (See <em>Savelli </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1964) 229 Ca.App.2d 124, 129, 131-132 [40 Cal.Rptr. 171].) In a case involving the agency\u2019s initial determination whether an individual qualifies to enter a profession or trade the courts uphold the agency decision unless it lacks substantial evidentiary support or infringes upon the applicant\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights. Once the agency has initially exercised its expertise and determined that an individual fulfills the requirements to practice his profession, the agency\u2019s subsequent revocation of the license calls for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>an independent judgment review of the facts underlying any such administrative decision.\u201d (Fns. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">By analogy to the <em>Bixby </em>language, an applicant for a teaching position does not possess a vested right to be hired, but a tenured teacher possessed a vested right to be retained. Between these two falls the instant case: one\u2019s right to be rehired following a trial period to determine competency and effectiveness prior to being granted tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">In considering the student\u2019s need for education, the teacher\u2019s need for job security, and the school board\u2019s need for flexibility in evaluating and hiring employees who may remain 40 years, the Legislature may determine whether a teacher\u2019s vested right shall be granted, postponed or denied. <em>(Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 564, 577 [33 L.Ed.2d 548, 560-561, 92 S.Ct. 2701].) Our school system is established not to provide jobs for teachers but rather to educate the young. Establishing a test period for teachers to prove themselves is essential to a good education system. While refusal to grant total job security at the time of initial hiring may be repugnant to those pursuing a teaching career, repeated statutory amendments relating to probationary teachers\u2019 rights (see Comment, <em>Probationary Teacher Dismissal </em>(1974) 21 UCLA L.Rev. 1257, 1260-1264), reveal that the Legislature has been well aware of the delicate balancing necessary to accommodate these sometimes competing interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">Examination of existing statutes convinces us the Legislature has not seen fit to grant probationary teachers a vested right to be rehired so as to make trial de novo review applicable. By labelling the position probationary, the Legislature had clearly advised the employee that the position is neither vested nor permanent. Probation means the teacher is on trial\u2014his competence and suitability remaining to be determined. (See Webster\u2019s New Intemat. Diet. (3d ed. 1961) p. 1806.) Probationary is the opposite of vested. Although the label may not be determinative, it is strong indication of legislative intent not to grant a vested right.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">To hold that a probationary teacher has a vested right to be rehired for the next school year\u2014requiring limited trial de novo review\u2014would contravene portions of section 13443, subdivisions (c) and (d). By providing that the school board\u2019s determination of the sufficiency of the cause is conclusive, the Legislature has foreclosed judicial evaluation of the gravity of misconduct of probationary teachers. Under subdivisions (c) and (d), once misconduct relating to the schools and their pupils is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>established, it is within the school board\u2019s discretion to determine whether the cause is sufficiently serious to warrant a refusal to rehire and whether the teacher\u2019s other qualities justify reemployment. <em>(Lindros </em>v. <em>Governing Bd. of the Torrance Unified School Dist., supra, 9 </em>Cal.3d 524, 534; <em>Bekiaris </em>v. <em>Board of Education, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d 575, 586-587; <em>Griggs </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, supra, </em>61 Cal.2d 93, 96; <em>McGlone </em>v. <em>Mt. Diablo Unified Sch. Dist. </em>(1969) 3 Cal.App.3d 17, 22 [82 Cal.Rptr. 225]; <em>American Federation of Teachers </em>v. <em>San Lorenzo etc. Sch. Dist. </em>(1969) 276 Cal.App.2d 132, 136 [80 Cal.Rptr. 758]; <em>Raney </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees </em>(1966) 239 Cal.App.2d 256, 259 [48 Cal.Rptr. 555].)</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In contrast, this court, establishing the scope of limited trial de novo review, upheld a trial court\u2019s determination based on conflicting evidence and inferences that an administrative board\u2019s finding of moral turpitude was not sustained by the weight of the evidence. <em>(Yakov </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 67, 71 et seq. [64 Cal.Rptr. 785, 435 P.2d 553].) Similarly, in <em>Magit </em>v. <em>Board of Medical Examiners </em>(1961) 57 Cal.2d 74, 87-88 [17 Cal.Rptr. 488, 366 P.2d 816], this court, recognizing the doctor was guilty of unprofessional conduct in violation of statute, held matters found by way of excuse by the trial court precluded license revocation, permitting only a lesser penalty. Trial de novo review as reflected by the above cases is thus broader than that permitted by subdivisions (c) and (d) and, if applied to decisions refusing to rehire probationary te\u00e1chers, would invalidate procedural provisions of the subdivisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Moreover, because the substantive grounds for dismissal of a permanent teacher (see fn. 4) include substantially all matters constituting \u201ccause\u201d\" for refusal to rehire a probationary teacher, failure to enforce the procedural differences would mean probationary teachers have the same tenure enjoyed by permanent teachers\u2014a result obviously contrary to legislative intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The intention of the Legislature to limit review being manifest, cardinal rules of statutory construction require rejection of the argument that the Legislature has granted probationary teachers a vested right, thereby invalidating the express provision making conclusive the board\u2019s determination of sufficiency.  Courts should construe all provisions of a statute together, significance being given\u2014if possible\u2014to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuance of the legislative purpose. (E.g., <em>Moyer </em>v. <em>Workmen's Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1973) 10 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>222, 230 [110 Cal.Rptr. 144, 514 P.2d 1224].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n                   And courts should construe statutes where possible in favor of validity. (E.g., <em>Erlich </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 553, 558 [11 Cal.Rptr. 758, 360 P.2d 334].)</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">In <em>Young </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 769 [115 Cal.Rptr. 456], the Court of Appeal held the Legislature has given probationary teachers a vested right to be rehired, having provided that employment in effect shall continue until <em>\"divestedfor cause. \u201d </em>(At p. 780; italics in orig.) However, a provision that administrative action must be for cause means no more than that arbitrary and oppressive action is forbidden, and such a standard will be implied in its absence when the policy leading to the adoption of the legislative enactment is apparent. <em>{Louis Stores, Inc. </em>v. <em>Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control </em>(1962) 57 Cal.2d 749, 760 [22 Cal.Rptr. 14, 371 P.2d 758]; <em>In re Petersen </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 177, 184 et seq. [331 P.2d 24]; <em>Rescue Army </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 460, 471 [171 P.2d 8]; see <em>Kugler </em>v. <em>Yocum </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 371, 380 et seq. [71 Cal.Rptr. 687, 445 P.2d 303].) Moreover, the conclusion in <em>Young </em>that the provision requiring cause reflected legislative intent to grant a vested right would\u2014as we have seen\u2014invalidate the provision making the board\u2019s determination conclusive. It would be anomalous to reach the result that one provision of a statute has the effect of invalidating the one immediately following it. The court in <em>Young </em>also relied upon language in <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, supra, </em>408 U.S. 564, 573-574 [33 L.Ed.2d 548, 558-559], but the language is directed to whether a teacher hired for a term has a sufficient interest in his position requiring a hearing for a determination not to rehire. The language does not deal with the question of judicial review of the hearing when, as here, a hearing has been conducted. Insofar as it is contraiy to the views expressed herein, <em>Young </em>is disapproved.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The standard of performance in teaching algebra clearly relates to the welfare of the school and its pupils. Turner\u2019s termination was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>based, not on activity outside the classroom, but solely on his failure to perform the principal activity for which he was hired\u2014teaching algebra.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The finding of below-standard performance is supported by substantial evidence, namely, testimony by the department head and two students showing Turner was not teaching algebra. Although evidence also exists not supportive of the findings, the weight to be given the conflicting evidence is for the board to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">It is also for the board to determine whether the factors affecting Turner\u2019s performance explained or excused his below-standard teaching. Just as the courts may not reweigh the gravity of the facts found justifying dismissal, they may not redetermine the weight to be given the offered excuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">Turner contends his rehiring for the 1971-1972 school year establishes that his conduct was satisfactory in the 1970-1971 school year. However, a recommendation not to rehire for the next school year must be given prior to 15 March or the teacher is automatically hired for the next year. (\u00a7 13443.) The rehiring occurrence in the midst of the school year may not be viewed as a determination of satisfactory conduct for the entire year. It is noted Turner\u2019s low performance occurred partially after 15 March 1971, the administrator gaining knowledge of all his questionable conduct after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">Although Turner\u2019s performance during his second year was satisfactory, he cannot demand\u2014and courts may not require\u2014the school board and students face the risk of repetition of earlier unsatisfactory performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude the board did not abuse its discretion in refusing to rehire Turner.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">McComb, J., Mosk, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-10\">A11 statutory references are to the Education Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b817-10\">While there were five other charges of misconduct, they were resolved in Turner\u2019s favor, and the evidence relating to them has been omitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b818-6\">There is also provision for employment of substitute teachers and of temporary teachers on a day-to-day basis during the first three months of the school year.

(\u00a7\u00a7 13413, 13414.) When the cause for dismissal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>based on the other subdivisions of section 13403, hearing is held before a hearing officer alone, <em>and his decision is binding on the school board.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b823-6\">When it is contended that one of the provisions of subdivision (d) reflects a legislative intent to grant a vested right to a probationary teacher, it is incumbent upon this court in determining legislative intent to consider the entire subdivision and the effects upon other subdivision provisions which might follow from acceptance of the vested right contention. To refuse or to postpone consideration of the potential invalidity of part of the subdivision, resulting from this court\u2019s interpretation of another part of the subdivision, is to hide from reality and to ignore the practical effects of our own decision. Moreover, a determination of partial invalidity of the subdivision may require the conclusion that the statute is not severable, invalidating the entire subdivision\u2014including the portion interpreted today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b824-11\">TOBRINER, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0u\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-12\">The critical issue in this case\u2014a very narrow issue\u2014is whether a superior court, in reviewing a school board decision not to reemploy a probationary teacher, must utilize its independent judgment in evaluat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>ing disputed facts, or alternatively, must uphold the factual determinations of the school board so long as such determinations are supported by substantial evidence. Under this court\u2019s decisions in <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242] and <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 28 [112 Cal.Rptr. 805, 520 P.2d 29], the resolution of this issue turns on whether the school board\u2019s decision not to reemploy a probationary teacher substantially affects a \u201cfundamental, vested right\u201d of the teacher. No one questions the \u201cfundamental\u201d nature of the probationary teacher\u2019s right in this context;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> rather, the controversy in this case relates solely to the issue of whether the probationary teacher enjoys a \u201cvested\u201d right within the meaning of <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b825-4\">The majority conclude that the probationary teacher enjoys no such \u201cvested\u201d right, relying heavily on the dictionary meaning of \u201cprobationary\u201d and on the supposition that a contrary conclusion would obliterate all distinctions between permanent and probationary teachers in this state. As I shall explain, however, the majority\u2019s analysis fails to take proper cognizance of the fact that the Legislature has explicitly provided probationary teachers with a statutory right to be reemployed unless terminated \u201cfor cause\u201d; this statutory provision, in itself, establishes the \u201cvested\u201d nature of the probationary teacher\u2019s interest in reemployment. Moreover, as I further explain, the majority\u2019s suggestion that such a conclusion would eliminate the distinctions between permanent and probationary teachers simply reflects a fundamental misconception of the scope of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">As the majority properly recognize, analysis of the question at issue here must necessarily begin with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno, supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d 130. In <em>Bixby, </em>we articulated the distinction between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>\u201cvested\u201d and \u201cnonvested\u201d rights by reference to the differential treatment that traditionally has been accorded an <em>applicant </em>who has been denied a license, as distinguished from a <em>license holder </em>whose license has been revoked. Observing that \u201c[c]ourts are relatively ill-equipped to determine [in the first instance] whether an individual would be qualified ... to practice a particular profession or trade,\u201d we recognized that \u201ccourts uphold [an agency\u2019s initial determination whether an individual qualifies to enter a profession or trade] unless it lacks substantial evidentiary support or infringes upon the applicant\u2019s statutory or constitutional rights.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 146.) On the other hand, we emphasized that \u201c[o]nce the agency has initially exercised its expertise and d\u00e9termined that an individual fulfills the requirements to practice his profession, the agency\u2019s subsequent revocation of the license calls for an independent judgment review of the facts underlying any such administrative decision.\u201d <em>(Id.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">In the instant case, of course, the probationary teacher whose rights are at issue is in no sense analogous to a mere applicant for a license. Such a teacher has already obtained his teaching credential (see Ed. Code, \u00a7 13200 et seq.) and moreover, has already been found tentatively acceptable by the local school district which has hired him. Most significantly, such a probationary teacher enjoys much more than just a subjective \u201chope\u201d or \u201cexpectancy\u201d that he will be reemployed by the school district; instead, he possesses a statutory right to reemployment which may be lost only if the local school board finds proper \u201ccause\u201d not to reemploy him.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Thus, the critical factor in this case is the mandate of section 13443, subdivision (d) of the Education Code, which provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he governing board\u2019s determination not to reemploy a probationary employee for the ensuing school year <em>shall be for cause only.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Although the section goes on to provide that the governing board has the final word as to whether a given \u201ccause\u201d is sufficiently serious to warrant non-reemployment, the provision also stipulates that \u201cthe cause shall relate solely to the welfare of the school and the pupils thereof.\u201d Accordingly, so long as a probationary teacher conducts himself so as to provide no \u201ccause\u201d \u201crelating to the welfare of the schools and the pupils thereof\u2019 for non-reemployment, the teacher retains a statutory right to reemployment. This statutory right, though subject to divestment upon a finding of \u201ccause,\u201d constitutes a \u201cvested\u201d right within the meaning of <em>Bixby. </em>(See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Governing Board </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 769 [115 Cal.Rptr. 456].)</p>\n<p id=\"b827-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>The numerous cases upholding the \u201cvested\u201d nature of statutory retirement benefits confirm this conclusion. (See <em>Strumsky </em>v. <em>San Diego County Employees Retirement Assn., supra, </em>11 Cal.3d 28, 45, <em>Kern </em>v. <em>City of Long Beach </em>(1947) 29 Cal.2d 848, 853 [179 P.2d 799]; <em>Dryden </em>v. <em>Board of Pension Commrs. </em>(1936) 6 Cal.2d 575, 579 [59 P.2d 104]; <em>O\u2019Dea </em>v. <em>Cook </em>(1917) 176 Cal. 659, 661-662 [169 P. 366].) As these cases recognize, although an\u2019 employee\u2019s right to retirement benefits may be lost by the occurrence of a condition subsequent (such as the lawful termination of employment before maturity), the right to such statutory benefits <em>vests </em>upon the initial acceptance of employment; in similar fashion, although a probationary teacher\u2019s right to reemployment may be lost by the occurrence of a condition subsequent (a finding of \u201ccause\u201d for non-reemployment), the statutory right vests upon the probationary teacher\u2019s acceptance of employment. As in the retirement benefit cases, judicial review of factual determinations of the local administrative bodies must be exercised pursuant to the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard. (See <em>Strumsky, supra, </em>11 Cal.3d at pp. 45-46.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b827-4\">In reaching a contrary conclusion, the majority make two fundamental errors. First, the majority suggest that since plaintiff is a \u201cprobationary\u201d teacher, it follows from the dictionary definition of \u201cprobationary\u201d that he has no \u201cvested\u201d rights under <em>Bixby </em>or <em>Strumsky. </em>The defect in this reasoning is rather patent, for it simply ignores the fact that in this state \u201cprobationary\u201d teacher is a term of art, a term used to describe a class of teachers whose rights have been defined in a complex body of legislative enactments. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 13333, 13335, 13336.5, 13442, 13443, 13443.5, 13443.6, 13444.5.) Thus, while the term \u201cprobationary employee\u201d might normally connote an employee with no legally protected rights to reemployment, this is simply not true of \u201cprobationary\u201d teachers in California. Instead, such probationary teachers have been accorded numerous procedural and substantive rights, including statutory protection from termination without \u201ccause.\u201d These specific statu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>toiy enactments, of course, must take precedence over Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">Second, the majority also err in suggesting that recognition of a probationary teacher\u2019s \u201cvested\u201d right under <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>will obliterate any distinction between probationary and permanent teachers. As I explain, this suggestion simply reflects a basic misconception of the nature of the <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Under the present legislative scheme, while a school board may only refuse to reemploy a probationary teacher \u201cfor cause,\u201d once lawful \u201ccause\u201d relating to the welfare of the schools or pupils is shown, the school board is the final arbiter in determining whether such cause is sufficient to warrant non-reemploythent. The application of the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard of review contemplated by <em>Bixby-Strumsky </em>would not alter this legislative scheme; the school board woiild retain ultimate judgment on the <em>\u201csufficiency\u201d </em>of the cause, unencumbered by judicial second-guessing. Under <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky, </em>trial courts would exercise their independent judgment only with reference to the disputed <em>factual issues </em>in the record, i.e., whether or not the charges brought against the teacher were true or not; if the court found that the charges were true and related to the welfare of the school or pupils, the court would be obliged to uphold the district\u2019s decision not to reemploy the teacher. Thus, school boards would retain the substantial discretion they now enjoy in deciding whether or not a given \u201ccause\u201d is. sufficient to warrant not reemploying a probationary teacher.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">By contrast, a school board\u2019s authority to terminate a permanent, tenured teacher is much more limited. Dismissal is permitted only for certain statutorily enumerated causes. (See Ed. Code, \u00a7 13403.) Moreover, as noted by the majority <em>{ante, </em>p. 822) in reviewing the dismissal of a permanent teacher, courts may determine whether the charged conduct is sufficiently serious to warrant dismissal, or alternatively, whether some lesser sanction is appropriate. That would not be the case with respect to the reemployment of probationary teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">Thus, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, a decision recognizing the \u201cvested\u201d nature of a probationary teacher\u2019s right under <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky </em>would not eliminate the existing distinctions between probationary and permanent teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>The majority\u2019s decision to deny probationary teachers the limited protection they are entitled to under <em>Bixby </em>and <em>Strumsky </em>is particularly unfortunate in light of the fact that, in today\u2019s job market, a local school board\u2019s decision not to re employ a probationary teacher is effectively equivalent to a revocation of that teacher\u2019s credential. It is no secret, of course, that there presently exists a nationwide surplus of qualified elementary and secondary school teachers over the number of available teaching positions, or that this problem is particularly acute in California.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Consequently, it is extremely unlikely that any teacher, once terminated for cause, will be rehired in the foreseeable future over the countless applicants whose records do not bear the blemish of an earlier dismissal. Given the critical importance of such a decision to a young teacher\u2019s career, the need for the minimal safeguard provided by the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard is manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">In sum, the Legislature has enacted a specific provision protecting a probationary teacher from losing his job in the absence of a showing of cause; this statute provides the probationary teacher with a \u201cvested\u201d interest in reemployment, requiring a trial judge to exercise \u201cindependent judgment\u201d when reviewing the factual basis of a school board\u2019s decision not to reemploy the teacher. The majority reach a contrary conclusion only by ignoring the effect of the governing legislative provision and by misconstruing the nature of the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">I would reverse the judgment and remand to the trial court for reconsideration in light of the \u201cindependent judgment\u201d standard of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Wright, C. J., and Sullivan, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-6\">In <em>Bixby </em>v. <em>Pierno </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 130, 144-145 [93 Cal.Rptr. 234, 481 P.2d 242], we said: \u201cIn determining whether the right is fundamental the courts do not alone weigh the economic aspect of it, but the effect of it in human terms and the importance of it to the individual in the life situation.
