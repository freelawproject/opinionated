As will appear, we have concluded that, under the particular facts in this case, plaintiffs waived their right to a jury trial. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7631, subd. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Plaintiff minors, through their guardians ad litem, brought this action against, defendants (three railroad corporations and the City of Los Angeles) to recover for personal injuries sustained when a train collided with th\u00e9 car in which plaintiffs were riding. Plaintiffs, in an appropriate manner, demanded a jury, deposited the required fees (see Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631, subd. 5), and the trial commenced on July 25, 1972, as a jury trial. On August 2, 1972, plaintiffs notified the clerk that they no longer wished a jury and the defendants thereupon paid the jury fees with the trial continuing before a jury until Monday, August 7, 1972, at which time defendants also waived a jury, they having previously paid the fees for August 7, and on that day the jury was discharged. The trial continued before the court which ultimately entered its own findings against plaintiffs and ruled that they take nothing on their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Plaintiffs filed their appeal and, in addition to the juiy trial issue discussed below, raised numerous other issues, including the failure of the evidence to support the findings, inconsistencies in the findings of fact, and the trial court\u2019s refusal to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">The Court of Appeal disposed of the appeal by ruling that plaintiffs were improperly denied a jury trial, thereby finding it unnecessary to reach the additional issues raised by plaintiffs regarding the merits of their cause of action. We granted a hearing in the matter for the sole purpose of considering the jury trial issue. As will be developed, we have concluded that plaintiffs waived their right to a jury trial, and that reversal of the trial court\u2019s judgment cannot be based upon this ground. Accordingly, we will retransfer the cause to the Court of Appeal for consideration of the merits of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal. (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 12; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 20.) We consider such a procedure appropriate to assure that complex and substantial issues raised on appeal are initially considered by the Court of Appeal before their presentation to us, thereby providing the parties, a more complete form of appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>We turn to the critical point in the trial on August 7, 1972, when, plaintiffs having previously waived a jury on August 2, the defendants then also expressly waived their right to jury. The court met with counsel in the absence of the jury to review the status of the jury as trier of fact and the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">\u201cThe Court: I knew nothing about it and just found out from the Clerk that his [plaintiffs\u2019] fees were underwritten up to today by the defense after you [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel] indicated you were not willing to proceed, and you understand that that would be a waiver on your part of jury and your refusing to post further fees or failing to so post. You understand that? Mr. Berman [plaintiffs\u2019 counsel]: Well, is the Court asking me at this time whether or not if the railroad [defendants] doesn\u2019t want to continue posting, that I should, I would continue to post or are you asking me whether\u2014 The Court: Well, if you have abandoned it, if you have abandoned it, you have abandoned it for all time. Mr. Berman: <em>Yes. </em>The Court: You can\u2019t play hot and cold. Mr. Berman: <em>That\u2019s right, Your Honor. </em>The Court: I have to keep this record straight. Mr. Berman: Yes. The Court: You have refused with knowledge of that fact to\u2014 Mr. Berman: No question about it, Your Honor. The Court: All right. Mr. Berman: <em>No question about it. The plaintiffs waived jury some six, seven days ago. </em>The Court: All right.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">Following the foregoing discussion, one of defendants\u2019 counsel apologized to the court for wasting the jurors\u2019 time, and offered to post jury fees if the court felt that any undue pressure upon the court had been created by defendants\u2019 belated decision to forego a jury. The court refused the offer, stating that it was willing to accept the responsibility of trying the case. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel made a similar offer to \u201csplit\u201d the jury fees with defendants, but the court likewise declined that offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">Subsequently, the following exchange took place between the court and plaintiff\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-7\">\u201cMr. Berman: Your Honor, are you indicating that I have waived forever at this point, as far as you are concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-8\">The Court: Oh, yes, sure. You have so indicated. Is there anything else to be implied from anything you have said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b872-9\">Mr. Berman: Only that I would discuss the matter once again with my clients, because there has been a change in the conduct of the case. As you say, we have had a jury sitting here for seven days, longer, and there may be a change in their attitudes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>The Court: Well, so far as we are concerned,' so far as the law is concerned, if you have waived by failing to post fees, that is a final act on the plaintiff\u2019s part. That is as final as the law makes it out and you can\u2019t later come into the case and say: Now I want a jury; now I don\u2019t; now I want a jury; now I don\u2019t. You have done it. I don\u2019t approve of the way this thing has been handled up to this point for only the reasons indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-4\">The Court: All right. Now is there anything you want to say at this time, Mr. Berman? I am about to call the jury in and tell them that this case will be disposed of without them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">Mr. Berman: Well, at this time, Your Honor, I don\u2019t think there is very much for me to say other than the fact that\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-6\">The Court: Any legal objection to the contemplated action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-7\">Mr. Berman: <em>I don\u2019t know that I have a basis at this point or would even contemplate a basis for any objection. </em>I just didn\u2019t, I just don\u2019t feel that it is a fair inference being made toward the conduct of plaintiff\u2019s counsel and I just want the record to show that both defense counsel, including the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">The Court: Well, I am making no inferences. I am only saying, counsel, I am making no inferences for or against any lawyer. I am only saying if we would have known about this we wouldn\u2019t have taken so long in this case in deference to accommodating this jury . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-9\">Preliminarily, we note trial court error in its assumption that plaintiffs having initially waived a jury on August 2 necessarily did so \u201cfor all time\u201d or \u201cforever.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631, subd. 8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-10\">Resolution of the issue involves an interpretation of section 631 of the Code of Civil Procedure which describes those acts which constitute a waiver of a jury trial. Subdivision 7 provides that a waiver occurs \u201cBy failing to deposit with the clerk or judge, at the beginning of the second and each succeeding day\u2019s session a sum equal to one day\u2019s fees of the jury, . . .\u201d Since it is undisputed that plaintiffs failed to deposit jury fees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>after their express waiver on August 2, 1972, they waived their right to a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Plaintiffs initially assert, however, that, despite their counsel\u2019s concession at trial, no true waiver by plaintiffs occurred since defendants never agreed to the waiver, but instead \u201cpicked up\u201d the jury fees, until August 7. Under plaintiffs\u2019 present theory, a waiver of jury trial does not occur until both parties have \u201csimultaneously\u201d waived a jury trial. However, no case authority supports plaintiffs\u2019 contention, and we find nothing in the language of section 631 of the Code of Civil Procedure which requires a \u201cjoint\u201d or \u201csimultaneous\u201d waiver.' Rather, the statutory pattern thereby created contemplates an alternating process of waiver in which the onus of demand for jury and deposit of jury fees may briefly oscillate back and forth between the parties until final waiver by the last party permitted to assert the right, subject always to trial court discretion to relieve from waiver for just cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-5\">The question remains, of course, whether plaintiffs right to jury trial was <em>reinstated </em>once defendants, having \u201cpicked up\u201d the jury by payment of the required fees, thereafter expressly waived in turn their right to a jury. Plaintiffs argue that once defendants ceased paying the jury fees, plaintiffs\u2019 right to jury trial was automatically reinstated. As we will develop, this contention lacks merit for two reasons: (1) Neither the cases nor the statutes provide for revival of a previously waived right to juiy trial, except in the court\u2019s discretion, and (2) in any event, plaintiffs failed to demand a jury trial, or to object to the trial court\u2019s ruling that plaintiffs\u2019 prior waiver remained in effect. Under such circumstances plaintiffs may not raise the issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-6\">We trace certain relevant history. It has been a general rule in California that once a party has waived right to jury trial that waiver cannot thereafter be withdrawn except in the discretion of the trial court. <em>(Lee </em>v. <em>Giosso </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 246, 248-249 [46 Cal.Rptr, 803], hg. den., Peters and Tobriner, XT., to grant; <em>Broadway Fed. etc. Loan Assoc. </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1955) 133 Cal.App.2d 382, 398 [285 P.2d 61]; <em>Estate of Miller </em>(1936) 16 Cal.App.2d 154, 158-159 [60 P.2d 498], hg. den., Curtis, X, to grant; <em>Harmon </em>v. <em>Hopkins </em>(1931) 116 Cal.App. 184, 188 [2 P.2d 540]; see <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Wilson </em>(1961) 193 Cal.App.2d 615, 611-619 [14 Cal.Rptr. 585].) In <em>Lee, </em>for example, the plaintiff originally waived a jury trial at the pretrial conference; the defendant, however, demanded a jury and then waived it during trial. The court concluded that the plaintiff\u2019s subsequent demand for a jury was untimely and properly denied in view of plaintiff\u2019s earlier waiver. (P. 249.) In <em>Estate of Miller, </em>it was held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>the failure of one party to pay jury fees does not afford the other party, who had originally failed to demand a jury, the opportunity to preserve a jury trial by offering to pay those fees: \u201cAppellant having once waived a jury trial under the statute, could not be restored to the right which he had waived, . . .\u201d (Pp. 158-159; see also <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Reichlin </em>(1933) 217 Cal. 289, 291 [18 P.2d 664] [nondemanding party may not rely upon the demand of his adversary].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\">Subsequent amendments to section 631 have ameliorated the harshness of the foregoing rule by permitting a party to rely upon another party\u2019s demand and deposit of fees. (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 631, subds. 4, 8; <em>De Castro </em>v. <em>Rowe </em>(1963) 223 Cal.App.2d 547, 561 [36 Cal.Rptr. 53].) Section 631, subdivision 8, constitutes a codification of earlier appellate expressions such as <em>Broadway Fed. etc. Loan Assoc. </em>v. <em>Howard, supra, </em>133 Cal.App.2d 382, 398, wherein it was said: \u201cWhere a trial by jury has been regularly and voluntarily waived, such waiver cannot later be withdrawn except in the discretion of the court. [Citation.] Under the circumstances . . . which suggest no more than that defendants changed their minds after two waivers, the court did not abuse its discretion in having the case tried without a jury. [Citation.]\u201d Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 insistence, however, these amendments do not provide for the <em>automatic </em>reinstatement of jury trial in favor of one who has already waived it; the matter rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">Thus, subdivision 8 of section 631, upon which plaintiffs rely, provides that: \u201c[Trial by jury may be waived by the several parties to an issue of fact in manner following:] 8. When the party who has demanded trial by jury either waives such trial upon or after the assignment for trial to a specific department of the court, or upon or after the commencement of the trial, or fails to deposit the fees as provided in subdivisions 6 or 7; by the other party either failing promptly to demand trial by jury before the judge in whose department such waiver, other than for the failure to deposit such fees, was made, or by his failing promptly to deposit the fees as provided in subdivision 6 or 7. [If] The court may, in its discretion upon such terms as may be just, allow a trial by jury to be had although there has been a waiver of such a trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Although the foregoing language is somewhat complex its meaning is clear: When the party who originally demanded jury trial subsequently waives it, the other party has the opportunity to preserve a jury trial by promptly demanding one and depositing the necessary jury fees. This is precisely how defendants herein were able to prolong the jury trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>following plaintiffs\u2019 waiver. But the first paragraph of subdivision 8, however, does not deal with the issue raised in this case, namely, whether a party who has originally demanded <em>and then waived </em>a jury trial may subsequently withdraw his waiver. That question is answered in the <em>second </em>paragraph of the subdivision which requires the party who has waived to ask the trial court, in its discretion, to relieve him from that waiver. The record before us discloses that plaintiff, the affected party, made no such request.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Plaintiffs argue that it would have been an \u201cidle act\u201d to ask the trial court for relief from the prior waiver, or to demand a jury trial, in light of the court\u2019s expressed opinion that plaintiffs\u2019 original waiver remained in effect. Plaintiffs contend that their trial counsel did request, and were denied, the opportunity to confer with plaintiffs on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">The fact remains that plaintiffs at no time informed the trial court that they believed they still retained a right to jury trial. Rather they acquiesced in the court\u2019s interpretation of events. The bare request by plaintiffs\u2019 counsel to confer with clients, assuming it was made, did not constitute either a demand for jury trial or an objection to the trial court\u2019s ruling. The record, fairly read, indicates that the trial court repeatedly asked for plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s views on the question, and once inquired whether plaintiffs had \u201cany objection to the contemplated action?\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, rather than affirmatively stating the position now asserted on appeal, merely replied that he felt the court was making unfair inferences regarding counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">An objection to a court\u2019s contemplated ruling is indeed often an \u201cidle act\u201d in the sense that the objection may have no effect upon the court\u2019s decision. On the other hand, a proper objection might well succeed, thereby obviating an unnecessary appeal. Legal points of this nature must be presented on appeal by a record supporting trial assertion of the claim. A party must preserve his record.  Thus, it is well established that \u201c. . . a party cannot without objection try his case before a court without a jury, lose it and then complain that it was not tried by jury. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Pink </em>v. <em>Slater </em>(1955) 131 Cal.App.2d 816, 817 [281 P.2d 272]; see <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Norton </em>(1973) 34 Cal.App.3d 717, 722 [110 Cal.Rptr. 307]; <em>De Castro </em>v. <em>Rowe, supra, </em>223 Cal.App.2d 547, 552; <em>Glogau </em>v. <em>Hagan </em>(1951) 107 Cal.App.2d 313, 316 [237 P.2d 329].) As stated in the recent <em>Tyler </em>case, wherein defendants proceeded to try the case before a judge without <em>objecting to </em>the absence of a jury, \u201cDefendants cannot play \u2018Heads I win. Tails you lose\u2019 with the trial court.\u201d (P. 722.)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Our review of the record indicates that plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, while carefully inquiring regarding the trial court\u2019s position on the waiver question, neither himself demanded a jury trial nor objected to the court\u2019s ruling. Under such circumstances, plaintiffs cannot now be heard to complain of that ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\">The cause is retransferred to the Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, for disposition of plaintiffs\u2019 appeal on the merits. With respect to the proceeding before this court, in the interest of justice, each side shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Wright, C.
