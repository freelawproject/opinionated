(El Dorado), a limited partnership, made and delivered pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 689<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> its verified third .party claim to certain personal property upon which a writ of execution had been levied to enforce a judgment for money in favor of plaintiff Lewis W. Evans and against defendants John N. Galardi and Richard E. Hodge. After a hearing, the court sustained the claim and entered a judgment on third party claim declaring that at the time of levy of the writ the title to the property in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>question was vested in the third party claimant. Plaintiff appeals from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">The facts are not in dispute. El Dorado is a limited partnership formed for the purpose of owning and managing certain real property in the City of South Lake Tahoe, California, and of constructing, owning and managing a motel on the premises. Eventually, a motel known as the Rodeway Inn was built. When the partnership was formed in June 1969, plaintiff and defendants were the limited partners and entitled to receive all of the partnership net profits. The general partner at all times material herein was a California corporation known as El Dorado Improvement Corporation which operated the motel and whose stock initially was owned entirely by plaintiff and defendants. Raymond Haley was the president of the corporate general partner and in this position was charged with the over-all management of the business and with the supervision of its large number of employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">About September 15, 1970, plaintiff, defendants and El Dorado Improvement Corporation entered into a written contract whereby plaintiff agreed to sell and defendants agreed to purchase for the sum of $50,000 all of plaintiff\u2019s right, title and interest in the limited partnership and all of plaintiff\u2019s stock in the corporate general partner. Defendants executed and delivered to plaintiff their promissory note for the full amount of the purchase price. The respective obligations were undertaken by the parties as individuals, - and not in their status as limited partners or shareholders of the corporate general partner. El Dorado was not a party to the agreement of purchase and sale and did not sign either the agreement or the promissory note. As a result of this transaction, defendants as limited partners in El Dorado each became entitled to 50 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>percent of its net profits, if any, and became the owners of all of the stock of the corporate general partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">Defendants defaulted on the promissory note and about April 2, 1971, plaintiff brought an action against them in their individual capacity to recover on it. Ultimately judgment was entered in favor of plaintiff and against defendants individually in the sum of $60,008.15.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">On May 9, 1973, plaintiff obtained a writ of execution for the full amount of the judgment,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and instructed the Sheriff of El Dorado County to levy execution upon the Rodeway Inn and to place a keeper there to collect the receipts of the business until the judgment was satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">El Dorado filed a third party claim (see fn. 1, <em>ante) </em>to the property and business receipts alleging that it was the sole owner of the Rodeway Inn and its receipts and that defendants had no interest in the property upon which a writ of execution could properly be levied to enforce plaintiff\u2019s judgment. It further alleged that plaintiff could have reached defendants\u2019 partnership interests to satisfy his judgment only by means of a charging order, which had not been utilized in the instant case. As previously stated, the claim was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Plaintiff does not dispute that the legal title to the Rodeway Inn and to the money receipts generated by the motel is vested in El Dorado. Rather, he asserts that since defendants in their capacities as limited partners are each entitled to one-half of the net profits, they together in fact own the entire equitable and beneficial interest in El Dorado\u2019s assets.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On this basis,\u2018he contends; First, that he should be permitted to reach the partnership assets in satisfaction of his judgment against these defendants as individuals; and second that El Dorado is not a bona fide third party and hence may not assert a claim under Code of Civil Procedure section 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-8\">We begin our analysis by observing that as a general rule \u201c[a]ll goods, chattels, moneys or other property, both real and personal, or any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>interest therein, of the judgment debtor, not exempt by law . .. are liable to execution.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 688.) Thus, the initial and most important question confronting us is whether defendants, in their capacities as limited partners, have any interest in the assets of El Dorado as such which renders these assets potentially subject to execution in satisfaction of a personal judgment against defendants. In answering this question, we find it helpful to discuss briefly some of the basic principles underlying the law governing limited partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The form of business association known as a \u201climited partnership\u201d was not recognized at common law and is strictly a creature of statute. (2 Rowley on Partnership (2d ed. 1960) Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 53.0, pp. 549-550; 2 Barrett &amp; Seago, Partners and Partnerships, Law and Taxation (1956) Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 1, p. 483; <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(E.D.N.Y. 1947) 71 F.Supp. 521, 524; <em>Skolny </em>v. <em>Richter (1910) 139 </em>App.Div. 534 [124 N.Y.S. 152, 154].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It can generally be described as a type of partnership comprised of one or more general partners who manage the business and who are personally liable for partnership debts, and one or more limited partners who contribute capital and share in the profits, but who take no part in running the business and incur no liability with respect to partnership obligations beyond their capital contribution. (Corp. Code, \u00a7 15501<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; 2 Barrett &amp; Seago, Partners and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Partnerships, Law and Taxation, <em>supra, </em>Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 1, p. 482; 2 Rowley on Partnership, <em>supra, </em>Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 53.0, p. 549.) The obvious purpose underlying legislative recognition of this type of business entity was to encourage trade by permitting \u201ca person possessing capital to invest in business and to reap a share of the profits of the business, without becoming liable generally for the debts of the firm, or risking in the venture more than the capital contributed, provided he does not hold himself out as a general partner, or participate actively in the conduct of the business.\u201d <em>(Skolny </em>v. <em>Richter, supra, </em>124 N.Y.S. 152, 155; see also <em>Clapp </em>v. <em>Lacey </em>(1868) 35 Conn. 463, 466.)</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The California Legislature first legitimated limited partnerships in this state in 1870 by enacting a \u201cspecial partnership\u201d statute (Stats. 1869-1870, ch. 129, p. 123). These provisions were subsequently repealed in 1929, when the Legislature adopted the Uniform Limited Partnership Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Among other things, this act sets forth with considerable specificity the rights and obligations of the general and the limited partners, including a detailed description of their proprietary interests in the business. With certain specified limitations, the general partner has all of the rights and powers enjoyed by partners in \u201cnon-limited\u201d partnerships. (\u00a7 15509.) Thus, by reference to the Uniform Partnership Act (\u00a7 15001 et seq.), his property rights include: \u201c(1) <em>his rights in specific partnership property, </em>(2) his interest in the partnership, and (3) his right to participate in the management.\u201d (\u00a7 15024, italics added.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In sharp contrast, the limited partner is given no property interest in the specific partnership <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>assets as such. Rather, he is entitled, among other things,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cto receive a share of the profits or other compensation by way of income, and to the return of his contribution as provided in Sections 15515 and 15516.\u201d (\u00a7 15510, subd. (2).)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">This unwillingness on the part of the Legislature to grant the limited partner a property interest in the specific assets owned by the partnership, while at the same time providing for such an interest in the general partner, compels the conclusion that the limited partner has no interest in the partnership property by virtue of his status as a limited partner. Thus, such assets are not available to satisfy a judgment against the limited partner in his individual capacity. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 688.)</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">While our research has disclosed no reported California decision which has considered this question, we note that our conclusion in this regard finds ample support in the decisions of our sister states and of the federal courts as well as in various treatises and other legal authorities. (See, e.g., <em>Reiter </em>v. <em>Greenberg </em>(1968) 21 N.Y.2d 388 [288 N.Y.S.2d 57, 60, 235 N.E.2d 118]; <em>In re Panitz &amp; Co. </em>(D.Md. 1967) 270 F.Supp. 448, 453, affirmed <em>sub nom. Hammerman </em>v. <em>Arlington Federal Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>385 F.2d 835; <em>Alley </em>v. <em>Clark, supra, </em>71 F.Supp. 521, 526-527; <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Cooke </em>(1931) 256 N.Y. 73 [175 N.E. 518, 521-522]; <em>Appeal of Silberman </em>(1926) 105 Conn. 192 [134 A. 778, 785], reversed in part on other grounds <em>sub nom. Blodgett </em>v. <em>Silberman </em>(1927) 277 U.S. 1 [72 L.Ed. 749, 48 S.Ct. 410]; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1864) 28 N.Y. 574 [86 Am.Dec. 268, 269, 270]; 2 Barrett &amp; Seago, Partners and Partnerships, Law and Taxation, <em>supra, </em>Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 1, p. 485; 2 Rowley on Partnership, <em>supra, </em>Limited Partnerships, \u00a7\u00a7 53.18, 53.26, pp. 582, 594; Comment, <em>The Limited Partnership </em>(1954) 2 U.C.L.A.L.Rev. 105, 118-119.)</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Thus, in a case substantially identical to the one at bench, the New York Court of Appeal held that a sheriff lacked the power and jurisdiction to sell property owned by a limited partnership in execution of a judgment against a limited partner. In so holding, the court reasoned; \u201cThe interest of Harris [the limited partner] in the property of a limited partnership can hardly be said to be an interest in the property of the firm. He advance^ to the firm a sum of money, which he is entitled to receive back, with interest, at the termination of the partnership; he is also entitled to a share in the profits; but he is to no further extent the owner of the property. Upon payment of these claims, the property would belong to the general partners.\u201d <em>(Harris </em>v. <em>Murray, supra, </em>28 N.Y. 574 [86 Am. Dec. 268, 270].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Quite apart from the lucid statutory language and the overwhelming weight of authority, the very nature of the limited partner\u2019s relationship with the business organization indicates that he has no property interest in the specific partnership assets which would render them available to his personal creditors. The limited partner is, primarily, an investor, who contributes capital and thereby acquires the right to share in the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>profits. (See Uniform Limited Partnership Act, Official Comment, \u00a7 I.) His contribution must be in the form of cash or other property, may not consist of services (\u00a7 15504), and must be specified as to amount in the partnership certificate. (\u00a7 15502.) His surname may not be used as part of the firm name. (\u00a7 15505.) He may not actively participate in the conduct of the business. (\u00a7 15507.) Assuming that he complies with these conditions, he is not liable as a general partner on business debts and obligations, except to the extent of his capital contribution. (\u00a7\u00a7 15501, 15507.) His death or withdrawal will not dissolve the partnership (\u00a7\u00a7 15519, 15520, 15521), and he is not a proper party to proceedings by or against the firm. (\u00a7 15526.) In sum, \u201c[tjhe most striking feature of the relation of a special partner to the copartnership is its detached and impersonal character which accentuates sharply its dissimilarity from the relations of a general partner.\u201d <em>(Skolny </em>v. <em>Richter, supra, </em>124 N.Y.S. at p. 155.)</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">In the instant case, it is undisputed that plaintiff\u2019s action on the promissory note and the ensuing judgment were against defendants as individuals, and that El Dorado was not named as a party to the action or as a judgment debtor. Furthermore, there is no question but that the cash receipts of the Rodeway Inn constitute an asset owned by El Dorado. Therefore, under the principles heretofore discussed, defendants in their capacities as limited partners had no property interest in these receipts; accordingly, the receipts were improperly levied upon in execution of plaintiff\u2019s judgment against defendants. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 688.)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">We are not persuaded by plaintiff\u2019s argument that a contrary conclusion is compelled simply because defendants were entitled to 100 percent of the net partnership profits in their capacity as limited partners. The Uniform Limited Partnership Act does not distinguish between the rights and obligations of limited partners or their relationship with the firm depending upon the extent of their ownership interest. Nor does plaintiff suggest any grounds for ignoring the result mandated by the act in the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Plaintiff does not claim and certainly did not establish at the hearing before the trial court, that there is any basis for finding that El Dorado is not, in fact, a bona fide limited partnership or that defendants\u2019 relationship with the firm indicates that they should be treated as general partners.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nor does he allege that defendants used this form of business to defraud plaintiff or anyone else or that they treated the business assets as their own. (See, e.g., <em>Minton </em>v. <em>Cavaney </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 576, 579 [15 Cal.Rptr. 641, 364 P.2d 473].) In short, plaintiff provides no legal basis for the rule he would have us adopt and accordingly we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We wish to point out that our decision in this regard does not leave plaintiff remediless. Section 15522, subdivision (1), establishes a method by which a creditor of a limited partner may satisfy his claim from the debtor\u2019s partnership interest through the use of a so-called charging order.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In construing a virtually identical statute applicable to \u201cnon-limited\u201d partnerships (\u00a7 15028, subd. (I)), this court stated that \u201ccharging orders on partnership interests have replaced levies of execution as the remedy for reaching such interests.\u201d <em>(Baum </em>v. <em>Baum (1959) 51 </em>Cal.2d 610, 612-613 [335 P.2d 481].)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Plaintiff would have us adopt an exception to this statutory prohibition against execution (\u00a7\u00a7 15028, 15522) to cover those cases in which the partnership is owned entirely by the judgment debtors.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> He argues that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the purpose underlying the enactment of these statutes is to protect innocent partners from the injustice and hardship they may suffer when partnership property is sold in execution of a judgment against an individual partner. <em>(Taylor </em>v. <em>S &amp; M Lamp Co., supra, </em>190 Cal.App.2d 700, 708.) This purpose, so the argument goes, is not furthered by disallowing execution against specific partnership assets in cases when the judgment debtors own the entire proprietary interest in the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">We decline plaintiff\u2019s invitation to recognize such an implied exception to the required use of the statutory charge procedure. Where, as in the instant case, the partnership is a viable business organization and plaintiff does not show that he will be unable to secure satisfaction of his judgment by use of a charging order or by levy of execution against the debtors\u2019 other personally owned property, there is no reason to permit deviation from the prescribed statutory process.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Finally, plaintiff argues that since El Dorado was owned entirely by defendants, it was not a bona fide third party claimant for purposes of Code of Civil Procedure section 689 and therefore could not properly assert a third party claim under this statute. In making this argument, plaintiff relies upon various authorities which state that a partnership is not necessarily viewed as a separate legal entity for all purposes. (See, e.g., 1 Barrett &amp; Seago, Partners and Partnerships, Law and Taxation, <em>supra, </em>Characteristics of a Partnership, <em>\u00a7 </em>1.2, pp. 151-156; 1 Rowley on Partnership, <em>supra, </em>Historical and Preliminary, \u00a7 1.3, pp. 22-23.)</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In answering plaintiff\u2019s contention, we need only point out that a limited partnership is viewed as an entity separate and apart from the limited partners for purposes of suing and being sued. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 388, subd. (a); \u00a7 15526.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The limited partner is not a proper party to proceedings by or against the limited partnership (\u00a7 15526), and the limited partnership is not involved in suits against the limited partners in their individual capacity. (2 Rowley on Partnership, <em>supra, </em>Limited Partnerships, \u00a7 53.26, p. 594.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>In the instant case, El Dorado was not named or in any way involved in plaintiff\u2019s suit against defendants. Nor did the judgment entered in the action purport to hold the limited partnership liable. Rather, the suit was based upon plaintiff\u2019s personal claim against defendants as individuals and the judgment was rendered accordingly. Thus, El Dorado may be viewed as an entity separate and apart from the limited partners for purposes of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Furthermore, we have previously determined that defendants had no interest in the property seized in execution of plaintiff\u2019s judgment, and that El Dorado was the legal owner of this property. Under these circumstances, El Dorado could properly assert its right to these assets by filing a third party claim under Code of Civil Procedure section 689.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Wright, C. J., McComb, J., Tobriner, J., Mosk, J., Clark, J., and Richardson, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">Section 689 provides in relevant part: \u201cIf tangible or intangible personal property levied on, whether or not it be in the actual possession of the levying officer, is claimed by a third person as his property by a written claim verified by his oath or that of his agent, setting out the reasonable value thereof, his title and right to the possession thereof and delivered, together with a copy thereof, to the officer making the levy, such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>officer must release the property and the levy unless the plaintiff, or the person in whose favor the writ runs, within five days after written demand by such officer, made by registered or certified mail within five days after being served with such verified claim, gives such officer an undertaking executed by at least two good and sufficient sureties, in a sum equal to double the value of the property levied upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">\u201cWhenever a verified third party claim is delivered to the officer as herein provided, upon levy of execution or attachment (whether any undertaking hereinabove mentioned be given or not), the plaintiff, or the person in whose favor the writ runs, the third party claimant, or any one or more joint third party claimants, shall be entitled to a hearing in the court in which the action is pending or from which the writ issued for the purpose of determining title to the property in question. ... At the conclusion of the hearing the court shall give judgment determining the title to the property in question, which shall be conclusive as to the right of the plaintiff, or other person in whose favor the writ runs, to have said property levied upon, taken, or held, by the officer and to subject said property to payment or other satisfaction of his judgment. In such judgment the court may make all proper orders for the disposition of such property or the proceeds thereof.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\">The judgment was thereafter modified and affirmed on appeal.and has become final.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Plaintiff concedes that he had received a payment of $18,000 in partial satisfaction of the judgment and hence that the writ of execution was improperly issued with respect to this amount.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\">Plaintiff points out that the corporate general partner has no equity ownership in El Dorado, and in any event, its stock is owned entirely and equally by the two judgment debtors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b333-6\">The origin, history and purpose of this type of business organization was described by the New York court in <em>Ames </em>v. <em>Downing </em>(1850) 1 Bradf. 321, 329-330: \u201cThe system of limited partnerships, which was introduced by statute into this State, and subsequently very generally adopted in many other States of the Union, was borrowed from the French Code. (3 <em>Kent, </em>36; <em>Code de Commerce, </em>19, 23, 24.) Under the name of <em>la Societe en commandite, </em>it has existed in France from the time of the middle ages; mention being made of it in the most ancient commercial records, and in the early mercantile regulations of Marseilles and Montpelier. In the vulgar Latinity of the middle ages it was styled <em>commenda, </em>and in Italy <em>accomenda. </em>In the statutes of Pisa and Florence, it is recognized so far back as the year 1160; also in the ordinance of Louis-le-Hutin, of 1315; the statutes of Marseilles, 1253; of Geneva, of 1588. In the middle ages it was one of the most frequent combinations of trade, and was the basis of the active and widely-extended commerce of the opulent maritime cities of Italy. It contributed largely to the support of the great and prosperous trade carried on along the shores of the Mediterranean, was known in Languedoc, Provence, and Lombardy, entered into most of the industrial occupations and pursuits of the age, and even travelled under the protection of the arms of the Crusaders to the city of Jerusalem. At a period when capital was in the hands of nobles and clergy, who, from pride of caste, or canonical regulations, could not engage directly in trade, it afforded the means of secretly embarking in commercial enterprises, and reaping the profits of such lucrative pursuits, without personal risk; and thus the vast wealth, which otherwise would have Iain dormant in the coffers of the rich, became the foundation, by means of this ingenious idea, of that great commerce which made princes of the merchants, elevated the trading classes, and brought the Commons into position as an influential estate in the Commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Hereafter, unless otherwise indicated, all section references are to the Corporations Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b334-5\">See Statutes 1929, chapter 865, pages 1912, 1913.

In holding that a Canadian corporation, which was a limited partner in a California limited partnership, had a \u201cpermanent establishment\u201d in the United States for purposes of a tax convention with Canada, the court stated that \u201ceach partner, whether general or limited has am interest as such in the assets and profits of the partnership, incl\u00fading the physical plant or offices at which the partnership conducts its business ....\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 207.) However, the court\u2019s finding of such an interest for purposes of a tax convention is not persuasive authority in regard to the question at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b337-7\">It is possible that a portion of these cash receipts may, eventually, constitute \u201cnet profits\u201d of El Dorado to which defendants will be entitled as limited partners. However, there is absolutely no evidence in the record as to the financial status of El Dorado which indicates what, if any, part of the receipts may find their way into defendant\u2019s hands in the form of distributed net profits. Furthermore, plaintiff did not purport to limit the scope of execution accordingly. Finally, section 15522 indicates that plaintiff must obtain a charging order, rather than a writ of execution, to reach defendants\u2019 interests in the limited partnership. (See discussion in text accompanying fn. 14, <em>infra.)</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b338-6\">We note that even if plaintiff were able to show that defendants should be viewed and treated as general partners, he could not reach the partnership assets by reason of this fact alone. Section 15025, subdivision (2)(c) provides that \u201c[a] partner\u2019s right in specific partnership property is not subject to attachment, or execution, except on a claim against the partnership.\" Section 15509 makes the same rule applicable to general partners in a limited partnership.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Section 15522 provides in relevant part as follows: \u201cOn due application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any creditor of a limited partner, the court may charge the interest of the indebted limited partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of such claim; and may appoint a receiver, and make all other orders, directions, and inquiries which the circumstances of the case may require.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">In urging that we recognize this exception plaintiff relies upon the case of <em>Taylor </em>v. S &amp; <em>M Lamp Co. </em>(1961) 190 Cal.App.2d 700 [12 Cal.Rptr. 323], However, the specific holding of that case indicates that plaintiff\u2019s reliance thereon is misplaced. We quote the relevant portion of that opinion: \u201c \u2018Charging orders on partnership interests have replaced levies of execution as the remedy for reaching such interests.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">\u201cThis is a correct statement of the law as applied to the ordinary case, i.e., (1) where the partnership continues a bona fide existence and (2) where there is no transfer of partnership assets without a fair and adequate consideration or in fraud of creditors of either the partnership or of individual partners. But, if as alleged, (a) dissolution occurred (see Corp. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 15029 and 15031 as to definition and causes of dissolution), or (b) there was a transfer of partnership assets to one or more of the remaining partners, or to a third party, without a fair and adequate consideration or for the purpose of defrauding creditors of the partnership or of individual partners, then we do not have the ordinary and usual situation which Corporations Code, sections 15025 and 15028, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>designed to protect, l'o apply the general rule as a shield to such a situation is contrary to reason and would violate public policy.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 710-711.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Code of Civil Procedure section 388 provides in relevant part that \u201c[a]ny partnership or other unincorporated association, whether organized for profit or not, may sue and be sued in the name which it has assumed or by which it is known.\u201d While a general partner may be joined as a party to proceedings by or against the firm, the limited partner may not.
