His natural mother Joan Todd<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> surrendered him for adoption to an approved agency, Catholic Charities Diocese of Metuchen (\u201cCatholic Charities\u201d) on February 10, 1994. <em>See N.J.S.A </em>9:3-38a (defining \u201capproved agency\u201d). Thereafter, Baby D was placed in the home of plaintiffs, Peter Robinson and Vivian Robinson, on February 23, 1994, where he has continuously resided.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">Effective April 27, 1994, adoptions in New Jersey are governed by <em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-38 to -55. This appeal requires us to construe <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a where the natural father of a child born out of wedlock contests an adoption after the natural mother surrenders the child for adoption to an approved agency. Although there have been two reported opinions construing this statute, <em>In re Adoption of a Child by R.K., </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 696 A.2d 116 (Ch.Div.1997), and <em>In re Adoption of a Child by F.O. and W.O., </em>307 <em>N.J.Super. </em>176, 704 A.2d 604 (Ch.Div.1997), both opinions involved natural fathers who knew of their child\u2019s existence from the date of birth. Here, the natural father, Richard Sampson,' in objecting to the Robinson\u2019s adoption, alleged that he first learned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>of the birth of his infant son on October 22, 1994. Thus, he argued that a determination of whether he \u201csubstantially failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child, although able to do so,\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46, must be based on an analysis of his conduct commencing on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">Plaintiffs countered that they were entitled to the statutory presumption, embodied in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46, that \u201c[a] parent shall be presumed to have failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child if the court finds that the situation set forth in <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l)] or <em>[N.J.S.A. </em>9:3^46a(2) ] has occurred for six or more months.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">The essence of plaintiffs\u2019 contention is that the statutory presumption commences at birth, here January 31, 1994, and thus plaintiffs were entitled to that presumption effective July 31,1994. Thus, plaintiffs argue that despite Sampson\u2019s lack of knowledge of Baby D\u2019s birth, the statutory presumption entitled them to a judgment, after proof that they met all other statutory criteria for adoption. Stated differently, plaintiffs argue that ignorance of a child\u2019s existence is, by itself, insufficient to overcome the statutory presumption. Alternatively, plaintiffs contend that Sampson failed to perform the \u201cregular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child\u201d even after he learned of Baby D\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">The trial judge agreed with Sampson. The eleven-day trial focused upon the entire relationship of Sampson and Todd, exploring the veracity of Sampson\u2019s claim that he did not learn of Todd\u2019s pregnancy or of Baby D\u2019s birth until October 22, 1994, and exploring and evaluating Sampson\u2019s conduct after October 22, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">At the conclusion of the trial on March 27, 1997, the judge rendered a fifty-one page oral opinion. After reviewing in meticulous detail the testimony of each witness, and then, again in meticulous detail, explaining why certain portions of the testimony were not worthy of belief and why other portions of testimony were substantially credible, the judge concluded, \u201cBased upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>those findings, the Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that [Sampson] abandoned<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> this child \u25a0within the meaning of that term within <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l)\u201d. The judge thus concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 complaint for adoption must be denied. The judge also orally concluded that visitation between Sampson and Baby D should immediately commence, and that a transition plan should be established resulting in Baby D\u2019s move from plaintiffs\u2019 home in New Jersey to Sampson\u2019s home in West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Immediately following the judge\u2019s oral decision, plaintiffs made a motion for a stay of the order transferring the child pending appeal, a motion for a \u201cbest interests hearing,\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and requested the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration. Sampson\u2019s counsel immediately contended:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">[T]he adoptive parents at this time have no legal right to restrain the child. The only person who has the right to restrain that child or to hold that child is the father____ [T]he adoptive parents have absolutely no right to a best interest \u2022 hearing. They have no right to a custody hearing because the time that they have held this child is not custody, it\u2019s possession____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">The judge delayed the implementation of her ruling to permit the filing of appropriate motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">On March 31, 1997, Sampson filed a petition seeking, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:67-13, a writ of habeas corpus demanding sole custody of Baby D. On that same day plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the judge\u2019s oral decision. Plaintiffs also filed on that day a complaint for custody.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">Plaintiffs\u2019 motions were heard by the court on April 4, 1997. The court entered orders on April 7, 1997, granting visitation to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>Sampson, denying plaintiffs\u2019 motion for reconsideration, dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 count one of the adoption complaint and declaring the dismissal to be a final judgment, and denying plaintiffs application for a \u201cbest interests hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thereafter, on April 22, 1997, plaintiffs sought an order from this court declaring the trial court\u2019s order final for purposes of appeal, for a stay of the transfer of Baby D, and for a stay of visitation. On May 28, 1997, we granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to stay the trial court\u2019s order regarding custody, denied their application to stay visitation, and accelerated the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Our standard of review is articulated in <em>Rova, Farms Resort, Inc. v. Investors Ins. Co., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u201c[0]ur appellate function is a limited one: we do not disturb the factual findings and legal conclusions of the trial judge unless we are convinced that they are so manifestly unsupported by or inconsistent with the competent, relevant and reasonably credible evidence as to offend the interests of justice,\u201d and the appellate court therefore ponders whether, on the contrary, there is substantial evidence in support of the trial judge\u2019s findings and conclusions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">In a non-jury case, such as here, a judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6I\">should not be overthrown except upon the basis of a carefully reasoned and factually supported (and articulated) determination, after canvassing the record and weighing the evidence, that the continued viability of the judgment would constitute a manifest denial of justice____ It is only upon the predicate of a determination that there has been a manifest miscarriage of justice, that corrective judicial action is warranted,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUM\"><em>[Baxter v. Fairmont Food Co., 74 N.J. </em>588, 597-98, 379 A.2d 225 (1977). <em>See Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N.J. </em>2, 6-8, 258 A.2d 706 (1969) (noting the appellate tribunal\u2019s deference to the trial judge in matters \u201cnot transmitted by the written record\u201d); <em>Liqui-Box Corp. v. Estate of Elkman, </em>238 <em>N.J.Super. </em>588, 596, 570 A.2d 472 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>122 <em>N.J. </em>142, 584 A.2d 214 (1990).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-13\">We are therefore compelled, after our thorough review of the entire record, and after careful analysis of the oral arguments presented by counsel, including the amici briefs and oral arguments of amici counsel,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to affirm the trial judge\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>denying plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeking adoption of Baby D. However, we conclude that the judge\u2019s decision denying plaintiffs\u2019 post-trial motion for a hearing was error. A hearing, as envisioned in <em>Sorentino v. The Family and Children\u2019s Soc\u2019y of Elizabeth, </em>72 <em>N.J. </em>127, 367 A.2d 1168 (1976) <em>(Sorentino I), </em>and as further amplified in <em>Sorentino v. The Family &amp; Children\u2019s Soc\u2019y of Elizabeth, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>313, 378 A.2d 18 (1977) <em>(Sorentino II), </em>was mandatory under the facts of this ease.* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We therefore affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand to the Family Part for further accelerated proceedings, as discussed <em>infra. </em>We shall retain jurisdiction and shall consider, on an accelerated basis, any application necessitated by the decision of the Family Part at the conclusion of the <em>\u201cSorentino-type\u201d </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">When Todd surrendered Baby D to Catholic Charities for adoption, she did not reveal the identity of Baby D\u2019s biological father.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although Catholic Charities placed Baby D in the home <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>of plaintiffs on February 23, 1994, plaintiffs\u2019 complaint seeking adoption was not filed until October 4, 1994.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> On November 9, 1994, an order was entered scheduling the adoption hearing for December 9, 1994. The hearing was rescheduled for December 23, 1994, due to a scheduling conflict. At that hearing, the court was informed that after plaintiffs\u2019 complaint was filed, a man identifying himself as Richard Sampson and claiming to be the father of Baby D had called Catholic Charities to inquire about the child. Pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-45, the court ordered that Sampson be given notice of the adoption proceeding. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel directed a notice to Sampson at his residence in West Virginia that same day. On January 9, 1995, Sampson, through counsel, entered a notice of his objection to plaintiffs\u2019 adoption of Baby D.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">On March 31, 1995, a case management order was entered by the court ordering a paternity test to determine whether Sampson was, in fact, the biological father of Baby D. We glean from the record that either preceding the management conference or during the conference Sampson admitted that he learned of Baby D\u2019s birth on October 22, 1994, while serving a one-year prison sentence in West Virginia for assault. Sampson was released from jail in early-March 1995. Upon his release from jail, Sampson obtained employment in June 1995, and voluntarily commenced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>forwarding support for Baby D. Plaintiffs rejected Sampson\u2019s support payments and those payments have been deposited to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s trust account. After a lengthy discovery process, following the management order, Sampson was confirmed to be the biological father of Baby D.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On June 13, 1995, Sampson filed a motion for visitation with Baby D. Sampson\u2019s motion requested visitation in New Jersey once per month. Plaintiffs and the guardian ad litem appointed by the court to represent Baby D filed objections to this request. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel\u2019s certification stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVEY\">5. Our firm has conducted a preliminary investigation with respect to the criminal background of [Mr. Sampson] and the nature of the offenses in which he has been involved. We have obtained from the Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia, and attached hereto as Exhibit A, the police reports issued by the Wheeling Police Department____ This activity took place approximately one year ago and two months after the child was bom and placed for adoption. These reports are self-evident and constitute <em>prima fade </em>proof that [Mr. Sampson] is a violent, abusive and dangerous person who would pose an extreme emotional and physical threat to the safety of the child. Such evidence also directly refutes his self-serving statement that he is \u201cfit to parent\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">On September 8, 1995, an order for a risk assessment for visitation was entered. The report of the Family Crisis Intervention Unit was submitted September 25,1995, finding that Sampson \u201creadily admits his involvement in domestic violence incidents, but he does not acknowledge the severity of the crimes. He blithely dismissed a brutal attack on another individual as a mistake and excused a stalking complaint because the charges were dismissed.\u201d The assessment concluded that if Sampson were to be granted visitation, it should be supervised. Further, the assessment found Sampson could benefit from a program to assist batterers as well as from a parenting course. Sampson\u2019s motion for visitation was denied.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>On October 15, 1996, plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment arguing that the objection to the adoption filed by Sampson had been untimely as a matter of law. Sampson cross-moved for immediate custody on October 29, 1996. The guardian ad litem for Baby D filed her report on November 6,1996, opining that it was in Baby D\u2019s best interests to remain in the physical custody of plaintiffs. Both motions were denied in a letter opinion dated November 15, 1996. Trial commenced November 19, 1996. As noted, the trial was held over eleven days between November 19, 1996, and January 23, 1997, with the judge rendering her oral opinion on March 27,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">Plaintiffs primary contention is that Sampson\u2019s objection was untimely. Baby D was born on January 31, 1994. Sampson first expressed an interest in Baby D when he telephoned Catholic Charities from jail in mid-November 1994. Thus, plaintiffs contend they were entitled to the statutory presumption of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\">A person who is entitled to notice ... shall have the right to object to the adoption of his child. A judgment of adoption shall not be entered over an objection of a parent communicated to the court by personal appearance or by letter unless the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-9\">(1) that the parent has substantially failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child, although able to do so, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-10\">(2) that the parent is unable to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child and that the parent\u2019s inability to perform those functions is unlikely to change in the immediate future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-11\">The regular and expected functions of care and support of a child shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-12\">(a) the maintenance of a relationship with the child such that the child perceives the person as his parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-13\">(b) communicating with the child or person having legal custody of the child and visiting the child unless visitation is impossible because of the parent\u2019s confinement in an institution, or unless prevented from so doing by the custodial parent or other custodian of the child or a social service agency over the birth parent\u2019s objection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-14\">(c) providing financial support for the child unless prevented from doing so by the custodial parent or other custodian of the child or a social service agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>A parent shall be presumed to have failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support if the court finds that the situation set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) has occurred for six or more months.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">The trial judge concluded that the operative words \u201calthough able to do so\u201d in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l) connote knowledge of a child\u2019s birth, and, therefore, unless a parent has actual knowledge of a child\u2019s birth, the parent cannot have \u201csubstantially failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child.\u201d The trial judge equated failing to perform this obligation with abandonment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Predicated upon the trial judge\u2019s interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3\u2014 46a(l), the trial focused upon these essential issues: when Sampson actually or constructively knew that Todd was pregnant; alternatively, if Sampson did not know, either actually or constructively, that Todd was pregnant, when Sampson actually or constructively learned that Todd had given birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">We need not recount the testimony of the numerous witnesses presented at trial. As noted, the trial judge concluded that Sampson did not actually or constructively know of Todd\u2019s pregnancy or of Baby D\u2019s birth until he was informed by Todd while he was an inmate in a West Virginia jail on October 22, 1994. The trial judge\u2019s conclusion could \u201creasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence in the record\u201d considering \u201cthe proofs as a whole\u201d with due regard to the opportunity of the one who heard the witnesses to judge their credibility. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 161-62, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>9:3-46a(l) does not expressly define the words \u201calthough able to do so.\u201d We have reviewed the legislative history of the amended Adoption Act and find that the legislative history is silent and provides no specific clue as to the Legislature\u2019s specific intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">We discern a basis to interpret the meaning of \u201calthough able to do so\u201d when we compare <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l) with <em>N.J.SA </em>9:3-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>46a(2). As argued by Sampson, subsection (1) deals with willful failure to maintain a parent-child relationship and looks to the conduct of a parent in terms of past conduct; subsection (2) deals with inability to maintain a parent-child relationship that is \u201cunlikely to change in the immediate future.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">It seems quite obvious that where a parent has voiced no objection to an adoption, the parent\u2019s conduct, either past or future, will not be a consideration before the court when asked to approve an agency-placed adoption. Six months from the date of placement, if the adoptive parents are otherwise deemed fit, the adoption will be approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Where a parent does voice an objection, either because the parent has been specifically identified at or before the date of surrender and has been notified of the adoption, or when, as in this case, the parent learns of the birth after the surrender and before the finalization of the adoption, the parent\u2019s past conduct must be scrutinized. If the parent was \u201cunable to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child,\u201d but that inability is likely \u201cto change in the immediate future,\u201d the adoption must be denied. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">Both subsections (1) and (2) require an analysis of a parent\u2019s conduct. Both statutory subsections hinge on a parent\u2019s abilities: subsection (1) on past abilities; subsection (2) on future abilities \u201cimmediate[ly]\u201d commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Where, as here, the trial judge determines that a natural father did not know or have reason to know of the natural mother\u2019s pregnancy, and did not know or have reason to know of the birth of a child he fathered, his parenting conduct or his failure to act as a parent must be evaluated from the time he gained sufficient knowledge which would warrant that he \u201cperform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child,\u201d because it is from that point that he may be deemed to have been \u201cable to do so.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">We are aware of precedent in other jurisdictions which considers a parent\u2019s conduct prior to the birth of a child. <em>See Robert O. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number><em>v. Russell K., </em>80 N.Y.2d 254, 590 <em>N.Y.S.2d </em>37, 604 N.E.2d 99 (1992).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> However, the scheme of New York\u2019s adoption statute permits affirmative action by an unwed father prior to the birth of a child. But even <em>Robert O, </em>as we read that decision, is premised upon knowledge of a pregnancy. We do not reject the concept that pre-birth conduct may be utilized in scrutinizing a parent\u2019s conduct. We simply determine \u25a0 that it is irrelevant in those situations where, as here, the natural father is found by credible evidence in the record to not have actually or constructively known of either the pregnancy or birth of his child prior to learning of that fact before the finalization of the adoption of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The decision in this case does not hinge on the constitutional rights of unwed fathers to notice. <em>See Lehr v. Robertson, </em>463 <em>U.S. </em>248, 103 <em>S.Ct. </em>2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614 (1983); <em>Caban v. Mohammed, </em>441 <em>U.S. </em>380, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>1760, 60 L.Ed.2d 297 (1979); <em>Quilloin v. Walcott, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>246, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>549, 54 L.Ed.2d 511 (1978); <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>645, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551 (1972). Here, Sampson obtained notice. Once his identity was known, he was given the opportunity to object, which he exercised, and presented evidence that, but for his lack of prior notice, he would have been \u201cable\u201d to \u201cperform the regular and expected functions of care and support of the child.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(10).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">We have already noted that immediately upon hearing the trial judge\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law, <em>R. 1:7-4, </em>plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>counsel orally sought a hearing to determine the \u201cbest interests\u201d of Baby D. Plaintiffs\u2019 motion was renewed in writing three days thereafter. The trial judge erroneously denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">In <em>Sorentino I, supra, </em>in an adoption proceeding, the natural mother, then married to the natural father, sought to revoke her pre-marital surrender of a child, predicated upon her contention that her decision to surrender the child for adoption was coerced by an adoption agency. 72 <em>N.J. </em>at 128, 367 A.2d 1168. Despite a finding by the trial court that the mother was coerced, our Supreme Court refused to order a return of the child to the natural parents without an additional investigation to determine the best interests of the child in light of the potential psychological damage inherent in a custody change. <em>Id. </em>at 131-33, 367 A.2d 1168. The Court specifically recognized that a \u201ccourt cannot evade its responsibility, as <em>parens patriae </em>of all minor children, to preserve them from harm,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he possibility of serious psychological harm to the child ... transcends all other considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 132, 367 A.2d 1168 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The child in <em>Sorentino I </em>was then thirty-one months of age and, as of the date of the decision, December 17, 1976, had been residing with the prospective adoptive parents since July 9, 1974. <em>Id. </em>at 128, 367 A.2d 1168. <em>See Sorentino II, supra, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>at 317, 378 A.2d 18. Here, Baby D has been residing in plaintiffs\u2019 home since February 23, 1994. The trial judge, who rendered her oral opinion on March 27, 1997, was compelled to abide by the dictates of <em>Sorentino I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">Our Supreme Court has continued to adhere to its recognition that serious and enduring psychological harm may befall a child when separated from an alternate caretaker. <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth and Family Services v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 512 A.2d 438 (1986) (stating that the potential injury to a child caused by severing his or her attachment to an alternate caretaker may be considered a harm to the child which a parent is unable to eliminate). \u201cIt has been recognized that the psychological aspect of parenthood is more important in terms of development of the child and its mental and emotional health than the coincidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>biological or natural parenthood.\u201d <em>Sees v. Baber, </em>74 <em>N.J. </em>201, 222, 377 A.2d 628 (1977). Further, the Legislature has fully recognized the prospective harm to a child when separated from an alternate caretaker. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-15.1a(2); <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992); <em>In re Guardianship of K.L.F., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>32, 608 A.2d 1327 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">Although the proceedings here were solely within the context of the Adoption Act, the effect of the trial court\u2019s decision as to plaintiffs is akin to a termination of putative parental rights and, most importantly, ignored the potential harm to Baby D. We reject Sampson\u2019s suggestion that <em>Sorentino I </em>is applicable only to contested custody cases. <em>Sorentino I </em>arose in the context of a revocation of the surrender of a child for adoption. Although the natural mother sought custody of her child who she had placed for adoption, the ultimate decision of the court, both in <em>Sorentino I, </em>and thereafter in <em>Sorentino II, </em>was an analysis steeped in precedent in cases having root under the rubric of adoption, termination of parental rights, and custody. Pervading each case is the need to address the best interests of the child. Ignoring that issue by denying plaintiffs\u2019 post-oral decision motion which sought a \u201cbest interests\u201d hearing was plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">We remand to the Family Part for a hearing to be concluded by April 1, 1998, on the issue of whether transferring the custody of Baby D to his natural father will raise the probability of serious harm to Baby D. In accord with <em>Sorentino I, supra, </em>and paraphrasing the Court, 72 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 367 A.2d 1168, Sampson will have the burden of proving by a preponderance of the credible evidence that the potentiality for serious psychological harm accompanying or resulting from such a move will not become a reality. The Assignment Judge of Somerset County shall immediately assign this remand hearing to another judge assigned to the Family Part.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To assure objectivity, the trial judge, in his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>discretion, may appoint an impartial expert witness.
