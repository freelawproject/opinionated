Although phrased in a variety of ways, T.S. contends that the Family Part\u2019s findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>relating to parental unfitness were not supported by clear and convincing evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">We need not describe the procedural history in detail. T.S. and J.H. are the unmarried birth parents of M.R., who was born on August 11, 1994. After J.H. expressed her willingness to surrender her parental rights to M.R., the prospective adoptive parents filed a complaint for adoption. T.S. filed an objection to the adoption. His parents moved to intervene. Following the denial of their motion for intervention, T.S.\u2019s parents filed an emergent appeal. We ordered the Family Part to proceed with a hearing respecting whether T.S.\u2019s parental rights could be terminated over his objection. We directed that T.S.\u2019s parents be afforded an opportunity to renew their application for intervention before consideration of other substantive issues relevant to custody, guardianship or adoption. Following a protracted hearing, the Family Part entered a judgment terminating T.S.\u2019s parental rights. T.S. appealed. We now affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">The essential facts are not in dispute. T.S. and J.H. met in June of 1993. In December of that year, J.H. learned she was pregnant and so advised T.S. Although T.S. expressed interest in the prospect of becoming a father, he was heavily addicted to synthetic heroin, cocaine, marijuana and alcohol and was unemployed. T.S.\u2019s problems with narcotics had begun in his early teenage years, and despite J.H.\u2019s repeated entreaties, continued throughout their relationship. Moreover, T.S. had a substantial criminal record, having been convicted of several armed robberies and weapons offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">In February 1994, T.S. was incarcerated in the county jail. As a condition of his release, T.S. entered a drug treatment program. T.S. admitted to J.H. that he continued to use drugs while in that program, and that he found a way to circumvent the drug tests that were administered. After his completion of the rehabilitation program, T.S. was briefly employed, but used the money he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>earned to purchase drugs and was fired. We add that T.S.\u2019s employment history can fairly be characterized as negligible. T.S. was fired from six different jobs within a seven month period. T.S. never set aside any money for his daughter. Although J.H. worked until June of 1994, she ultimately found it necessary to receive welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">J.H. went into labor on August 10, 1994. Although T.S. agreed to drive J.H. to the hospital, he did not appear and was not present when the baby was born. He admitted the reason he was not present was because he was taking drugs. We note that the weekend before J.H. went into labor, T.S. had borrowed her car, but had never returned it. After the baby was born, the automobile was recovered, but it had been totally destroyed. J.H. and the baby resided with J.H.\u2019s parents. When her parents were away, J.H. invited T.S. to spend a weekend with her in order to establish a relationship between him and the baby. When J.H. awoke the next morning, T.S. had left the house with her father\u2019s automobile in order to purchase drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">In September 1994, T.S. was incarcerated for a parole violation. Although professing to seek rehabilitation, T.S. chose to go to prison when offered the opportunity to enter a work therapy program. While incarcerated, T.S. repeatedly requested J.H. to visit him with their daughter. J.H. acceded to T.S.\u2019s request on one occasion, but otherwise refused because she felt that the jail was not an appropriate atmosphere for child visitation. We digress to note that T.S. rarely sought to visit his daughter even when he was not incarcerated and able to do so. J.H. testified that M.R. did not recognize T.S. as her father.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">While T.S. was in prison, J.H. decided to surrender her parental rights to M.R. Although T.S.\u2019s parents had taken a keen interest in the child and had attended to her material needs, J.H. came to the conclusion that adoption was in the best interests of M.R. When she broached the subject, T.S. indicated in a letter that he would agree although he did not \u201cwant [his] daughter to be raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>by ... strangers.\u201d Upon his release from prison, however, T.S. expressed his dissatisfaction with the planned adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The problem became more complicated upon T.S.\u2019s subsequent arrest for breaking into his parents\u2019 home and stealing his father\u2019s guns. T.S.\u2019s relationship with his parents had long been strained and volatile. T.S. had worked for his father for brief periods, but his drug addiction precluded continued employment. Upon T.S.\u2019s latest arrest for theft of the weapons, his parents obtained a domestic violence order prohibiting any contact. On December 9, 1996, T.S. pled guilty to third degree theft. He was incarcerated at the time this appeal was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">Dr. Arlene Bruskin conducted a psychological evaluation of T.S. at the Family Part\u2019s request. She testified that T.S. was not functionally competent to act as a parent. According to Dr. Bruskin, T.S.\u2019s \u201chistory of oppositional behavior manifested in drug abuse, school problems, antisocial actions, and frequent job changes\u201d disclosed an underlying immaturity that would prevent him from raising M.R. without substantial risk. In her interview with T.S., he appeared \u201cangry, defensive, deficient in empathy and preoccupied with issues of dependency [and] autonomy which relate[d] to his self esteem.\u201d The \u201ctest data suggested]\u201d that T.S. \u201coverestimates his abilities\u201d and that \u201chis independent judgment [is] below average.\u201d The witness noted that T.S. intended to rely substantially on his parents\u2019 assistance if ultimately granted custody. She stressed, however, that T.S.\u2019s volatile behavior would inevitably place him in conflict with his parents concerning issues of child care. Moreover, T.S.\u2019s \u201cunresolved emotional\u201d problems would likely influence his discipline of M.R. as she matured. Dr. Bruskin added that T.S. was emotionally immature, his insight was poor, and his desire for stabilization solely through his own efforts appeared highly unrealistic.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">The witness discounted the possibility that T.S. would improve if psychotherapy was provided. Dr. Bruskin noted that T.S. regarded psychotherapy as \u201cwitchcraft\u201d and a \u201ccomplete waste of time.\u201d T.S. confided to Dr. Bruskin that while in prison, he had attended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>several therapy sessions in order to \u201clook good\u201d and further his chance of parole. However, his attitude and emotional state made him a poor candidate for rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">The Family Part issued an extensive written opinion in which it found that T.S. was unfit to act in a parental role. In reaching this conclusion, the court determined that T.S. was \u201cunable to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support,\u201d and that his incapacity was \u201cunlikely to change in the immediate future.\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:8-46a(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Parents have a constitutionally protected, fundamental liberty interest in raising their biological children. <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>745, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982). The Federal and State Constitutions protect the inviolability of the family unit. <em>Stanley v. Illinois, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>645, 651, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1208, 1212-13, 31 L.Ed.2d 551, 558-59 (1972); <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth and Family Serv. v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>591, 599, 512 A.2d 438 (1986). The law\u2019s concept of the family \u201crests on a presumption that parents possess what a child lacks in maturity, experience, and capacity for judgment required for making life\u2019s difficult decisions.\u201d <em>Parham v. J.R., </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>584, 602, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2493, 2504, 61 L.Ed.2d 101, 118 (1979). As is true of so many other legal presumptions, \u201cexperience and reality may rebut what the law accepts as a starting point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>at 602, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2504, 61 L.Ed.2d at 119. The incidence of child abuse and neglect eases attests to the fact that some parents may act against the interests of their children. <em>Ibid. </em>Government \u201cis not without constitutional control over parental discretion in dealing with children when their physical or mental health is jeopardized.\u201d <em>Id. </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>at 603, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2504, 61 L.Ed.2d at 119 (citing <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 <em>U.S. </em>205, 230, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>1526, 1540, 32 L.Ed.2d 15, 33 (1972)). The State as <em>parens patriae </em>may act to protect children from serious physical and emotional harm. This may require a partial or complete severance of the parent-child relationship. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>\u201c[f]ew forms of state action are both so severe and so irreversible.\u201d <em>Santosky v. Kramer, </em>455 <em>U.S. </em>at 759, 102 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1398, 71 L.Ed.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">When the child\u2019s biological parent resists termination of parental rights, our function is to decide whether the parent can raise the child without causing harm. <em>In re Guardianship of J.C., </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>1, 10, 608 A.2d 1312 (1992). The cornerstone of our inquiry is not whether the parent is fit, but whether he can become fit to assume the parental role within time to meet the child\u2019s needs. <em>Ibid. </em>\u201cThe analysis of harm entails strict standards to protect the statutory and constitutional rights of the natural parents.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The burden rests on the party seeking to terminate parental rights \u201cto demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that risk of \u201cserious and lasting [future] harm to the child\u201d is sufficiently great as to require severance of parental ties. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">The question focuses upon what course serves the \u201cbest interests\u201d of the child. The law does not require ideal parents. The State has no roving commission to search for individuals who, by reason of temperament, wealth or situation, would better raise the child if afforded the opportunity. The issue instead, is whether, recognizing the frailties of humankind, the birth parent can substantially perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">That is the criterion expressly set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46. That section provides that \u201c[a] judgment of adoption shall not be entered over an objection of a parent ... unless the court finds:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-8\">(1) that the parent has substantially failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child, although able to do so, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-9\">(2) that the parent is unable to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child and that the parent\u2019s inability to perform those functions is unlikely to change in the immediate future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-10\">The regular and expected functions of care and support of a child shall include the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b413-11\">(a) the maintenance of a relationship with the child such that the child perceives the person as his parent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>(b) communicating with the child or person having legal custody of the child and visiting the child unless visitation is impossible because of the parent\u2019s confinement in an institution, or unless prevented from so doing by the custodial parent or other custodian of the child or a social service agency over the birth parent\u2019s objection; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-4\">(c) providing financial support for the child unless prevented from doing so by the custodial parent or other custodian of the child or a social service agency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">A parent shall be presumed to have failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child if the court finds that the situation set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) has occurred for six or more months.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Although T.S.\u2019s arguments are couched in terms of attacking the Family Part\u2019s factual findings, they are premised upon an interpretation of the statute with which we disagree. T.S. contends that termination of parental rights is impermissible in any case in which the parent is able to perform any one of the three \u201cregular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child\u201d listed in the statute even if he is unable to perform the other two parental functions specified. He asserts that the party seeking severance of parental ties must establish the parent\u2019s inability to perform all three of the \u201cregular and expected parental functions of care and support of the child\u201d listed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">T.S.\u2019s interpretation of the statute is wholly at odds with the statutory language. The \u201cregular and expected\u201d parental functions listed by the statute are stated in the disjunctive. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>262 <em>N.J.Super. </em>487, 506, 621 A.2d 493 (App.Div.) (\u201c[w]hen items in a list are joined by a comma or semicolon, with an \u2018or\u2019 preceding the last item, the items are disjunctive.\u201d), <em>certif. denied, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>476, 634 A. 2d 523 (1993). Further, the Legislature\u2019s use of the word \u201cinclude\u201d indicates that the list of \u201cregular and expected\u201d parental functions was not intended to be all-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>inclusive. The statutory language clearly belies T.S.\u2019s argument that each parental function listed is to be considered as a hermetically sealed watertight compartment without reference to the overall welfare of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">Moreover, T.S.\u2019s construction of the statute defies common sense. Were we to adopt T.S.\u2019s interpretation, the Family Part would be barred from severing parental ties where the person resisting termination is able to provide financial support, but unable to communicate with the child and maintain a relationship in which the child perceives the person as his parent. Similarly, a person able to communicate with the child, but unable to provide financial support and maintain a parental relationship could resist termination despite the clear and present danger posed to the child. And finally, a person able to maintain a parental relationship with a child, but unable to communicate or provide financial support would have an unbreakable right to raise the child regardless of the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">We read the statute consonant with the legislative purpose to prevent harm to the child for which there is \u201cunambiguous and universal social condemnation.\u201d <em>New Jersey Div. of Youth and Family Serv. v. A.W., </em>103 <em>N.J. </em>at 604, 512 A.2d 438. In setting forth a list of \u201cregular and expected parental functions,\u201d the Legislature attempted to identify the core values of parenthood, <em>ie., </em>the essential ingredients of the parental role. We do not suggest that a person\u2019s inability to perform any one of these functions necessarily incapacitates that individual from acting as a good parent. For example, a person\u2019s inability to provide adequate financial support, standing alone, should not be the basis for severing parental ties. The hallmark of an effective parent has never been his or her bank account, because we know that children can be and often are loved and nurtured in poverty-stricken families. Conversely, the ability to provide financial support, standing alone, cannot bar the State from intervening to prevent serious harm to the child, because we know that children can be and sometimes are neglected in affluent homes. Against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>this backdrop, we believe the legislative intent was to establish several key parental standards upon which the parental abilities of the person resisting termination are to be measured. The Legislature did not intend to bar termination of parental rights merely because the parent is able to perform one or more of the parental functions listed. Nor was it the legislative design to compel automatically the severance of parental ties because a person is unable to perform one or more of the parental obligations set forth in the statute. Instead, termination hinges upon whether continuation of the parental relationship would place the child in imminent danger of serious harm, and the standards listed in the statute are to be considered within that context. <em>See In re Adoption of a Child by R.K., </em>303 <em>N.J.Super. </em>182, 196, 696 A.2d 116 (Ch.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The record amply supports the Family Part\u2019s conclusion that continuation of T.S.\u2019s parental relationship would place M.R. in substantial jeopardy. T.S.\u2019s chronic addiction to drugs is well documented. Although T.S. likens his addiction to a disease such as cancer, we perceive a volitional aspect in his unwillingness to obtain treatment. We offer no moral judgments. In drawing a line between the sick and the bad, there is no purpose to subject others to harm at the hands of the addicted, and there can be no doubt but that T.S.\u2019s abuse of drugs poses a serious risk to the health, safety and welfare of M.R.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">So too, the fact that T.S. has lived a life of crime tends to negate his commitment to parental responsibilities. T.S.\u2019s life has been punctuated by lengthy periods of incarceration. These lengthy custodial terms and the underlying crimes that gave rise to incarceration are \u201crelevant in determining whether parental rights should be terminated, because [they] bear on parental unfitness.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Children by L.A.S., </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>127, 143, 631 A.2d 928 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Finally, T.S.\u2019s longstanding psychological problems and his unwillingness to genuinely seek psychological treatment make it highly unlikely that he can fulfill the parental responsibility to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>provide nurture and emotional support, to offer guidance, advice and instruction and to maintain a parental relationship with M.R. As noted by Dr. Bruskin, T.S.\u2019s volatile relationship with his parents would place him in conflict concerning issues of child care, and thus their ability to assist in raising M.R. would inevitably be subverted.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of termination is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b414-8\"> The Family Part rejected the adoptive parents' contention that T.S. had substantially failed to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(l). We have no occasion to consider whether or not the court was correct in reaching this conclusion. Our disposition of the issues raised is confined to the Family Part\u2019s finding that T.S. is unable to perform the regular and expected parental functions of care and support under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:3-46a(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
