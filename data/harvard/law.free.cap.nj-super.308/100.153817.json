(temporarily assigned).</author>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">J.N. is a thirteen-year-old profoundly disabled child suffering from neurological impairment, blindness and incontinence. He requires twenty-four hour care. Without question, because of his disabilities, he is entitled to a free education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 1400-1491o and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1, to be paid for by the Board of Education of his domicile.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">Even though J.N. has resided with his maternal grandparents in East Brunswick for his entire life, defendant East Brunswick Board of Education (East Brunswick) petitioned the Commissioner of Education challenging J.N.\u2019s domicile. East Brunswick asserted that the obligation to pay for J.N.\u2019s education was the responsibility of the Edison Township Board of Education (Edison) because J.N.\u2019s mother, plaintiff J.H.R. moved to Edison Township with her new husband. Even after plaintiffs marriage, J.N. continued to remain in East Brunswick.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Not content with simply resolving the issue of domicile as between East Brunswick and Edison, East Brunswick added another count to its petition \u2014 it sought reimbursement of tuition from plaintiff in the event Edison was determined to be responsible for the cost of J.N.\u2019s education.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As a result of this challenge and her exposure to the loss of J.N.\u2019s benefits under IDEA, plaintiff retained counsel and successfully defended East Brunswick\u2019s challenge before the Office of Administrative Law (OAL). Plaintiff incurred $15,000 in legal fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>The OAL found that J.N. was domiciled in East Brunswick and that East Brunswick was responsible for the cost of J.N.\u2019s education. The Commissioner of Education affirmed in December 1995. Thereafter, in May 1996, plaintiff commenced an action in the Law Division seeking reimbursement for attorneys\u2019 fees necessitated by plaintiffs defense of East Brunswick\u2019s claim for tuition reimbursement. East Brunswick filed a motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint. Judge Douglas Wolfson in the Law Division denied defendant\u2019s motion. Thereafter, plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment which Judge Wolfson granted and awarded attorneys\u2019 fees. East Brunswick appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We conclude that 1) East Brunswick\u2019s action for tuition reimbursement from plaintiff places in issue J.N.\u2019s right to a free education under IDEA; 2) the Superior Court has concurrent jurisdiction with the federal court to adjudicate fee actions under IDEA; and 3) plaintiffs claim was timely filed. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">In the proceedings before the OAL, the parties stipulated the relevant facts which we repeat:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-9\">J.N. was born on May 14, 1984, and since his birth, J.N. has lived with his maternal grandparents in East Brunswick. [Plaintiff] lived with her parents in East Brunswick when her son was born and she continued to live there until she remarried and moved to Edison in September 1993. J.N. continues to live with his maternal grandparents in East Brunswick while his mother and stepfather <em>live </em>in Edison.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-10\">J.N. has multiple disabilities. He is neurologically impaired, blind and incontinent, which requires him to wear diapers. He has a kidney disease called renal tubular acidosis which requires medical care including daily medicine. J.N. needs twenty-four-hour care.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-11\">J.N. is a classified student in the [East Brunswick\u2019s] school district, and has attended the Lakeview School in Edison since 1987. [East Brunswick] provides transportation to the school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-12\">[Plaintiff] is in the U.S. Army Reserves on active duty. She has had personal medical problems since March 1992 and she may need further hospitalization and an operation. [Plaintiffs] husband is employed as a full-time superintendent for a garden apartment complex (approximately 900 apartments) in Edison and his job requires him to live on site and be on twenty-four-hour call. Although financially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>[plaintiff] and her husband can support J.N., they cannot give him the extensive care he needs. According to [plaintiff], there are no day-eare centers that will accept J.N. because of his problems. [Plaintiff] visits her son at her parents\u2019 home and sometimes takes him to Edison for the weekend or on trips.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">As stated, J.N. lives with his maternal grandparents, and they provide him with twenty-four-hour care. J.N.\u2019s school states that all of its contacts are with his grandparents; the grandparents have nurtured the child and provided all additional home instruction and therapy. The grandparents also support J.N., except that J.N.\u2019s medical, prescription drug and dental bills are.covered by his parents\u2019 insurance policies. [Plaintiff] pays for some of J.N.\u2019s clothes and his diapers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-5\">[Plaintiff] is divorced from J.N.\u2019s father and she has custody of their son. J.N.\u2019s father contributes support payments which [plaintiff] puts into a bank account for J.N. [Plaintiff] has given her mother a power of attorney to take care of her son.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">[Plaintiff] claimed her son as a dependent on her 1993 federal and state income tax forms. J.N. was claimed as a dependent by his maternal grandparents on their 1994 federal and state income tax forms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-7\">When the East Brunswick Board found out in October 1994 that J.N. was living with his grandparents and his mother was living in Edison, it requested that [plaintiff] and her mother, P.H., complete its standard affidavit forms for pupils living apart from parents. The Brunswick Board initially received forms that were not signed, not notarized and not submitted in a timely manner. Representatives of the Brunswick Board met with [plaintiff] and P.H. regarding the domicile of J.N. on February 16,1995.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">Based on these facts, the OAL made conclusions of law which were adopted by the Commissioner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">I agree with the arguments of [plaintiff] and the Edison Board and I CONCLUDE that the Brunswick Board is responsible for the free public education of J.N. pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S. A </em>18A:38 \u2014 1(b)(1)- J-N. and his grandparents meet the criteria set forth in this statute. It was clearly established by the facts that J.N.\u2019s grandparents are domiciled within East Brunswick\u2019s school district and have assumed all the obligations for J.N. relative to his school requirements, and that J.N. is not residing with them solely for the purpose of receiving a free public education in [East Brunswick], Pursuant to the provisions of <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38 \u2014 1(b) (1), it is not necessary that J.N.\u2019s grandparents provide all of the financial support for J.N. gratis, and the facts in this case show that the grandparents do provide a substantial portion of the financial support for J.N. Also pursuant to the statute, I CONCLUDE that J.N.\u2019s mother is not capable of providing care for him due to family hardship. [East Brunswick\u2019s] suggestion that [plaintiff] can secure day care for J.N. is unrealistic in light of his needs, and the facts clearly show that J.N. is living with his grandparents because of his disabilities and not simply for the convenience of his mother.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-10\">... J.N. lives with his grandparents because of his needs and not for the convenience of his grandparents____ [C]ustody is not a requirement pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A38-l(b)(l). As to [East Brunswick\u2019s] argument regarding the domi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>cile of [plaintiff], I agree that J.R.\u2019s plans to move back to East Brunswick are vague and that she is currently domiciled in Edison.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The Commissioner adopted the findings and conclusions of the OAL and affirmed in December 1995. Neither party filed an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Plaintiff filed this independent action for attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the fee-shifting provisions of 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(B) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.1997) (the fee-shifting statute). Plaintiff claimed that by seeking tuition reimbursement under these facts, East Brunswick had implicated IDEA. She asserted that she met the statutory threshold requirement of \u201cprevailing party.\u201d East Brunswick first challenged the applicability of IDEA. Thereafter, East Brunswick asserted that the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to consider a federal statutory claim for attorneys\u2019 fees. Finally, it claimed that plaintiffs action for fees was filed out of time. The trial judge disagreed with East Brunswick, as do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">We first address the issue of whether this matter falls within the scope of IDEA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> IDEA is designed to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education. <em>Smith v. Indianapolis Public Schools, </em>916 <em>F.Supp. </em>872 (S.D.Ind.1995). Congress has stated that the purpose of IDEA is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">to assure that all children with disabilities have available to them ... a free appropriate public education, which emphasizes special education and related services designed to meet their unique needs, to assure that the rights of children with disabilities and their parents or guardians are protected, to assist States and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>localities to provide for the education of all children with disabilities, and to assess and assure the effectiveness of efforts to educate children with disabilities. <em>m U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1400(c) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1400(d) (Supp.1997).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">In <em>In re the Adoption of Amendments to N.J.AC. 6:28-2.10, 3.6 and 1.3, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>389, 702 A.2d 838 (App.Div.1997), <em>(In re Amendments), </em>we recently commented on the relationship between the federal and state roles in implementing IDEA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">The IDEA (formerly the Education of All Handicapped children Act (EAHCA)), provides federal money to assist states and local agencies in educating handicapped children. <em>Hendrick Hudson Dist.

As such, it has enacted legislation, <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:46-1 to -46, and adopted regulations, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-1.1 to -12.1, that assure all handicapped children the right to a free appropriate public education (FAPE) as required by the IDEA <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-l.l(b)(l).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2U\"><em>[In re Amendments, supra, </em>305 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 394, 702 A.2d 838 <em>see also Rabinowitz v.

Under the New Jersey regulations, when parents of a handicapped child are dissatisfied with his or her education, they have the right to request a mediation conference, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-2.6, or to request a due-process hearing, <em>N.J.AC. </em>6:28-2.7.

Under that subsection, \u201c[i]f in the judgment of the board of education the evidence does not support the validity of the claim by the resident, the board may deny admission to the child\u201d and collect an assessment of tuition from the resident. However, the resident has the right to contest that decision to the Commissioner and \u201c[n]o child shall be denied admission during the pendency of\u2019 such proceedings. <em>Ibid. </em>If the evidence does not support the claim of the resident, then the Commissioner shall impose a pro-rated assessment of tuition against such residents. Generally, where an alleged handicapped child who falls within the protection of IDEA is involved, the issue is not that of residence but rather whether the child is disabled and, thus, qualifies for benefits under IDEA. <em>See, e.g., J.M. v. Freehold Tp. Bd. of Educ., </em>95 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(Eds) 133, 1995 WL 373335 (1995) (Petitioner was not eligible for Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE) under IDEA because the ALJ determined that petitioner\u2019s educational problems resulted from his drug abuse, not a mental or physical disability.); <em>B.B. v. Hillsborough Bd. of Educ., </em>94 <em>N.J.A.R.2d </em>(Eds) 71, 1994 WL 406538 (1994) (ALJ ruled that rebellious child (petitioner) did not qualify as educationally disabled and, thus, petitioner\u2019s parents were not eligible for tuition reimbursement and assessment costs under IDEA.). Unlike these cases where the issue of disability is contested, J.N.\u2019s physical circumstances precluded any dispute as to his eligibility for relief under IDEA and <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-1. The only question should have been which school board was going to pay for J.N.\u2019s education.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The scope of the dispute was considerably expanded by East Brunswick because East Brunswick not only raised the question of which board had to pay but asserted a right to reimbursement by plaintiff. Thus, the question was raised as to whether, because of the dispute between two competing school boards, J.N. would be deprived of a free education. East Brunswick suggests that this is, nevertheless, not a dispute falling within the scope of IDEA, and, absent such nexus, plaintiff is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The fee-shifting provision of IDEA under which plaintiff brings her claim provides: \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this subsection, the court, in its discretion, may award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees as part of the costs to the parents or guardian of a child or youth with a disability who is the prevailing party.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The right to recover attorneys\u2019 fees under the fee-shifting statute extends to actions or proceedings which have been heard and resolved, as here, in administrative proceedings. <em>Moore v. District of Columbia, </em>907 F.2d 165 (D.C.Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>498 <em>U.S. </em>998, 111 <em>S.Ct. </em>556, 112 L.Ed.2d 563 (1990), <em>Field v. Haddonfield Bd. of Educ., </em>769 <em>F.Supp. </em>1313 (D.N.J.1991). The right of recovery of fees belongs to the parents who are the \u201cprevailing parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">In determining the applicability of IDEA, we must first decide whether plaintiffs participation in the OAL action as respondent defending against a claim for tuition implicates IDEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\"><em>In Roxbury Tp. Bd. of Educ. v. West Milford Bd. of Educ., </em>283 <em>N.J.Super. </em>505, 662 A.2d 976 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>N.J. </em>325, 670 A.2d 1066 (1996), we considered whether a \u201cdue process\u201d action by a parent involving the emergent relief authority of the Department of Education to compel a school district to accept responsibility for an autistic child\u2019s education fell within the scope of IDEA, where the ultimate dispute was between competing school boards. Emergent relief was necessary because, unlike here, the school refused to keep the child enrolled during the pendency of the dispute. All parties agreed that the parents\u2019 emergent application fell within the scope of IDEA. After the school the child was attending agreed to maintain the child during the dispute between school boards, the parents withdrew their emergent application. As here, the issue then became a dispute between school boards as to which was required to pay. We affirmed the Law Division\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the parents pursuant to the fee-shifting statute. We noted, in dictum, that \u201c[e]ven if the only issue remaining before the ALJ was the question of which board(s) was (were) financially responsible, that issue by itself is sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of IDEA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 517, 662 A.2d 976 (footnote omitted), citing <em>Rabinowitz v. New Jersey State Bd. of Educ., </em>550 <em>F.Supp. </em>481 (D.N.J.1982). But, here, as in <em>Roxbury, </em>more was in issue than simply the child\u2019s domicile and <em>which </em>school board was responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">By joining plaintiff as a respondent and seeking the relief of assessment of tuition against her, East Brunswick placed J.N.\u2019s right to a free education in issue. East Brunswick claims that instead of simply denying school attendance to J.N., as it has the right to do under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>18A:38-1, it petitioned the Commissioner, permitted J.N. to continue to attend Lakeview and continued to pay for the costs of his education. Thus, it claims that it never denied the child a free public education during the pendency of its petition. It had also joined Edison as a respondent to its petition because, it asserts, that Edison would have been responsible to pay for J.N.\u2019s education in the event the child was deemed to reside with his mother in Edison.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>It is true that East Brunswick did not seek to avoid payment of J.N.\u2019s education during the pendency of the action; nevertheless, it did choose to join plaintiff as a respondent and assert a claim against her as a respondent. In these circumstances, we conclude that East Brunswick\u2019s actions were gratuitous. J.N.\u2019s need for an education protected by IDEA was never an issue and the right of J.N. to have a free education paid for by one of the school boards should never have been an issue. East Brunswick, by joining plaintiff, made it an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">Either East Brunswick or Edison was going to bear responsibility for the cost of J.N.\u2019s education. Plaintiff could have been spared the necessity of defending a costly administrative proceeding by a stipulation that one board or the other would ultimately be responsible for the cost of education. If East Brunswick understood J.N.\u2019s needs and rights, it need only have availed itself of the procedure we described in <em>Roxbury:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">If West Milford desired to relieve J.K.\u2019s parents of the financial burden of participating in the OAL hearing, it could have stipulated that J.K\u2019s placement costs would be paid, with the question of allocation between the boards to await the outcome of a contested case hearing before the Commissioner, and it could have withdrawn that portion of its ... letter in which it questioned the appropriateness of J.K.\u2019s residential placement. That was not done, and, thus we find nothing in the record that relieved the parents of the challenge presented to them by West Milford\u2019s letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\"><em>[Id. </em>at 516-17, 662 A.2d 976]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">We conclude that by joining plaintiff as a defendant and seeking tuition reimbursement where no question existed as to an IDEA protected education, East Brunswick implicated IDEA and its protections in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">East Brunswick suggests that implicating IDEA and ultimately awarding attorneys\u2019 fees when a school board contests domicile would \u201cchill\u201d a school board\u2019s willingness to legitimately challenge those who are not properly domiciled in a school district. The flaw in East Brunswick\u2019s argument is that such concerns are illusory, for there is no fee-shifting provision in <em>N.J.S.A </em>18A:38-1. Challenges to a student\u2019s domicile, absent IDEA, would not, under ordinary circumstances, expose a school board to fees. When one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>challenges a student protected by IDEA, Congress has made a policy decision that, indeed, does expose such contest to the potential of fee-shifting. Congress recognized that benefits and protections had to be afforded handicapped children and their parents to insure that these children receive a quality education. The fee-shifting provision reflects Congress\u2019 intent that parties, including school boards, exhibit a chariness in challenging the rights of those protected by the statute. The fee-shifting provision and the broad application of the scope of IDEA are consistent not only with the Congressional objectives when the statute was originally promulgated, but also to ensure its continued vitality as a guardian of educational benefits for handicapped children. As noted in the legislative history appended to the most recent amendments to IDEA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-5\">In its 22 year life span, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act has achieved many of the important goals it sought to achieve. Children with disabilities are for the most part well served in America\u2019s public and private school and are guaranteed the right in every State and outlying area to a free appropriate public education by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">The IDEA has been a very successful law. Prior to its implementation, approximately 1 million children with disabilities were denied education. The number of children with developmental disabilities in State institutions has declined by close to 90 percent. The number of young adults with disabilities enrolled in postseeondary education has tripled, and the unemployment rate for individuals with disabilities in their twenties is almost half that of their older counterparts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">[H.R. 95, 105th Cong., at 84 (1997), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1997 at 78, 81.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">In order to achieve these objectives and meet these goals, Congress was required to balance the competing interests of the school board in protecting the rights of the taxpayers and the interests of the parents of a disabled child in insuring that the rights afforded by IDEA to both parents and children are protected. Congress acted to insure that the nature, cost and location of a handicapped child\u2019s education are comparable to every other child in a local system.

While the majority of courts required that a party succeed on a significant issue and receive some of the relief sought in the lawsuit, <em>see, e.g., Fast v. School Dist. [of City of Ladue], </em>723 [728] <em>F.2d </em>1030,1032-33 (8th Cir.1984) (ere banc), the Court of Appeals for the Fifth and Eleventh Circuits applied a narrower test, requiring that a party succeed on the central issue in the litigation and achieve the primary relief sought. <em>See, e.g., Simien v. San Antonio, </em>809 F.2d 255, 258 (5th Cir.1987).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">The Court in <em>Garland </em>adopted the former, \u201cless demanding\u201d test and noted that \u201cthe <em>degree </em>of the plaintiff\u2019s success in relation to the other goals of the lawsuit is a factor critical to the determination of the size of a reasonable fee, not to eligibility for a fee award at all.\u201d <em>Garland, </em>489 <em>U.S. </em>at 790, 109 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1492 (emphasis in original)(citing <em>Hensley v.

Additionally, the legislative history of IDEA both under its present name and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the Education of the Handicapped Act (EHA), warrants the same conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">As enacted in 1975, IDEA contained no fee-shifting provisions and, in fact, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(A) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(A) (Supp.1997), originally 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4) (1975), was simply a general jurisdiction provision of the statute. While the district court, without question, maintained jurisdiction over cases involving federal questions, \u201cthe amount in controversy\u201d was an issue requiring congressional attention. Until 1980, there did not exist a \u201cminimum amount in controversy\u201d requirement for district court jurisdiction over federal question eases. <em>See Historical and Statutory Notes, </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415 (1986) As noted, the EHA renamed IDEA in 1990, was enacted in 1975 and originally contained the text of 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(A) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(A) (Supp.1997), as simply \u00a7 (e)(4). <em>See Historical and Statutory Notes, </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415 (1986). Subsequently, in 1986, the Act was amended, adding the fee-shifting statute, along with several other amendments dealing with attorneys\u2019 fees, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(C) to (G) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(C) to (G) (Supp.1997), and redesignating the jurisdictional provision from \u201c(e)(4)\u201d to \u201c(e)(4)(A).\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Thus, at the time IDEA was enacted, \u201c(e)(4)\u201d eliminated any \u201cminimum amount in controversy\u201d issue as a condition precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction by the federal courts over IDEA cases. This jurisdictional provision long pre-dated any congressional action regarding fee-shifting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">An interpretation limiting jurisdiction of the fee-shifting provisions to the federal courts makes little practical sense.

Nothing in the language of the statute, legislative history or common sense compels such a result.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">To the extent that <em>Zipperer v. School Bd. of Seminole County, Fla., </em>111 F.3d 847, 851-52 (11th Cir.1997); <em>J.B. v. Essex-Caledonia Supervisory Union, </em>943 <em>F.Supp. </em>387, 390 (D.Vt.1996); and <em>Curtis K v. Sioux City Community Sch.

We consider the flaw in the reasoning leading to such holding to be a misreading of the relationship of jurisdictional provisions \u2014 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(A) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(A) (Supp.1997) and the fee-shifting statute. As we noted earlier, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4) (1975), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(A) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.1997), predates the 1986 amendment to the statute creating the fee-shifting provision. At the time of the enactment of the jurisdiction provision, Congress could not have intended its application to a not yet adopted fee-shifting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">Additionally, the language in the fee-shifting statute, \u201c[i]n any action or proceeding brought under this subsection\u201d refers to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>action or proceeding brought pursuant to 20 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 1415(e). This is the only \u201caction or proceeding\u201d in which a court is involved.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus, during the court \u201caction or proceeding\u201d contemplated by 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (Supp.1997) (an action which is cognizable in either state or federal court), a court after a determination of the rights of the parties and an adjudication of the appeal from the proceedings may award attorneys\u2019 fees as part of that action or proceeding. <em>See, e.g., Roxbury Tp. Bd. of Educ. v. West Milford Bd. of Educ., supra. </em>To conclude otherwise would negate any significance to the phrase <em>\u201cin </em>any action or proceeding\u201d (emphasis added). <em>See R. </em>l:4-8(d) authorizing the award of fees for frivolous actions which mandates that the issue be raised \u201cin the action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The result should be no different where, as here, a litigant seeks to enforce his or her rights under the fee-shifting statute, and no \u201caction or proceeding\u201d is pending thus empowering the trial judge in the 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(2) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (Supp.1997) action from first determining the respective rights of the parties and then awarding attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the fee-shifting statute. Judicial economy and efficiency demand no less.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">We conclude that the state court shares concurrent jurisdiction with the federal court in considering an application for attorneys\u2019 fees under the fee-shifting statute. We further conclude that a prevailing party under this section may maintain in an independent action in the state court to enforce a right to attorneys\u2019 fees incurred in the successful defense of administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">East Brunswick argues that plaintiff is barred from recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees because her application was untimely. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Commissioner\u2019s decision was rendered on December 12, 1995 and the complaint for attorneys\u2019 fees was filed on May 1,1996. Judge Wolfson rejected East Brunswick\u2019s argument that plaintiff should have filed the application within thirty days, concluding that plaintiff \u201ccould not file [her] request for attorneys\u2019 fees until the appeal period expires, because [she\u2019s] not a successful prevailing party until [she\u2019s] won, and all avenues of appeal are exhausted.\u201d While we cannot subscribe to the view that plaintiffs status as a \u201cprevailing party\u201d was perfected only after the appeal time had run, we do agree that there was no thirty-day limitation period on plaintiffs cause of action for fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">The fee-shifting statute does not provide a limitations period for the filing of such actions. Where no limitation period is set forth in a federal statute, the federal courts will \u201cborrow\u201d and apply the most analogous local time limitation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Zipperer v.

Indiana Dep\u2019t. of Educ., </em>61 <em>F.3d </em>552 (7th Cir.1995) concludes that the attorney fee application is ancillary to the appeal under 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 <em>1415(e)(2) (1986), amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A) (Supp.1997) and, as such, has adopted shorter limitation periods consistent with appeals from administrative agencies.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Neither New Jersey courts nor the Third Circuit have identified a limitation period for actions for fees brought pursuant to the fee-shifting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Attorneys\u2019 fees may be awarded when provided for by rule or statute. <em>R. </em>4:42-9. Common to all of these applications is the presence of an underlying action and the use of motion practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>allowing for, in most cases, a summary adjudication of the fee issues within a short period of time. The action for fees, in the present factual context, is a new and independent action. Too short a period of time fails to reflect the realities of the practice of law and, while we ascribe to a policy of finality for litigations, no interest is served by requiring the filing of an action within such an abbreviated time period. To require the filing of such an action within thirty days is impractical, unfair and, most important, is inconsistent with the intent of IDEA.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">[T]he short statutes of limitations associated with appeals of administrative procedures, while appropriate when a child\u2019s Individualized Education Plan is at issue in a substantive appeal of an administrative determination, are too short to vindicate the underlying federal policies associated with the fee-claims provisions of the IDEA. <em>See, e.g., J.B. [By and Through C.B. v. Essex-Caledonia Supervisory Union, </em>943 <em>F.Supp. </em>387, 391 (D.Vt.1996) ] (\u201cCongressional policy favors the protection of the educational rights of the [disabled]. A short statute of limitations in attorneys\u2019 fee claims would frustrate that policy.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\"><em>[Zipperer v. School Bd. of Seminole County, Fla., supra, </em>111 <em>F.</em>3d at 851.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">New Jersey maintains a number of codified limitation periods, e.g., a one-year limitation period for libel and slander eases <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-3; a two-year period for personal injury claims <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-2 and a six-year provision for contract and other claims <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:14-1. None of these limitation periods are appropriate for an independent action for attorneys\u2019 fees which is ancillary to an administrative proceeding. Additionally, we recognize New Jersey\u2019s strong policy of fostering and encouraging finality in litigated proceedings. At the other extreme, we recently interpreted our frivolous litigation statute and rule to impose a ten-day limitation period on applications for attorneys\u2019 fees in statutory \u201cfrivolous litigation\u201d matters, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2A:15-59.1. <em>Czura v. Siegel, </em>296 <em>N.J.Super. </em>187, 190, 686 A.2d 390 (App.Div.1997). In addition, both the statute and our recently amended court rule, <em>R. </em>1:4-8, require that the fee application be brought \u201cin the action\u201d itself. <em>R. </em>1:4 \u2014 8(b)(2). We recognize the various federal courts that have adopted a thirty-day limitation period, as we previously noted. Ten or thirty-day limitation periods, in our view, present too narrow a window of time to commence a new action especially when at the same time one is attempting to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>absorb and counsel litigants regarding a decision of the Commissioner of Education which may or may not require other action or consideration. Our research has failed to disclose or identify an appropriate local New Jersey limitation of the rights of the parties to secure relief under the fee-shifting statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">We prefer a more flexible approach. The Third Circuit provides persuasive guidance in <em>Bemardsville Bd. of Educ. v. J.H., </em>42 F.3d 149 (3rd Cir.1994), where the court addressed the limitation period for an action by parents seeking tuition and expense reimbursement and other relief under IDEA. The action was commenced two years after the child had been withdrawn from an inadequate educational facility. The court rejected the ninety-day limitation period for challenging a child\u2019s Individual Educational Plan and adopted a \u201creasonable time\u201d standard as a limitations period for commencement of such an action. \u201cThe fact that here the regulations do not specify a time limitation within which to bring a due process hearing, as well as the very nature and social significance of the education of children with disabilities incline us to equitable considerations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 157. The court concluded that a two-year time delay was excessive commenting that even one year was also excessive in bringing the reimbursement action.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">We conclude that the adoption of a \u201creasonable time\u201d rule for the institution of independent actions for attorneys\u2019 fees where there is no underlying action pending or brought pursuant to 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(b) (1986), <em>amended by </em>20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(f) (Supp.1997) appropriately harmonizes competing policy considerations. It provides a standard which allows independent actions to proceed forward and protects the rights of the parties under IDEA while at the same time precluding the extension of litigation over too long a period of time. We join in the Third Circuit\u2019s view that an action brought in excess of one year probably does not meet the \u201creasonable time\u201d standard. No interest is served by delaying the adjudication of recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. The interests of the litigants, counsel and the public agency involved would be well-served by an expeditious resolution of these dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>putes. We think such an extended period is inconsistent with the strong policy of finality of litigation.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">In the present case, the complaint for relief was filed on May 1, 1997, approximately four and one-half months after the agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Applying the \u201creasonable time\u201d standard to the matter before us, we conclude that a delay of four or five months is within the standard, and plaintiff is not barred from pursuing her course of action under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">The judgment of the Law Division awarding attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to the fee-shifting statute is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-9\"> Ironically, J.N. is enrolled in the Lakeview School located in Edison, but his domicile remains East Brunswick.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\"> The parties have stipulated that the amount of the fees and nature of services were reasonable and necessary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b135-11\"> Neither the Administrative Law Judge nor the Commissioner reached this issue. \"Since I have concluded that the Brunswick [sic] Board is responsible for the education of J.N. pursuant to <em>NJ.S.A. </em>18A:38-l(b)(l), it is not necessary for me to consider the tuition issue or whether IDEA is applicable in this matter.\u201d 96 <em>N.J.A.R.2&amp; </em>(Edu) 285, 1995 WL 862990 (1995). \u201cThe Commissioner further concurs with the A.L.J. that ... it is not necessary to consider the tuition issue or whether the [IDEA] is applicable in this matter.\" <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b138-9\"> The fee-shifting provision, 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(e)(4)(B) (1986) was amended and redesignated as 20 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B) (Supp.1997).
