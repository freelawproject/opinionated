Rogers was sentenced to a one year probationary term, a $350 fine, 100 hours of community service, and payment of $870 in restitution. Appropriate penalties were assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-13\">On appeal, filed <em>nunc pro tunc </em>on leave granted, Rogers argues that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to dismiss the indictment because the statute under which he was charged is void for vagueness, and thus unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-14\">The facts giving rise to the conviction may be simply stated. Emely Padilla had been served with a complaint by Citibank <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Mortgage Corp. (Citibank) which sought to foreclose on her house. Padilla received a notice dated March 24, 1995, signed by Rogers as President of Express Consolidation, Refinance &amp; Mortgage Consultation, Inc., indicating that the pending foreclosure by Citibank had come to his attention and offering to help the Padillas with the foreclosure on their home by buying the house, solving money problems or refinancing. Padilla responded to the letter and Rogers called Padilla to discuss how his company could help.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">Rogers met with Padilla at her home to explain how he was going to help her avoid foreclosure through refinancing her loan or obtaining a buyer for her house. Padilla agreed to pay the equivalent of one month\u2019s mortgage payment for these services and signed a contract on May 15, 1995, which stated: \u201cAny fees paid are not to be construed as mortgage application fees, appraisal fees, legal fees or as any fees other than consultation fees and are non-refundable.\u201d Apparently Padilla told Rogers that she did not know how to answer Citibank\u2019s foreclosure complaint. Rogers explained to her that she had thirty-five days to file an answer. Padilla gave defendant the information he needed to prepare an answer to the complaint. Defendant prepared the answer to the complaint and submitted it to Padilla for her signature. Padilla indicated that defendant filed the answer with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">At his plea proceedings, Rogers admitted preparing the answer to the complaint, but stated that he gave it to Padilla to file with the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Rogers argues that the statute is facially vague and vague as applied, and therefore, is unconstitutional. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:21-22 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-8\">b. A person is guilty of a crime of the fourth degree if the person knowingly engages in the unauthorized practice of law and; ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-10\">(2) Derives a benefit ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Here, Rogers contends that <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:21-22(b) is unconstitutionally vague because it fails to define what constitutes the \u201cpractice of law.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Generally, a presumption of validity attaches to a duly enacted statute. <em>Matter of C.V.S. Pharmacy Wayne, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>490, 497, 561 A.2d 1160 (1989), <em>cert. denied, </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>1045, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>841, 107 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>836 (1990); <em>Piscataway Township Bd. of Educ. v.

Kervick, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>68, 74, 167 A.2d 380 (1961). Nevertheless, vague laws are unenforceable under the Federal and State Constitutions. <em>See U.S. Const. </em>amend. V; <em>N.J. Const, </em>art. I, 1\u00cd1. The vagueness doctrine is grounded in concepts of fairness, and \u201crequires that a law be sufficiently clear to apprise an ordinary person of its reach.\u201d <em>Matter of CVS Pharmacy of Wayne, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 500, 561 A.2d 1160 (citing <em>Brown v.

Vague laws are unconstitutional even if they fail to touch constitutionally protected conduct, because unclear or incomprehensible legislation places both citizens and law enforcement officials in an untenable position. Vague laws deprive citizens of adequate notice of proscribed conduct ... and fail to provide officials with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>guidelines sufficient to prevent arbitrary and erratic enforcement, (citation omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\"><em>See also Papachristou v. City of Jacksonville, </em>405 <em>U.S. </em>156, 162, 92 <em>S.Ct. </em>839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110, 115 (1972); <em>Lanzetta v.

General Construction Co., </em>269 <em>U.S. </em>385, 391, 46 <em>S.Ct. </em>126, 127, 70 <em>L.Ed. </em>322, 328 (1926)). Our Supreme Court also has indicated that \u201c[pjenal laws ... are subjected to sharper scrutiny and given more exacting and critical assessment under the vagueness doctrine than civil enactments.\u201d <em>State v. Cameron, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>586, 592, 498 A.2d 1217 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">A statute can be challenged as either \u201cfacially\u201d vague or vague \u201cas applied.\u201d \u201cA statute may be vague facially if \u2018there is no conduct that it proscribes with sufficient certainty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matter of C.V.S. Pharmacy Wayne, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 501, 561 A.2d 1160 (quoting <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 498 A.2d 1217). If a statute does not prohibit the conduct sought to be proscribed with sufficient clarity it can be challenged \u201cas applied.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>162, 175, 631 A.2d 946 (1993). In such case, the relevant question is \u201cwhether the statute clearly extends to the acts that the State alleges defendant committed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 165, 631 A.2d 946.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">Nevertheless, we have noted that \u201c[ejven if behavior is not susceptible to precise definition, the statute may be constitutional.\u201d <em>State v. Saunders, </em>302 <em>N.J.Super. </em>509, 521, 695 A.2d 722 (App.Div.), <em>certif denied, </em>151 <em>N.J. </em>470, 700 A.2d 881 (1997). In <em>State in Interest of B.N., </em>99 <em>N.J.Super. 30, 34, </em>238 A.2d 486 (App.Div.1968), where defendant was convicted for violating a municipal ordinance which prohibited \u201c[ljoud, offensive, disorderly, threatening, abusive, or insulting language\u201d we concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>[W]here the legislative regulatory objective is appropriate and the conduct intended to be prohibited is not fairly susceptible of definition in other than general language, there is no constitutional impediment to the use of such language. <em>State v.

That there may be marginal cases in which it becomes difficult to determine the side of a line on which a particular fact situation falls is not a sufficient reason to hold the language too ambiguous to define a penal offense. <em>State v. Monteleone, </em>36 <em>N.J. </em>93, 99 [175 A.2d 207] (1961); <em>State v. New York Central Railroad Co., </em>37 <em>N.J.Super. </em>42, 48 [116 A.2d 800] (App.Div.1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-6\"><em>See also State v. Lee, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 166, 475 A.2d 31 (stating that the Legislature may address criminal conduct by \u201cpreparing] a deta\u00f1ed catalogue of proscribed activities or, within constitutional limits, addressing] the problem more genera\u00f1y\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Although the Supreme Court remarked that the \u201cpractice of law does not lend itself \u2018to [a] precise and a\u00f1-inelusive definition,\u2019 \u201d it is clear that the \u201cpractice of law\u201d is not limited to litigation, \u201cbut extends to legal activities in many non-litigious fields.\u201d <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Northern New Jersey Mortgage Associates, </em>32 <em>N.J. </em>430, 437, 161 A.2d 257 (1960) (quoting in part <em>Auerbacher v. Wood, </em>142 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>484, 485, 59 A.2d 863 (E. &amp; A.1948)). Hence, the practice of law is not \u201climited to the conduct of cases in court but is engaged in whenever and wherever legal knowledge, training, sk\u00f1l and ability are required.\u201d <em>Stack v. P.G. Garage, Inc., </em>7 <em>N.J. </em>118, 121, 80 A.2d 545 (1951). What constitutes the practice of law is often required to be decided on a case by case basis because of the broad scope of the fields of law. <em>See In re Opinion No. 2k of Committee on Unauthorized Practice of Law, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>114, 122, 607 A.2d 962 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Rogers argues that the statute is facia\u00f1y vague because it does not precisely define any activity. However, merely because a criminal statute fa\u00f1s to define a term w\u00fcl not necessarily render it facially vague, particularly where it is a term of common usage or has a readfiy ascertainable meaning. <em>See State v. Afanador, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 631 A.2d 946 (a person of common intelligence can comprehend the meaning of the words \u201corganizer, supervisor, financier or manager\u201d); <em>see also Arnett v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number><em>Kennedy, </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>134, 159, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>1633, 1647, 40 L.Ed.2d 15, 36 (1974). In the absence of an express indication that a special meaning is intended, the words used in a statute carry their \u201cordinary and well-understood meanings.\u201d <em>State v. Afanador, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 171, 631 A.2d 946. Thus, a claimed legislative deficiency in defining a term need not result in a declaration that the statute is void for vagueness. <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 596, 498 A.2d 1217; <em>see also State v. Lee, supra, </em>96 <em>N.J. </em>at 166, 475 A.2d 31 (\u201c[t]hat the prohibited behavior is not susceptible to precise definition need not lead to legislative paralysis\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Certain activities such as a paralegal\u2019s work, have been held to constitute the practice of law. <em>See In re Opinion No. 24, supra, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>at 123, 607 A.2d 962. <em>See also Application of New Jersey Soc. of Certified Public Accountants, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>231, 233, 507 A.2d 711 (1986) (preparing and filing a New Jersey Inheritance Tax Return constitutes the practice of law); <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v.

Reiner, </em>43 <em>N.J. </em>313, 316, 204 A.2d 146 (1964) (plaintiffs activities of \u201crendering of advice and assistance in obtaining extensions of credit and compromises of indebtedness\u201d constituted the practice of law); <em>New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v.

The term, and therefore the statute, is not \u201c \u2018impermissibly vague in all its applications\u2019 \u201d because it proscribes certain conduct with sufficient clarity. <em>State v. Afanador, supra, </em>134 <em>N.J. </em>at 170, 631 A.2d 946 (quoting <em>State v. Cameron, supra, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>at 593, 498 A.2d 1217); <em>see also Lawline v.

Foster, </em>674 So.2d 747, 752 (Fla.App. 1 Dist.), <em>case dismissed, </em>677 So.2d 840 (Fla.1996) (statute prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law is not vague because it is \u201c \u2018set out in terms that the ordinary person exercising ordinary common sense can sufficiently understand and comply with, without sacrifice to the public interest\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Arnett v. Kennedy, supra, </em>416 <em>U.S. </em>at 158, 94 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1646, 40 L.Ed.2d at 36.)</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Rogers also contends that the statute is vague \u201cas applied\u201d to him because he was not put on notice that his particular actions were considered the \u201cpractice of law.\u201d We reject that argument. The very notice sent by Rogers to Padilla attempted to disclaim what might be the practice of law, and went so far as to attempt his own interpretation of his actions by \u201cconstruing\u201d the fee received to be merely \u201cconsultation fees.\u201d Caselaw makes clear that the drafting of pleadings and other legal documents constitutes the practice of law, <em>see In re Polk License Revocation, supra, </em>90 <em>N.J. </em>at 575-576, 449 A.2d 7, a service for which Rogers here had received compensation. <em>See Cape May County Bar Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>45 <em>N.J. </em>at 124, 211 A.2d 780 (the practice of law included the \u201cfilling in and completion of legal forms\u201d). <em>Accord: New Jersey State Bar Ass\u2019n v.

The statute was clearly intended to include the unauthorized rendering of legal advice on how and when to answer a complaint and preparation of pleadings such as an answer to a complaint. Here, Rogers admitted obtaining information from Padilla and preparing her answer to the complaint in appropriate form to be filed. This constituted the practice of law; it was not just the typing of the answer to the foreclosure complaint. Rogers also admitted to advising Padilla that she had thirty-five days to answer the complaint. Again, this constituted the practice of law. We are persuaded in this regard by the opinion in <em>State v. Buyers Service Co., Inc., supra, </em>357 <em>S.E.2d </em>at 18, where the South Carolina Supreme Court succinctly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>The reason preparation of instruments by lay persons must be held to constitute the unauthorized practice of law is not for economic protection of the legal profession. Bather, it is for the protection of the public from the potentially severe economic and emotional consequences which may flow from erroneous advice given by persons untrained in the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Defendant was in the business of giving mortgage advice. The clause in his own contract form evinced that he knew that he was not permitted to give legal advice. Furth\u00e9rmore, in his solicitation of this type of business there are many situations that require legal advice that falls within the province of an attorney. It is such situations that the statute addresses in order to protect the public from erroneous, misleading, or incomplete advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-8\"> Defendant limits his appeal to what constitutes the \"practice of law\u201d and does not challenge the trial judge\u2019s ruling that the term \"unauthorized\" is not vague. The judge held that the term \"unauthorized\u201d is not vague because it is clear \u201d[i]f you practice law without having first been admitted by the Supreme Court, or are exempted by the Court, you are doing so in an unauthorized capacity.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
