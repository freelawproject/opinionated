Sykes lived in a dormitory apartment on Rutgers\u2019 Busch Campus in New Brunswick. On the morning of February 3,1994, at approximately 11:00 a.m., Sykes went out to Parking Lot # 58 to start her car. When her car would not start, she headed back to her dormitory. On the way, she slipped and fell on an \u201caccumulation of ice\u201d in the parking lot and was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-14\">On September 21,1995, Sykes filed a complaint against Rutgers alleging that her \u201cfall, and resulting bodily injuries\u201d were caused by its \u201cnegligence and carelessness.\u201d Specifically, she charged that Rutgers \u201cfailed to protect against the [icy] condition by faffing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>to properly inspect, repair, supervise, control and remedy or warn of the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On May 19,1997, Rutgers filed a motion for summary judgment contending that, as a public entity, it is shielded from liability by common law snow-removal immunity and the weather-immunity provision of the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In opposition, Sykes contended that the \u201cimmunities claimed by Rutgers are not absolute.\u201d Relying on <em>Bligen v. Jersey City Housing Authority, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>124, 619 A.2d 575 (1993), Sykes urged that statutory weather-immunity provided by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:4-7 does not apply when, as in her case, an accident occurs in a parking lot and not on a \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201chighway\u201d and that the policy reasons behind common law snow-removal immunity do not apply to the Busch campus parking lot because it constitutes only a \u201cfinite, bounded area\u201d from which to remove snow.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Following oral argument, the trial judge entered an order denying Rutgers\u2019 motion for summary judgment finding the case \u201calmost indistinguishable\u201d from <em>Bligen. </em>By our leave, Rutgers appeals contending that the trial judge erred in failing to recognize its immune status.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">There are two possible roads to snow-removal immunity; one is the Tort Claims Act and the other is the common law. The relevant provision of the Tort Claims Act is <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:4-7 which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">Neither a public entity nor a public employee is liable for an injury caused solely by the effect on the use of streets and highways of weather conditions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">The Supreme Court in <em>Bligen </em>denied Tort Claims Act coverage to the Jersey City Housing Authority for a fall on an icy parking lot because the internal driveways and parking areas of a public housing complex are not \u201cstreets\u201d or \u201chighways\u201d as contemplated by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Sykes asks us to analogize the Busch Campus parking lot to the facts in <em>Bligen </em>in order to conclude that Tort Claims Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>immunity is unavailable. However, the Court in <em>Bligen </em>specifically declined to enunciate a rule broader than the facts before it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJM\">The precise scope of the statutory terminology is not before us. Our conclusion that the internal driveway servicing defendant\u2019s apartment complex is not a \u201cstreet\u201d or \u201chighway\u201d does not resolve whether other roadways servicing public facilities are the essential equivalent of public streets covered by the immunity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">[131 <em>N.J. </em>at 130, 619 A.2d 575.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">We need not grapple with this issue because we have concluded that regardless of Rutgers\u2019 entitlement to Tort Claims Act immunity, it is clearly entitled to the common law immunity established in <em>Miehl v. Darpino, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>49, 247 A.2d 878 (1968). That immunity was not invalidated by the Tort Claims Act. <em>Rochinsky v. State of New Jersey Department of Transportation, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>399, 414, 541 A.2d 1029 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We recognize that the Supreme Court in <em>Bligen </em>refused to afford common law snow-removal immunity to the defendant housing authority. In so doing, it acknowledged that \u201cthe imposition of liability on public entities responsible for the removal of snow on a network of ... roadways could be limitless.\u201d <em>Bligen, supra, </em>131 <em>N.J. </em>at 133, 619 A.2d 575. However, the Court opined that the driveways and parking lots in a public housing authority, which is \u201ca finite area from which to remove the snow do not present that problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 131, 619 A.2d 575. In addition, the Court distinguished the facts in <em>Bligen </em>from the previous snow-removal immunity cases by invoking the well-established rule that municipal landlords \u201chave a duty to maintain the premises to prevent foreseeable injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134, 619 A.2d 575 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">Sykes argues that while the total area under Rutgers control may be larger than that of the area controlled by the housing authority in <em>Bligen, </em>the \u201cinternal parking lot\u201d in which she fell is analogous to <em>Bligen </em>because it is a \u201cfinite, bounded area\u201d from which to remove snow. We disagree. To us, there is nothing in <em>Bligen </em>to suggest that the Supreme Court intended its \u201cfinite, bounded area\u201d characterization of the seven-acre housing authority there to allow a slip and fall plaintiff to fractionalize a 1500 acre <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>college campus. Sykes\u2019 argument that the scope and size of Rutgers\u2019 Busch Campus can be ignored by focusing only on the part of the campus \u201cdedicated to student housing\u201d would enable slip and fall plaintiffs to effectively dissect any public entity into its constituent \u201cfinite, bounded areas\u201d for purposes of avoiding common law snow-removal immunity. This would, in effect, destroy the common law immunity which has protected public entities against liability for their snow-removal activities for over a quarter of a century. <em>See Miehl v. Darpino, supra. </em>Indeed, under her reasoning, any municipality which is smaller or similar in size to Rutgers could be subjected to liability with respect to \u201cfinite, bounded areas\u201d of hardscape supporting its public buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">We also reject Sykes\u2019 argument that because she resided in a dormitory on the Busch campus, Rutgers had a legal responsibility to her as a municipal landlord like that imposed on the housing authority in <em>Bligen. </em>Classifying Rutgers as a \u201clandlord\u201d in order to come within the <em>Bligen </em>rationale ignores its role as a State University which primarily uses its campuses for scholastic activities and not housing. The Busch campus consists of over 1500 acres containing classrooms, administration buildings, athletic areas, and an ecological preserve, all of which is intersected by 139 acres of hardscape surface consisting of parking lots, roads and sidewalks. This is quite distinct from the situation in <em>Bligen </em>and apart from her reliance on <em>Bligen, </em>Sykes alludes to no authority establishing the creation of such a relationship in these circumstances. In the absence of a clearly established landlord-tenant relationship, our courts have previously rejected attempts by slip and fall plaintiffs to classify a particular public entity as akin to a commercial landlord in order to squeeze within the <em>Bligen </em>rationale. <em>See e.g., Rossi v. Borough of Haddonfield, </em>297 <em>N.J.Super. 494, 688 </em>A.2d 643 (App.Div.), <em>aff'd </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>43, 702 A.2d 1285 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">In sum, Rutgers is entitled to common law snow-removal immunity and summary judgment should have been granted. <em>Brill v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number><em>Guardian Life Ins. Co., </em>142 <em>N.J. </em>520, 536, 666 A.2d 146 (1995). Consequently, we reverse the trial court\u2019s decision denying summary judgment and remand the matter for the entry of summary judgment in favor of Rutgers based upon the application of common law snow-removal immunity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
