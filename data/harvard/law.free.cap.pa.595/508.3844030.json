(HSP/Sugarllouse) and Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners, L.P. (PEDP/Foxwoods), pursuant to the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development and Gaming Act (Gaming Act), 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1101 et seq. The Gaming Board denied the applications for licensure submitted by Keystone Redevelopment Partners, PNK Pinnacle Entertainment (Pinnacle), and Riverwalk Casino, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>L.P. Riverwalk Casino filed an appeal to this Court pursuant to 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1204.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On July 17, 2007, the Gaming Board\u2019s Adjudication and Order was affirmed by this Court. <em>Riverwalk Casino v. Pa. Gaming Control Bd., </em>592 Pa. 505, 926 A.2d 926 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">In anticipation of the award by the Gaming Board of casino licenses in the City of Philadelphia, City Council had enacted Ordinance No. 051028-AA on February 23, 2006, adding Chapter 14-400 to the provisions of the Philadelphia Code that govern zoning and planning.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Ordinance created a new zoning classification referred to as Commercial Entertainment Districts (CEDs). The CED ordinance was \u201cintended to encourage the orderly development of major entertainment facilities and certain other uses in accordance with an approved plan of development,\u201d without interfering with the Gaming Board\u2019s approved locations of the casinos. Phila. Code \u00a7 14-401(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">Specifically, the provisions of the Philadelphia Code state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">(1) Nothing in this Chapter shall limit the right of the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board under the [Gaming] Act to identify the property on which it will permit a Category 2 licensed gaming facility within the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">(2) Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prohibit any use that is exclusively regulated and permitted by the Commonwealth under the [Gaming] Act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Phila.Code \u00a7 14-405(2), (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Section 14-403 of the CED Ordinance sets forth the procedures for the establishment of a Commercial Entertainment District. Under the CED Ordinance, a plan of development is submitted to the Philadelphia Planning Commission for approval. After a plan of development is approved by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Planning Commission, it is submitted to Council. Council is to take two separate actions to designate a site for casino development: (1) designate by ordinance the site as a Commercial Entertainment District, and (2) review and approve a Plan of Development that has been submitted by the Planning Commission. Phila. Code \u00a7 14-403(1), (2). Once the CED designation becomes effective, the underlying zoning classifications for all lots within the district are superseded. Phila. Code \u00a7 14-403(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">On March 26, 2007, HSP submitted a proposed Plan of Development to the Planning Commission. On May 22, 2007, the Planning Commission held a public hearing and approved HSP\u2019s Plan of Development. The Planning Commission recommended the approval of three bills related to HSP, which would (1) amend zoning for HSP\u2019s gaming site and zone the property as a CED District, (2) approve HSP\u2019s Plan of Development, and (3) authorize the revision of the lines and grades on HSP\u2019s site and provide a right of way for sewer maintenance. On May 24, 2007, the bills were introduced before City Council; however, the bills were not acted upon by City Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">On October 25, 2007, HSP filed this Petition for Review against Respondents City Council for the City of Philadelphia, the City of Philadelphia, and the City Planning Commission for the City of Philadelphia. HSP also filed an Application for Summary Relief and Expedited Briefing Schedule.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">HSP requests that this Court issue an order directing Respondents to comply with their statutory duties to implement the decision of the Gaming Board to locate a Category 2 casino at HSP\u2019s site in Philadelphia as selected and approved by the Gaming Board.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> HSP asserts that City Council has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>refused and failed to act on three bills that were properly introduced to City Council on May 24, 2007, and is thereby obstructing the process established in the Philadelphia Code, \u00a7\u00a7 14-401 et seq., for developing gaming facilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\">HSP further requests that a master be appointed pursuant to Section 1506 of the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506. HSP contends that there are no material factual issues in dispute with respect to the inaction and obstruction by Council, but requests that a master be appointed with continuing jurisdiction of these matters pursuant to \u00a7 1506.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">On November 2, 2007, a Brief of Respondents was filed on behalf of the City of Philadelphia and the City Planning Commission (the City). The City does not have any objection to HSP\u2019s request for relief.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Specifically, the City states in its Brief that it does not oppose the following relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">(1) that the site approved by the Gaming Board for the SugarHouse Casino be declared zoned as a Commercial Entertainment District pursuant to the Philadelphia Code Chapter 14-400 as in existence on November 1, 2007;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">(2) pursuant to Chapter 14-400, HSP\u2019s Plan of Development as approved on May 22, 2007 by the Planning Commission, including all provisos thereto, be declared to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>finally approved and shall require no further approval as if City Council had approved the same;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-4\">(3) that all revisions, relocations, strikes and vacations of easements and public rights of way identified in the Plan of Development as approved by the City Planning Commission are authorized; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-5\">(4) that the City shall take all actions necessary to implement the relief granted, including making all necessary changes to City records, maps and plans, and receiving, reviewing and acting upon all applications from HSP in the ordinary course and in compliance with the Court\u2019s order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The City requests this Court to consider HSP\u2019s Petition for Review on an expedited schedule based upon the filings and briefs that have already been submitted. The City asserts that all relevant legal issues have been briefed in full and there are no material issues of fact in dispute. The City contends that neither additional briefing nor argument are necessary for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On November 2, 2007, City Council (Council) filed a \u201cConsolidated Motion to Dismiss by City Council for the City of Philadelphia in Opposition to Petition for Review and in Opposition to Application for Summary Relief, Including Preliminary Objections to Both the Petition and the Application.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> An Amicus Curiae Brief in Opposition to the Petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>for Review has been filed by State Senator Vincent J. Fumo. Both Council and Amicus request that we dismiss HSP\u2019s Petition for Review and Application for Summary Relief and Expedited Briefing Schedule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">HSP has filed a Brief in Opposition to the Consolidated Motion to Dismiss. The City responds that it believes that its original brief adequately addresses the issues raised in Council\u2019s motion to dismiss and renews its request for an expeditious resolution of the underlying dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">We agree with the City that the briefs submitted by the parties and by Amicus have provided all of the argument required for this Court to consider and address the issues that have been raised. We accept the matter for consideration and disposition on the briefs submitted by the parties and Amicus.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Section 1506 of the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The threshold question to be addressed is whether this Court has jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to Section 1506 of the Gaming Act, 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506. Section 1506 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-9\">In order to facilitate timely implementation of casino gaming as provided in this part, notwithstanding 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 933(a)(2) (relating to appeals from government agencies), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is vested with exclusive appellate jurisdiction to consider appeals of a final order, determination or decision of a political subdivision or local instrumentality involving zoning, usage, layout, construction or occupancy, including location, size, bulk and use of a licensed facility. The court, as appropriate, may appoint a master to hear an appeal under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">HSP contends that City Council\u2019s refusal to enact the HSP bills represents the final determination and decision of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>political subdivision that involves the zoning, usage, and location of a licensed gaming facility within the scope of \u00a7 1506.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The City notes that in a brief previously filed with this Court in <em>Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners, L.P. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>594 Pa. 468, 937 A.2d 385 (2007)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>, the City had conceded that if a gaming operator with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>an approved site submitted a development plan that was approved by the Planning Commission and Council simply refused to approve the plan, there might be a role for this Court as the City ultimately has no discretion to preclude gaming. The City asserts that \u201c[f]or the SugarHouse Casino, the time is now.\u201d Brief of City of Philadelphia at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">The City of Philadelphia acknowledges the efforts of HSP, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">For almost a year, SugarHouse has worked collaboratively with the City to craft a development proposal that addresses every issue the City has identified to address the profound and cityscape-altering impacts of gaming. These issues include transportation, public safety, community reinvestment, economic opportunity, design quality waterfront access, environmental issues, and local taxes. SugarHouse has been forthcoming with its plans and has adjusted them to address the City\u2019s concerns with storm-water run-off, design transportation, waterfront access, and the scores of other issues that must be addressed to assure the successful introduction of gaming into the nation\u2019s fifth largest city.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMs\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The City recognizes that the Gaming Board has exclusive authority to choose the location of slot machine facilities in Pennsylvania under the Gaming Act. The City observes that \u201c[t]he locations of the proposed casinos were, particularly in Philadelphia, a central concern of the [Gaming Board] and was, according to the licensing decision, a critical factor in the determination of which licenses to award.\u201d Brief of City at 4. The City asserts that its powers \u201cdo not extend to overturning the decisions of the [Gaming Board], either through action or inaction, but only to regulate the development through its valid zoning authority once the Board has located the Philadelphia casinos.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>Council asserts that this Court does not have jurisdiction over this matter under \u00a7 1506 because Council has not issued a final order or made a final determination or decision regarding HSP. Council contends that HSP wrongly argues that its refusal to act is a final determination and decision. Council argues that HSP blatantly misrepresents the record with respect to the legislative process and is attempting to circumvent the process in its entirety. Council claims that if the General Assembly had intended that delay or inaction would have satisfied the requirement of a decision or determination, the General Assembly would have so stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">In <em>Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board v. City Council, </em>928 A.2d 1255 (Pa.2007), we interpreted \u00a7 1506 to determine whether this Court had jurisdiction to consider a claim regarding an ordinance enacted by City Council. Applying the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (SCA), 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501 et seq., we concluded that by its terms, \u00a7 1506 created an appeal that may be taken from certain local actions, and that the ordinance was appealable under \u00a7 1506 because it was \u201ca final order, determination or decision of a political subdivision\u201d involving the \u201clocation of a licensed facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1264.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Our conclusion was guided by the words in \u00a7 1506, as defined by their common usage, and their plain meaning; and the General Assembly\u2019s express instruction in \u00a7 1506 to interpret the statute to facilitate the timely implementation of gaming. We observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">Under the SCA, it is fundamental that \u201c|'t]he object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assemblyf,] and that [ejvery statute shall be construed, if possible, to give effect to all of its provisions.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). In this regard, the SCA instructs that \u201c[w]hen the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(b). When, however, the words of a statute are not explicit, the General Assembly\u2019s intent is to be ascertained by considering matters other than statutory language. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(c).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>The SCA provides that \u201c[wjords and phrases shall be construed according the rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage[.J\u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1903(a). If the General Assembly defines words that are used in a statute, those definitions are binding. <em>Commonwealth v. Kimmel, </em>523 Pa. 107, 565 A.2d 426, 428 (1989). Under the SCA, a court may presume that the General Assembly does not intend a result that is absurd, impossible of execution or unreasonable; does not intend to violate the Constitution of the United States or that of Pennsylvania; and intends the entire statute to be certain and effective. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1X3).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">* * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Initially, \u00a7 1506 provides this Court with two instructions. In interpreting the statute, we are to remain mindful that \u00a7 1506 aims \u201cto facilitate timely implementation of casino gaming,\u201d and that 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 933(a)(2) of the Judicial Code is set aside and has no significance in this context. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">Section 1506 then describes the jurisdiction it vests in this Court. Our jurisdiction is \u201c \u2018exclusive\u2019 and \u2018appellate\u2019 and authorizes us \u2018to consider appeals of a final order, determination or decision of a political subdivision of local instrumentality involving ... [the] location of a licensed facility.\u2019 \u201d 4 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1506. The SCA defines a \u201c \u2018political subdivision\u2019 as \u2018[a]ny county, city, borough, incorporated town, township, school district, vocational school district and county institution district.\u2019 \u201d 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991. The dictionary defines a \u201c \u2018determination\u2019 as \u2018the act of coming to a decision or of fixing or settling a purpose[,]\u2019 and a \u2018decision\u2019 as the act or process of deciding; determination, as of a question or doubt, by making a judgment^] the act or need for making up one\u2019s mind[;] something that is decided; resolution.\u201d The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 517, 541 (2nd ed.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>928 A.2d at 1263-1264 (footnote omitted).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">With these guiding principles in mind, we conclude that the inaction of City Council in the present case constitutes a final order, decision or determination within the purview of \u00a7 1506. Council has decided to block bills that would designate HSP\u2019s site for a casino in a CED district and not to approve a Plan of Development. As a result, HSP has not been able to secure the approvals that it must have under the Philadelphia Code in order to develop its site into the licensed facility the Gaming Board approved. Council\u2019s refusal to act is no less an action that amounts to a final decision or determination involving the zoning of a licensed facility under \u00a7 1506 than the approval or rejection of a plan of development.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">It would be an absurd result to conclude that an appeal from a political subdivision\u2019s final decision to approve or reject a plan of development may be taken immediately to this Court under \u00a7 1506, but that no such appeal may be taken if the political subdivision simply refused to act, thereby halting implementation of the Gaming Board\u2019s decision to locate a licensed facility. <em>See </em>1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1922(1). Indeed, Council\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>interpretation would violate the Statutory Construction Act by requiring us to disregard the General Assembly\u2019s express instruction in \u00a7 1506 that it aims \u201cto facilitate timely implementation of casino gaming.\u201d Accordingly, we conclude that this Court has jurisdiction over HSP\u2019s Petition for Review under \u00a7 1506.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">II. PETITION FOR REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">HSP asserts that since the Gaming Board issued its decision on December 20, 2006 and its Adjudication and Order on February 1, 2007, awarding Category 2 Licenses to HSP and Philadelphia Entertainment &amp; Development Partners, City Council has refused and continues to refuse to implement the Gaming Board\u2019s decision by refusing to take the steps the Philadelphia Code requires for the development of its site as a licensed facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">On January 9, 2007, the casino developers began a series of meetings with the City to establish a plan of development for the two casino sites. On May 22, 2007, the Planning Commission approved HSP\u2019s Plan of Development and recommended approval of three bills related to HSP (collectively referred to as the \u201cHSP Bills\u201d). The three critical bills include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">\u2022 Bill No. 070456, which would amend current zoning for HSP\u2019s Gaming site and zone the property as a CED district (the CED Designation Bill).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-8\">\u2022 Bill No. 070457, which would authorize the revision of the lines and grades on HSP\u2019s site and provide a right of way for sewer maintenance (the Omnibus Bill).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>\u2022 Bill No. 070458, which would approve HSP\u2019s Plan of Development that had previously been approved by the Planning Commission (the Plan of Development Bill).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">On May 24, 2007, the bills were introduced before Council and referred to committee. The District Designation Bill and the Plan of Development Bill were sent to the Rules Committee and the Omnibus Bill was sent to the Committee on Streets and Services. The Committee on Streets and Services did not conduct any hearings on the Omnibus Bill, which remained in committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">On June 13, 2007, the Rules Committee held a hearing on the District Designation Bill and the Plan Approval Bill, but the bills were not voted upon at that session. The Rules Committee scheduled another meeting for September 26, 2007 to consider the two bills and other gaming-related bills. The meeting was cancelled. No further action has been taken on the three bills.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">HSP seeks relief from Council\u2019s deliberate actions to delay and obstruct implementation of the Gaming Board\u2019s approval of HSP\u2019s Category 2 slot machine license application. HSP asserts that Council\u2019s efforts are designed to nullify the Gaming Board\u2019s siting decision by failing to process the HSP bills. HSP contends that Council has refused to abide by this Court\u2019s decision that the Gaming Board has the exclusive authority to select the location of the casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">The Gaming Board conducted public input hearings in Philadelphia on April 10-12, 2006. At the hearings, a council member testified in favor of the license application of PNK Pinnacle Entertainment (Pinnacle). On December 20, 2006, Pinnacle\u2019s application was denied by the Gaming Board. Pinnacle did not file an appeal to this Court from the Gaming Board\u2019s Order and Adjudication dated February 1, 2007.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> HSP asserts that the same council member who testified in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>favor of the Pinnacle site has undertaken efforts to oppose HSP\u2019s facility at the site selected by the Gaming Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">HSP has provided extensive documentation that certain council members have made public statements regarding their efforts to obstruct and derail the Gaming Board\u2019s approval of HSP\u2019s facility. Council has not denied or refuted any of the documents provided by HSP. Nor has Council disputed the accuracy of the public statements made by those council members in its Motion to Dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Included among the actions taken by council members to delay the implementation of the Gaming Board\u2019s decision to locate the casinos in Philadelphia, as well as the public statements made in opposition to HSP\u2019s site, are the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\u2022 a council member\u2019s press release announcing he intended to file an appeal from the Gaming Board\u2019s Adjudication, quoting the council member as stating \u201cI think it\u2019s a horrible decision. I will do everything I can to delay construction of the facilities until some of these serious concerns are addressed.\u201d Exhibit I to Petition for Review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">\u2022 a council member\u2019s statement at a March 2, 2007 public hearing on Ordinance No. 070112<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>that \u201cthis was dumped on us, and we got to figure out a way in which we can slow this process down.\u201d Exhibit L to Petition for Review;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">\u2022 a council member\u2019s announcement at the March 2, 2007 public hearing that he \u201cintended to vote for the bills that [another council member had] put forth in an effort to slow this down or stop this process.\u201d Exhibit L to Petition for Review; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">\u2022 a council member\u2019s sponsorship on April 19, 2007 of Resolution No. 070322 \u201c[a]uthorizing the creation of a Special Committee on Gaming Alternate Site Selection of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the City Council of Philadelphia, for the purpose of holding hearings and making written recommendations to identify alternate locations for slots parlors in the City....\u201d Exhibit N to Petition for Review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">HSP asserts that the detrimental impact of one council member\u2019s actions is demonstrated by his exercise of \u201cthe councilmanic prerogative\u201d to impede consideration of the HSP bills. HSP states that \u201c[u]nder a tradition known as \u2018council-manic prerogative,\u2019 zoning legislation that affects property within any councilmanic district will not be passed by City Council unless the Council member representing that district approves the legislation.\u201d HSP contends that since other members of City Council honor the tradition, a council member representing the district where HSP\u2019s facility is located is uniquely positioned to block the zoning legislation for the development of the SugarHouse casino.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The use of the councilmanic prerogative to delay the zoning legislation and zoning construction was referred to in a document circulated by a council member:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">When the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board issued gaming licenses to SugarHouse and Foxwoods Casinos, I pledged to my constituents that I would fight their decision with every tool I had available.

After the Planning Commission approved HSP\u2019s Plan of Development and the Plan was submitted to City Council for its consideration, neither <em>PAGE </em>nor the Philadelphia Code permitted City Council to refuse consideration of the submission for the purpose of delaying and obstructing implementation of the Gaming Board\u2019s Adjudication and Order regarding the situs of the gaming facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">A political subdivision has no power to override the statutory provisions of the Gaming Act regarding the situs of a licensed gaming facility or to use its authority to zone to impede implementation of the Gaming Board\u2019s decision in that regard. A member of City Council does not have the authority to use local zoning processes to overturn the Gaming Control Board\u2019s approval of an applicant\u2019s Category 2 slot machine license. The <em>PAGE </em>decision was never intended to permit \u25a0 council members in the City of Philadelphia to pressure successful applicants with promises or enticements of expeditious zoning approvals should they relocate their facilities to another site, especially when a suggested alternate site was originally rejected by the Gaming Control Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As recognized by the City of Philadelphia, the City ultimately has no discretion to preclude gaming. We conclude that the undisputed documentation establishes the deliberate inaction by Council for the purposes of delay.

A C-3 Commercial designation permitted several commercial uses.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">On December 20, 2006, the Gaming Board approved the license for PEDP, including the location of the licensed facility that PEDP proposed to establish on its property. On January 23, 2007, PEDP filed an application with the City's Department of Licenses and Inspections for a zoning and use registration permit (\"C-3 Permit\u201d) under the property\u2019s C-3 Commercial designation. PEDP requested the permit for construction of a new hotel with accessory facilities and, inter alia, an \"amusement arcade within LCB licensed areas allowed in C-3 commercial.\u201d PEDP later requested that the application be amended to seek construction of an \"amusement arcade within state licensed areas regulated either by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board or the Pennsylvania Gaming Board....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">PEDP\u2019s request for a permit on January 23, 2007 was made pursuant to the zoning provisions relating to C-3 Commercial uses, aird not under Chapter 14-400 of the Philadelphia Code establishing \"Commercial Entertainment Districts\u201d for the development of licensed gaming facilities.

In Count II, PEDP sought a writ of mandamus to compel the City to issue a C-3 zoning and use registration permit or, alternatively a CED zoning and use registration permit. We concluded that the constitutional claim was not ripe for adjudication, and that the allegations contained in the second count of PEDP\u2019s petition did not place a final order or determination or decision of a political subdivision within the meaning of \u00a7 1506 before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">Unlike the instant case filed by HSP, PEDP did not allege that City Council had refused to act after the Planning Commission had ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>proved a Plan of Development under Chapter 14-400 of the Philadelphia Code.

Amicus Curiae has asserted that HSP cannot obtain control of or a property interest in the river bed of the Delaware River without state legislative authorization to the Pennsylvania Department of General Services for the conveyance of the river bed lease, and that HSP has not acquired such authorization from the General Assembly.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-10\">In its Brief in Opposition to the Consolidated Motion to Dismiss, HSP concedes that it needs riparian rights before it can begin building as contemplated by its Plan of Development, but asserts that the effective designation under the CED ordinance and the riparian rights are parallel prerequisites to HSP obtaining the permits it needs to begin construction. HSP states that the CED ordinance is silent with respect to riparian rights and provides no requirement regarding obtaining the right to construct its casino on riparian land. <em>See </em>HSP Brief in Opposition at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-11\">We need not address the issue of riparian rights at this stage of the proceedings as HSP did not raise that issue in its Petition for Review. The resolution of the issue as to whom may have the authority to grant riparian rights must be left for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b570-7\">Justice SAYLOR,</author>\n<p id=\"AEg\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">I do not believe that relief should be granted at the threshold stage of this case. In the first instance, I have substantial questions about this Court\u2019s jurisdiction to do so in this developing area of the law. Moreover, the pleadings have been filed directly in this Court, and there has been no lower court decision or, indeed, any fact-finding at all. There is therefore no record on which to determine the merits of Petitioner\u2019s claims. Accordingly, even if this Court has jurisdiction in such circumstances, I believe it would be more appropriate to appoint a special master as Petitioner requests, <em>see </em>Petition for Review of HSP Gaming LP at 49, to hold any necessary, hearings and report back to this Court in an expeditious manner. In this way, the underlying, dispositive facts can be ascertained on a developed record. More generally, to the extent that the Court is, in the fourth item of the Order, presently granting the mandamus relief requested by Petitioner, <em>see id. </em>at 48, I would simply note that, pursuant to recent precedent, it appears that we lack jurisdiction to entertain a request for such relief. <em>See Philadelphia Entertainment and Development Partners v. City of Phila., </em>594 Pa. 468, 937 A.2d 385 (2007).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
