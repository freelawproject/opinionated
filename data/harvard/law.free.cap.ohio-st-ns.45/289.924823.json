All were parties to a suit commenced in the common pleas by the assignee of Ross J. Patton, an insolvent debtor, for the purpose of requiring them to interplead, and settle in that way their respective claims to the fund in his hands, all the property assigned having been sold and converted into money. Upon the trial the court, at the request of the parties, made a finding of facts. From this it appears, that Ross J. Patton, being the owner of a certain lot upon which he had constructed a building to be used as a flouring mill, on April 30, 1883, entered into an agreement with The Case Manufacturing Co., of Columbus, Ohio, by which it was to furnish certain machinery to be used in said mill, the title to which \u25a0 was, by the agreement, to remain in the company until the machines were fully paid for, on which there was due and unpaid at the time of the trial $3,133.45. As to the manner in which the machines had been constructed and fastened to the building for use, the court found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-8\"><em>\u201c </em>The roller mills and the large machines built of wood, for convenience of putting up and taking down, were made in pieces or sections, and when put together and fastened to their places in the mill and attached thereto, could be easily detached and taken apart, removed and set up again in another building, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>without material injury to the machines themselves or to the building from which they were removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">\u201c And the other machines, although not made in pieces or sections, to-wit: The purifiers, scalping-chests, reels, etc., when fastened to their places in the mill and attached thereto, could be easily detached, removed and set up again m another building, without material injury to the machines themselves or to the building from which they were removed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-7\">\u201c The usual way of fastening them and of fixing them to the building and premises where\u00bb used, was by iron bolts passing through the floors of the building and then up. through the frames of the machines and secured by nuts, except that the bulirs were supported on upright iron frames called \u2018 hursts, \u2019 which rested on brick foundations imbedded in the ground floor of said building. The \u2018hursts\u2019 extended up through openings in the floor, left for that purpose, and the buhrs rested on the top of the same. None of said machines were to be or were fastened to the walls, foundation or superstructure of said building. One machine was sufficient weight to be kept in its place without any fastening to the floor by bolts or otherwise, its own weight being sufficient for that purpose. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-8\">As to the claim of the Mansfield Machine Works, the court found that on May 10, 1883, the company entered into an agreement with Patton to furnish the motive power of, his mill, a steam engine and boiler with the usual attachments, at the agreed price of $1,650, a part, $450, to be paid \u201cwhen the engine should be started, \u201d the residue to be evidenced by notes of $300 each at six months intervals, and be secured by a chattel mortgage on the engine, boiler and attachments. It. was also stipulated that the title to no part of the property should pass until the notes with the interest should be paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">The engine, boiler, etc., were furnished according to the agreement, and were placed in the building and adjusted and fastened by a \u201c hand \u201d furnished by the company itself; and as to the manner in which this was done, the court fouud:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u201c That said engine and boiler were taken into said building through an opening left in its foundation wall for that purpose, and said opening was afterward weather-boarded over to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>close it up, and the removal of such weather-boarding, which could easily be done and with trifling expense, would be the only injury that said building would necessai\u2019ily sustain in taking out said engine and boiler. The boiler was encased by two brick walls on each side, and each about six feet high, and was suspended and secured between the same, and held in position by suitable appliances adapted to that purpose. The engine rested on and was fastened to a stone foundation about 2J feet high above the ground, in which it was imbedded, by bolts passing through the iron plate of said engine and into said stone foundation. Neither the stone foundation on which the engine rested, nor the walls encasing the boiler were attached to, or formed any part of the foundation or superstructure walls of said building; said engine and boiler were connected in the usual way and manner of making such connection, and also with a main shaft, from and by which all the machinery of said mill was driven. Said engine and boiler, with all their attachments, fixtures, shaftings, etc., could be easily taken down and apart, and removed from said building, without any material injury to said engine, boiler and all their said attachments, fixtures, etc., and put into another building suitable for the same, or without any other inconvience or damage to said building other than the removal of the weather-boarding as aforesaid. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AX9\">The stipulation as to the title was carried into the notes; and, on August 10, 1883, Patton executed and delivered the chattel mortgage as he had agreed, which was duly filed in the proper office on the 31st of the same month, and afterward duly refiled at the proper times for keeping a chattel mortgage in force; and at the time of the trial there was due the Machine Works on the purchase money, $663.80 and interest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b316-6\">And the court further found, that the machinery furnished by each of these parties, \u201cwere designed and intended for said mill, and were adapted to the same and said milling business, and intended by said Patton when placed in said building, to be permanent and to become a part and parcel of his said premises.\u201d But, it is also found, that it was not the intention of either party furnishing it, that the part furnished by it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>should become a part of the realty and the property of Patton until fully paid for.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-5\">Subsequently, Patton sold and conveyed to one Collins an undivided interest in the property; and, on January 29, 1884, they executed to Hogue &amp; Donaldson a real estate mortgage, including the mill property, to secure the payment of certain loans amounting to $4,000. It was recorded February 21, 1884.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-6\">In December following a like mortgage was executed in favor of the Farmers\u2019 &amp; Mechanics\u2019 National Bank of Cadiz, Ohio, to secure a loan of $600. It was taken to indemnify a surety on the loan, and was recorded at once. As to each of these mortgages it is found, that it was taken in good faith by the mortgagee, and without any notice of the agreement with the Manufacturing Company or the Machine Works.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-7\">From other findings it appears, that if, upon the facts, the claim of the Manufacturing Company is prior in right, as it is in time, to either that of Hogue <em>&amp; </em>Donaldson or that of the bank, it should be paid from the funds in the hands of the assignee before either of those claims; and that the claim of the Mansfield Machine Works should next be paid, if found to be prior in right, as it is in time, to the mortgagees of the' realty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">The judgment of the court was in favor of the priority of mortgagees of the realty, and, upon error, was affirmed by the circuit court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b317-9\"><em>David K.

The court, .in these cases, fully sustains the doctrine that, as against a previous real estate mortgage, a conditional sale of a chattel which, being affixed to the real estate, becomes a part thereof, is valid and binding, and such chattel may be reclaimed unless the price is paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-8\">The validity of conditional sales of personal property is no longer a subject of controversy in Ohio.

The validity of such agreements as to personalty, even as against innocent purchasers, was recognized as the law of this state at the time they were made, <em>(Sage </em>v. <em>Sleutz, </em>23 Ohio St. 1; <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Keber, </em>28 Ohio St. 630; <em>Call </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>40 Ohio St. 670); it has been changed by statute (82 Ohio L. 238),. but the rights of the parties in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>this case must be determined by the law as it existed at the time their contracts were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The property sold and transferred by The Case Manufacturing Company under its contract with Patton embraced the machinery employed in the manufacture of flour by the roller-system; that furnished by The Mansfield Machine Works supplied the motive power of the mill, and consisted of an engine and boiler with the usual attachments.</p>\n<p id=\"Agb\">For the purpose of keeping them in place when in use, some of the machines were fastened to the floor with bolts, others were held in place by their own weight, and, as found by the court \u201call could easily have been detached, removed and set up in another building without material injury to the machines themselves or to the building.\u201d Of the motive power, the boiler was inclosed by brick walls between which it was suspended and held in place by suitable appliances in the usual way; the engine rested upon a stone foundation imbedded in the ground, to which it was fastened by bolts passing through an iron plate \u2014 part of the engine \u2014 -into the foundation; and, as found, all could have been removed without any material injury to the machinery, or to the building, other than the removal of some weather-boarding inclosing an opening in the foundation wall through which it had been imtroduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">All the machinery furnished by these two parties under their agreements with the mill-owner is readily distinguishable into two classes, namely, (1), that which supplied the motive power of the mill, and (2), that which was propelled by it. It is a distinction generally recognized by those who run and operate mills as well as by the courts, being founded in the general character of the machinery of each class, and the mode in which it is usually placed upon the premises for use.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The machinery furnishing the motive power is generally more closely annexed to the freehold, and of a more permanent nature, as the power furnished by it may be adapted to the propulsion of the machinery of a variety of mills without any substantial change in the motive power itself or in the building other than by substituting one kind of machinery for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>another; whilst the machinery that is propelled, has more of the general character of personalty, is not as a rule so closely annexed to the freehold, and may be removed, and frequently is, from one mill to another, as any other article of personalty; and is more properly <em>\u201c </em>accessory to the business\u201d carried on upon the realty than to the realty itself. <em>Goepper </em>v. <em>Fortman, </em>14 Ohio St. 567.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">PIcnce, it has generally been held in this country that articles of machinery used in a factory for manufacturing purposes, only attached to the building to keep them steady in their places, so that they may be more serviceable when in use, and that may be removed without any essential injury to the freehold or the articles themselves, are personal property and do not pass by a conveyance or mortgage of the freehold. Ewell Fix. 294. On the other hand, steam engines and boilers with their appliances, that supply the motive power of machinery, and, for purpose of use, are usually stably attached to the realty, pass by a conveyance or mortgage of the land. 1 Sch. Per. Prop. 155; Ewell Fix. 290; 1 Wash. R. P. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">In <em>Teaff v. </em>Hewitt, 1 Ohio St. 511, this distinction in the charter of the property and in the mode of its use and annexation to the realty, was taken and applied to the facts of that case. It is there said that &lt;\u00a3 the machinery and implements in a manufacturing establishment, although useful and even essential to the business carried on, which are not permanently affixed to the ground or the structure of the building, and which can easily be removed without material injury to the building or articles themselves, and their places supplied by other articles of a similar kind, are not. fixtures, but personal property. But that portion of the machinery in such an establishment, which is firmly affixed to the earth orto the structure of the building, and which from its nature, mode of attachment, use, and the relative situation of the. party placing it there, was plainly intended to be permanent, is parcel of the freehold.\u201d So it was there held that the carding machines of a woolen factory, attached to the building by cleats to coniine them to their proper places, and subject to removal whenever convenience or business required, were not fixtures, but chattels; whilst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>the steam enginfe and boiler, used to supply the motive power, permanently fixed upon a foundation laid in the earth, were regarded as realty.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The difficulty of prescribing a rule that may be applied to cases in general* has been confessed both by courts and writers upon the subject; various tests have been adopted, none of which have been applied with anything like uniformity. It may however, be admitted that the distinction .between the motive power of a factory and the machines driven by it, is somewhat <em>arbitrary; </em>still it is one based uptin a physical difference, easily perceived, if not dictated by any well defined principle, and is no more illogical than many distinctions to be found in other branches of the law. That which divides all property into real and personal, is quite as wanting in anything like scientific classification; but, from its general recognition wherever the common law prevails, is found to bo very convenient in practice ; and it is such considerations that have always more or less influenced the adoption of definite rules of property.</p>\n<p id=\"A80\">It remains to be considered whether the result, as to either of these claims, indicated by the discussion, is to be varied by the finding of the court that all the machinery furnished by either of said parties <em>\u201c </em>were designed and intended for said mill, and were adapted to the same and to the said milling business, and intended by Patton when placed in said building, to be permanent and to become a part and parcel of said premises.\u201d But that it was not the intention of either of them \u201c that said machinery so furnished by them, respectively, should become a part and parcel of said real estate, and become the property of the said Patton, and remain permanently attached to said mill unless they were fully paid for.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">There is no question but that the character of things which would otherwise be fixtures, may be changed to that of personalty by the agreement of the parties, and conversoly, so as to be binding upon them. And the stipulation of the vendor in each of these cases, that the title to the property furnished by it should not pass until it had been paid for by the purchaser, precludes the idea that either of them intended that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the machinery furnished by it, should become a part of the realty until payment had been made, as, to impute a different intention, would be to suppose that neither intended the benefit of a stipulation exacted with the greatest care in its own behalf. In such case the intention of the purchaser must be regarded as subordinate to the prior intention of the vendor, expressed in the agreement by which he has possession of the property. <em>Tifft </em>v. Horton, 53 N. Y. 377.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">But the question remains, as to the Mansfield Machine Works whether it can have the benefit of its stipulation, that the title to the property furnished by it should not pass, nor, by inference,' become a part of the realty, until paid for. Here the question is not whether the character of the property may bo changed by the agreement of the parties, as between themselves; of this there is no doubt; but, when the property is such that from the manner of the annexation it would, but for the agreement, ordinarily be regarded as a fixture, whether it can be made by the agreement of the parties to preserve the character of personalty so as to avail against innocent purchasers without notice ? This must, we think, upon principle and authority, be answered in the negative. The point, though not directly presented by the record, was considered in <em>Fortman </em>v. <em>Goepper, </em>14 Ohio St. 558, where the doctrine of <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Cobb, </em>20 N. Y. 344, holding the affirmative, was disapproved. It was, however, directly presented in the subsequent case of <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>15 Ohio St. 446, upon a state of case very similar to that presented by the record before us: B. sold an engine and boiler to F., and, after they had been placed by himself upon the premises of F. as the motive power of his saw-mill, took a chattel mortgage thereon to secure the <em>purchase-money; </em>the property was described in the mortgage as the steam engine and boiler sold to, and then in the possession of, F., and <em>\u201c </em>designed to be used in his saw-mill; \u201d and it was stipulated in the condition, that in case payment was not made when the money became duo, the vendor might enter upon the premises of the purchaser and retake the property wherever it might be found, <em>\u201c </em>whether the same should be \u00e1ttached to the freehold and in law a part of the realty or not,\u201d and remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>the same. But it was held that neither the mortgage, nor the stipulation in it, was available as against a subsequent mortgagee of the freehold without actual notice thereof. And White, J., again disapproving the case of <em>Ford </em>v. Cobb, said, <em>\u201c </em>it seems to us to be the sounder rule, and more in accordance with principle, and the policy of our recording laws, to require actual severance, or notice of a binding agreement to sever, to deprive the purchaser of the right to fixtures or appurtenances to the freehold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The fact that the Machine Works took a chattel mortgage upon the engine and boiler, in addition to the stipulation as to the title, does not seem to help its case. It caused the property to be annexed to the realty of the purchaser in such manner, that, but for the agreement, it would become a part of it. The subsequent mortgagees of the realty had no notice of the agreement or of the chattel mortgage. And to use the language of White, J., in the case above cited, it then devolved upon the vendor, if it <em>\u201c </em>sought to change the legal character of the property, and create incumbrances upon it, either to pursue the mode prescribed by law for incumbering the kind of estate to which it appeared to the world to belong, and for giving notice of such incumbrance, or, otherwise, take the risk of its loss in case it should be sold and conveyed as a part of the real estate to a purchaser without notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Nor, so far as we see, is there any want of consistency in the ruling as to the two cases. The machinery furnished by The Case Manufacturing Co., did not, from the manner of its use and mode of annexation, become a part of the realty. The effect of the agreement was, not to preserve its character of personalty \u2014 it would have retained this character without the agreement \u2014 but to prevent the title passing from the vendor to the purchaser until the property had been paid for; and if there is any apparent want of justice in giving effect to the agreement as against a purchaser without notice, it is in the rule itself, and not in the application of it. Not so however, as to the machinery that constituted the motive power; this, as we have shown, was so annexed, that, but for the agreement, it would have been a fixture, and so a part of the realty \u2022 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>the agreement could not take effect without that being regarded as personalty which would otherwise be realty; and it is giving effect to such agreement as against innocent purchasers, that, as said in the case just referred to, is regarded as against the policy of our registration laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Judgment modified so as to give priority to The Case Manufacturing Company over the mortgages of the realty in the distribution of the fund, and affirmed as to all else.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
