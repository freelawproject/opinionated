Meuser eutered upon the duties of said trust as secretary of said Citizen\u2019s Building Association of Gabon, Ohio. Plaintiff further says that prior to the sixth day of April, A. D. 1880, a constitution and by-laws were adopted by said association, and the same were in full force between the first day of January, A. D. 1881, and is still in force, subject, however, to certain amendment to the constitution of said association as hereinafter stated. By the provisions of the said constitution and by-laws of said Citizen\u2019s Building Association of Gabon, the person so elected, and before entering upon the duties of his said office and trust was required to give bond to said association in said sum of $5,000 for the faithful performance of his duties as such secretary. The said J. G. Meuser, after his election as secretary of said association, as aforesaid, and before entering upon said trust, made and executed his bond, a copy of which is hereinbefore set forth, with the said defendants, S. G. Cummings and F. Kuhn, as sureties on said bond. By the terms and conditions of said bond said defendants promised, agreed and bound themselves in the sum of $5,000, that the said J. G.

D. 1-881, was elected and qualified as such secretary, and between the sixth day of April, 1880, and the 20th day of January, 1881, said J. G. Meuser received large sums of money belonging to said plaintiff, to-wit: the sum of $2,488, and said J. G.

Section one of article four of the constitution of said Citizens\u2019 Building Association of Galion, Ohio, was amended by the unanimous vote of all the shareholders of said association (more than two-thirds of all the shareholders of 'said association being present) ; said section one, article four of the constitution of said association was so- amended and adopted as to read as follows, to-wit: c The officers of this association shall consist of a president, secretary, treasurer, and seven' directors, one of whom shall be president, and all of whom must be shareholders.

Green was duly elected by the board of directors of said association, as treasurer of said association for a period of two years, and that said James H.

G Meuser, former secretary of said association, that he pay over to them, for the use of said plaintiff, the said sum of $2,488, the amount of money which came into his hands by virtue of his office of secretary of said association during the period aforesaid. That said J. G. Meuser neglected and refused to pay over for the use of said plaintiff said sum of $2,488 or any part thereof; that said plaintiff then, through its authorized agents James H. Green and George Snyder, demanded of said defendants, S. G. Cummings and F. Kuhn, as sureties of said J. G. Meuser on said bond, that they pay over for the use of said plaintiff the same of $2,488, the amount received by said J. G. Meuser as secretary of said association during the period aforesaid ; that said S. G. Cummings and F. Kuhn neglected and refused to pay over said sum of money or any part thereof, though often requested so to do; that the said defendants, upon demand made, refused to deposit said sum of money or any part thereof in the treasury of said association or to pay the same over to the treasurer of said association or its proper officers, or to pay to said plaintiff said money so received by said J. G. Meuser, as secretary of said association, although often requested so to do. Whereby an action has accrued to the plaintiff against said defendants on said written obligation according to the conditions therein written. Wherefore, the said plaintiff demands a judgment against said defendants, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>said sum of $2,488, with interest thereon from the twentieth day of January, A.

This being an official bond, unlike an undertaking, is required to be under seal, and falls directly within the principle laid down in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Allmen, </em>19 Ohio St. 485, which case has not been qualified, as claimed by counsel for plaintiff in error, in <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Simington, </em>37 Ohio St. 484 and <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>38 Ohio St. 375.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-9\">In both the latter cases the instrument upon which suit was brought was an undertaking which, unlike a <em>bond, </em>was not required to be under seal.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-10\">An undertaking is not a bond. <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Simington, </em>37 Ohio St. 486.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-11\">A code undertaking need not be under seal; it ranks as a parol contract merely. <em>State </em>v. <em>Boring, </em>15 Ohio, 507; <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>5 Ohio, 222; <em>Fullerton </em>v. <em>Sturges, </em>4 Ohio St. 529.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b697-12\">2. It is not directly averred in the petition that the money came into the hands of the secretary of the association by virtue of his office. This is important because the defendants (if they are held to have executed the bond) have the right to insist upon a strict construction of their obligation, which is that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>they shall be holden for such moneys <em>\u201c </em>as may come into his hands by virtue of his office.\u201d Therefore a petition which does not so state is bad on demurrer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-5\">It is true that the petition elsewhere argumentatively and inferentially sets out that the money came into his hands by viriue of his office, \u201cbut such pleading is objectionable on demurrer.\u201d Boone Code Pl. 5; Story Eq. Pl. sec. 4, <em>n.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-6\">3. The obligation of the defendants as sureties is fixed by the instrument itself, and cannot be enlarged or changed. Sureties have the right to stand on the strict letter of their obligation, which cannot be enlarged, nor by implication extended to something not covered by the strict language of the contract itself. <em>State </em>v. Medary, 17 Ohio, 565; <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Pike, </em>27 Ohio St. 501; <em>State </em>v. <em>Cutting, </em>2 Ohio St. <em>1; McGovney </em>v. <em>State, </em>20 Ohio, 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-7\">The obligations which the sureties undertook that their principal should perforin were that he should deposit the moneys received with the Citizens\u2019 National Bank of Galion (which by the constitution was created perpetual treasurer of the association), within twenty-four hours after their roceipt. They undertook to be responsible for nothing more.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b698-8\">They did not agree that he should pay to some one who might be appointed to receive the money; nor that he should pay on demand to an officer created after his term of office expired and unknown to the constitution as it existed at the time the bond was signed. They did not agree that he would turn the money over to his successor in office. They only agreed that he should deposit the money in bank within twenty-four hours of receiving it. It is not averred in the petition nor claimed by the plaintiff that the bond was broken in this respect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b698-9\">Dickman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AXl\">The first question presented for our consideration is, was it material to the validity of the bond, as against the sureties, that they should be named in the body of the instrument. It is clear from the terms of the instrument, that it was the intention to hold and firmly, bind those who might duly execute it. In <em>Partridge </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>38 Ohio St. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>375, it is held that to charge one as obligor, who has signed a bond or written undertaking, it is not necessary that his <em>name </em>should appear in the body of such instrument, provided the intention that he shall be so charged appears clearly from its terms, taken in connection with the circumstances attending its execution. And the language of Brinkerhoff J. in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Allmen, </em>19 Ohio St. 485, indicating a contrary rule, has been disapproved in <em>McLain </em>v. <em>Simington, </em>37 Ohio St. 484. Indeed the principle is established by numerous adjudications, that if a surety, in witness of his obligation to perform certain covenants and conditions, has affixed his hand and seal to the instrument, and delivered it as his bond, it is adequate to bind him, although his name is not mentioned in any part of the body of the bond, but a blank intended for it is left unfilled. How<em>ell </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>89 N. C. <em>230; Vanhook </em>v. <em>Barnett, </em>4 Dev. (Law), 268; <em>Danker </em>v. <em>Atwood, </em>119 Mass. 146; <em>Ahrend </em>v. <em>Odiorne, </em>125 Mass. 50; <em>Scheid </em>v. <em>Liebshultz, </em>51 Ind. 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">The Building association, by virtue of the act of May 5, 1868 (65 Ohio L. 137), was organized as provided in sections 63, 64 and 65 of the act of May 1, 1852 (S. <em>&amp; </em>C. 304); and section 64 provides that the officers appointed by the directors of the corporation, shall, <em>\u201c </em>when required by the by-laws, give bond to the satisfaction of the directors, for the faithful discharge of the trust committed to them.\u201d It is contended that by the word bond, as used in the statute, is to be understood a common law bond, with its most indispensable characteristic, a seal, and not an undertaking as provided for in the code, and which is not required to be under seal. It is claimed that although S. G. Cummings and F. Kuhn signed the instrument, there being no seal or scroll affixed to either of their names, it is not their bond, and therefore they are not liable as sureties.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-6\">There is but one seal to the bond signed by the defendants in <em>error; </em>but, it is not essential that there should be as many separate seals annexed to a bond as there are signers, as two or more among any number of signers may adopt one seal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>whereby the obligation will become an instrument sealed by all. As it was said in <em>Lord Lovelace\u2019s Case </em>(Sir. Wm. Jones, 268): \u201cIf one of the officers of the forest put one seal to the rolls, by assent of all the verderers, regarders, and other officers, it is as good as if every one had put his several seal, as in case divers men enter into an obligation, and they all consent and set but one seal to it, it is a good obligation of them all.\u201d See Perkins, sec. 134; Shep. Touch. 55; <em>Ball </em>v. <em>Dunsterville, </em>4 T. R. 313; <em>Mackay </em>v. <em>Bloodgood, </em>9 John. 285; <em>New Orleans, etc. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Burke, </em>53 Miss. 200, 231.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">It is argued that one seal may be adopted by several signers only when the names of all are inserted as obligors in the body of the instrument; but we do not think that the rule is to be thus limited, nor is the rule to be treated as inapplicable to the class of instruments denominated official bonds. In <em>Pequawkett Bridge </em>v. <em>Mathes, </em>7 N. H. 230, the bond declared on was signed by the four individuals who were defendants in the suit, and also by Young who was the last signer; but there were only four seals affixed to the signatures, and Young\u2019s name was not mentioned in the bond, though it appeared to have been once inserted, and to have been afterwards erased. But the bond contained the usual allegation, \u201c sealed with our seals,\u201d and the court was of opinion, that when Young put his name to the instrument, he must be considered as having adopted one of the seals already affixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">And in <em>Bradford </em>v. <em>Randall, </em>5 Pick. 496, an assessors\u2019 warrant was made out and signed by the assessors, with one seal affixed while they were together, and concluding with, \u201c given under our hands,\u201d without adding <em>\u201c </em>our seals.\u201d The court drew a distinction between private deeds and warrants executed by virtue of some special authority, holding it necessary in the latter case that the authority should be strictly pursued. Morton,.J., says: \u201c This brings us to the inquiry whether this warrant was sealed in the manner required by the statute. Assessors have no common seal. And the form of the warrant given in the statute clearly indicates that it should be under their several seals as well as signatures. But it contains no indication that their seals shall be on sep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>arate pieces of wax or wafer, any more than that they shall be on the same. The initials L. S. used in the form, may at least as well stand for <em>locus sigillorum </em>as for <em>loci </em>sigillorum.\u201d See also <em>Bank of Cumberland </em>v. <em>Bugbee, </em>19 Me. 27, an action of debt on the bond of a bank cashier; and <em>Northumberland v. Cobleigh, </em>59 N. H. 250, an action of debt on the bond of the defendant, as collector of the plaintiff town.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Did the defendants in error adopt the seal or scroll affixed to the name of J. G. Meuser ? Whether they did or not, was a question of fact for the jury, to be determined upon proper issue joined, the burden being on the plaintiff to show the adoption. The defendants did not raise an issue of fact by plea of <em>non est factum, </em>or by answer denying that they sealed the writing sued on, but demurred to the petition, and admitted all allegations well pleaded. It was held in <em>Northumberland v. Cobleigh, supra, </em>that when the bond contains the usual attestation clause, \u201csealed with our seals,\u201d the law will intend that all the signers adopt one seal. And in <em>Bohannons </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>3 T. B. Mon. 376, the language of the court is, \u201c When an instrument with one seal and two or more signers, is alleged to be sealed by all, the court on demurrer is not authorized to infer from there being but one seal, and f.wo or more signers, that but one in fact sealed the instrument; and the party who contends that it is not his' seal, must reach the fact by way of plea, controverting the allegation ; and as one seal may be the seal of many signers, the court, from the bare inspection of the paper and declaration cannot decide that it is the segl of one only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">It is alleged in the original petition that J. G. Meuser, S. G. Cummings and E. Kuhn, \u201cmade their certain\u2018 writing obligatory \u201d ; that it was given by Meuser to and accepted by the board of directors of the Building Association. The bond itself sets forth that the obligors thereby bound themselves, their heirs and legal representatives \u2014 with the recital added, \u201c sealed with our seals.\u201d The petition further alleges that Meuser, after his election as secretary and before entering upon the trust, executed his bond, with the defendants Cummings and Kuhn as sureties; and that by the terms and coir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>ditions of the bond, the defendants bound themselves in the sum of $6,000 that Meuser should faithfully perform the duties pertaining to the office of secretary of the association, etc. The language of the bond, -when considered in connection \u2018with the allegations of the petition, may reasonably be said to imply that the instrument was sealed by all who signed it. The error assigned in <em>Penson </em>v. <em>Hodges, </em>Cro. Eliz. 737, was, that the plaintiff declared that the defendant <em>\u201c </em>acknowledged himself bound by his writing obligatory,\u201d without saying, <em>\u201c </em>sealed with his seal.\u201d Gowdy, J., said, that the declaration was well enough, for when the plaintiff saith, <em>\u201c </em>by his writing obligatory he acknowledged himself to be bound,\u201d all necessary circumstances are intended to concur, viz., the sealing and delivering of the deed; for otherwise it is not a writing obligatory. The declaration in <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>6 Vt. 40, did not, in terms, allege that the bond was signed and scaled, but it declared on the defendant\u2019s <em>writing obligatory. </em>These words, it was held, imply in law a deed, and include sealing. And Sargeant Williams in his notes to Saunder\u2019s Rep., vol. 1, p. 291, says that there are some words of art, such as <em>writing obligatory, </em>which of themselves, import that the instrument was sealed by the party, without an averment of sealing. <em>\u201c </em>If therefore the declaration states that J. S. by his <em>writing obligatory </em>acknowledges, etc., without averring that he sealed, still the declaration is good.\u201d See also <em>Ashmore </em>v. <em>Rypley, </em>Cro. Jac. 420. In <em>Hollis </em>v. <em>Pond, </em>7 Humph. (Tenn.), 222, there were four seals to the bond, and nine signatures. The declaration alleged that all the parties sealed the covenant. The defendants craved oyer of the covenant and demurred. It was the opinion of the court that where there is a greater number of signatures than seals, it must be doubtful on the face of the paper\u2019, whether it be not the deed of all the <em>parties; </em>but the probability that it is the deed of all, is increased where the instrument uses the words, \u201c witness our hands and seals,\u201d which may be looked to as a circumstance to explain the intention of the parties. <em>\u201c </em>But,\u201d says Green, J., <em>\u201c </em>to have sustained the demurrer would have excluded all investigation as to the question, whether the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>ties adopted the seals of other obligors; and would have been a determination that they did not. This the court should not do, where the question is doubtful, and must depend on proof. The demurrer was, therefore, properly overruled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The case as reported, shows no conflict between the decision in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Allmen, supra, </em>and the views we have advanced in reference to the sealing of bonds. We find no copy or full d\u00e9scription of the obligation upon which the action against Allmen was founded, and can not, therefore, determine whether its language would import that the bond was sealed by all who signed it. Indeed, it does not appear in the case, that the question as to the adoption of the seals of the original sureties by the subsequent signers, was in any manner presented or considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">And it is proper here to observe that whether, upon all the allegations in the original petition there should not have been an issue of fact for the jury as to the adoption or otherwise by S. G. Cummings and E. Kuhn of the seal opposite the signature of J. G. Meuser, is a question which, as we are advised, was not urged upon or considered by the circuit court, in affirming the judgment of the court of common pleas and sustaining the demurrer to .the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">It is urged in argument that it is not directly averred in the petition that the money came into Meuser\u2019s hands by virtue of his office as secretary, nor, that there was a failure to deposit the money in bank within twenty-four hours of receiving it, and that, therefore, the demurrer was properly sustained. We think it unmistakably appears, from allegations in the petition, that the sum of $2,488, was received by the secretary between April 6, 1880 and January 20, 1881, in his official <em>capacity; </em>and that the assignment of breach of condition in the bond was sufficiently certain to show the subject matter of complaint, and to apprise the defendants what they were called upon to answer. <em>State </em>v. <em>Caffee, </em>6 Ohio, 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">\n<em>Judgment of the court of common pleas and circuit court reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
