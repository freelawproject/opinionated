EVANS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AOJh\">Plaintiff in error was convicted and sentenced uppn an indictment charging him, among other things, with having purchased from \u201cpersons unknown, <em>in the city of </em>Chicago, a quantity of cocaine hydrochloride,\u201d in violation of the so-called Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act. Comp. St. \u00a7\u00a7 6287g-6287q. Support for the conviction rests entirely upon the presumption which arose from De Moss\u2019 possession of such narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-26\">Section 1 of the act reads: \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any person to purchase, * * * any of the aforesaid drugs except in the original stamped package or from the original stamped package; and the absence of appropriate tax-paid stamps from any of the aforesaid drugs shall be prima facie evidence of a violation of this section by the person in whose possession same may be found.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-27\">Counsel for plaintiff in error contends that the government failed to prove the venue; that the presumption referred to in the foregoing section does not extend to the <em>place </em>of purchase. The precise question has been considered and very fully treated in Bright-man v. United States (C. C. A.) 7 F.(2d) 532, and with the ultimate conclusion there reached we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1045-28\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
