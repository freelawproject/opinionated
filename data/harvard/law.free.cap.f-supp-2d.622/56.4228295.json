PRESKA, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">This Opinion concerns the extent of a cargo buyer\u2019s liability in the context of maritime disaster litigation. The buyer here, ESM Group, Inc. (\u201cESM Group\u201d), purchased 900 tons of a granulated magnesium-based desulphurization reagent, known by the trade name \u201cSuper-Sul Mg-89\u201d (\u201cSS-89\u201d), from its wholly-owned subsidiary, ESM (Tianjin) Co., Ltd. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>(\u201cESMT\u201d). While en route on the high seas, the SS-89 allegedly caused or contributed to an explosion and fire aboard the MTV RICKMERS (the \u201cRICKMERS\u201d), the transporting vessel. The vessel owners (the \u201cRickmers Interests\u201d) and entities that owned or insured other <em>cargo </em>aboard the RICKMERS (the \u201cCargo Interests\u201d) have sued ESM Group, in its individual capacity and as an alter-ego of ESMT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the Cargo Interests and Rickmers Interests assert claims against ESM Group based in common law negligence, common law strict liability, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (\u201cCOGSA\u201d), breach of contract, and alter-ego theories of liability.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">ESM Group now moves for summary judgment, seeking to dismiss all claims asserted against it. The Cargo Interests and the Rickmers Interests (the \u201cNon-Moving Parties\u201d) oppose that motion.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the reasons set forth below, the motion is GRANTED in part and DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">1. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">The following facts are derived from the affidavits, Rule 56.1 Statements, testimony, and exhibits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> All facts are construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>and all reasonable inferences are drawn in favor of the Non-Moving Parties. <em>See infra </em>Part II.B.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">ESM Group is a New York limited liability corporation organized under the laws of Delaware. (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 39; Rickmers 56.1 Stmt, at f 39; O\u2019Con-nor Aff. at \u00b6 6.) Prior to 2005, ESM Group was affiliated with a group of related companies consisting of ESM II Inc., ESM II L.P., and ESM Manufacturing, L.P. (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 40; Rickmers 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 40; Batz Dep. 32:3-13; MeyerGrunow Dep. 58:17-60:14, 90:10-12.) The ESM companies have or have had plants in several locations around the United States and abroad. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 6.) They produce a family of magnesium desulphurization reagent products, including SS-89. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7-8.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">SS-89 is \u201c[u]sed as a desulphurizing reagent in steelmaking ... [and] is designed to be injected into molten iron ore to remove sulphur and make the steel less brittle. Because it removes sulphur and consists of approximately 89% magnesium, it is regularly identified under the English language trade name \u2018Super-Sul Mg-89.\u2019 \u201d (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 3.) Magnesium based products liberate hydrogen gas when in contact with water, especially sea or salt water. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 26, Lee Dep. 199:3-24; Schwede Dep. 174:4-175:16.) Hydrogen gas is flammable and susceptible to exploding. (Schwede Dep. 174:4-15; O\u2019Connor Aff., Ex. 27.) According to a Material Safety Data Sheet (\u201cMSDS\u201d) prepared by ESM Manufacturing L.P., SS-89 poses \u201cunusual fire and explosion hazards\u201d and should be kept dry and away from water and moisture. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 30, Ex. 27.)</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In 1996, ESM Group created ESMT in Tianjin, China, allegedly in order to save production costs, obtain lower prices for materials previously imported by ESM Group, and avoid U.S. anti-dumping regulations concerning the manufacture of SS-89. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 7-11; Meyer-Grunow Dep. 49:13-51:15; ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at f 42; Lee Dep. 13:13-14:8; Batz Dep. 34:21-36:6; Rotella Dep. 34:10-18.) ESMT is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESM Group and a limited liability corporation organized and existing under the laws of the People\u2019s Republic of China. (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 41-42; Rickmers 56.1 Stmt, at f 41^2.) ESM Group established the ESMT plant, trained ESMT personnel, transferred equipment from U.S. sites to the ESMT plant, and provided ESMT with the formula for SS-89. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>(O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10, 13-18; Lee Dep. 14:12-15:24; Batz Dep 36:14-37:8, 138:16-139:10; Meyer Grunow Dep. 53:9-19.) ESM Group brought ESMT\u2019s engineers and plant manager to the United States for technical and corporate training. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 13; Batz Dep. 138:16\u2014 25; Meyer-Grunow Dep. 53:9-19.) ESM Group\u2019s CEO became President of ESMT. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 12; Batz Dep. 47:16-21.) ESMT\u2019s Board of Directors included, at times exclusively, ESM Group employees. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 12; Meyer-Grunow Dep. 88:7-89:20.) ESM Group directly paid ESMT\u2019s raw materials suppliers. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 19; Batz Dep. 96:8-97:19; Zhou Zhou Tr. at 33, 135-36.) ESM Group executives regularly visited the ESMT plant to monitor its operations, manufacturing, and shipping procedures. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, Exs. 10-12; Lee Dep. 28:16-23; Meyer-Grunow Dep. 55:15-56:13, 58:3-16; Rotella Dep. 70:17-23,117:1-6.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When ESM Group desired a shipment of SS-89 from ESMT, ESM Group would send ESMT a Purchased Material Service Specification outlining the chemical and physical make-up of the desired product. <em>(See </em>O\u2019Connor Aff. at 17, Ex. 9.) Aside from these purchase orders, ESM Group and the related U.S. companies corresponded with ESMT managers about altering the chemical composition of SS-89 to ESM Group\u2019s requirements. <em>(See, e.g., id., </em>Exs. 8,10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Sometime in or around 2000, ESM Group created and provided ESMT with a sample MSDS for the SS-89 product. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 32; Rotella Dep. at 64:9-65:3; Bell Dep. 36:20-37:6.) Although ESM Group alleges that it \u201cdid not get involved in providing recommendations to [EMST] regarding safety measures in the production, storage or transportation of products which [ESMT] produces\u201d (Dillon Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 7, 13), ESM Group, acting through its predecessor ESM II, directed ESMT to include its own MSDS for shipments of SS-89 and requested test data on the product from ESMT before shipments were to be made. (O\u2019Connor Aff., Exs. 9, 12.) ESMT created its own MSDS for magnesium granules but apparently never created an MSDS for SS-89. (Zhou Zhou Tr. at 94-99, Exs. 93-94, 108; Bell Dep. 41-43, 50-56.) ESMT\u2019s plant manager acknowledged that ESMT would have distributed an MSDS for SS-89 upon ESM Group\u2019s instruction to do so. (Rickmers January 22, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at 2, \u00b6 9; Zhou Zhou Tr. at 93.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">In 2005, all of ESMT\u2019s production of SS-89 was sold to ESM Group, and ESM Group would not allow ESMT to sell SS-89 to other buyers. (Rickmers January 22, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at 2, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Zhou Zhou Tr. at 189-93.) Of the other products ESMT produced, only half were sold to buyers other than ESM Group. <em>(Id.) </em>As such, 85% of ESMT total production was sold or supplied to ESM Group. <em>(Id.; see also </em>O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 11, 20; ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 42; Batz Dep. 38:7-22; Rotella Dep. 34:10-18; Donnelly Dep. 293:13-22.) ESMT\u2019s net profits in 2004 and 2005 were $10,000 and $45,000, respectively. (Rickmers January 22, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at \u00b6 2, 5; Zhou Zhou Tr. at 37, 40; Ex. 82.) ESMT did not report the payments ESM Group made to ESMT\u2019s raw material suppliers as taxable income. (Rickmers January 22, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at 2, \u00b6 8; Zhou Zhou Tr. at 238-39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">On or about January 25, 2005, ESM Group sent ESMT a purchase order for 900 metric tons of SS-89, C.I.F.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Balti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>more. <em>(See </em>Dillon Aff. at \u00b6 2, Ex. A; ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 1.) ESMT arranged for the SS-89 to be shipped from the ESMT Tianjin plant to the United States aboard the RICKMERS. (Dillon Aff. at \u00b6 16.) ESMT contracted with Pudong Trans U.S.A., Inc. (\u201cPudong\u201d), a Non-Vessel Owning Common Carrier (\u201cNVOCC\u201d), to transport the SS-89 from the Tianjin plant to port in Xingang, China, where the RICKMERS<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> was docked. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16-17.) On or about March 3, 2005, Pudong issued ESMT a bill of lading identifying ESMT as the shipper and identifying \u201cTo Order of Shipper\u201d as the consignee. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 16, Ex. F; O\u2019Connor Aff., Ex. 15.) Pudong then contracted with the Rickmers Interests to have the RICKMERS carry the SS-89 from China to Camden, New Jersey. (Dillon Aff. at \u00b6 17.) Sometime thereafter, the Rickmers Interests issued a bill of lading identifying Pudong as the shipper and identifying U.S. Shipping, Inc. (\u201cU.S. Shipping\u201d) as the consignee. <em>(Id., </em>Ex. G; O\u2019Connor Aff., Ex. 16.) U.S. Shipping was to act as an intermediary NVOCC and releasing agent in the United States, apparently tasked to transport the SS-89 from Camden to Baltimore. <em>(See </em>O\u2019Con-nor Aff. at \u00b6 21; Liu Dep. 19.) There is no evidence ESMT informed any of these entities about the risks associated with transporting SS-89 by sea; ESMT also did not provide an MSDS. (O\u2019Connor Aff. at \u00b6 31.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">On or about March 2, 2005, ESMT placed 600 metric tons of SS-89, of the 900 total metric tons ordered, into sacks. (Dillon Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 5, 14-15; ESM Group 56.1 Stmt. at \u00b62.) ESMT tested the sacks to ensure they complied with U.S. Hazardous Material Regulations \u201cdangerous when wet\u201d criteria. (Dillon Aff. at \u00b6\u00b6 8, 10.) Based on fresh-water testing, the results were normal and within U.S. regulatory standards. <em>(Id. </em>at 11.) ESMT placed the packages into containers. <em>(Id. </em>at 15.) Pu-dong apparently picked up the containers and delivered them to the Xingang port that same day. On or about March 3, 2005, the containers were loaded aboard the RICKMERS into Hold No. 1. (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b6 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">On March 8, 2005, after having departed the Xingang port and apparently stopping at other Chinese ports, the RICKMERS collided with the SUN CROSS in foggy weather in the Yellow Sea. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 15.) The RICKMERS suffered damage to her forward double-hull plating, and flooding occurred in Hold No. 1. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 17.) Approximately four hours after the collision, an explosion occurred in Hold No. 1, and a fire ensued. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 19.) The containers of SS-89 were totally lost. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 20.)</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On April 11 and 12, 2005, a representative from ESM Group faxed the director of the ESMT plant instructions to remove certain language about fire and explosion hazards from ESMT\u2019s MSDS for magnesium granules. (Zhou Zhou Tr. at 96-101; Exs. 93-94.) ESMT complied with ESM Group\u2019s instructions and prepared a revised MSDS for magnesium granules. <em>(Id. </em>at 100:8-11, Ex. 108.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>On December 31, 2005, ESM Group became the corporate successor in interest of ESM II Inc. and ESM II L.P., both of which ceased to exist upon their merger into ESM Group. (ESM Group 56.1 Stmt, at \u00b640; Rickmers 56.1 Stmt, at 8, \u00b640; Meyer-Grunow Dep. 90:10-12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\n<em>A. Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The complaints invoke this Court\u2019s admiralty subject matter jurisdiction. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333(1). They allege that cargo loss and damage occurred aboard the RICKMERS while it was serving as a common carrier of merchandise on the high seas. Accordingly, subject matter jurisdiction is proper because the damages alleged here occurred on navigable waters and arise from traditional maritime activity. <em>See Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co., </em>513 U.S. 527, 534, 115 S.Ct. 1043, 130 L.Ed.2d 1024 (1995); <em>see also Foremost Ins. Co. v. Richardson, </em>457 U.S. 668, 674-75, 102 S.Ct. 2654, 73 L.Ed.2d 300 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The defendants do not contest personal jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\n<em>B. Summary Judgment Standard</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Summary judgment should be granted only if there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The moving-party bears the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine dispute of fact on each material element of the claims asserted. <em>See Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 323, 106 S.Ct. 2548; <em>see also FDIC v. Giammettei, </em>34 F.3d 51, 54 (2d Cir.1994). The substantive law governing the suit identifies the essential elements of the claims asserted and therefore indicates which facts are material. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255-56, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). If the moving party carries her burden, the non-moving party must then \u201cset out specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e). Mere allegations or denials from the pleadings will not be sufficient to defeat summary judgment; instead, the non-moving party \u201cmust set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 256, 106 S.Ct. 2505. The court must grant summary judgment \u201cif, under the governing law, there can be but one reasonable conclusion as to the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-13\">To determine whether such an issue of fact exists, a court must review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and draw all reasonable inferences in her favor. <em>See Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 586, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986); <em>Lucente v. Int\u2019l Bus. Machs. Corp., </em>310 F.3d 243, 253 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Matsushita, </em>475 U.S. at 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348). \u201cSupporting and opposing affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(e).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\n<em>C. The Claims \u25a0 Asserted Against ESM Group</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The Non-Moving Parties apparently assert the following claims against ESM Group: (1) common law negligence claims (general negligence and failure to warn), (2) a common law strict liability claim, (3) Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (\u201cCOGSA\u201d) claims, (4) a breach of contract claim, and additionally, (5) agency and veil piercing theories of liability.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">However, I first note that the Non-Moving Parties have not provided a coherent choice of law analysis for determining what law should apply to these claims. The Non-Moving Parties have at various times advocated for the application of New York law, Delaware law, and federal maritime common law. As all parties now appear to agree that federal maritime common law applies, <em>compare </em>ESM Group\u2019s January 22, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at 3 &amp; n. 1, <em>with </em>Rickmers\u2019s January 27, 2009 Supplemental Letter Brief at 3, I will apply federal maritime common law in reviewing the claims in these consolidated actions. <em>See In re Holborn Oil Trading, </em>774 F.Supp. 840, 843 (S.D.N.Y.1991) (concluding that the parties\u2019 \u201cimplied consent concludes the choice of law inquiry\u201d); <em>see also Kirno Hill Corp. v. Holt, </em>618 F.2d 982, 985 (2d Cir.1980) (concluding that invocation of federal courts\u2019 maritime jurisdiction tends to result in the application of federal maritime common law).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">Additionally, I understand the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 position to be that claims 1-1 are asserted against ESM Group in its individual capacity <em>and </em>as an alter-ego of ESMT. As such, I will first consider claims 1-1 treating ESM Group and ESMT as separate corporate entities, not in an agency relationship. This treatment is proper because piercing the corporate veil and agency determinations should not be assumed but rather require consideration independent from the substantive merits analyses of asserted claims. <em>See infra </em>note 23. Then, in Part II.C.5, <em>infra, </em>I will consider whether the relationship between ESMT and ESM Group warrants piercing the corporate veil or concluding that they were principal and agent. To the extent that either of those findings is warranted, ESM Group may be liable for the breach of contract, torts, or other liabilities of ESMT.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-11\">\n<em>1. Federal Maritime Common Law Negligence Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">The Non-Moving Parties assert general negligence and failure to warn claims against ESM Group. <em>See </em>Rickmers\u2019s March 25, 2008 Supplemental Letter Brief (\u201cThe failure to warn claim is based on the dangerous characteristics of the [SS-89] that were known to ESM Group ... but not to [the Rickmers Interests]. The negligence claim is based, among other things, on the failure to test the product for its reaction to sea (salt) water as opposed to distilled water.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">Under the federal maritime common law, a C.I.F. buyer traditionally owes the carrier and fellow cargo interests no tort-based duty to warn of risks associated with the buyer\u2019s purchased cargo. Nor do buyers owe carriers and fellow cargo interests general duties of care. <em>See Aslanidis v. U.S. Lines, Inc., </em>7 F.3d 1067, 1077 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]mposing liability on the purchaser of goods would be both unjustified and illogical.\u201d); <em>Di Gregorio v. N.V. Stoomvaart Maatschappij </em>\u201cNederland\u201d, 411 F.Supp. 331, 335 (S.D.N.Y.1975) (noting in the context of an F.O.B. contract that \u201c[a] buyer normally has no duty under the law to supervise the seller in the process of producing or packing the purchased goods\u201d). These rules derive from the common law of torts, which primarily imposes duties only in relation to a party\u2019s actions or conduct that foreseeably causes harm or damage. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Third) of Torts \u00a7 7(a) and commentary (discussing the duty of care owed by \u201can actor\u201d); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 18 and commentary (emphasizing that a duty to warn may arise only in relation to a defendant\u2019s \u201cconduct\u201d). Since C.I.F. buyers do not arrange for the carriage of their goods and tend to have little, if any, contact with the carrier and fellow cargo interests before and during the carriage, imposing tort-based duties on C.I.F. buyers would be particularly odd. In other words, plaintiffs can rarely point to an \u201cact or omission on the part of [a C.I.F. buyer] that was negligent.\u201d <em>Aslanidis, </em>7 F.3d at 1076.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Accordingly, courts sitting in common law have tended to reject buyer liability theories. <em>See Excel Shipping Corp. v. Seatrain Int\u2019l S.A., </em>584 F.Supp. 734, 747 (E.D.N.Y.1984) (concluding that no negligence action may lie against a buyer whose purchased goods may have caused damage aboard a vessel during shipment); <em>Atkins, Kroll &amp; Co. v. Nedlloyd Line, </em>210 F.Supp. 315, 317 (N.D.Cal.1962) (\u201cAs between carrier, shipper, and consignee, the consignee would be least likely to possess the necessary knowledge to have avoided any difficulty arising from improper packaging.\u201d); <em>Garcia v. Sunbelt Trading (Kansas), Inc., </em>No. 04-01-00435-cv, 2003 WL 179763, at *2 (Tex.App. Jan. 29, 2003) (concluding that a buyer owes no duty of care to longshoremen to protect against harm caused by the buyer\u2019s purchased goods). The Non-Moving Parties have pointed this Court to no authority to the contrary.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">Some cases have intimated that a buyer\u2019s duty might lie if the buyer had unique knowledge or control over its purchased cargo. For example, in <em>Aslanidis, </em>the court reiterated the rule that a \u201cbuyer <em>normally </em>has no duty under the law to supervise the seller in the process of producing or packing the purchased goods,\u201d but apparently left open the possibility that a buyer <em>might </em>have a duty if it is in a unique position to protect against harm or warn of known risks. 7 F.3d at 1077 (internal quotation marks omitted, emphasis added). Similarly, in <em>DiGregorio, </em>the court noted that the \u201conly conceivable reason for imposing some additional duty on [the buyers] might be some circumstance putting [the buyers] on notice of inability or incompetence on the part of [the shipper] to do the proper packing.\u201d 411 F.Supp. at 335.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Irrespective of whether these statements are correct as a matter of law, I am not persuaded that ESM Group owed a duty to the Non-Moving Parties here. ESM Group did not manufacture, package, or ship the SS-89 cargo that was ultimately stowed aboard the RICKMERS. And even though ESM Group may have been significantly involved in the day to day operations of ESMT, there is no evidence that ESM Group had any involvement in the preparation or shipment of the particular SS-89 cargo that allegedly caused the damages in this case. The mere fact that ESM Group had general knowledge about the characteristics of SS-89 is insufficient to qualify ESM Group\u2019s purchase of the SS-89 shipped aboard the RICKMERS as duty-conferring conduct or action within the meaning of the common law of torts. Accordingly, no tort-based duty may properly be imposed on ESM Group.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">In declining to impose a tort-based duty on ESM Group, I also take into consideration that the Non-Moving Parties have failed to provide any authority declaring a C.I.F. buyer owed tort-based duties to carriers or cargo interests. The dearth of cases is noteworthy and reflects the common law\u2019s settled and efficient allocation of liability among the various parties typically involved in maritime shipping arrangements. In order to promote predictability in commercial dealings, I decline to fashion a new theory of buyer liability today. <em>See generally Senator Linie GMBH &amp; Co. KG v. Sunway Line, Inc., </em>291 F.3d 145, 169 (2d Cir.2002) (emphasizing the importance of predictability in maritime law); <em>DiGregorio, </em>411 F.Supp. at 335 (\u201cTo impose a duty upon a purchaser of goods to exercise surveillance over the packaging by the seller would be a totally unjustified interference with normal and sound commercial practice.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">Accordingly, I find ESM Group owed no duty to the Non-Moving Parties under the facts of this case. The Non-Moving Parties\u2019 negligence claims asserted against ESM Group are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\n<em>2. Federal Maritime Common Law Strict Liability Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The Non-Moving Parties also argue that ESM Group should be held strictly liable under the federal maritime common law for the damage aboard the RICKMERS allegedly caused by the SS-89 cargo that ESM Group purchased. But, again, the Non-Moving Parties offer no authority supporting their theory of C.I.F. buyer strict liability. Merely pointing to ESM Group\u2019s knowledge of SS-89\u2019s dangerous characteristics is insufficient as a matter of law to support imposing strict liability on a C.I.F. buyer. For many of the same reasons I rejected the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 common law negligence claims, I decline to fashion a new common law strict liability claim for buyers of dangerous goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">I note that the Court of Appeals has recently clarified the law of <em>shipper </em>strict liability for accidents relating to the shipment of dangerous goods. <em>See In re M/V DG Harmony, </em>533 F.3d 83 (2d Cir.2008); <em>Senator Linie, </em>291 F.3d 145. The Court of Appeals has indicated that COGSA is the exclusive means for suing cargo shippers in this context. <em>See Senator Linie, </em>291 F.3d at 168 (\u201c \u2018[T]he exclusive application of COGSA cannot be avoided by couching claims in terms of negligence or other common law causes of action.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Miller Export Corp. v. Hellenic Lines, Ltd., </em>534 F.Supp. 707, 710 (S.D.N.Y. 1982))). But the Court of Appeals\u2019s analysis cannot and should not be applied wholesale to <em>buyers </em>of dangerous goods, and I see no reason to fashion a new theory of liability today.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 strict liability claims asserted against ESM Group are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\n<em>8. Liability under COGSA \u00a7\u00a7 4(3) and (6)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The Non-Moving Parties contend that ESM Group may be found liable under COGSA \u00a7\u00a7 4(3) and (6).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> COGSA represents \u201cthe culmination of a multilateral effort to establish uniform ocean bills of lading to govern the rights and liabilities of carriers and shippers <em>inter se </em>in international trade.\u201d <em>Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S.A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, </em>515 U.S. 528, 537, 115 S.Ct. 2322, 132 L.Ed.2d 462 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). COGSA limits carriers\u2019 and shippers\u2019 freedom of contract by essentially inserting certain mandatory liability rules into these parties\u2019 bills of lading. <em>Id. </em>at 547, 115 S.Ct. 2322 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\u201c[COGSA] allows a freedom of contracting out of its terms, but only in the direction of <em>increasing </em>the [carrier\u2019s] liabilities, and never in the direction of diminishing them. This apparent onesidedness is a commonsense recognition of the inequality in bargaining power ... [and] is [meant] to prevent the impairment of the value and negotiability of the ocean bill of lading.\u201d (emphasis in original)).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">According to COGSA \u00a7 4(3), \u201cThe shipper shall not be responsible for loss or damage sustained by the carrier or the ship arising or resulting from any cause without the act, fault, or neglect of the shipper, his agents, or his servants.\u201d COGSA \u00a7 4(6) provides,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-11\">Goods of an inflammable, explosive, or dangerous nature to the shipment whereof the carrier, master or agent of the carrier, has not consented with knowledge of their nature and character, may at any time before discharge be landed at any place or destroyed or rendered innocuous by the carrier without compensation, and the shipper of such goods shall be liable for all damages and expenses directly or indirectly arising out of or resulting from such shipment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah\">ESM Group argues that these sections are inapplicable to cargo buyers like itself, because COGSA speaks only of carriers and <em>shippers. </em>The Non-Moving Parties argue that the term \u201cshipper\u201d in COGSA should be interpreted to include buyers.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">As with all interpretive endeavors, the language of the statute is controlling. COGSA defines certain terms, but does not define \u201cshipper.\u201d <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 30701 note \u00a7 1. The Court of Appeals has tended to interpret COGSA according to its plain meaning. <em>See Senator Linie, </em>291 F.3d at 154. The common dictionary meaning of shipper is a \u201cseaman\u201d or \u201c[o]ne who ships goods for transportation.\u201d <em>Oxford English Dictionary </em>(2d ed. 1989). A major maritime treatise defines a shipper as, \u201c[t]he person or company who is usually the supplier or owner of commodities shipped,\u201d or the \u201cConsignor.\u201d Richard J. Nikas, <em>Technical Glossary, </em>at 64 <em>in </em>8 <em>Benedict on Admiralty </em>(7th rev. ed. 2008). \u201cConsignor\u201d is defined as a \u201cperson or company shown on the bill of lading as the shipper.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 22. Other noted commentators distinguish shippers from con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>signees. <em>See </em>1 Thomas J. Schoenbaum, <em>Admiralty and Maritime Law </em>\u00a7 10-22 (4th ed. 2004). And at least one authority has noted that the international rules on which COGSA was based proceed on the assumption that \u201c[t]he original party to the bill of lading other than the carrier is generally the named shipper.\u201d <em>See </em>Sir Richard Aikens <em>et al, Bills of Lading </em>\u00a7 7.71 (2006). <em>Cf </em>U.C.C. \u00a7 7-102(a)(12) (\u201c \u2018Shipper\u2019 means a person that enters into a contract of transportation with a carrier.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">Thus, according to a plain language interpretation of the term, a COGSA shipper is whomever the carrier contracted with, as evidenced by their bill of lading. The plain language of COGSA does not bear the interpretation proposed by the Non-Moving Parties <em>here </em>\u2014 viz., that a third-party buyer who never contracted with a carrier may qualify as a shipper for COG-SA purposes.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The Non-Moving Parties urge me to disregard the plain meaning of the term \u201cshipper\u201d and instead use the definition in the Shipping Act of 1984 (the \u201cShipping Act\u201d)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 a definition that is much broader than the plain meaning of the term permits and which includes consignees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Non-Moving Parties point to some cases that have apparently employed Shipping Act definitions to define COGSA terms. For example, in <em>Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. M/V Tokyo Senator, </em>a suit by a carrier asserting COGSA claims against the seller, buyer, and NYOCCs of cargo containing certain chemicals, the district court used the Shipping Act definition to find that all three defendants qualified as shippers. Nos. 95 Civ. 3303 &amp; 96 Civ. 0008, 2001 WL 238293, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 09, 2001).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Also, in <em>Scholastic Inc. v. M/V Kitano, </em>a district court applied Shipping Act definitions to COGSA terms. 362 F.Supp.2d 449, 456-57 (S.D.N.Y.2005). The Non-Moving Parties also point to <em>SAT Int\u2019l Corp. v. Great White Fleet (US) Ltd., </em>which they suggest supports their theory that the Shipping Act definitions may be used interchangeably with COGSA terms. No. 03 Civ. 7481, 2006 WL 661042, at *6 &amp; n. 7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2006) (unreported).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-11\">I am reluctant to adopt Shipping Act definitions for purposes of interpreting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>COGSA terms because the Shipping Act limits the applicability of its definitions elsewhere. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102 (limiting the definitions included therein with the prefatory language, \u201cIn this part [of the U.S. Code] ... \u201d). Statutory exegesis rules require consideration of statutory context when interpreting identical terms. <em>See Atl. Cleaners &amp; Dyers, Inc. v. United States, </em>286 U.S. 427, 433, 52 S.Ct. 607, 76 L.Ed. 1204 (1932) (cautioning against assigning the same meaning to identical words used in different statutes when \u201cthe scope of the legislative power exercised in one [statute] is broader than that exercised in another\u201d); <em>accord Envtl. Def. v. Duke Energy Corp., </em>549 U.S. 561, 574, 127 S.Ct. 1423, 167 L.Ed.2d 295 (2007). While the Court of Appeals has indeed looked to Shipping Act terms for guidance in the context of COGSA analyses, <em>see Senator Linie </em>and <em>Rexroth, </em>it has yet to analyze whether the Shipping Act definition of <em>shipper </em>should be used for COGSA purposes. I conclude that it should not.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">The Shipping Act is fundamentally a regulatory regime that serves two primary goals: providing antitrust immunity to ocean carriers who form Shipping Conferences and creating new tools for shipper-interests to obtain better services and lower rates from carriers. <em>See generally </em>1C <em>Benedict on Admiralty, </em>ch. II, \u00a7\u00a7 9-18; Peter A. Friedmann <em>&amp; </em>John A. Devierno, <em>The Shipping Act of 1981: The Shift from Government Regulation to Shipper \u201cRegulation\", </em>15 J. Mar. L. <em>&amp; </em>Com. 311, 313-14, 320 (1984). The Shipping Act is administered by the Federal Maritime Commission (the \u201cFMC\u201d). <em>See Fed. Mar. Comm\u2019n v. S. Carolina State Ports Auth., </em>535 U.S. 743, 774-75, 122 S.Ct. 1864, 152 L.Ed.2d 962 (2002). The FMC is tasked with reviewing shipping agreements so as to regulate rates and services offered to the shipper market. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 40301-40307; Friedmann &amp; Devierno, <em>supra, </em>at 327-28; <em>see also </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40101 (describing the purposes of the Act as regulating common carriage of goods and providing an efficient economic transportation system). The Shipping Act also provides tools to <em>potential </em>shippers in order to improve their bargaining position when they shop for carriers. <em>See </em>Friedmann &amp; Devierno, <em>supra, </em>at 344. With this context in mind, it is not surprising that Congress defined \u201cshipper\u201d broadly so as to encompass the shipper market as a whole, as opposed to identifiable shippers who have already contracted with identifiable carriers. <em>See also </em>1C <em>Benedict on Admiralty, </em>ch. Ill, \u00a7 12A (noting that the recodification of the Shipping Act at 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102 defines shipper \u201cbroadly\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">In any event, the Shipping Act was not meant to affect maritime parties\u2019 rights and liabilities for purposes of civil litigation. Plaintiffs may not sue under the Shipping Act unless and until they have lodged a complaint with the FMC and an investigation has been concluded. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 41306(a); <em>see also F.W. Myers Co. v. World Projects Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>903 F.Supp. 353, 355-56 (N.D.N.Y.1995). And even then, plaintiffs may only sue for injunctive relief in accordance with an FMC investigation. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 41306(c); <em>see also Port Auth. of New York &amp; New Jersey v. Maher Terminals, LLC, </em>No. Civ. 08-2334, 2008 WL 2354945, at *3 (D.N.J. June 3, 2008) (\u201c[N]o provision of the Shipping Act of 1984 provides a federal cause of action for violations of the Act.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">COGSA, on the other hand, <em>does </em>affect maritime parties\u2019 rights and liabilities for purposes of civil litigation. COGSA is fundamentally concerned with efficiently and equitably allocating the contractual rights and obligations of carriers and shippers who have actually contracted with each other. <em>See Senator Linie, </em>291 F.3d at 158. COGSA invalidates carriers\u2019 onerous limit-</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>ed-liability provisions in their bills of lading, which are essentially contracts of adhesion because carriers historically have exercised dominant bargaining power. <em>See M/V Sky Reefer, </em>515 U.S. at 543-44, 115 S.Ct. 2322. As such, COGSA establishes rules that overlay bills of lading between carriers and their identifiable contracting partners \u2014 usually suppliers and consignors, as the plain meaning of the term \u201cshipper\u201d suggests. Unlike the Shipping Act, COGSA provides no textual support for broadening the plain meaning of the term \u201cshipper\u201d to include non-contracting third-parties or potential shippers. The text of COGSA does not even mention buyers or consignees, let alone \u201cthe person for whose account the ocean transportation of cargo is provided\u201d or \u201cthe person to whom delivery is to be made.\u201d <em>Cf. </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7 40102(22).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, I find the Shipping Act\u2019s definition of shipper particularly ill-suited for purposes of determining who should be subject to COGSA\u2019s shipper rules. <em>Cf. Madonna Shipping Servs., Inc. v. Mediterranean Shipping Co. S.A., </em>No. 06 Civ. 1200, 2007 WL 2775138, at *3 &amp; n. 2 (S.D.N.Y.

Feb. 23, 2007) (unreported) (applying the plain meaning definition of shipper over the Shipping Act definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">Here, ESM Group did not contract with the Rickmers Interests, <em>see infra </em>Part II. C.4, and was a mere consignee. ESMT, on the other hand, through Pudong, contracted with the Rickmers Interests and thus qualifies as the shipper in this case. For these reasons, I find that COGSA imposes rights and obligations on ESMT, but not on ESM Group. Accordingly, the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 COGSA claims asserted against ESM Group are dismissed.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\n<em>L Contract Liability</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ArL\">The Rickmers Interests assert a breach of contract claim against ESM Group.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Additional facts about the bills of lading are necessary to evaluate this claim. As noted above, ESMT arranged for Pudong to pick up the SS-89 at the Tianjin plant and transport it to the Xingang port. From there, the RICKMERS was to deliver the cargo to the United States. On or around March 3, 2005, Pudong picked up the SS-89 from the Tianjin plant. Pudong issued ESMT a bill of lading identifying ESMT as the \u201cshipper/exporter\u201d and identifying \u201cTo Order of Shipper\u201d as the \u201cconsignee.\u201d <em>(See </em>O\u2019Connor Aff., Ex. 15.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>The bill also identified the RICKMERS as the transporting \u201cvessel.\u201d <em>(Id.) </em>The bill required the \u201cMerchant\u201d to inform the carrier in writing of the exact nature of dangerous goods and reprinted COGSA\u2019s dangerous goods strict liability provisions for shippers. <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6(l)-(2).) The bill defined \u201cMerchant\u201d to include \u201cthe shipper, the Consignor, the Holder of this Bill of Lading, the Receiver and the Owner of the Goods.\u201d <em>(See id. </em>at \u201cDefinitions\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Once Pudong delivered the SS-89 to the RICKMERS, the Rickmers Interests issued Pudong a bill of lading identifying Pudong as the \u201cshipper,\u201d U.S. Shipping, Inc. as the \u201cconsignee,\u201d and the RICKMERS as the \u201cvessel.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>Ex. 16.) That bill provided that \u201cthe Merchant shall indemnify the Carrier against all claims, losses, damages or expenses arising in consequence of the Carriage of [dangerous] Goods.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>\u00b6 19(3).) The bill defined \u201cMerchant\u201d to include \u201cthe Shipper, Holder, Consignee, Receiver of the Goods or of this Bill of Lading, any Person owning or entitled to the possession of the Goods or this Bill of Lading and anyone acting on behalf of any such person.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at \u201cDefinitions\u201d.)</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">The Rickmers Interests argue that, pursuant to the definitional sections of the Pudong and Rickmers bills of lading, ESM Group qualifies as a \u201cMerchant\u201d and thus should be bound to the terms of both contracts. The Rickmers Interests also argue that they were a party to the Pu-dong bill of lading and can enforce its terms against ESM Group and ESMT. Accordingly, the Rickmers Interests argue that both ESM Group and ESMT are obligated to indemnify the Rickmers Interests for the loss allegedly caused by the SS-89 cargo and are liable for their failure to warn the Rickmers Interests about the known dangers of shipping SS-89. (Rickmers Opp\u2019n Mem. at 7-8.) ESM Group counters that it was never a party to either bill of lading, irrespective of what the definitional sections say, and made no representations to the Rickmers Interests. (ESM Mem. at 17.)<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Having already determined that federal maritime common law applies to the claims in this case, I will look to common law principles of contract formation and interpretation to determine whether ESM Group was bound by the bills of lading. <em>See Norfolk S. Ry. Co. v. Kirby, </em>543 U.S. 14, 31, 125 S.Ct. 385, 160 L.Ed.2d 283 (2004) (\u201c[C]ontracts for carriage of goods by sea must be construed like any other contracts: by their terms and consistent with the intent of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">The Court of Appeals has reaffirmed the common law principle that a party is not bound to the terms of a bill of lading unless the party consents to be bound. <em>Stein Hall &amp; Co. v. S.S. Concordia Viking, </em>494 F.2d 287, 291 (2d Cir.1974); <em>see also Excel Shipping, </em>584 F.Supp. at 748 (\u201cTo enforce the bill of lading provisions against [a non-party buyer] ... would have the anomalous result of creating a greater scope of liability for a consignee having no active participation in the shipment of goods than for the shipper itself.\u201d).

Waterman S.S. Corp., </em>471 F.2d 186, 189 n. 4 (5th Cir.1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">Of course, common law third-party beneficiary principles may be applicable when interpreting bills of lading. Generally, the Restatement says that to the extent a third-party qualifies as an intended beneficiary,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it may enforce contract terms in its favor. Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 304 (1981). However, qualifying as an intended beneficiary in no way <em>creates </em>contractual obligations on the part of the intended beneficiary. <em>See, e.g., Stein Hall, </em>494 F.2d at 291 (\u201cWhile the carrier and the shipper can extend certain contractual protections, such as the limitation on damages, to stevedores as third-party beneficiaries, they cannot contract to bind an unconsenting third party.\u201d (citation omitted)). As one court has noted, the two primary methods for actually binding an intended beneficiary to a bill of lading are showing that the third party exhibited acceptance to be so bound and through an agency relationship with one of the contracting parties. <em>Taisheng Int\u2019l Ltd. v. Eagle Mar. Servs., Inc., </em>No. Civ. A. H-05-1920, 2006 WL 846380, at *4 (S.D.Tex. Mar. 30, 2006) (unpublished). Absent such a showing, contractual obligations cannot be imposed on an intended beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">With these general contract rules in mind, I note that courts have differed in their interpretation of the types of so-called Merchant Clauses that were included in the Pudong and Rickmers bills of lading. Some courts have held that when a third-party who falls within a Merchant Clause sues on a bill of lading, the third-party in effect accepts the bill of lading and becomes a party to the contract. <em>See, e.g., Polo Ralph Lauren, L.P. v. Tropical Shipping &amp; Constr. Co., </em>215 F.3d 1217, 1222 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>All Pac. Trading, Inc. v. Vessel M/V Hanjin Yosu, </em>7 F.3d 1427, 1431-32 (9th Cir.1993)). Some courts have been more circumspect with their terminology and hew more closely to third-party beneficiary principles. <em>See, e.g., EIMSKIP v. Atl. Fish Mkt., Inc., </em>417 F.3d 72, 78 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that the \u201c \u2018merchant\u2019 definition in the bill of lading \u2014 although it probably embraces [the buyer-plaintiff] \u2014 arguably is not binding on someone who was not (in some fashion) a party to the bill of lading or otherwise accepted [its] obligationfs]\u201d). The Court of Appeals has not addressed the binding effect of Merchant Clauses in bills of lading. For the purposes of this Opinion, I will follow the general contract rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Here, although ESM Group likely falls within the scope of both Merchant Clauses, there is no evidence that ESM Group consented to be bound by either bill of lading. ESMT and Pudong were the contracting parties to the Pudong bill of lading. Similarly, Pudong and the Rickmers Interests were the contracting parties to the Rickmers bill of lading. There is no evidence ESM Group was a party to either bill or consented to be bound to their terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">While ESM Group, as the cargo purchaser and ultimate consignee, may certainly have been an intended third-party beneficiary, that status alone is insufficient to warrant a finding that ESM Group was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>bound to comply with the Merchant\u2019s obligations as described in both bills of lading. Accordingly, I find that ESM Group was not bound by the bills of lading and the Rickmers Interests\u2019 contract claim asserted against ESM Group is dismissed.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\n<em>5. Federal Maritime Common Law of Agency and Veil Piercing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In their memoranda and at oral arguments, the Non-Moving Parties assume or cursorily conclude that ESM Group and ESMT are sufficiently related to hold each liable for the other\u2019s torts, contracts, and statutory obligations. <em>{See </em>Rickmers Opp\u2019n Mem. 13; <em>see also </em>Cargo Opp\u2019n Mem. at 5-6.) In this regard, the Non-Moving Parties apparently propose that I apply corporate veil piercing and agency theories in order to extend ESMT\u2019s liability to ESM Group. (Rickmers Opp\u2019n Mem. at 13 nn. 4-6.) ESM Group counters by arguing that its status as a C.I.F. buyer and parent corporation vitiates any legal basis for extending ESMT\u2019s liability to ESM Group. ESM Group also argues that the Non-Moving Parties should be precluded from raising agency and veil piercing theories in this case because the Non-Moving Parties insufficiently pleaded those theories in their Complaints. I address these arguments in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">\n<em>a) The Norir-Moving Parties\u2019 Agency Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Federal maritime common law embraces principles of agency. <em>See Dow Chem. Pac. Ltd. v. Rascator Mar. S.A., </em>782 F.2d 329, 339-43 (2d Cir.1986); <em>Kirno Hill, </em>618 F.2d at 985. In specifying the contours of federal maritime common law agency principles, courts of this Circuit have looked to the Restatement (Second) of Agency (1958). <em>See, e.g., Dow Chem., </em>782 F.2d at 340; <em>Interocean Shipping Co. v. Nat'l Shipping &amp; Trading Corp., </em>523 F.2d 527 (2d Cir.1975) (apparently applying New York law and federal maritime common law, as stated by the district court in 462 F.2d 673, 676 n. 6, but relying primarily on the Restatement).<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u201cAn agency relation exists only if there has been a manifestation by the principal to the agent that the agent may act on his account, and consent by the agent so to act.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 15; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 1 (agency generally). \u201c[Authority to do an act can be created by \u25a0written or spoken words or other conduct of the principal which, reasonably interpreted, causes the agent to believe that the principal desires him so to act on the principal\u2019s account.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 26; <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 34 (circumstances considered in interpreting authority). A principal has the power to control the agent\u2019s conduct regarding matters entrusted to the agent. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">An undisclosed principal is bound by contracts made on the principal\u2019s behalf by an agent acting within the scope of the agent\u2019s authority. <em>See Dow Chem., </em>782 F.2d at 339; <em>Kirno Hill, </em>618 F.2d at 985; <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 186. And a principal may be liable for the torts committed by her agent. <em>See generally </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency, ch. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">ESM Group contends that by the express terms of a C.I.F. sale, contractual parties cannot qualify as agents. (ESM Reply Mem. at 13.) This contention is untenable as a matter of law because agency depends not on contractual formalities but on whether an agreement was made between principal and agent to the effect that the agent will act on the principal\u2019s account. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7 1 cmt. b (\u201cThe relation which the law calls agency does not depend upon the intent of the parties to create it, nor their belief that they have done so. To constitute the relation, there must be an agreement, but not necessarily a contract, between the parties; if the agreement results in the factual relation between them to which are attached the legal consequences of agency, an agency [relationship] exists although the parties did not call it agency and did not intend the legal consequences of the relation to follow.\u201d). In other words, because agency is determined according to extant factual circumstances, a contractual disclaimer or acknowledgement of agency is not dispositive for purposes of determining whether an agency relationship exists as a matter of law. <em>See Interocean, </em>523 F.2d at 537. In this regard, I also reject ESM Group\u2019s argument that the absence of its identification as the consignee in the Pudong bill of lading vitiates ESM Group\u2019s alleged agency relationship with ESMT. <em>{See </em>ESM Reply Mem. at 13-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Here, a genuine factual issue exists as to whether ESM Group and ESMT agreed that ESMT would act on ESM Group\u2019s account. ESM Group established ESMT apparently for the sole purpose of manufacturing SS-89 and its component parts. ESM Group paid ESMT\u2019s material suppliers directly, tending to prove that ESMT was acting primarily for ESM Group\u2019s account. (Zhou Zhou Tr. at 239.) Particularly probative is the evidence that ESM Group had the power to direct ESMT to alter its MSDS for magnesium granules, that ESM Group limited ESMT\u2019s ability to sell to other buyers, and that ESMT would have distributed an MSDS for the shipments of SS-89 if ESM Group had instructed ESMT to do so. (Zhou Zhou Tr. at 93-99, Ex. 93.) ESM Group and ESMT were not acting as arms-length contracting parties, and I find significant indicia of ESM Group\u2019s control over ESMT.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The C.I.F. terms of the January <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>25, 2005 purchase order are not dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">At a minimum, the Non-Moving Parties have presented evidence to present a genuine issue for trial concerning whether ESM Group and ESMT had a principal/agent relationship. Accordingly, ESM Group\u2019s motion for summary judgment, as to the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 agency theory, is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\n<em>b) The Ncm-Moving Parties\u2019 Veil Piercing Theory</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Under the federal maritime common law, courts may pierce the corporate veil when a parent so dominates and disregards a subsidiary\u2019s corporate form that the subsidiary primarily transacts the parent\u2019s business rather than its own business. <em>See Kirno Hill, </em>618 F.2d at 985. Courts are reluctant to pierce a corporate veil but may do so when presented with a particularly egregious case of domination and control. <em>See N. Tankers (Cyprus) Ltd. v. Backstrom, </em>967 F.Supp. 1391, 1401-02 (D.Conn.1997). In determining whether sufficient domination and control existed to warrant piercing a corporate veil, courts have considered fifteen factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-8\">(1) common or overlapping stock ownership between parent and subsidiary; (2) common or overlapping directors and officers; (3) use of same corporate office; (4) inadequate capitalization of subsidiary; (5) financing of subsidiary by parent; (6) parent exists solely as holding company of subsidiaries; (7) parent\u2019s use of subsidiaries\u2019 property and assets as its own; (8) informal intercorporate loan transactions; (9) incorporation of subsidiary caused by parent; (10) parent and subsidiary\u2019s filing of consolidated income tax returns; (11) decision-making for subsidiary by parent and principals; (12) subsidiary\u2019s directors do not act independently in interest of subsidiary but in interest of parent; (13) contracts between parent and subsidiary that are more favorable to parent; (14) non-observance of formal legal requirements; (15) existence of fraud, wrongdoing or injustice to third parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 1402; <em>see also Williamson v. Recovery Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>542 F.3d 43, 53 (2d Cir. 2008) (\u201cInstead of a firm rule, the general principle guiding courts in determining whether to pierce the corporate veil has been that liability is imposed when doing so would achieve an equitable result.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). No one factor is required. <em>See Backstrom, </em>967 F.Supp. at 1402. As is evident from the above listed factors, a showing of fraud may assist in a court\u2019s decision to pierce the corporate veil but is not required. <em>Id.; Dow Chem., </em>782 F.2d at 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">Here, the evidence presented raises triable issues as to whether piercing the corporate veil is warranted. The Non-Moving Parties have pointed to the facts that: ESMT is a wholly-owned subsidiary of ESM Group and may have been created to circumvent U.S. import laws or obtain lower prices for certain materials previously imported by ESM Group; ESM Group directors sit on ESMT\u2019s board, sometimes constituting the entire ESMT board; ESM Group provides substantial financing to ESMT; ESM Group designed ESMT\u2019s plant to manufacture SS-89 and supplied the capital, machinery, and expertise necessary to start the operation; ESM Group developed the specifications for SS-89, gave that formula to ESMT, and instructed ESMT personnel on how to make SS-89; ESM Group conducts oversight of ESMT production facilities and proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>dures; a significant majority of ESMT\u2019s output is sold to ESM Group, and ESM Group fulfills its SS-89 needs from ESMT; although apparently sufficiently capitalized, ESMT\u2019s net profits were comparatively small in 2004 and 2005. This evidence tends to show that ESMT was transacting ESM Group\u2019s business rather than its own business. Taking this evidence as a whole, it is sufficient to create a triable issue as to whether veil piercing is warranted in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Accordingly, ESM Group\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, as to the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 veil piercing theory, is denied.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">\n<em>c) The Sufficiency of the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 Pleadings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">ESM Group complains of the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 failure to plead agency and veil piercing theories in their Complaints. I note that the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 Complaints did in fact include allegations that ESM Group and ESMT had an agency relationship <em>(see </em>Chem One Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 14, 19, 28, 37), and that the two entities were \u201crelated companies\u201d (see Rickmers Compl. at \u00b6 10). Even if these allegations failed to put ESM Group on notice of the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 theories of liability, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a), I find that the Non-Moving Parties should be entitled to amend their Complaints in light of the evidence adduced in consideration of this Motion for Summary Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">In its seminal pronouncement on when leave to amend should be granted, the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-10\">If the underlying facts or circumstances relied upon by a plaintiff may be a proper subject of relief, he ought to be afforded an opportunity to test his claim on the merits. In the absence of any apparent or declared reason \u2014 such as undue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of amendment, etc. \u2014 the leave sought should, as the rules require, be \u201cfreely given.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b116-11\"><em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962); <em>accord Kaster v. Modification Sys., Inc., </em>731 F.2d 1014, 1018-19 (2d Cir.1984). ESM Group primarily argues that leave to amend should not be granted because the Non-Moving Parties have failed to comply with ESM Group\u2019s contention interrogatories. However, I find that although the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 responses to the interrogatories were vague, ESM Group was not unduly prejudiced by these deficiencies. Particularly because I find that the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 agency and alter-ego theo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ries survive ESM Group\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment, leave to amend is warranted in order to aid this Court in testing the claims on the merits. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 15(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-4\">Therefore, the Non-Moving Parties are hereby granted leave to amend their complaints to include veil piercing and agency allegations only.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">III. <em>CONCLUSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">For the reasons stated herein, ESM Group\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment [dkt. no. 84 (4261 action) ] is DENIED in part and GRANTED in part.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The Non-Moving Parties\u2019 negligence, strict liability, COGSA, and contract claim asserted against ESM Group are dismissed.

The Non-Moving Parties also argue that ESM Group did, in fact, contract with the carrier here, the RICKMERS. I reject that argument in Part II.C.4, <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b108-7\">. <em>See </em>46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 40101-41309. The Shipping Act was formerly codified at 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 1701-1719. <em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 98-237, 98 Stat. 67.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b108-8\">. According to the Shipping Act \u00a7 40102(22), \"[t]he term 'shipper' means \u2014 (A) a cargo owner; (B) the person for whose account the ocean transportation of cargo is provided; (C) the person to whom delivery is to be made; (D) a shippers\u2019 association; or (E) a non-vessel-operating common carrier that accepts responsibility for payment of all charges applicable under the tariff or service contract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b108-9\">. In reviewing the decision, the Court of Appeals recognized that the district court used the Shipping Act definition of shipper for COGSA purposes, but vacated the district court\u2019s decision on other grounds. <em>Senator Linie, </em>291 F.3d at 150 &amp; n. 5. In other words, the Court of Appeals had no reason to analyze the portion of the district court\u2019s opinion applying the Shipping Act definition and merely iterated, in dicta, what the district court had done. Accordingly, <em>Senator Linie </em>is of no precedential value on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-13\">Additionally, although the Non-Moving Parties do not cite it, I note that in another case the Court of Appeals looked to Shipping Act definitions. <em>See Rexroth, </em>547 F.3d at 357 (applying the Shipping Act definitions of \"common carrier\u201d and \"non-vessel-operating common carrier\u201d). However, in that case the Court of Appeals had no reason to analyze the appropriateness of using the Shipping Act definition of <em>shipper </em>for a COGSA analysis. Thus, <em>Rexroth </em>is also of no precedential value on this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b110-4\">.Of course COGSA does not <em>prohibit </em>binding such parties to bills of lading or prevent contracting parties from agreeing that buyers or consignees shall have the same rights and obligations as shippers under COGSA. <em>See </em>Aikens, supra, at \u00a7 7.72 (\"[T]he bill [of lading] does not always evidence a contract between the carrier and the named shipper.... [I]t may be the case that [] the bill of lading evidences a contract with someone other than the named shipper, for example, the consignee ----\"). As such, determining whether a third-party buyer or consignee was actually bound to a bill of lading is a matter of contract construction and must be accomplished by examining the terms of bills of lading. <em>See infra </em>Part II.C.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b110-9\">. Because I conclude that COGSA does not apply to ESM Group, I have not reached the questions of (1) whether cargo interests have standing to bring claims under COGSA, <em>see In re DG Harmony, </em>533 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2008), (2) whether SS-89 qualifies as a dangerous good under COGSA, or (3) what knowledge, if any, the Rickmers Interests had about SS-89 at the time of the accident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b110-10\">. The Cargo Interest Plaintiffs have not asserted a breach of contract claim against ESM Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b111-7\">. Furthermore, ESM Group disputes the allegation that ESMT contracted on behalf of ESM Group as its agent. As explained above and in Part II.C.5, <em>infra, </em>I consider the Non-Moving Parties' agency theory of liability to be conceptually distinct from the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 contract and tort claims. Accordingly, for the purposes of this Part\u2019s analysis, I evaluate the contract claim treating ESM Group as a distinct entity and not in a principal/agent relationship with ESMT.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b112-6\">. Unless otherwise agreed to by the contracting parties, an intended beneficiary is any</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-7\">beneficiary of a promise ...

The Rickmers Interests also apparently contend that ESM Group made warranties and negligent misrepresentations, apart from anything contained in the Rickmers and Pu-dong bills of lading. <em>{See </em>Rickmers Compl. at \u00b6\u00b6 34-38). However, no evidence has been offered tending to show that ESM Group ever warranted or represented anything to the Rickmers Interests. To the extent that the Rickmers Interests maintain these claims against ESM Group, they are also dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Additionally, in light of my conclusion that ESM Group was not bound to the Pudong bill of lading, I need not address the Rickmers Interests' argument that they were a party to the Pudong bill of lading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\">. As an aside, I reject the Non-Moving Parties\u2019 argument that I should automatically assume an agency relationship existed between ESM Group and ESMT. It is true that intermediaries, such as NVOCCs, may be assumed to be acting as agents for shippers, but only insofar as the agent contracts to limit carriers' liability downstream. <em>See Norfolk, </em>543 U.S. at 33, 125 S.Ct. 385. Agency is only to be assumed in this limited context, and the assumption does not extend to consignor/consignee relationships. The Non-Moving Parties have supplied no authority from the Second Circuit that supports such an extension. And objective commentators reject it. <em>See </em>Julian Cooke <em>et al., </em>Voyage Charters \u00a7 18.77 (3d ed. 2007) (\"[T]he general rule is that a party who procures shipment for the ultimate benefit of a consignee does not thereby contract with the carrier as agent of the consignee.\u201d). If taken literally, the notion that consignors and consignees can be assumed to be in a principal/agent relationship would expose consignees to potentially limitless liability for the conduct and contracts of their consignors. Clearly that cannot be the case. Rather, agency theories of liability must be considered on a case-by-case basis and should not be assumed. Accordingly, a proper analysis of the relationship between ESM Group and ESMT must be conducted before determining whether ESMT\u2019s liability may be extended to ESM Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\">. I have reviewed Mr. Zhou's testimony, offered to show that ESMT was not controlled by ESM Group. <em>{See, e.g., </em>Zhou Zhou Tr. at 190.) Taking the evidence in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>favorable to the Non-Moving Parties and without making a credibility determination, Mr. Zhou's testimony is insufficient to meet ESM Group's summary judgment burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b116-7\">. In addition to their veil piercing theory of liability, the Non-Moving Parties apparently intend to assert a separate alter-ego theory. (Rickmers Opp\u2019n Mem. at 13 n. 5.) However, the Non-Moving Parties have failed to argue that this theory exists under the federal maritime common law. The cases the Non-Moving Parties cite in their memoranda do not apply federal maritime common law and thus do not stand for the proposition that the federal maritime common law embraces an alter-ego theory distinguishable from the veil piercing theory. <em>See </em>Rickmers Opp\u2019n Mem. at 13 n. 5 (citing <em>Goodman Piping Prods., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>741 F.2d 10 (2d Cir.1984); <em>Jacobson v. Metro. Switchboard Co., Inc., </em>No. 05-CV-2224, 2007 WL 1774911 (E.D.N.Y. June 18, 2007) (unreported)). In light of the Non-Moving Parties' dearth of authority, I doubt whether an alter-ego theory is cognizable under the federal maritime common law. <em>Cf. Wm. Passalacqua Builders, Inc. v. Resnick Developers S., Inc., </em>933 F.2d 131, 138 (2d Cir. 1991) (concluding that under <em>New York law, </em>the piercing the corporate veil and alter-ego theories are \u201cindistinguishable\u201d). Accordingly, to the extent the Non-Moving Parties intend to assert an alter-ego theory separate from veil piercing, it is dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b117-19\">.
