Conversion of Mortgaged Property \u2014 Nonresident.\u2014When a nonresident debtor has property in this State, a resident creditor can proceed directly against the property to collect his debt; and where a third party converts to his own Use property on which there is a lien, the creditor can proceed against him for the value of the property, not to exceed a sufficient amount to pay such debt.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b434-10\">2.

The act of the defendant in converting said property to his own use is a trespass; and appellant being thereby unable to foreclose his lien on said property, may bring his action for the trespass, sue for the conversion of the property, or waive the last and sue for money had and received, as against the defendant, who was a wrongdoer. The plaintiff was entitled to the possession of said property, out of which to satisfy his lien. Veck v. Holt, 71 Texas, 715; 1 Add. on Torts, 544.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-6\">2. The court erred in sustaining special exceptions to plaintiff\u2019s amended account, wherein it is contended that said account is bad, because the same fails to show defendant in possession of any portion of the mortgaged cotton, and because the mortgagor is not a party to this suit; because the plaintiff in this case is not seeking to foreclose said mortgage, but really attempting to recover the same from a tort feasor, or who, himself being a trespasser, has no right to demand that Delk be made a party to this suit. Delk does not become a necessary party to any suit until the plaintiff seeks to foreclose his lien against Delk, which he is not doing in this case. Boydston v. Morris, 71 Texas, 698; Veck v. Holt, 71 Texas, 715; 1 Add. on Torts, 544-548.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-7\">No brief for appellee reached the Reporter.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-8\"><em>Davis &amp; McKay, </em>for appellee\u2019s motion for rehearing,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJN\">cited: Parker v.

(2) Because Delk was not made a party to the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-12\">In the Justice Court judgment was rendered for plaintiff, and the cause appealed to the County Court, where, upon the trial, the general and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>special demurrers were sustained, and judgment rendered for Beasley, from which Williams appeals to this court. The assignments of error relate to the ruling of the trial court on demurrers.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b436-9\">Delivered November 29, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<otherdate id=\"b436-10\">Motion for rehearing overruled February 14, 1894.</otherdate>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">We are of the opinion that said ruling was erroneous. It is well settled, that when a nonresident debtor has property in this State, a resident creditor can proceed directly against the property to collect his debt. It is also settled, that where a third party converts to his own use property on which there is a lien, the creditor can proceed against him for the value of the property, not to exceed a sufficient amount to pay such debt. Boydston v. Morris, 71 Texas, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">The plaintiff alleged that Delk was insolvent; that he was a nonresident; and also that defendant Beasley had converted the mortgaged property. We think these allegations show a good cause of action. The exceptions should have been overruled. Veck v. Holt, 71 Texas, 715.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
