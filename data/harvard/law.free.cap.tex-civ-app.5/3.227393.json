Disqualification of Judge \u2014 Trespass to Try Title. \u2014 A judge who is in possession of the land involved in a suit of trespass to try title, claiming adversely to the plaintiffs therein, is disqualified from trying the case, although he is not a party to the suit and his own title is not directly in issue.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b29-5\">2. Same \u2014 Disqualification not Waived. \u2014 Where the interest of the judge in the subject matter of the suit was not discovered by plaintiff until after trial begun, their failure to make him a party to the suit would not change the rule; and such disqualification being made to appear in a motion for new trial, the judgment, although correctly rendered oh the merits of the case, was reversed and the cause remanded.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b29-6\">Appeal from Wilbarger.

Railway, 72 Texas, 476.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b29-13\">STEPHENS, Associate Justice.</author>\n<p id=\"Ae\">At the threshhold of this case is the question of the disqualification of the judge before whom it was tried. In the motion for a new trial, which was verified by the affidavit of appellants\u2019 attorney, it was alleged, that the judge trying the case was in possession of and claiming title to the land in controversy under a title adverse to that of appellants; and that appellants\u2019 counsel was not aware of this until after the trial had begun and the case was nearly disposed of, when he was made acquainted with the facts by the judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-15\">In overruling this motion, the court found and adjudged the facts it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>contained to be true, but held that they did not disqualify him as judge in the case. The question for us to determine, then, is, was he \u201c interested \u2019 \u2019 within the meaning of that word as used in our Constitution? Const., art. 5, sec. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-3\">That the person in possession of land had an interest in the result of an ejectment suit, though not a party thereto, was recognized by the English courts in the early history of that action. In order to prevent the abuses resulting from \u201cclandestine ejectments,\u201d the rule was established, that no plaintiff should proceed in ejectment to recover the land against a casual ejector, unless notice of the suit was first given to the. tenant in possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">The principle of this ancient and wholesome rule is still recognized in our action of trespass to try title, substituted for that of ejectment. Article 4790 of the Revised Statutes provides: \u201cThe. defendant in the action shall be the person in possession, if the premises are occupied, or some person claiming title thereto, in case they are unoccupied.\u201d It may be urged that the occupant\u2019s title can not be affected by a suit to which he is not a party, and that the judgment therein would not conclude his rights when set up in another suit. Neither was the judgment in the action of ejectment conclusive upon the title or right of property, even between the parties; but as each ouster was a separate trespass, the action could be repeated and the same question retried indefinitely. The possession only was recovered. And yet, two centuries ago, Chief Justice Holt deemed it a precedent worthy of perpetuation in law literature, that \u201c The mayor of Hereford was laid by the heels for sitting in judgment in a case where he himself was lessor of the plaintiff in ejectment, though he, by the charter, was sole judge of the court.\u201d It will be remembered that the lessor of the plaintiff was not a party to the suit, though his title was the foundation to the action, which was brought in the name of the lessee to recover the possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">In Castleberry\u2019s case, the Supreme Court of Alabama, construing a statute containing the word \u201c interested,\u201d used this language: \u201c To constitute such interest as will disqualify a judge, within the meaning of this section, from proceeding, it is not necessary that he should be a party. It is sufficient if he is in anywise interested in the subject matter.\u201d 23 Ala., 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-6\">It seems to us that this language is broad enough to cover the present case; and that the true principle to be applied in the construction of such enactments is correctly stated by the Supreme Court of California as follows : \u20181 This provision should not receive a technical or strict construction, but rather one that is broad and liberal;\u201d and quoting from the Supreme Court of Michigan: \u201c The court ought not to be astute to discover refined and subtle distinctions to save a case from the operation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>maxim, when the principle it embodies bespeaks the propriety of its application. The immediate rights of the litigants are not the only objects of the rule. A sound public policy, which is interested in preserving every tribunal appointed by law from discredit, imperiously demands its observance.\u201d 58 Cal., 315, 322.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b31-7\">Delivered November 1, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">It seems to us that a judge ought not to try the title to land which he himself claims to own and is in possession of, holding adversely to one of the litigants; and that the failure of the plaintiff (through ignorance) to make him a party defendant, as he should have done, ought not to change the rule. In this particular case, however, no harm was done appellant, as the court decided the case correctly on the merits, as heretofore held in a similar case (Marsalis v. Creager, 2 Texas Civil Appeals, 368); but solely for the reason that he was disqualified, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">\n<em>Meversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
