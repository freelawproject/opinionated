He is shown to have died in 1842, leaving debts and property. Administration began June 4,1851, and at that time there was no limitation as to the time within which administration should be had. The administrator gave bond and qualified, returning an inventory. He applied for sale of property on two occasions. In each debts are shown. The second sale was the headlight certificate and duplicate which had been obtained. The sale was regularly made, duly returned, and was confirmed by order of the Probate Court. This was a case of actual jurisdiction of the estate, by the Probate Court of Harris County. The petition for letters of administration showed deceased to have been a citizen of Harris County, while the testimony showed that after the war he had settled in Houston and engaged in keeping a tavern. No other residence in the State is shown. These facts which appear show a valid sale, certainly in a collateral attack. Pasch. Dig. art 1260, and note 462; Lyne v. Sanford, 82 Texas, 58; Weems v.

The appellee, Walker, is one of the heirs of Wilbarger, and has acquired the interest of the other Wilbarger heirs to the land in controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><em>Opinion. </em>\u2014 1. The first assignment of error attacks the validity and legality of the administration sale of the certificate, for the reason that it appears that Samuel Flenner was a volunteer in the Texas Army from a foreign country, and was killed in one of the battles of the Republic. Therefore, that his estate, under the Act of January 14,1841, was exempt from administration, as it was not shown that the person administering was entitled to the estate as next of kin, nor that the heirs or next of kin of said Samuel Flenner authorized the administration.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">The only evidence in the record bearing upon the points raised by this assignment is that of John Flenner, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b177-7\">\u201c I am 80 years old. I knew Samuel Flenner, who served as a soldier in the army of Texas in the war for independence of Texas. I knew him when a child, in my father\u2019s family, in. Huntington County, Pennsylvania. He was born in that county, and prior to going to Texas he lived in what is now West Virginia. I think he went to Texas in 1837 or 1838. He was a soldier in the Texas Army during the war for independence of Texas, but I don\u2019t know the exact time he was there. He wrote home after he was enlisted, and after the close of the war. I saw and read the letters, in which he stated that he was in the Texas Army, and that he would get a quantity of land for his services. After the war he went to Houston City and got into business, and he and another man kept a hotel. When the capital was changed to Austin City he went there, and after-wards joined the Santa Fe Expedition. I do not know how long he lived in different places. He was killed by Indians in the Santa Fe Expedition, on the 20th of July. This information I had from his comrades. After the war for independence of Texas, Samuel Flenner wrote me that he bought property in different places, and even gave the number of the lots. The last time I saw Samuel Flenner was in 1835 or 1836. I understood that Samuel Flenner did live in Harrisburg County, Texas, a short time; and that, I believe, was one of the places he owned lots, but I am not certain. He wrote me that he owned some lots, but I forget the names of towns.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">This evidence, we think, is not sufficient to establish the fact that Samuel Flenner was a volunteer in the Texas Army from a foreign country, in the sense intended by the Act of January 14, 1841. It is not of that certain character that should exist in order to defeat the jurisdiction of a court that has apparently in a legal way exercised jurisdiction over a subject that it has the general power to deal with. When a court deals with a subject that falls within its general jurisdiction, and renders orders and decrees that are apparently valid, it is presumed that every fact neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>sary to exist in order to confer jurisdiction was established to the satisfaction of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-3\">If we consider whatever elements of hearsay evidence there may be in the testimony of John Flenner, along with the evidence of any fact that he has testified to, it establishes no more than that Samuel Flenner once lived in Pennsylvania and what is now West Virginia, and that he went to Texas and was a soldier in the war of independence. He says that he thinks he went to Texas in 1837 or 1838, and says that the last time he saw Samuel Flenner was in 1835 or 1836. So far as this evidence tends to establish the contrary, Samuel Flenner may have been residing in Texas at the date of the declaration of independence on the 2nd day of March, 1836, and his citizenship in the Republic of Texas established by section 10, \u201c General Provisions,\u201d of the Constitution of 1836. If this be true, and we regard him as a single man, of which fact there is no evidence to the contrary, he would, by virtue of that section of the Constitution, be entitled to one-third of a league as his headright, independent of the fact whether he was a volunteer in the army or not. If there is any recital in the patent or any of the title papers offered in evidence in the court below showing that the character of the certificate issued to Samuel Flenner was for services as a volunteer in the army, it is not shown by any fact stated in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">2. It is contended by appellants, in their third assignment of error, that the administration of the estate of Samuel Flenner and the sale of the certificate thereunder are void, for the following reasons':</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">(1) It does not appear that the Probate Court of Harris County had jurisdiction to administer the estate, because Flenner neither resided nor died in Harris County, nor had he any property there, and that no inventory was ever filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">(2) It does not appear that any claim against the estate was ever presented, allowed, or approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">(3) The administration sued out in 1851, more than ten years having elapsed since the death of Flenner, the presumption is, that there were no existing liabilities against his estate, and that the administration was fraudulently obtained and conducted for the purpose of acquiring, without lawful authority, title to the property of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">The proceedings show an administration valid against collateral attack, and we think all^of the points raised in this assignment are settled against the contention of appellants in the case of Lyne v. Sanford, 82 Texas, 61, and the cases there cited, and Saul v. Frame, 3 Texas Civil Appeals, 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">3. The fourth assignment of error is as follows: 11 The court erred in its fifth and sixth findings of fact; in this, that it does not appear that the certificate described in the administrator\u2019s application for an order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>sell, the order, report, or confirmation of sale, is the same certificate by virtue of which the land in controversy was located and patented.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b179-11\">Delivered November 15, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The fifth and sixth findings of fact by the court below are as follows: \u201c That on the 29th day of March, 1852, on application of the administrator, there was an order by said Probate Court to sell the headright certificate of Samuel Flenner. That on the 4th day of May, 1852, said administrator, John H. Isbell, according to law, sold said headright certificate, the same upon which the land in dispute was located and patented, and which was then purchased by W. E. Baker, and the sale duly reported by the administrator and confirmed by the court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">In this connection we will set out the seventh finding of the court, to the effect, \u201c that on the 17th day of March, 1854, the State of Texas issued a patent for one-third league of land \u2014 the one in dispute \u2014 to the heirs of Samuel Flenner, deceased. That said patent was issued by virtue of the same headright certificate that was sold under said order of the Probate Court of Harris County, and purchased by said Baker.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">It appears that the patent was in evidence before the trial court, but its contents are not stated in the record before us. All that we have is simply a statement that the plaintiffs read in evidence a certified copy of the patent to the heirs of Samuel Flenner for the land described in plaintiffs\u2019 petition, dated March 7, 1854, reciting that the land was located by virtue of duplicate certificate number issued by the Commissioner of the General Land Office on the 16th day of March, 1852. The seventh finding of fact identifies the certificate sold by the administrator as the same headright certificate upon which the patent was issued. In view of this finding, as the patent was before the trial court, we must assume, as there is no evidence here to the contrary, that there was some statement or recital in the patent showing that it was issued by virtue of a location made by the Flenner headright certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">If such was the fact, we think it sufficient to show the identity of the land in controversy as that located by the certificate sold by the administrator. The orders relating to the sale describe the certificate as the Flenner headright.
