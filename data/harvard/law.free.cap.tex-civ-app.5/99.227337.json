Fraudulent Conveyance. \u2014 While courts will not interfere in behalf of a fraudulent vendor who has delivered the property, to recover possession of it, yet when the attempted sale is void and no actual possession was given, such contract presents no obstacle to the recovery of the property by the vendor when seized by the alleged vendee.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b125-12\">4.

Some months later appellant moved from Nolan to Llano County, and about January 5, 1887, appellant executed his note to the attorney of said Frank Hickman for $100, and afterwards paid said note, and that the same was paid for the use and benefit of said Frank Hickman.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-6\"><em>\u201c </em>That the $70 and the $100 above mentioned were paid by appellant at the request of appellee, who promised to repay the same to appellant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-7\">\u201c That at this time, to-wit, in January, 1887, and for a long time prior thereto, appellee owned the stock of horses in controversy in this suit, then numbering about 25 head.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-8\">\u201c That at this time appellee was indebted to W.

That the consideration was the $70 and the $100 before paid by appellant for the benefit of said Frank Hickman; and further, that the appellant was to sell as many of said horses as was necessary, or all of them if necessary, in order to procure counsel and pay expenses necessarily incurred in getting up petitions and procuring signatures thereto in support of an application for pardon addressed to the Governor of Texas in behalf of said Frank Hickman, who had then been tried and convicted under the aforesaid charge of felony; and that it was also the intention of appellee and appellant by such transfer to defeat the collection of the debt owed by appellee to said W. W. Martin.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b126-10\">\u20181 That at the time of said attempted transfer said horses were running loose on the range in Llano and San Saba Counties, and consisted of about 26 head of stock horses, and appellee did not deliver possession of said horses to appellant at the time of said transfer; neither did appellee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>at any time execute to appellant a bill of sale for said horses; or other written instrument conveying title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b127-5\">\u201cOn January 19, 1887, appellee caused the county clerk of Llano County, Texas, to note on the record book of marks and brands of said county, on the page opposite where appellee\u2019s horse brand was recorded, the following words, to-wit: \u2018 The above mark and brand was transferred to John W.

A verbal agreement of sale under which appellant claims the property in controversy, unaccompanied by actual delivery of possession, and without a bill of sale or other conveyance in writing from appellee to appellant, conveyed no title to appellant. The memorandum of a transfer of the brand in question, from appellee to appellant, entered by the clerk upon the mark and brand record of Llano County, was not authorized by law, and gave no validity to the pretended transfer.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b128-5\">2. It having been shown that one of the objects and considerations for the attempted verbal transfer, contemplated and intended by both appellant and appellee, was to evade the payment of a small debt of appellee\u2019s, the element of fraud would vitiate the entire transaction; and courts will not interfere to perfect and validate or to rescind such fraudulent agreement for the benefit of either of the mutually guilty parties thereto, but will leave said parties as to such agreement where they have legally placed themselves. Rev. Stats., art. 4564; Edrington v. Rogers, 15 Texas, 188; Wood v. Chambers, 20 Texas, 253; Seeligson v. Lewis, 65 Texas, 215; Davis v. Sittig, 65 Texas, 497; Wegner Bros. v.

The . attempted sale by appellee to appellant was not in writing, of course not recorded, and not accompanied by delivery, the horses running loose upon the range. Rev. Stats., arts. 4562-4564; Brown v. Vaughan, 70 Texas, 50; Bank v.Emery, 78 Texas, 512; Prude v. Campbell, 85 Texas, 4; Rankin v. Bell, 85 Texas, 36; Bank v. Brown, 85 Texas, 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">The attempted sale was a nulity. If it had been executed in compliance with the statute, it being to defraud creditors, appellee could not disturb appellant\u2019s rights acquired' thereunder. Seeligson v. Lewis, 65 Texas, 216; Wegner Bros. v. Biering, 65 Texas, 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-8\">Courts can not be used to enforce or cancel such contracts. But the attempt to sell in this case amounted to nothing; it left the title to the horses in the appellee. The entry in the record of marks and brands by the clerk, by direction of appellee, to the effect that his mark and brand had been transferred to his son, the appellant, was not an act of sale, nor did it cure the defects in the original attempted sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">The conclusion of the court, that the possession of the horses as claimed by appellant in bar of appellee\u2019s title was a joint possession, and was not adverse to appellee, was sustained by the testimony, and it was not error to hold that the plea of limitation was not sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">The judgment of the court, that F. M. Hickman was the owner of the horses, was correct, as before seen, and it was therefore not error to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>petuate the preliminary injunction, restraining J. W. Hickman from handling or in any manner using the horses.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b129-8\">Delivered November 1, 1893.</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">We have examined the evidence, and conclude that it can not be said that the court awarded to defendant below a less sum on his plea in re-convention than he was entitled to under the evidence. It is not necessary to discuss the testimony. It does not show that the court, who was the judge of the credibility and weight of the testimony, has erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
