(MoCo) appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Mobile Area Water and Sewer System, Inc. (MAWSS). MoCo brought suit against MAWSS seeking injunctive relief under federal and Alabama state antitrust laws. MAWSS moved for summary judgment, arguing it was immune from liability under the doctrine of state action immunity. MoCo filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on its antitrust claims and contended MAWSS was not entitled to state action immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-17\">On July 23, 2008, the district court granted MAWSS\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied MoCo\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court concluded the principles of state action immunity barred MoCo\u2019s antitrust claims against MAWSS because MAWSS\u2019s challenged conduct followed a clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed state policy. Specifically, the court found MAWSS\u2019s conduct was authorized by the Alabama legislature and its anticompetitive effect was a foreseeable result of this authorization. After reviewing the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we agree MAWSS is entitled to state action immunity and affirm for the reasons stated in the district court\u2019s well-reasoned order, which is published at 567 F.Supp.2d 1342 (S.D.Ala.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1304-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
