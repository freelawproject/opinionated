Appellant, then a minor dependent of a member of the armed forces, was examined for tuberculosis and advised that he was not infected by the disease. He alleges that the diagnosis was negligently made and that his chest x-ray showed the presence of the disease. In 1965, during the course of a pre-induction physical ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>animation taken while appellant was residing in Colorado Springs, the presence of the disease was established and, by that time, was in a critical and advanced stage. Radical surgery was required. The single appellate issue is whether the action is cognizable under the Federal Tort Claims Act in view of the exclusionary provision of 28 U.S. C. \u00a7 2680 (k) which bars recovery upon \u201cany claim arising in a foreign country.\u201d The trial court held the claim to be excluded under the cited statute and dismissed the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The appellant contends that his claim did not \u201carise\u201d at the time when (1962), or the place where (Taiwan) the misdiagnosis occurred and that he had no claim at all until the fact of damage occurred. It is of course true, as a generality, that a mere act of negligence is not legally tortious and becomes an actionable wrong, a tort, only when harm results to the claimant. Damage is the last event necessary to impose liability and the place of the occurrence of damage may become important when the doctrine of conflicts of laws must be applied. The state in which damage occurs is said to be the \u201cplace of wrong,\u201d Restatement, Conflicts of Laws, \u00a7 377, and under the first Restatement \u00a7 378, it is the law of the place of wrong which governs. A less mechanistic approach has been adopted by the Restatement (Second) \u00a7 379 (Tent. Draft No. 9, 1964), and the Supreme Court in Richards v. United States, 369 U.S. 1, 82 S.Ct. 585, 7 L.Ed.2d 492, making reference to the latter approach, has expressly held that the \u201cplace of wrong\u201d doctrine does not apply to cases arising under the Federal Tort Claims Act. Thus in <em>Richards, </em>it was held that the amount of damages recoverable under the Act was controlled by the whole law of the State of Oklahoma, the place of negligence rather than the place of wrong, which state, in turn, recognized the law of Missouri, the place of damage, as determinative of that element of the tort. So, too, in interpreting the limitation provision of the Act, section 2401, and under facts similar to those being here considered, it has been held that the time of occurrence of negligence does not start the running of the statute of limitations, under Georgia law, when damage does not immediately occur and that the manifestation of damage matures the cause of action. United States v. Reid, 5 Cir., 251 F.2d 691. - However, these authorities can accord to appellant\u2019s argument no more than academic interest for in the case at bar we are not concerned with either the time or place of an accrued cause of action for the purpose of applying a statute of limitations or a principle of conflict of law. We are concerned only as to whether appellant\u2019s claim arose in a foreign country within the contemplation of section 2680 (k) and the intent and purpose of the Act and all its provisions. We think this inquiry to be fully settled by the provisions of the Act and the decision of the Supreme Court in United States v. Spelar, 338 U.S. 217, 70 S.Ct. 10, 94 L.Ed. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">Although an act of negligence, here the misdiagnosis, is not actionable without damage it is apparent that after damage occurs the initial premise of the tort is the act of negligence. The liability of the United States for the completed tort shall be \u201cin accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission (negligence) occurred.\u201d 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). These statutory words \u201ccommand application of the law of the place where the negligence occurred\u201d and dispose of any conflict of law question in the first instance. Richards v. United States, supra, 369 U.S. at p. 9, 82 S.Ct. 585. Appellant\u2019s claim is thus dependent upon the law of Taiwan, a foreign country, and falls within the exclusionary provision of section 2680 (k) for as Mr. Justice Reed states in United States v. Spelar, supra, 338 U.S. at page 221, 70 S.Ct. at page 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-9\">\u201cIn brief, though Congress was ready to lay aside a great portion of the sovereign\u2019s ancient and unquestioned immunity from suit, it was un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>willing to subject the United States to liabilities depending upon the laws of a foreign power. The legislative will must be respected.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
