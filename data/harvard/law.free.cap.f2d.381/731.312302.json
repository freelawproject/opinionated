Collins sues the Warden of San Quentin Prison, where he is an inmate, and the prison accountant, under the Civil Rights Act. He claims $50,000 damages because his opposition to an extension of time to file a brief, requested by the California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>Attorney General in Collins\u2019 pending appeal to this court in habeas corpus,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was delayed in mailing for five days. This court granted the extension on March 25, 1966, the day on which Collins\u2019 opposition would have been mailed had there been no delay. Moreover, when the extension was granted, we had before us Collins\u2019 motion to hold the appellee in the habeas corpus case in default because his brief had not been filed in time, and we denied that motion on April 4, 1966. In short, Collins\u2019 contentions were brought to the attention of this court and were ruled upon. The delay in mailing caused Collins no legally cognizable damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b812-25\">. Collins v.
