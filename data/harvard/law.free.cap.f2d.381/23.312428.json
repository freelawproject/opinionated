OUGHTON, Appellant, v. J. C.

The grounds relied on by the appellee in support of his motion are that appellant\u2019s inaction for such a long period of time is tantamount to an abandonment of his appeal and that since the appellant was, in May 1965, transferred from Leavenworth to the U. S. Penitentiary at McNeil Island, Washington, the action pending in this court is now moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-23\">Both grounds are without merit. On July 8, 1964, this court granted appellant\u2019s motion to stay proceedings until further order of court. Appellant has not been inactive since then, but has had hearings before the District and Supreme Courts of Alaska. On December 2, 1966, the Alaska Supreme Court affirmed the lower court\u2019s denial of Oughton\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence. Although in federal custody, Oughton is a state prisoner and during the past two years he has been merely exhausting his state remedies as required by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. There has been no abandonment of his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-24\"> The prisoner was within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas when the petition for a writ of habeas corpus was filed and when the appeal was docketed. \u201cJurisdiction in this matter, once acquired, is retained,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>United States ex rel.
