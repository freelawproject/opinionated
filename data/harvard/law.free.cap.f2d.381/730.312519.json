If there is any merit to the movant\u2019s contention concerning the validity of the procedures prescribed by the Integration Rule for disciplining members of The Bar \u2014 a question which we do not here decide \u2014 it is premature.\u201d State ex rel. The Florida Bar v. Swanson, Fla., 172 So.2d 448, 449.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">The absence of any constitutional defect on the face of this Integration Rule warranted the trial court\u2019s action in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
