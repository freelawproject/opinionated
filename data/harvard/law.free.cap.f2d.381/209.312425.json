KAUFMAN, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b290-29\">The underlying question presented on this appeal is whether a defendant who enters a guilty plea in a New York State court, knowing that he may subsequently challenge in the state\u2019s appellate process the denial of his pretrial motion to suppress evidence alleged to be the fruit of an illegal search and seizure, should be considered to have waived the right to raise his Fourth Amendment claims in the federal courts by way of an appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>cation for habeas corpus. We are also asked to examine the murky area of probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">I. <em>The Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The facts in the case are not in dispute and lend themselves to simple statement. On January 12, 1963, Judge O\u2019Grady, of the New York City Criminal Court, issued a warrant to search Rogers\u2019 apartment which occupied the first and basement floors at 191 Quincy Street, Brooklyn. The warrant was based on the affidavit of Detective Gowski of the Brooklyn District Attorney\u2019s Office. He stated that he had probable cause to believe that appellant was in possession of narcotic drugs and paraphernalia which could be found in his apartment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>Nine days after the warrant was issued, officers of the New York City Police Department\u2019s Narcotics Bureau searched the apartment and found narcotics, cutting implements, and a loaded .22 caliber automatic gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Two indictments were subsequently filed against Rogers. In one, he was charged with violation of the state\u2019s narcotics law, while in the other he was accused of carrying a dangerous weapon and of having committed second and third degree assaults during the search of his apartment. Rogers then moved in the Kings County Supreme Court to set aside the search warrant and to suppress the evidence that had been obtained, claiming that Gowski\u2019s affidavit was insufficient as a matter of law to create probable cause for the issuance of the warrant. When his motion was denied, Rogers pleaded guilty to one count \u2014 a reduced charge recommended by the prosecutor \u2014 carrying a dangerous weapon (N. Y. Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Con-sol. Laws, c. 40 \u00a7 1897), which covered all the counts of both indictments. On September 11, 1963, Judge Malbin of the Kings County Supreme Court sentenced Rogers to a term of from 2V2 to 5 years in state prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-14\">Appellant then pursued in the state courts his appeal from the judgment of conviction and, pursuant to section 813-c of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure, urged the reviewing court to reverse the intermediate order denying his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>pre-trial suppression motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Division, Second Department, affirmed the judgment and order in a brief memorandum opinion, stating <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AbZ\">The affidavit of the police officer, on the basis of which the search warrant was issued, shows that the undisclosed informant, to whom reference is made in the affidavit, was reliable and had given the police the information that defendant and others \u201cfound\u201d in the subject premises \u201care selling narcotic drugs\u201d therein. <em>We read this to mean that the informant saw the traffic in narcotics taking place in the premises. 22 </em>A.D.2d 902, 255 N.Y.S.2d 332-333 (1964). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">The New York Court of Appeals also rejected Rogers\u2019 contentions, accepting the Appellate Division\u2019s assumption that \u201cthe informer had seen narcotic drug transactions in the apartment\u201d. 15 N.Y. 2d 422, 424, 260 N.Y.S.2d 433, 434, 208 N.E.2d 422 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Having unsuccessfully litigated his claims in the state courts, Rogers applied for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judge did not reach the merits of appellant\u2019s claim but, citing our decision in U. S. ex rel. Glenn v. McMann, 349 F.2d 1018 (1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 915, 86 S.Ct. 906, 15 L.Ed.2d 669 (1966), denied the application on the ground that appellant\u2019s plea of guilty in the state court barred him from raising his Fourth Amendment claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding. 255 F.Supp. 516 (N.D.N.Y. 1965). Judge Port having granted a certificate of probable cause, we now review his denial of the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-11\">II. <em>Waiver</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-12\"> At the threshold we must decide whether, in light of the procedures provided by New York in section 813-c, Rogers\u2019 plea of guilty in the state courts foreclosed him from challenging the validity of the search warrant in the federal courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The general rule, well established in this and other Circuits, is that a \u201cvoluntary guilty plea entered on advice of counsel is a waiver of all non-jurisdictional defects in any prior stage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>of the proceedings against him.\u201d U. S. ex rel. Glenn v. McMann, 349 F.2d at 1019. See U. S. ex rel. Boucher v. Reincke, 341 F.2d 977 (2d Cir. 1965); Wallace v. Heinze, 351 F.2d 39 (9th Cir. 1965), cert, denied, sub nom. Wallace v. Oliver, 384 U.S. 954, 86 S.Ct. 954 (1966); Alexander v. United States, 290 F.2d 252 (5th Cir.) cert, denied, 368 U.S. 891, 82 S.Ct. 144, 7 L.Ed. 89 (1961). The rationale behind this doctrine is not difficult to discover. It is reasonable to conclude that when a defendant knowingly enters a guilty plea, it is an independent admission of the facts charged; thus, it becomes unnecessary for the prosecution to offer any evidence. And, since the conviction is based solely on the plea of guilty or admission of the facts charged, no purpose would be served in permitting a defendant to argue <em>ab initio </em>on appeal that there had been an illgal search and seizure. See U. S. ex rel. Vaughn v. LaVallee, 318 F.2d 499 (2d Cir. 1963). Therefore, in the greater number of state courts a guilty plea bars a defendant from raising his Fourth Amendment claims in a subsequent appeal. And, since the defendant is presumed to be aware of this consequence, the federal courts have properly concluded that his plea constitutes an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d (Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938)) of his Fourth Amendment claims. It follows, therefore, that one who knowingly fails to raise his constitutional arguments via the appropriate and reasonable state procedures that have been provided waives his right to raise these same claims before a federal court in an application for a writ of habeas corpus. See Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 438, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">But while there is merit to the general rule that a guilty plea in a state court waives a defendant\u2019s right to raise in the federal courts alleged non-jurisdictional defects, we must be wary of blindly applying this doctrine to every case involving such a plea. There is nothing inherent in the nature of a plea of guilty which <em>ipso facto </em>renders it a waiver of a defendant\u2019s constitutional claims. Rath' er, waiver is presumed because ordinarily such a plea is an indication by the defendant that he has deliberately failed or refused to raise his claims by available-state procedures; therefore, principles of comity and the interests of orderly federal-state relations require that he should not be allowed to present these claims to the federal courts. Thus, the question we are called upon to decide in the present case is whether, in light of the explicit language in \u00a7 813-c, Rogers\u2019 plea of guilty can properly be construed as an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d of his Fourth Amendment contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">The answer to this inquiry must necessarily begin with an examination of section 813-c which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">A person claiming to be aggrieved by an unlawful search and seizure and having reasonable grounds to believe-that the property, papers or things hereinafter referred to as property, claimed to have been unlawfully obtained may be used as evidence against, him in a criminal proceeding, may move for the return of such property or for the suppression of its use as evidence. The court shall hear evidence-upon any issue of fact necessary to determination of the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-9\">If the motion is granted, the property shall be restored unless otherwise subject to lawful detention, and in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>event it shall not be admissible in evidence in any criminal proceeding against the moving party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">If the motion is denied, the order denying such may be reviewed on appeal from a judgment of conviction notwithstanding the fact that such judgment of conviction is predicated upon a plea of guilty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">New York has thus provided a specific statutory exception to the general rule that a plea of guilty bars a defendant from raising on appeal alleged non-jurisdictional defects. And, we are quite easily able to discern legitimate and powerfully compelling reasons for establishing such an exception. In the greater number of cases, the present one being illustrative, a defendant in a criminal case recognizes that unless he succeeds in suppressing the evidence seized, the state will have little difficulty in proving the charges filed against him. A defendant may well have no desire to go to trial once his pre-trial suppression motion has been denied, and thereafter may lose heart for any defense to the charges. If, however, the defendant is confronted with state law which decrees that a plea of guilty bars him from appealing the denial of his motion, then he will be presented with a <em>fait accompli </em>and be forced to proceed to trial just so that he can preserve his right to appeal. Section 813-c is an enlightened statute and was designed to alleviate this undesirable and archaic end which can only result in cluttering trial calendars. The guilty plea in such circumstances is merely a procedural step which permits review of the defendant\u2019s constitutional claims without the necessity of a trial that would be a waste of time, money and manpower.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">But, we then must ask, what are the rights of the criminal defendant who chooses to follow the procedure New York has established in Section 813-c? Does he thereby lose a right that he would otherwise have enjoyed if he went to trial\u2014 the right to raise his Fourth Amendment claims in an application for federal habeas corpus should his state appeal prove unsuccessful ? The question suggests the wisdom of a negative response.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">When Rogers\u2019 pre-trial suppression motion was denied, he had no right of appeal from that intermediate order. See People v. Merz, 20 A.D.2d 918, 249 N.Y. S.2d 475 (2d Dept. 1964); People v. Oliver, 38 Misc.2d 320, 238 N.Y.S.2d 220 (1963). At that juncture he was faced with a hard choice. True, he could demand a trial, realizing that the state could easily prove its case, and then on appeal from the conviction he could challenge the denial of his suppression motion. Or he could simply plead guilty, as he did, thereby avoiding an unnecessary, costly and time-consuming trial, and still preserve under \u00a7 813-c his right to appeal the denial of his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">In these circumstances, we are of the view that appellant\u2019s decision to enter a plea of guilty cannot fairly or realistically be viewed by a Federal District Court as an \u201cintentional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d by Rogers of his Fourth Amendment claims. Indeed, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>would be anomalous if a defendant by scrupulously following a sanctioned and reasonable state procedure for preserving his federal constitutional claims on appeal in the state courts, simultaneously waived his right to present these same claims to a federal court in an application for habeas corpus because he was lulled into following state procedures.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Rogers followed mandated state procedures and exhausted his required state remedies. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The District Court, therefore, should have considered the merits of his claim that there was no probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">III. <em>Probable Cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">There is no need, however, to remand the case to the District Court to consider the merits of Rogers\u2019 claims for in the circumstances of this case we find the record sufficient to make a determination of our own. In deciding whether the warrant was issued on probable cause we can consider only the information that was presented to the magisstrate. Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. 480, 486-487, 78 S.Ct. 1245, 2 L.Ed.2d 1503 (1958). In the present case, this information was contained exclusively in Gowski\u2019s affidavit, which is before us. Thus, we see no need for an evidentiary hearing, and no purpose would be served in remanding the case to the District Court to consider Gowski\u2019s affidavit in light of our opinion, for we are equally capable of giving this consideration. See Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. 257, 267, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">A. <em>The Applicable Standards</em></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Our inquiry cannot proceed without an examination of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-11\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, <em>and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, </em>and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">Since the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961), holding that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s proscriptions apply to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, we have been informed that the standards for obtaining a valid search warrant are the same under both amendments. See Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. 108, 110, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723 (1964); Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 33, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 (1963). And, the determination of whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a warrant quite properly must be made by \u201ca neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\u201d Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10,14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 369, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>This independent evaluation by a judicial officer as to the existence of probable cause is essential if we are to be assured that the right of privacy, which the Fourth Amendment is designed to protect, see Warden v. Hayden, 387 U.S. 294, 87 S.Ct. 1642, 18 L.Ed.2d 782 (U.S. May 29, 1967), Camara v. Municipal Court, 387 U.S. 523, 87 S.Ct. 1727, 18 L.Ed.2d 930 (1967), is not eroded by the action of police officers who, in their well-meaning but occasionally over-zealous efforts to protect the citizenry, cannot, because of their understandable partisanship, appraise objectively and impartially the potency of their cause. It is not the magistrate\u2019s function, therefore, merely to determine whether the official seeking the warrant believes that probable cause exists; rather,' the magistrate must ask whether the facts presented persuade <em>him </em>that there is probable cause. See Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. at 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436; U. S. ex rel. De-Negris v. Menser, 360 F.d 199, 203-204 (2d Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Once there has been a judicial determination of probable cause, however, it will not be handily overturned by an appellate court. The question we must ask in reviewing the magistrate\u2019s conclusion is whether \u201cthere was substantial basis for [him] to conclude that narcotics were probably present\u201d. Jones v. U. S., 362 U.S. at 271, 80 S.Ct. 736. Nevertheless, in an appropriate case a finding of probable cause must be reversed, for \u201c[although the reviewing court will pay substantial deference to a judicial determination of probable cause, the court must insist that the magistrate perform his \u2018neutral and detached\u2019 function and not serve. merely as a rubber stamp for the police.\u201d Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. at 111, 84 S.Ct. at 1512.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">B. <em>The Affidavit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">We now turn our attention to the information presented to the judge in this case. In examining Gowski\u2019s affidavit<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (the only evidence before the judge who issued the warrant), it is evident that it contains but 2 statements upon which the finding of probable cause may have been premised. First, Gowski reported that he had received \u201cconfidential information * * * from an an [sic] informant known to be reliable * * * that Jimmy Rogers and other persons found in said apartment are selling narcotic drugs in the 1st fl. &amp; basement apartment * * * \u201d And, second, the officer stated that he had observed \u201cthe premises\u201d on 2 occasions, and had seen a total of 9 \u201cunknown males\u201d and 4 \u201cknown male addicts\u201d enter the \u201cpremises.\u201d The question presented to us, therefore, is whether these statements, considered alone or in conjunction with one another, afford a \u201csubstantial basis\u201d for the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-10\">1. <em>The Informant\u2019s Report</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-11\"> We consider first Gowski\u2019s hearsay statement that an informant had reported that narcotics were being sold in Rogers\u2019 apartment. Preliminarily, it should be noted that we recognize the rule that a hearsay statement alone may be sufficient to establish probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. See Aguilar v. State of Texas, 378 U.S. at 114, 84 S.Ct. 1509, 12 L.Ed.2d 723.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> But, we have also been informed by the Supreme Court that when an affidavit is based on hearsay, it must be shored up by some additional support before there can be a finding of probable cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-12\">[T]he magistrate must be informed of some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the narcotics were where he claimed they were, and some of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>underlying circumstances from which the officer concluded that the informant, whose identity need not be disclosed, see Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887, was \u201ccredible\u201d or his information \u201creliable.\u201d Ibid. (Footnote omitted.)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Rogers does not claim that the affidavit in this case failed to comply with the latter half of this double-barreled requirement. Gowski stated that the informant had previously supplied information that led to the arrest and conviction of 3 persons. Such a statement, we believe, sufficiently apprised the magistrate of the underlying circumstances upon which the officer concluded that his source of information was reliable. See Rugendorf v. United States, 376 U.S. 528, 84 S.Ct. 825, 11 L.Ed.2d 887 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Rogers does argue vigorously, however, that Gowski\u2019s affidavit was deficient because it failed to inform the issuing judge of the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d from which the informant concluded that narcotics were being sold in the apartment. We agree with this contention. Gowski\u2019s affidavit suffered from the same fatal flaw that was present in <em>Aguilar </em>\u2014 it did not contain a statement that the informant spoke from personal knowledge when he reported that Rogers was selling drugs in his apartment, nor was any information presented from which the magistrate might properly have inferred that this was so. In fact, the affidavit is totally devoid of <em>any </em>of the underlying circumstances upon which the informant\u2019s belief was grounded. Even in eases involving non-hearsay affidavits, the affiant\u2019s \u201cmere affirmance of belief or suspicion is not enough\u201d to create probable cause. United States v. Nathanson, 290 U.S. 41, 47, 64 S.Ct. 11 (1933). A <em>fortiori, </em>it is not sufficient for the affiant merely to state that his informant has \u201ca belief\u201d or a \u201csuspicion,\u201d without informing the magistrate of some of the underlying circumstances that support that belief. See Jones v. United States, 362 U.S. at 269, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697. Were the law otherwise, the rule established in <em>Nathanson, </em>that mere suspicion or belief by the affiant is not sufficient, could be easily circumvented by having the suspicion communicated to another who would then submit an affidavit stating that a reliable informant believes that narcotics will be found if a search is conducted. Therefore, Gowski\u2019s mere statement, without more, that an informer had reported that drugs were being sold in Rogers\u2019 apartment, could not by itself have created probable cause for the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Since we are dealing with one of the mistiest areas in the law, it might be of some interest to compare Gowski\u2019s affidavit with that examined by the Supreme Court in the <em>Rugendorf </em>case. The state relies on this c\u00e1se as supporting its position that probable cause was present here. In <em>Rugendorf, </em>the FBI agent, who obtained the search warrant, stated in' his affidavit to the issuing magistrate that he had probable cause to believe that stolen furs would be found in defendant\u2019s home because: 1. a reliable informer had actually seen the furs there; 2. another reliable informer had named the individuals who had stolen the furs, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>a police officer had seen the defendant with one of the alleged robbers; 3. a third reliable informer had stated that the defendant had previously acted as a \u201cfence\u201d for the thieves who were involved. The Supreme Court concluded that these hearsay statements provided a substantial basis for the Commissioner to conclude that there was probable cause to believe that the stolen furs would be found in the defendant\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">But, the several specific and factual statements contained in the <em>Rugendorf </em>affidavit contrast sharply with the unsubstantiated and conclusory statement in Gowski\u2019s affidavit that an informer told him \u201cthat Jimmy Rogers and other persons * * * are selling narcotics.\u201d It should be noted particularly, that while one of the informers in <em>Rugendorf </em>had actually seen the stolen furs in the defendant\u2019s home, there is not a hint in the present affidavit that the informant had seen any trafficking in narcotics taking place in Rogers\u2019 apartment. It is difficult for us to understand, therefore, the basis for the inference drawn by the Appellate Division and the New York Court of Appeals that the informant spoke of what he had seen, for the \u201cdeficiencies [in the affidavit] could not be cured by the * * * reliance upon a presumption that the complaint was made on the personal knowledge of the [informant].\u201d Giordenello v. United States, 357 U.S. at 486, 78 S.Ct. at 1250. In sum, the affidavit in <em>Rugendorf </em>and that in the present case differ <em>toto c\u00e1elo.</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In concluding that the portion of Gowski\u2019s affidavit relating to the information provided by the informant did not give the judge probable cause to issue the warrant, we are not unmindful of the fact that the Fourth Amendment requirements are practical, rather than abstract, and therefore affidavits must be construed in a common sense, realistic and non-hypertechnical fashion. See United States v. Ventresca, 380 U.S. at 108, 85 S.Ct. at 746.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">[But] [t]his is not to say that probable cause can be made out by affidavits which are purely conclusory, stating only the affiant\u2019s or an informer\u2019s belief that probable cause exists without detailing any of the \u201cunderlying circumstances\u201d upon which that belief is based. See Aguilar v. State of Texas, supra. <em>Recital of some of the \u25a0 \u25a0underlying circumstances in the affidavit is essential </em>if the magistrate is to perform his detached function and not serve merely as a rubber stamp for the police. Id. at 108-109, 85 S.Ct. at 746. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">As we have noted, the informant\u2019s statement that narcotics were being sold in Rogers\u2019 apartment was purely conclusory; no underlying facts were given to support his belief. From so much of Gowski\u2019s affidavit, therefore, the magistrate could not as a matter of law have made an independent finding that there was probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">2. <em>The Affiant\u2019s Surveillance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Thus, we must direct our attention to Gowski\u2019s statement relating to his surveillance, to see if it provides a 'bolstering basis for the magistrate\u2019s finding of probable cause. In the <em>Aguilar </em>case, supra, where the only facts in the officer\u2019s affidavit related to information given to him by an informant, the state attempted to prove probable cause by claiming that there had also been a surveillance of the defendant\u2019s house. But, since the magistrate had not been informed of that surveillance, the Court refused to consider it in determining whether there had been probable cause. The Supreme Court noted, however, that \u201c[i]f the fact and results of such a surveillance had been appropriately pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>sented to the magistrate, this would, of course, present an entirely different case.\u201d 378 U.S. at 109 n. 1, 84 S.Ct. at 1511. It would have been \u201can entirely different case\u201d because the Court, in determining whether there had been probable cause, could then have considered the facts which the surveillance had uncovered. We do not, however, read the Court\u2019s language to mean that whenever a surveillance is conducted, it will <em>ipso facto </em>serve to corroborate the otherwise insufficient hearsay conclusions of an informant regardless of how indefinite or unsound the surveillance may be. We believe that the only feasible interpretation of the Supreme Court\u2019s language is that the facts disclosed by a surveillance and presented to the magistrate must be independently analyzed by him in order that he can determine whether, standing alone, or when considered with hearsay information in the affidavit, they support a finding of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">At this point it would be helpful to re-examine the key paragraph in Gowski\u2019s affidavit dealing with his surveillance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-6\">2. I have information based upon confidental information * * * that Jimmy Rogers and other persons found in said <em>apartment </em>are selling narcotic drugs in the 1st fl. &amp; basement <em>apartment </em>of <em>premises </em>191 Quincy St., Brooklyn, N. Y. Observations by the deponent of the <em>premises </em>on Thursday, January 10, 1963, between the hours of 8:00 and 9:00 P.M. five unknown males and two known male addicts were seen entering the <em>premises; </em>on January 11th, 1963, from 9:00 to 11:00 A.M. four unknown males and two known male addicts. By reason of the aforesaid the deponent has probable cause to believe that narcotic drugs and paraphernalia commonly used by drug sellers and addicts may be found at the aforesaid <em>premises </em>and upon the persons found therein. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Since it is apparent that Rogers lived in an \u201capartment\u201d building, it is obscure, vague and at the very least equivocal whether Gowski actually observed the unknown males and known addicts entering Rogers\u2019 \u201capartment,\u201d or whether he merely saw them entering the \u201cpremises,\u201d meaning the apartment building at 191 Quincy Street. If he meant the former, that observation might by itself have been sufficient to sustain a finding of probable cause had he made that clear. But, if Gowski merely saw the unknown males and known addicts entering the <em>building </em>where Rogers lived, but did not see them going into his <em>apartment, </em>it is quite clear that his observation would not have provided probable cause for the issuance of a warrant. Certainly, it could not be argued that the police could obtain search warrants for every apartment in a building merely because they had seen addicts going in and out of the building. We have been told most recently by the Supreme Court that in a criminal investigation, such as the present one, the public interest does not \u201cjustify a sweeping search of an entire city conducted in the hope that [stolen or contraband goods] might be found. Consequently, a search for these goods, even with a warrant, is \u2018reasonable\u2019 only when there is \u2018probable cause\u2019 to believe that they will be uncovered in a particular dwelling.\u201d Camara v. Municipal Court, supra, 87 S.Ct. at 1734. (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>It is instructive to compare Gowski\u2019s affidavit with one examined by the Supreme Court in still another case upon which the state relies heavily. In United States v. Ventresca, supra, the affidavit presented to the magistrate stated that the affiant and other officers on 5 separate occasions observed cars with large bags of sugar entering the yard of the house under surveillance. Not only did they see cars being loaded at the building, but on 3 occasions they smelled the odor of fermenting mash emanating from the house. The officers also saw large metal cans being brought into the building and heard the sound of a pump or motor coming from within. The problems connected with the surveillance of a multidwelling building were simply not involved in <em>Ventresca,, </em>since the officers had been watching a one-family residence. Based on their detailed observations, and in view of the fact that surveillance of a one-family house was involved, there was little question but that probable cause existed to believe that the occupants were operating an illegal still.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">It can be argued, of course, that when Gowski stated that he had observed the \u201cpremises,\u201d he was really talking about the \u201capartment.\u201d <footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We recognize that affidavits are often hastily drawn and that we cannot expect a police officer to draft an affidavit with the skill and precision of a lawyer. As we have already stated, we agree with our dissenting brother that a court should avoid interpreting an affidavit for a warrant in a \u201chyp\u201der technical\u201d manner. Nevertheless, the simple fact remains that from the affidavit before us, neither we nor the magistrate who issued the warrant could be reasonably certain what it was that the officers observed, and there is nothing to indicate that the magistrate attempted to make any inquiries to resolve the ambiguity that existed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> When rights as fundamental as those protected by the Fourth Amendment are at stake we must be wary of drawing flimsy inferences that will permit erosion of these rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">IV. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">A court is always loath to issue a writ of habeas corpus when it is clear that the defendant is guilty of the crime charged. This is particularly true of a federal court when the state appellate process has been invoked. But cases such as the present one involve issues that far transcend the question of one man\u2019s guilt or innocence. That a guilty person may on occasion go unpunished is the price we must pay to be assured that the Fourth Amendment\u2019s guarantee against unreasonable searches and seizures is not a sham or simulacrum. The right of the innocent citizen to be free from searches and seizures unless there is probable cause for a warrant can be protected only by guaranteeing to his guilty neighbor that before his home may be searched, the officer seeking the warrant must demonstrate to the magistrate that a crime will probably be found occurring at the place \u201cparticularly [de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>scribed] * * * to be searched.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV. And certainly it is too late to advocate that a search can be justified by the fruit it produces, for if that is the law the discredited maxim that the end justifies the means will be given official sanction.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Order reversed and case remanded to the District Court for issuance of the writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b291-8\">.

When the application for the writ was made in October 1965, appellant was incarcerated in Auburn State Prison. His application was, therefore, directed against the Warden of Auburn. Rogers subsequently was transferred to Attica State Prison, and was released on parole in the custody of the Warden of Attica on October 10, 1966. The parties have stipulated, therefore, that the Warden of Attica should be substituted as the appellee.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b292-8\">.

The court <em>granted </em>the motion and the state appealed the intermediate order pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 518(6), 518-a of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure. The Appellate Division then reversed and tlie New York Court of Appeals affirmed the Appellate Division. A petition for certiorari was denied by the United States Supreme Court. Petitioner then pleaded guilty, and subsequently sought a writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts. His application was denied by the District Court which held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av\">However, the New York procedure may affect the federal rule where the plea of guilty is entered following the denial of a motion to suppress, it can have no effect where, as here, petitioner has had full recourse to all state appellate courts prior to pleading guilty. Accordingly, the application is denied. 257 P.Supp. at 505 (footnote omitted). Because the present case does not involve a defendant, who had recourse to the state appellate process <em>prior </em>to entering a plea of guilty, it should be emphasized that we are not passing on the issues presented in <em>LaMonica-.</em></blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b293-5\">. For the same reason, a defendant who pleads guilty in a federal prosecution, thereby foreclosing his opportunity to raise on appeal alleged non-jurisdictional defects, see, e. g., United States v.

See, e. g., Winston v. United States, 224 F.2d 337 (2d Cir.), cert, denied, 350 U.S. 916, 76 S.Ct. 201, 100 L.Ed. 803 (1955); Hoffman v.

Within a reasonable time before trial, the state must give written notice to a defendant or his counsel that it intends to offer a confession or admission of the defendant. If the defendant claims that the confession or admission is involuntary, he may move the appropriate court (\u00a7 813-i), within a reasonable time (\u00a7 813-h) to suppress it.

Since a guilty plea in these circumstances is merely a procedural step permitting review without being compelled to submit to trial, which the defendant seeks to avoid, it is of no relevance that the plea may have been given voluntarily. Thus, there is no need to remand this case to the District Court for such a determination. In fact, Rogers readily concedes that his plea was voluntary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. The state\u2019s brief raises a number of arguments to support its position that Rogers\u2019 plea of guilty prevents him from challenging the legality of the search and seizure in an application for federal habeas corpus. We have considered all of these contentious and find that most of them do not deal with the essential issue \u2014 whether, in view of the procedure established in \u00a7 813-e, appellant\u2019s plea of guilty should be construed as an \u201cintententional relinquishment or abandonment\u201d of his Fourth Amendment claims. Thus, for example, the fact that Rogers was permitted to plead guilty to only one count of the two indictments, received a light sentence, raised liis claims in 2 state appellate courts, and could have requested a trial, is not in our view relevant to the question of waiver. Those arguments presented by the state that do touch on the waiver issue are, we believe, answered in part II of our opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b296-5\">.

The Supreme Court has only recently held that where probable cause for a warrantless arrest and search is provided by a tip from a reliable informant, neither the Sixth nor the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits a judge, in the exercise of his sound discretion, from refusing to require that the informant\u2019s identity be revealed at a suppression hearing. McCray v. Illinois, 386 U.S. 300, 87 S.Ct. 1056, 18 L.Ed.2d 62 (1967). Similarly, the Court has refused to impose an absolute rule of disclosure even at federal criminal trials. See Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639 (1957). The Court has, however, granted certiorari to consider whether the failure by a state and its informant to reveal. the latter\u2019s name <em>when he testified </em>against a criminal defendant at trial violates the Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. Smith v. Ill., 70 Ill.App.2d 289, 217 N.E.2d 546, cert, granted U.S.L.Week 3401 (U. S. May 15, 1967).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b298-7\">.

In fact, the informant told the officers exactly where the narcotics were hidden in the apartment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\">. Of course, we have intended to make clear in our opinion that a court cannot paint with a broad brush in the area of the Fourth Amendment. The facts of a particular case are vital, and indeed, decisive. For example, the Supreme Court in the <em>Camara </em>case, also informed us that where inspections are conducted to enforce a health or building code, though a warrant is necessary, save in emergency circumstances, the inspector seeking the warrant need not show \u201cprobable cause to believe that a particular dwelling contains violations of the minimum standards prescribed by the code being enforced.\u201d Ibid. This is so because such inspections, unlike searches conducted as part of a criminal investigation, are designed for the legitimate purpose of insuring citywide compliance with specific minimum standards for the maintenance of private property. Such compliance may require the periodic inspection of <em>all </em>buildings, and therefore an inspection of a wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>area may be reasonable. If the facts reveal that \u201ca valid public interest justifies the intrusion contemplated, then there is probable cause to issue a suitably restricted search warrant.\u201d 87 S.Ct. at 1736.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b300-6\">. Indeed, it would be more reasonable to suppose that a detective engaged in surveillance would not station himself in juxtaposition to the \u201capartment,\u201d for this would quickly expose him to those under suspicion. It is more likely that an experienced policeman would have been observing \u201cthe premises.\u201d And when surveilling a multi-apartment building it is impossible to conclude with any reasonable degree of certainty that \u201cknown addicts\u201d entering \u201cthe premises,\u201d were all heading for Rogers\u2019 apartment and none other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b300-11\">.

Thus, for the first time, we are now provided with a description of the physical layout of the building in which Rogers lived; if accurate, this <em>might </em>indicate that Gowski actually saw the known addicts and unknown males entering the appellant\u2019s \u201capartment,\u201d something we were not told before.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-14\">We should note, however, as we tried to indicate in our opinion, that this information really has no relevance to the issue of probable cause unless it appears that it was brought to the attention of the magistrate at the time he issued the warrant, for we can only consider what was before him. But, the state tells us that the magistrate <em>might </em>have been familiar with the type of buildings in the neighborhood where Rogers lived, or he <em>might </em>have questioned Gowski to determine exactly what he had observed. Moreover, it claims that the magistrate <em>might </em>have inquired as to the basis for the informant\u2019s statement that narcotics would be found in Rogers\u2019 apartment. Because all this is conceivable, the state urges that once we determined that appellant had the right to present his constitutional claims to a federal court, we should have remanded the case to the District Court for a determination of the factual issues involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-15\">The state is to be faulted for having held back these facts and points raised so belatedly. Almost half of the lengthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>brief submitted by Rogers on appeal was devoted to the issue of probable cause. Yet the state in replying to that brief never so much as suggested that the magistrate\u2019s determination of probable cause was based on anything but Gowski\u2019s affidavit. We were given to believe by the state\u2019s silence on this question that there were no factual issues, for \u201cthere is nothing to indicate that the magistrate attempted to make any inquiries to resolve the ambiguity that existed [in Gowski\u2019s affidavit].\u201d United States ex rel.

In view of the events that have transpired in the present case, and the unnecessary drain on our time which resulted from this action by the state, we wish to make it clear that in the future it will be not only \u201cdesirable,\u201d but mandatory for the state to inform this Court of its views of the merits of a petitioner\u2019s claim, and the further proceedings it believes to be appropriate in the event this Court denies its prayer for a dismissal of the petition as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">We have determined, however, to remand to the District Court in order that it may ascertain whether the magistrate acted on any information other than that contained in Gowski\u2019s affidavit; and if so, whether he might properly have found probable cause to issue the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">We wish to make it clear that our remand in no way affects our holding regarding the right of a defendant to raise his Fourth Amendment claims in a federal habeas corpus proceeding after he has pleaded guilty and appealed pursuant to \u00a7 813-c of the New York Code of Criminal Procedure.
