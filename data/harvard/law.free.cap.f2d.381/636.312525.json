Patton, was tried in October, 1960 and convicted of armed robbery after a plea of nolo contendere, entered at the close of the State\u2019s evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>dence. He was sentenced to prison for a term of twenty years. No appeal was taken, but in April 1964, Patton applied for a state post-conviction hearing, and on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed.2d 799 (1963), was awarded a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">Patton remained in custody, and on February 17, 1965, after tendering a plea of not guilty, he was again convicted by jury on the original indictment. This time he had the\u2019 assistance of counsel, who called the court\u2019s attention to the fact that the defendant had been continuously imprisoned from June 10, 1960 and had already served nearly five years for the offense. Although the trial judge paid lip service to the idea of crediting Patton with that portion of the initial twenty-year sentence already served, he actually increased Patton\u2019s punishment by imposing, in effect, a twenty-five-year sentence and then deducting five years for the time served.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, as a result of seeking and obtaining a new trial, the prisoner, who originally would have been eligible for parole in October 1965, now, it is agreed, will not become eligible until February 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Regardless of whether the action of the sentencing judge is verbalized as a twenty-year sentence without credit for the five years already served, or as a twenty-five-year sentence with credit, the practical effect of the second judge\u2019s sentence is to compel the defendant to serve five years longer to become eligible for parole, than he would have been required to serve had he not asserted his constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Patton applied in August 1965 to the District Court for a writ of habeas corpus, contending that a harsher sentence following a second conviction for the same offense, after the initial conviction has been vacated on constitutional grounds, is a denial of due process of law; is inconsistent with the prohibition against double jeopardy; and is a denial of equal protection of the law. The District Court held Patton\u2019s sentence unconstitutional on the ground that the increased punishment violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. Patton v. North Carolina, 256 F.Supp. 225 (W.D.N.C.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-13\">I. <em>Exhaustion of State Remedies</em></p>\n<p id=\"ASW\">The State has misconceived the import of Patton\u2019s arguments. It interprets his contention to be that the second trial judge, in imposing a more severe sentence, was motivated by prejudice because of the defendant\u2019s successful attack on the initial conviction. The State\u2019s position on this appeal is that such an allegation has never been presented to the state courts, and it reasons that Patton having failed to exhaust available state remedies or to show that circumstances existed rendering the state process ineffective to protect his rights, the District Court lacked jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The District Judge carefully reviewed the relevant North Carolina cases, however, and concluded that the effect of the opinions of the state supreme court is to hold that a defendant is not entitled to credit for time served and may receive an increased sentence (unless the subsequent sentence plus the time already served under the invalid first sentence should exceed the statutory maximum).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We share the District Court\u2019s view that since further re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>sort to the North Carolina courts would be futile, it is not required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">II. <em>Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">The simplistic rationale traditionally offered for denying credit and permitting a harsher sentence at a second trial is that the prisoner, by successfully attacking his initial conviction, has \u201cvoided\u201d or \u201cwiped out\u201d all consequences of that conviction \u2014 including the sentence imposed by the first judge and any time served under that sentence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In State v. White, 262 N.C. 52, 136 S.E.2d 205 (1964), the North Carolina Supreme Court stated that a defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-6\">\u201cis not entitled as a matter of law to credit against the second sentence for time served under the original sentence. The rationale of the decisions seems to be that the defendant in seeking and obtaining a new trial <em>must be deemed to have consented to a wiping out of all the consequences of the first trial.\u201d </em><footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-14\">262 N.C. at 56, 136 S.E.2d at 208 (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b718-15\">The principle of fair dealing which impels judges in passing sentence to take into account the time a defendant was deprived of his liberty while awaiting trial, Dunn v. United States, 376 F.2d 191 (4th Cir. Feb. 24, 1967), insists even more inexorably that he shall not be finessed out of credit for time he was forced to serve under an invalid sentence. The trial and conviction may be voided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>on appeal, but the time illegally exacted by the unconstitutional sentence is an irreversible fact. It is1'grossly unfair\u2019for society to take five years of a man\u2019s life and then say, we now acknowledge that this should not have happened, but we will set everything right by refusing to recognize that it did happen. This is an unworthy pretense. Courts should not be astute to fashion legal fictions to attain unjust ends.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The risk of a denial of credit or the risk of a greater sentence, or both, on retrial may prevent''deifendants who have been unconstitutionally convicted from attempting to seek redress.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For this reason, the District Court declared that predicating Patton\u2019s constitutional right to petition for a fair trial on the fiction that he has consented to a possibly harsher punishment, offends the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>7a</footnotemark> It would confront the prisoner with the unhappy choice of either abandoning his constitutional right to a fair trial and serving out his prison term under the invalid sentence, or exercising that right under the hazard, in the event of a second conviction, of being treated as though the years of imprisonment already served had never occurred.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-17\">This is like the \u201cgrisly choice\u201d discountenanced in Fay v. Noia, 372 U.S. 391, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837 (1963). \u201cThe law should not, and in our judgment does not, place the defendant in such an incredible dilemma.\u201d Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> North Carolina deprives the accused of the constitutional right to a fair trial, then dares him to assert his right by threatening him with the risk of a longer sentence. It may not exact this price. Enjoyment of a benefit or protection provided by law cannot be conditioned upon the \u201cwaiver\u201d of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Indeed, this circuit has already held it impermissible to force upon an accused the risk of more severe punishment as a condition for securing a constitutional right. In United States v. Walker, 346 F.2d 428 (4th Cir. 1965), the defendant was initially sentenced in his absence. When he successfully attacked the sentence on this ground, he was resentenced to a longer term. Judge Bryan, speaking for the court criticized the trial judge\u2019s disregard of the original sentence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">\u201c[T]he import of the [District] Court\u2019s ruling was to condition his Constitutional right to seek correction upon the risk of another sentence, then unforeseeable in nature and extent. Thus, though not so intending, the Court potentially penalized him for asserting the privilege. This the law forbids * * *. [Citing Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 184 (1957).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-14\">It [the second, harsher sentence] was, in sum, the product of a procedure which could prove either deterring or punitive of an insistence on Constitutional privileges.\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-15\">346 F.2d at 430-431.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-16\">The District Court held that Patton\u2019s punishment could not be increased unless evidence justifying a harsher sentence appeared in the record, and that the State must bear the burden of showing that such facts were introduced at the second trial, since \u201cwhere the record disclose [d] no colorable reason for harsher punishment,\u201d the effect would be to inhibit the constitutional right to seek a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>new trial.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 256 F.Supp. at 236. We agree with the District Court that it is an impossible task for the prisoner to prove improper motivation of the trial judge. It is equally impossible, and most distasteful, for federal courts to pry into the sentencing judge\u2019s motivation to ascertain whether vindictiveness played a part.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">We do not think, however, that a defendant\u2019s rights are adequately protected, even if a second sentencing judge is restricted to increasing sentence only on the basis of new evidence. We are in accord with the First Circuit, which has recently held that a sentence may not be increased following a successful appeal, even where <em>additional </em>testimony has been introduced at the second trial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyY\">\u201cThe danger that the government may succeed in obtaining more damaging evidence on a retrial is just as real as the danger, for example, that the judge on his own may wish to reconsider, unfavorably to the defendant, the factors which led to his original disposition. We think that there must be repose not merely as to the severity of the court\u2019s view, but as to the severity of the crime.\u201d<footnotemark>12a</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Marano v. United States, 374 F.2d 583, 585 (1st Cir. Mar. 23, 1967). Contra, Starner v. Russell, 378 F.2d 808 (3rd Cir. May 25, 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">An analogy may be drawn between the solution adopted by the Supreme Court in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963), in response to the problems raised by Betts v. Brady, 316 U.S. 455, 62 S.Ct. 1252, 86 L.Ed. 1595 (1942), and the issue here.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Court had earlier held in <em>Betts </em>that whether the conviction of an unrepresented defendant was a denial of due process depended upon whether \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d existed which would, in a particular case, \u201cconstitute a denial of fundamental fairness.\u201d 316 U.S. at 462, 62 S.Ct. at 1256. But in <em>Gideon, </em>there was forthright recognition that to require such a showing, in an area in which the chance of undetectable prejudice is so great, was too heavy a burden to east upon an accused. The controlling point was not that the absence of counsel necessarily prejudiced the defendant, but that it created the <em>opportunity </em>for unfairness. For this reason, the <em>Gideon </em>Court made the presumption of injury irrebutable.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">Similarly, improper motivation is characteristically a force of low visibility. In order to prevent abuses, the fixed policy must necessarily be that the new sentence shall not exceed the old. Seldom will this policy result in inadequate punishment. Against the rare possibility of inadequacy, greater weight must be given to the danger inherent in a system permitting stiffer sentences on retrial\u2014 that the added punishment was in reaction to the defendant\u2019s temerity in attacking the original conviction. Even the <em>appearance </em>of improper motivation is a disservice to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-12\">III. <em>Equal Protection </em>The equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment likewise compels a rule barring a sentence in excess of the one invalidated, and this protection extends even to one seeking to avail himself of a state\u2019s post-conviction reme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>dies because of non-constitutional errors in the original trial.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">North Carolina strictly forbids an increase in a defendant\u2019s sentence after the trial court\u2019s term has expired and service of sentence has commenced.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus the threat of a heavier sentence falls solely on those who utilize the post-conviction procedures provided by the State. If the State wishes to institute a system permitting upward revision of sentences, it must proceed upon a rational basis in selecting the class of prisoners it will subject to this threat. It may not discriminate in this regard against those who have availed themselves of the right to a fair trial. This is an arbitrary classification offensive to the equal protection clause.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As the court-appointed counsel for the defendant has put it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-18\">\u201cThe risk of a harsher sentence is borne exclusively by those who pursue some post-conviction remedy. Yet there is no reason to suppose that the original sentences of this group are any more likely to warrant review as a class than the sentences of other convicts who are not subject to the same risk. The vulnerable class appears to be quite equivalent to a class described by race, right-handedness, indigence, or some other factor equally irrelevant in any proper determination of those whose sentences might appropriately be reviewed.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>Not only is the classification not a rational means for effectuating any legitimate state policy, but it also frustrates the pursuit of post-conviction remedies provided by the State. Courts should be especially vigilant to protect access to these remedies, rather than strive to fashion a doctrine inhibiting the exercise of the right to review.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">Even if the State\u2019s policy is to prevent insubstantial appeals, limiting the class to successful appellants would not be a rational means of accomplishing this purpose, since it has too broad a sweep\u2014 chilling meritorious appeals as well as frivolous ones. The inequity of such a system is apparent when it is realized that only prisoners whose appeals have been found meritorious are subjected to the peril of a higher resentence. Ironically, those whom the State admits having initially denied a fair trial are the only ones who stand to receive greater punishment. Thus, the threatened class is both underinclusive, in that those who do not pursue post-conviction remedies might also have been too leniently sentenced, and overinclusive, since not all bearing the risk (and thus deterred from attacking an unconstitutional conviction) were originally dealt with too lightly.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-12\">IV. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b723-13\">In view of the foregoing, we need not rest our decision on double jeopardy grounds. We are persuaded, however, that the constitutional protection against double jeopardy would also be violated if an increased sentence or a denial of credit is permitted on retrial.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b723-14\">Double jeopardy, r\u00e1ther than being a single doctrine, is actually comprised of three separate though related rules,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> prohibiting (1) reprosecution for the same offense following acquittal,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>(2) reprosecution for the same offense following conviction,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> and (3) multiple punishment for the same offense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In Green v. United States, 355 U.S. 184, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199 (1957), the Supreme Court invoked the first rule, that an accused may not be reprosecuted for the offense of which he was acquitted at the first trial. The Court held that the double jeopardy clause precluded a retrial for first-degree murder following defendant\u2019s successful appeal from his conviction of second-degree murder, on the theory that the jury in the first trial, by returning a verdict of second-degree murder, <em>impliedly acquitted </em>him of the charge of first-degree murder,</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">In a footnote, the <em>Green </em>majority declared \u2014 without further explanation\u2014 that Stroud v. United States, 251 U.S. 15, 40 S.Ct. 50, 64 L.Ed. 103 (1919), was \u201cclearly distinguishable.\u201d <footnotemark>25</footnotemark> 355 U.S. at 195, n. 15, 78 S.Ct. 221, 2 L.Ed.2d 199. There the defendant was retried for first degree murder and sentenced to death, following reversal of his prior conviction, for which he had received a sentence of life imprisonment. From a reading of the <em>Stroud </em>opinion, it appears that the case was argued to the Court on the theory that the defendant was put twice in jeopardy for the same offense merely by being retried on an indictment for first degree murder.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> There is no indication that the Court was presented with the argument that the risk of an increased penalty on retrial violates the double jeopardy clause by being a double punishment for the same offense. <em>Stroud </em>thus stands for no more than the well-established proposition that the double jeopardy clause does not en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>title a defendant who successfully attacks his conviction to absolute immunity from reprosecution.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">It is clear, therefore, that the Court was concerned in <em>Green </em>only with that aspect of double jeopardy which prohibits multiple <em>prosecutions </em>for the same offense, and was not faced with the precise question that is before us\u2014 whether a harsher punishment following retrial for the same offense is prohibited by the double jeopardy clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">Patton analogizes his situation to that in <em>Green, </em>asserting that as Green was \u201cimpliedly acquitted\u201d of the <em>greater degree </em>of murder when he was convicted of the lesser degree of that offense, similarly, Patton was \u201cacquitted\u201d of any <em>higher penalty </em>when he was sentenced to twenty years\u2019 imprisonment. And as the accused in <em>Green </em>was protected by the double jeopardy clause from retrial for <em>first </em>degree murder, by a parity of reasoning, Patton contends that the double jeopardy clause protects him from being \u201cretried\u201d for the penalty of which he had been \u201cacquitted\u201d at his first trial, namely, anything between the twenty years he actually received and the statutory maximum. On retrial, he asserts, he could only be given \u201cup to the degree of punishment of which he was originally convicted.\u201d <footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b725-14\">Defendant recognizes, and we agree, that to maintain that he was \u201cacquitted\u201d at the first trial of any penalty greater than twenty years, is as much a fiction as that he has \u201cwaived\u201d the benefit of his initial sentence by appealing his conviction.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> For this reason, we do not rest solely on the \u201cimplied acquittal\u201d doctrine, preferring to emphasize a somewhat different aspect of double jeopardy \u2014 the prohibition against multiple punishment. See Ex parte Lange, 85 U. S. (18 Wall.) 163, 21 L.Ed. 872 (1873).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is this aspect which has been consistently relied upon to prohibit an increase in a defendant\u2019s sentence, once service has commenced. E.g., Ex parte Lange, supra; United States v. Benz, 282 U.S. 304, 307, 51 S.Ct. 113, 75 L.Ed. 354 (1931); United States v. Sacco, 367 F.2d 368 (2d Cir. 1966); United States v. Adams, 362 F.2d 210 (6th Cir. 1966); Kennedy v. United States, 330 F.2d 26 (9th Cir. 1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-15\">We perceive no constitutionally significant distinction between the increases prohibited in the cases cited above and an increase in punishment following retrial. Thus, unless a defendant is held to waive this double jeopardy protection in seeking a new trial, a harsher penalty may not be imposed. And we have already declared, in Part II of this opinion, that we decline to predicate a prisoner\u2019s exercise of his right to seek a new trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>on the fiction that he has \u201cwaived\u201d the benefits of his initial sentence, because of the restrictive effect this has on access to post-conviction remedies.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This is in accord with this circuit\u2019s decision in United States v. Walker, 346 F.2d 428 (4th Cir. 1965), that, in seeking correction of an erroneous sentence,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> a defendant does not waive his double jeopardy right not to be subjected to multiple punishment. See Walsh v. United States, 374 F.2d 421, 426 (9th Cir. 1967) and Ekberg v. United States, 167 F.2d 380, 388 (1st Cir. 1948), discussed more extensively in Whaley v. North Carolina, 4 Cir., 379 F.2d 221 (decided this day).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">To summarize, we conclude that increasing Patton\u2019s punishment after the reversal of his initial conviction constitutes a violation of his Fourteenth Amendment rights in that it exacted an unconstitutional condition to the exercise of his right to a fair trial, arbitrarily denied him the equal protection of the law, and placed him twice in jeopardy of punishment for the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We affirm the District Court\u2019s order to release the defendant from confinement unless he is constitutionally re-sentenced by the state court to a term not exceeding 20 years from the date of his original sentence, passed on October 26, 1960, with full credit for the time already served.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-8\">. \u201cTHE COURT: Before I announce punishment, I will take into consideration the fact that he has served four years, or nearly five years.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">* * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: * * <em>* I </em>would give you five more years than what I am giving you, but I am allowing you credit for the time that you have served.

In that case, the defendant\u2019s sentence was increased following his second conviction, even though \u201c[t]he evidence on the new trial was not essentially different\u201d from that adduced at the original trial. In his appeal to the state supreme court, the defendant relied on Judge Craven\u2019s opinion here under review, to support his argument that any increase in the punishment imposed after a second conviction was in effect a penalty for seeking review of an invalid conviction, and a violation of his constitutional rights.

Commonwealth, 329 Mass. 445, 108 N.E.2d 922, 35 A.L.R.2d 1277 (1952), as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b718-18\">\u201cIt is hardly realistic to say that nine months in the State prison amount to nothing \u2014 that since the petitioner \u2018should not have been imprisoned as he was, he was not imprisoned at all.\u2019 [Citation omitted.] Moreover, * * * the time served before the reversal of the sentence might in some other case be so long that glaring and intolerable injustice would result if the time served on a first sentence should not be taken into account in imposing a second sentence.
