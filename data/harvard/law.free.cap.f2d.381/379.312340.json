This same argument was presented by appellant on an unsuccessful appeal from his conviction to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey, and on his application for certiorari to the Supreme Court of New Jersey. The district court independently considered these grounds at a full hearing and rejected appellant\u2019s arguments in a well-considered opinion, 271 F.Supp. 406, with which we are in complete accord.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-17\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
