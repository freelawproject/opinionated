(Serbin), defendant in the District Court, appeals from a final judgment in favor of Key West Hand Print Fabrics, Inc. (Key West) finding infringement of two copyrights, No. K67524 (\u201cZuzek Rose Butter\u201d) and No. K66990 (\u201cDragon\u201d). On appeal Serbin has raised points directed only to matters affecting liability. No question is raised as to the District Court\u2019s award of statutory damages<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of $5,000 on each of the two counts, and of attorneys\u2019 fees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-25\">Key West cross-appeals from the dismissal by the District Court, without prejudice, of a claim involving a third copyright K67222 (\u201cBougainvilla\u201d) for lack of an indispensable party plaintiff, one Charles Cervantes, in whose name the copyright was jointly registered. Key West does not question here the correctness of the District Court\u2019s dismissal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>for failure of proof, of its claim involving unfair competition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b816-4\">The District Court\u2019s opinion is reported in 269 F.Supp. 605. For the reasons carefully reviewed and enunciated there, requiring no elaboration by us, we affirm both as to the original appeal and the cross-appeal. As to the District Court\u2019s disposition of other matters (supra) not raised on either appeal or cross-appeal here, we of course express no views.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Key West applies for the allowance under the statute of additional attorneys\u2019 fees as a part of the costs for this appeal. The statute contemplates such fees. We deem it proper that such allowance be considered by the District Court rather than this court, and direct that that court consider an application therefor by Key West upon the going down of our mandate. D/S Ove Skou v. Hebert, 365 F.2d 341 (5 Cir. 1966) at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">Affirmed, with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b815-17\">. Title 17, U.S.C.
