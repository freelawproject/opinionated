However, the testimony of Doctors Cornish, Gemert, Warden, and Davidson, made a part of the record before the Appeals Council, supports the finding of the Secretary. Since that finding is supported by substantial evidence, it is conclusive. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g); Hall v. Celebrezze, 340 F.2d 608 (6th Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-19\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
