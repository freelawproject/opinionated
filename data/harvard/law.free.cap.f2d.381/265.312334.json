The union charged violation of \u00a7 8(a) (5) and (1) of the National Labor Relations Act, 61 Stat. 136, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">New cars awaiting shipment at the company\u2019s Southgate, California, plant were parked in two successive steps. The first part of the parking operation was done by employees of the employer who were members of a unit with which the employer had a collective bargaining agreement. The second part of the operation was done by employees of a different concern which had a contract with the company. The agreement between the union and the employer provided that \u201cthe methods, processes and means of manufacturing are solely and exclusively the responsibility of the Corporation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\"> The Company has made a contract by which the entire parking operation is to be performed by employees of the concern which had been performing only the second part of it. In response to a question that we asked, the Board found on remand that the change in the company\u2019s method of shipping cars did not involve contracting out work formerly performed by the union. We think the evidence does not support this finding. Though the change of method \u201cachieved substantial efficiencies,\u201d as the union concedes, the change was accomplished through a contracting out. It took away the jobs of six members of the union. Though these men got similar jobs elsewhere in the plant, the change had an adverse impact on the bargaining unit since it diminished by six the whole number of jobs performed by its members. This was not a mere <em>\u201cde minimis\u201d </em>violation of the employer\u2019s duty to bargain with the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-12\">In District 50, United Mine Workers v. NLRB, 358 F.2d 234 (1966), the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the Board\u2019s approval of contracting out, on the ground that \u201cthe Board was entitled to conclude that there was no substantial adverse impact on the employees caused by the employer\u2019s subcontracting decisions.\u201d 358 F.2d at 237. And in Puerto Rico Telephone Co. v. NLRB, 359 F.2d 983, 988 (1966), the First Circuit overruled part of a Board order against an employer because the court found no evidence \u201cthat the bargaining unit or any employee in it\u201d was \u201cadversely affected as a direct result\u201d of the contracting out. But in those cases, unlike the present case, the contracting out did not reduce the whole number of jobs in the bargaining unit. We think this ease is controlled by Fibreboard Paper Products Corp. v. NLRB, 379 U.S. 203, 85 S.Ct. 398, 13 L.Ed.2d 233 (1964), which affirmed 116 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 322 F.2d 411 (1963). The Supreme Court held that the \u201ccontracting out,\u201d which replaced employees in a bargaining unit with employees of an independent contractor, violated \u00a7\u00a7 8(a) (5) and 8(d) of the Act, which require employers to bargain with respect to \u201cwages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment,\u201d although the only purpose of the contracting out was to reduce costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number> The Board has said that a union will not be held to have waived a statutory right unless the waiver is \u201cclear and unmistakable.\u201d <em>E. g., </em>California Portland Cement Co., 101 N.L.R.B. 1436, 1439 (1952); Heokman Furniture Co., 101 N.L.R.B. 631, 632 (1952); Tide Water Associated Oil Co., 85 N.L.R.B. 1096, 1098 (1949). See NLRB v. Item Co., 220 F.2d 956, 958-959 (5th Cir.), cert, denied, 350 U.S. 836, 76 S.Ct. 73,100 L.Ed. 746 (1955). The agreement that \u201cthe methods, processes and means of manufacturing are solely and exclusively the responsibility of the Corporation\u201d is certainly not a \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d waiver of the union\u2019s right to bargain where a change in methods' amounts in fact to contracting out. <em>Cf. </em>Fafnir Bearing Co., 151 N.L.R.B. 332 n.1, 337, 341 (1965). Neither is it \u201cclear and unmistakable\u201d that \u201cthe methods, processes and means of manufacturing\u201d include parking manufactured cars.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">We must therefore reverse the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
