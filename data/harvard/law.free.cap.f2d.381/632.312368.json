We deny enforcement of the Board\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">American Radiator operates plants manufacturing plumbing and heating products throughout the United States and Canada. It deals with many unions representing separate bargaining units. The employees at American Radiator\u2019s Louisville plant belong to some thirteen different local unions, which in turn elect delegates to a single bargaining representative, the Standard Allied Trades Council.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-9\">For some years prior to 1964, American Radiator had in force pension plans for all its employees. These had been negotiated between the company and the bargaining units at its several plants. The plans were basically the same, with local variations at each plant. For a long while, however, top level officials of various International Unions \u2014 UAW-CIO, Boilermakers\u2019 Union, Potters\u2019 Union (Canada), Industrial Union Division of AFL-CIO, Steelworkers\u2019 Union, IAM, and Teamsters Union \u2014 had been dissatisfied with the manner in which these pension plans were being negotiated. It was their belief that the individual bargaining units had been powerless to affect the terms of the pension plans, once the company had arrived at its policy with respect thereto. They decided to attempt the negotiation of a \u201cnational package,\u201d so that the same pension plan would be in effect for all of the American Radiator employees covered by collective bargaining agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-15\">Meetings attended by representatives of these Internationals were consequently held in Washington, D. C., and Detroit, with the result that a six-man \u201cSteering Committee\u201d was formed, which included SATC\u2019s president, Robert Aubrey; this committee was to guide the efforts to establish a company-wide pension plan. The function of the Steering Committee is best disclosed by this excerpt from the minutes of one of the Washington meetings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-16\">\u201cIt was the unanimous decision of the delegates that no local union should agree to any changes in the Pension Plan until they are agreed to by the Steering Committee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-17\">As one way to achieve the desired goal\u2014 in the words of the report which issued from the series of meetings, \u201ca common settlement of the proposed pension plan\u201d \u2014some members of the Steering Committee would sit in with local union representatives at any future bargaining session involving pension discussions.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-18\">The pension agreement at the Louisville plant would be the first to expire\u2014 it would do so on November 30, 1964. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>Several months prior to that time SATC requested a bargaining meeting to consider extending the agreement, and a session was scheduled for September 22. On that date four so-called \u201coutsiders\u201d (delegates from the Steering Committee) appeared at the meeting, in addition to the regular SATC (Louisville) representative. These men were from other cities, were not members of the Louisville SATC, and quite obviously came to support the drive for a \u201cnationwide\u201d package on pensions. After the company representative had the \u201coutsiders\u201d identify themselves, and after one had allegedly stated that they were there \u201cto negotiate a national package,\u201d the company refused to go on with the meeting unless the \u201coutsiders\u201d left. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">This event was promptly followed by the SATC filing an unfair labor charge against American Radiator. Correspondence between the company and SATC ensued, in which the company reiterated its refusal to bargain over a nationwide plan, and its resistance to having \u201coutsiders\u201d participating in negotiations. The union \u2014SATC\u2014took the position that it was not, and had not been, demanding a nationwide contract, but insisted upon its right to have the \u201coutsiders\u201d participate in the meetings to aid the negotiation of a pension contract for the Louisville plant alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">There was merit in each of their contentions: it was conceded by the General Counsel that the company could not be forced to negotiate a nationwide contract; and we have held that a union has the right to select outsiders to sit in and assist a local bargaining committee., Standard Oil Company v. NLRB, 322 F.2d 40, 43, 44 (CA 6, 1963). Because of these partially valid positions of the parties, the charge lodged against the company for its conduct in refusing to conclude the September 22 meeting was not referred to in the Regional Director\u2019s complaint which issued on December 16, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">What was the basis of the complaint was a letter dated November 10, 1964, by American Radiator to the president of SATC which attempted to move forward with negotiations without waiting for Board resolution of the charges made by SATC relating to the September 22 meeting. The letter went as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">\u201cDear Mr. Aubrey:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">\u201cMr. Gamber has asked me to answer your letter to him dated November 6, 1964.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-10\"><em>\u201cWe have never contested your right to select the members of your negotiating committee for negotiations or any other collective bargaining purpose. </em>Our negotiations, however, involve only the Louisville Bargaining Unit. They are private negotiations and have never been open to the public or to, outsiders from other bargaining units outside Louisville.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">\u201cAs you know, an unfair labor practice proceeding is now pending before the NLRB filed by your Union against our Company testing the rights of these outsiders to attend Louisville negotiations meetings. (Case No. 9-CA-3332). <em>May we suggest that while this matter is being decided, we continue negotiations on the same basis as in the past years, without the outsiders being present. </em>If it is finally determined in the NLRB proceedings that these outsiders have a right to be present, we must, of course, follow the law and so determine that they can resume attendance at the meetings under such conditions as may be set in the ruling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">\n<em>\u201cThis proposal will enable negotiations to resume immediately and we hope will result in an early and peaceful settlement of outstanding issues relating to the Pension Program.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-13\">\n<em>\u201cPlease let us hear from you after you have given this matter consideration.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-14\">\u201cVery Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-15\">\u201cH. J. Brown, /s/</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-16\">H. J. Brown, Manager</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKi\">Industrial Relations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Au\">(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>There was no answer to this letter by SATC, but on November 30, 1964, the parties agreed to an indefinite extension of the existing pension contract, to continue until one or the other gave notice of terminating it. In January, 1965, SATC\u2019s president Aubrey gave such notice of termination, but suggested that the company begin pension negotiations, \u201cunder protest,\u201d with the \u201coutsiders\u201d present and assisting the SATC representatives. The company acquiesced, negotiations were held, and a new pension plan finally agreed upon.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-4\">The trial examiner rightly recited that \u201cthere is no substantial conflict in the evidence concerning the relevant facts.\u201d He concluded, however, that the company\u2019s letter of November 10, 1964, was a refusal to bargain and that it persisted in such refusal thereafter, including its bargaining \u201cunder protest\u201d with the outsiders present. He said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-5\">\u201cIn sum, I conclude and find that Respondent refused to bargain within the meaning of Section 8(a) (5) of the Act by its letter of November 10, 1964, by declining to meet with representatives selected by SATC to bargain on its behalf and thereafter by failing and refusing to meet with the selected negotiating committee of the Union.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">And in his footnote 4 he expressed his view of the \u201cunder protest\u201d meetings as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b715-7\">\u201c4. I do not consider that Respondent met its obligation at Louisville after January 15, 1965, by meeting, and purporting to bargain 'under protest.\u2019 The latter term connotes a sense of compulsion, restraint, and reluctance which is foreign, if not antithetic, to the freedom accorded to parties in collective bargaining to propose to consider and to engage in the give and take involved in good faith bargaining. Indeed, Section 8(d) emphasizes the freedom with which the parties may negotiate by providing specifically that the bargaining obligation does not compel agreement to a proposal or require the making of a concession. As concerns the statutory obligation, therefore, to bargain under protest seems no more than a contradiction in terms, negating any idea that the bargainer\u2019s consideration of, and reaction to, bargaining proposals can be free and voluntary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-9\"> The Board sustained its trial examiner, although it did not adopt the findings set forth in footnote 4 of the examiner\u2019s opinion. The Board\u2019s order cannot be upheld. The allegedly guilty conduct of the company consisted merely in writing a letter <em>suggesting </em>to the union a mechanism which would allow negotiations to continue; it asked for the union\u2019s consideration of the suggestion. This was followed by the company\u2019s acquiescence in the union\u2019s responsive counter suggestion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In our view this does not add up to a refusal to bargain, violative of Section 8(a) (1) and (5). If the critical finding here could be viewed as a final inference of fact, it was not supported \u201cby substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole\u201d. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(e), and we are not concluded by it. Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 490, 491, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1965). As a matter of law we can discern no evidence supporting the conviction of American Radiator of violation of the relevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b715-10\">Enforcement of the Board\u2019s order is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-10\">. 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 158 reads, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-11\">\u201c(a) It shall be an unfair labor practice for an employer\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-12\">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed in section 157 of this title;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-19\">* sfc * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-20\">(5) to refuse to bargain collectively with the representatives of his employees, subject to the provisions of section 159 (a) of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b715-11\">. It should be emphasized that the company did not after September 22 or November 10, refuse to participate in a bargaining session at which so-called outsiders were present. It did attend and bargain at such meetings \u201cunder protest\u201d at the union\u2019s suggestion,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
