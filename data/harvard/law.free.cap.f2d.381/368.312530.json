His principal contention is that the government failed to prove that he was an alien.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-11\"> The government proved that in November 1963 Farrell pleaded guilty to an earlier violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, thus admitting his alienage. Once status as an alien has been established, it is presumed to have continued until the contrary is shown. United States ex rel. Meyer v. Day, 54 F.2d 336, 338 (2d Cir. 1931). Cf. Hauenstein v. Lynham, 100 U.S. 483, 484, 25 L.Ed. 628 (1880); Ng Kam Fook v. Esperdy, 320 F.2d 86, 89 (2d Cir. 1963); Mills v. United States, 273 F. 625, 628 (9th Cir. 1921).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-15\">The government also introduced extra-judicial oral and written declarations by Farrell that he was an alien. These admissions were properly received in proof of the fact recited. Gonzales v. Landon, 215 F.2d 955, 957 (9th Cir. 1954), rev\u2019d on other grounds 350 U.S. 920, 76 S.Ct. 210, 100 L.Ed. 806 (1955). Farrell\u2019s objection to their admissibility based upon Miranda v. State of Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), is untenable in view of Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966), limiting Miranda to prospective application.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-16\">The government also introduced a birth certificate which showed that Farrell was born in the Panama Canal Zone and that his parents were born in the British West Indies. Farrell took the stand and confirmed his place of birth and that of his parents, and further testified that his parents had never become citizens of the United States. As the court instructed the jury (without objection), a person born in the Canal Zone is a citizen of the United States only if his father or mother or both were or are citizens of the United States. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1403.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-17\">Farrell\u2019s contention that his various admissions were conclusory and not based on personal knowledge went only to their weight \u2014 and diminished that but little, if at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-18\">We find this proof of alienage overwhelming.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Indeed, no argument to the contrary was made in the trial court, the defense resting entirely upon the contention that Farrell lacked the requisite criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-12\">. Appellant now argues for the first time that he is not an \u201calien\u201d subject to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326, because he is a \u201cnational of the United States\u201d as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (22), in light of 26 Ops. Att\u2019y Gen. 376 (1907), and is therefore excluded from the definition of \u201calien\u201d by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a) (3). This contention was not made below, and the legal and factual issues bases which it rests were therefore not explored. No plain error is presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b449-21\">. We therefore need not consider appellant\u2019s contention that certain additional documentary evidence offered on this issue was improperly admitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
