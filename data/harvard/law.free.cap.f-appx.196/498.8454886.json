To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-22\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Cruz-Herrera failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-23\">Cruz-Herrera\u2019s contention that the IJ deprived her of due process by failing to consider all the hardship factors in her case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See id. </em>at 930 (\u201c[traditional abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review Cruz-Herrera\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by failing to consider her testimony and by minimizing a doctor\u2019s testimony regarding her child\u2019s dental needs because she failed to raise these issues before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Cruz-Herrera contends the IJ violated due process by overlooking the lack of proof that orthodontic facilities are available in Mexico. Contrary to Cruz-Herrera\u2019s contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [she] was prevented from reasonably presenting [her] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Cruz-Herrera failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b522-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
