Gibson, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b547-12\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-13\">Efren Escobedo appeals from the district court\u2019s denial and dismissal of his petition for habeas corpus. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-16\">The only argument presented to us by Escobedo was not presented to the district court, so we are unable to consider it. Claims not raised before the district court in the habeas petition are not cognizable on appeal. <em>Cacoperdo v. Demosthenes, </em>37 F.3d 504, 507 (9th Cir.1994). In his brief to us Escobedo argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury by failing to define \u201cforce\u201d accurately. In the district court Escobedo asserted that the jury instructions were deficient for a different .reason, specifically that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that the prosecution had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that Deputy Nix did not use excessive force. The argument presented to us is legally distinct from that made to the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-17\">Moreover, if we could reach Escobedo\u2019s argument, it would fail on the merits. There is no dispute that Escobedo resisted arrest with \u201cforce\u201d under any sensible meaning of that term. Escobedo\u2019s own brief acknowledges that he and Deputy Nix physically fought each other in \u201ca wrestling match that was described by the California Court of Appeal as an \u2018extremely aggressive battle,\u2019 \u201d and goes on to describe the encounter as \u201ca sustained struggle.\u201d Escobedo does not challenge these facts, so his subsequent complaint that the jury might have understood \u201ctouching\u201d to be sufficient to constitute \u201cforce\u201d makes no difference in the context of this case, because Escobedo did not merely \u201ctouch\u201d Nix.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-18\">What that leaves is his assertion that his use of force was reasonable in resisting unreasonable force applied by Deputy Nix, and that the jury was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>properly advised as to the definition of \u201creasonable force.\u201d But Escobedo never establishes what was unclear about the meaning of \u201creasonable force.\u201d On direct appeal, the California Court of Appeal concluded that \u201creasonable force\u201d is a commonly understood term and that the trial court did not have an obligation sua sponte to give an instruction on a commonly understood term. Escobedo says nothing to dispute that conclusion. That conclusion was not contrary to or unreasonable under clearly established federal law, the standard under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Moreover, to merit federal habeas relief, deficiencies in jury instructions must violate a constitutional right. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 642-43, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). A defective jury instruction violates a constitutional right only if the complete \u201cinstruction by itself so infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 72, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991) (quotations omitted). This is an \u201cespecially heavy\u201d burden for the petitioner to prove where the petitioner challenges an omission or incomplete instruction, rather than an erroneous instruction. <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154-55, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977). Escobedo fails to establish a defect of constitutional magnitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b547-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
