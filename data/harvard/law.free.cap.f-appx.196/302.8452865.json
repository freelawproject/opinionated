His civil rights complaint alleged that the actions or inactions of several prosecutors in the Tarrant County District Attorney\u2019s office violated his federal constitutional rights and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). He also raised state law claims. Our review is de novo. <em>See Geiger v. Jowers, </em>404 F.3d 371, 373 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Contrary to Scheanette\u2019s assertions on appeal, the defendants were absolutely immune from suit with respect to actions that were \u201cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\u201d <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 430, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976); <em>Bruce v. Wade, </em>537 F.2d 850, 852 (5th Cir.1976). Moreover, the district court was correct that Scheanette\u2019s claims were conclusional. <em>See Koch v. Puckett, </em>907 F.2d 524, 530 (5th Cir.1990). The dismissal of Scheanette\u2019s state law claims of negligence, negligent and reckless infliction of emotional distress, and false imprisonment is supported by the record. <em>See Skipper v. United States, </em>1 F.3d 349, 352 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Twyman v. Twyman, </em>855 S.W.2d 619, 621 (Tex.1993); <em>Dillard Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Silva, </em>106 S.W.3d 789, 795 (Tex.App.2003); <em>Campos v. Ysleta Gen. Hosp., Inc., </em>836 S.W.2d 791, 795 (Tex.App.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Scheanette\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit both count as strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). Scheanette has at least one other strike. <em>See Scheanette v. Thomas, </em>No. 4:05-CV-208 (N.D.Tex. Apr. 8, 2005), <em>aff'd, </em>182 Fed.Appx. 345 (5th Cir.2006). As he has at least three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996); \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-9\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b326-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
