R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b526-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-16\">Harsimram Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). The BIA adopted and affirmed the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of Singh\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal to India and protection under the Convention Against Torture. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-17\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) made an adverse credibility finding. The BIA affirmed and provided its own brief analysis. We review the decisions of the IJ and the BIA for substantial evidence and will reverse only if the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1149-50 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-21\">The IJ and BIA identified specific and cogent inconsistencies between Singh\u2019s testimony and his sworn statement at the Honolulu airport. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003) (citing requirement that factfinder establish \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for disbelief\u2019). The \u201cidentified inconsistencies go to the \u2018heart of [the] asylum claim\u2019 \u201d because they relate to Singh\u2019s treatment while in India and his fear of returning. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004) (quoting <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>301 F.3d 1109, 1111 (9th Cir.2002) (alteration in original)); <em>accord Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1156. The record does not compel a finding that Singh\u2019s testimony was credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-22\">Because the asylum petition fails, Singh\u2019s petition for withholding of removal, which requires a higher standard of proof, fails as well. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-23\">Singh\u2019s petition for protection under the Convention Against Torture also fails because Singh relies upon the same statements that the IJ and BIA determined not to be credible. <em>See Farah, </em>348 F.3d at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b526-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
