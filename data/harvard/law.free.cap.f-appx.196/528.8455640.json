R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b553-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">Juan Margarito Perez-Lopez, a native and citizen of Mexico, petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying his motion to reopen removal proceedings. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing Perez-Lopez\u2019s appeal from the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying cancellation of removal because the instant petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-10\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Perez-Lopez submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-14\">Perez-Lopez\u2019s contention that the agency failed to consider all hardship factors does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d); <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-15\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b553-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
