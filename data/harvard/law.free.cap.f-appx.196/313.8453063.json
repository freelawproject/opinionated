Pierce, Assistant U.S. Attorney, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, Lubbock, TX, Delonia Anita Watson, U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office, Northern District of Texas, Fort Worth, TX, for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-16\">Charles Scott Chambers, Law Office of Charles S. Chambers, Lubbock, TX, for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b337-19\">Before DAVIS, SMITH, and WIENER, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b337-20\">PER CURIAM: <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></author>\n<p id=\"b337-21\">Lekema Jabbar Ray appeals the sentence imposed following the entry of his guilty plea to a charge of conspiracy to distribute, possess with intent to distribute, and manufacture more than 50 grams of cocaine base. Ray was sentenced to 135 months of imprisonment and five years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-22\">Ray, who was sentenced after the Supreme Court issued its opinion in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), asserts that because the district court sentenced him within the sentencing guidelines range, the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory in violation of <em>Booker. </em>In addition to considering the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), district courts must consider the applicable sentencing guidelines range when sentencing defendants in cases that arise after <em>Booker. United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Further, following <em>Booker, </em>sentences are reviewed for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 518. A sentence within the applicable guidelines range, like Ray\u2019s, is presumed to be reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 553-54 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-25\">Ray also asserts that this court\u2019s decision in <em>Mares </em>is erroneous. Ray\u2019s challenge to <em>Mares </em>is unavailing. One panel of this court may not overrule or ignore a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>prior panel decision. <em>United States v. Walker, </em>302 F.3d 322, 325 (5th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Ray further asserts that sentencing him under the belief that the Guidelines were mandatory constitutes a structural error. The record demonstrates that the district court did not sentence Ray under the belief that the Guidelines were mandatory. Additionally, a <em>Booker </em>error is not structural error. <em>United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 561 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b337-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
