KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b744-14\">Defendant-Appellant Brent Marquize Lee pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine (count I), possession with intent to distribute cocaine base (count II), and being a fugitive from justice in possession of a firearm (supplemental information). 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B)(iii), 846 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2, 922(a)(2), (g)(2). Mr. Lee indicates that in July 2003, the district court sentenced him to 188 months imprisonment as to counts I and II, and 119 months on the supplemental information, to run concurrently. Mr. Lee did not appeal his conviction or sentence. On December 27, 2005, Mr. Lee filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion alleging that his sentence was illegal under the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) , and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . He also argued that the <em>Booker </em>decision resulted in a breach of his plea agreement and that he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-17\">After reviewing the merits, the district court dismissed Mr. Lee\u2019s petition with prejudice on February 13, 2006. R. Doc. 3 at 2. On April 17, 2006, Mr. Lee filed a notice of appeal, which we construe as a renewed application for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d). Fed. R.App. P. 22(b). Because Mr. Lee has failed to demonstrate that it is reasonably debatable whether the district court\u2019s ruling dismissing his claims is correct, <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000), we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">As a threshold matter, we must determine whether Mr. Lee\u2019s notice of appeal is timely. As we have frequently stated, \u201c[t]he filing of a timely notice of appeal is an absolute prerequisite to our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Parker v. Bd. of Pub. Utils., </em>77 F.3d 1289, 1290 (10th Cir.1996). The party claiming appellate jurisdiction, in this ease Mr. Lee, has the burden of establishing our subject-matter jurisdiction. <em>Montoya v. Chao, </em>296 F.3d 952, 955 (10th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Rule 4(a)(1)(B), Fed. R.App. P., requires that notice of appeal be filed within 60 days of the entry of judgment for any civil or criminal case in which the United States is a party. The district court entered judgment on February 13, 2006, <em>see </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 58(b)(2) (noting that a judgment is entered when it is filed as a separate document), but Mr. Lee filed his notice of appeal on April 17, 2006, some 63 days later. Because Mr. Lee did not file the notice within 60 days, we have jurisdiction only if he can demonstrate compliance with the prison mailbox rule embodied in Rule 4(c)(1), Fed. R.App. P.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The prison mailbox rule states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">If an inmate confined in an institution files a notice of appeal in either a civil or criminal case, the notice is timely if it is deposited in the institution\u2019s internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. If an institution has a system designed for legal mail, the inmate must use that system to receive the benefit of this rule. Timely filing may be shown by a declaration in compliance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 or by a notarized statement, either of which must set forth the date of deposit and state that first-class postage has been prepaid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">In <em>United States v. Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d 1140, 1145 (10th Cir.2004), we held that \u201c[i]f a prison lacks a legal mail system, a prisoner <em>must </em>submit a declaration or notarized statement setting forth the notice\u2019s date of deposit with prison officials and attest that first-class postage was pre-paid.\u201d While we held the declaration or notarized statement requirement to be absolute in cases where there is no special legal mail system, we noted that a prisoner is free to file his declaration or notarization at any time until the case is resolved. <em>Id. </em>at 1144, n. 4. Failure to comply with the declaration and notarization requirement prevents this court from having jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 1445.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">We issued an order to show cause requiring Mr. Lee to address whether his notice of appeal was in compliance with the prison mailbox rule. While Mr. Lee could have submitted a declaration or notarized statement at that time, he instead included a paragraph in his brief explaining that he and his law clerk were separated because of hurricane Katrina, he had used \u201ca third party mail system\u201d to communicate with the court, and he had used \u201cdue diligence in filing his paperwork.\u201d Applt. Br. at 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-14\">If Mr. Lee did not use a legal mail system, we lack jurisdiction. Absent a legal mail system, a prisoner <em>must </em>submit a declaration or notarized statement listing the date of deposit with prison officials and attesting that first-class postage was prepaid. <em>Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d at 1145. We have rejected explanations that fail to strictly comply with our requirements. <em>See Price v. Philpot, </em>420 F.3d 1158, 1166-67 (10th Cir.2005) (finding insufficient an appellant\u2019s notarized statement because it did not include the language \u201cunder penalty of perjury\u201d as required by 28 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u00a7 1746); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>182 F.3d 733, 735 n. 1 (10th Cir.1999) (rejecting appellant\u2019s declaration because it failed to state that first-class postage was prepaid); <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>178 Fed.Appx. 830, 833 (10th Cir.2006) (rejecting as sufficient an appellant\u2019s excuse that hurricane Katrina actually delayed the transport of his filing).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">While Mr. Lee does not precisely state that he used a legal mail system, he does state that he used \u201ca third party mail system,\u201d which under the facts herein, we equate to a \u201clegal mail system.\u201d The envelope (correctly retained by the district court) containing Mr. Lee\u2019s notice of appeal bears independent verification that such a system was used. <em>See Ceballos-Martinez, </em>387 F.3d at 1144 (declaration or notarized statement is required only \u201cin lieu of documenting the time of deposit by way of the legal mail system\u201d). Stamped on the envelope, which was transmitted by certified mail and postmarked April 13, 2006, is a statement from the prison indicating that Mr. Lee\u2019s envelope was received and processed \u201cthrough special mailing procedures\u201d on April 12, 2006, or 58 days after entry of judgment by the district court. Coupled with Mr. Lee\u2019s independent assertion that he used a \u201cthird party mail system,\u201d the prison\u2019s statement is sufficient proof to demonstrate that Mr. Lee used a legal mail system. <em>See Philpot, </em>420 F.3d at 1165 (citing <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 275, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988), for the notion that the presence of a receipt log is the key component of a legal mail system). This conclusion is consistent with our practice of liberally construing a pro se litigant\u2019s pleadings, <em>see White v. Colorado, </em>82 F.3d 364, 366 (10th Cir.1996), and our inclination to decide cases on the merits as opposed to reliance on minor technicalities, <em>see Denver &amp; Rio Grande W. R.R. Co. v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>119 F.3d 847, 848 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">Unfortunately for Mr. Lee, however, we find the district court\u2019s resolution of his \u00a7 2255 motion not reasonably debatable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Arguments like Mr. Lee\u2019s, that his sentence is illegal under <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker, </em>have been rejected by this court many times. The holdings in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are not retroactive and apply only to pending cases or cases on direct review when the decisions were issued. <em>United States v. Bellamy, </em>411 F.3d 1182, 1188 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Price, </em>400 F.3d 844, 849 (10th Cir.2005); <em>Leonard v. United States, </em>383 F.3d 1146, 1148 (10th Cir.2004). Because Mr. Lee seeks collateral relief, which does not constitute direct review, <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are of no avail.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">Mr. Lee also claims he received ineffective assistance of counsel at sentencing. To succeed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Mr. Lee must show that his counsel was constitutionally deficient and that such deficient performance prejudiced him. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <em>United States v. Orange, </em>447 F.3d 792, 796 (10th Cir.2006). Failure to demonstrate either a deficiency or prejudice is fatal to an ineffective assistance of counsel argument. <em>Orange, </em>447 F.3d at 796-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\">Mr. Lee argues that his counsel was deficient because he permitted Mr. Lee\u2019s sentence to be calculated based on facts that were not admitted to or proved beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury \u2014 the very issued raised in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Consequently, Mr. Lee essentially argues that his counsel was ineffective because he did not anticipate the holdings in <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker</em>\u2014cases that were handed down well after Mr. Lee was sentenced. The Sixth Amendment does not entitle Mr. Lee to clairvoyant counsel. <em>See United States v. Harms, </em>371 F.3d 1208, 1212 (10th Cir.2004) (\u201cThe Sixth Amendment does not require counsel for a criminal defendant to be clairvoyant.\u201d); <em>United States v. Carew, </em>140 Fed. App\u2019x 15, 18 (10th Cir.2005) (noting that failure <em>to </em>predict <em>Booker\u2019s </em>holdings is not objectively unreasonable). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Lee\u2019s counsel was not ineffective is not reasonably debatable.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">We DENY a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b746-5\">. Mr. Lee\u2019s arguments are not the clearest, but we think the district court correctly categorized them as a <em>Booker </em>challenge and an ineffective assistance of counsel challenge. Mr. Lee's apparent argument that his plea should be specifically enforced, taking into account admitted facts only, is essentially an argument to apply <em>Booker </em>to his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
