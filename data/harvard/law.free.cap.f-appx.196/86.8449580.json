Because we determine that the appeal is lacking in arguable legal merit, we will dismiss it under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-25\">Until 1998, Abrams was employed by debtor American MetroComm as a paralegal. After being discharged, Abrams filed suit under the Louisiana Whistle-Blower Act, La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 23:967, in the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans. Abrams and American MetroComm eventually settled the case and, on September 11, 2000, a Louisiana state court judge enforced the settlement agreement and dismissed Abrams\u2019 claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-26\">On August 16, 2000, American Metro-Comm filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. In January of 2001, Abrams, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a proof of claim for $100,000 based on his Louisiana state court suit. The Trust Administrator, AMC Liquidating Trust (\u201cAMC\u201d), objected to the claim and moved for summary judgment. AMC argued that Abrams\u2019 claim was barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>the Louisiana state court settlement. On December 15, 2003, the Bankruptcy Court granted AMC\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">On May 18, 2004, Abrams appealed the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order to the District Court for the District of Delaware. In the District Court, AMC filed a motion to dismiss Abrams\u2019 appeal, arguing that Abrams\u2019 notice of appeal was untimely. The District Court granted the motion and Abrams timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d). Having granted Abrams leave to proceed <em>informa pauper-is </em>on appeal, we must now determine whether his appeal should be dismissed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). An appeal may be dismissed under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) if it has no arguable basis in law or fact. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989). Whether <em>an </em>appeal from the bankruptcy court to a district court is timely is a question of law which we review de novo. <em>Shareholders v. Sound Radio, Inc., </em>109 F.3d 873, 879 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-7\">Pursuant to Federal Rule of Bankruptcy Procedure 8002(a), a notice of appeal must be filed within ten days of the judgment or order which is appealed. The Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure contemplate situations where Rule 8002(a)\u2019s deadline cannot be met. Certain post-judgment motions, if timely, will extend the time to file a notice of appeal. Fed. R. BankrP. 8002(b). And Rule 8002(c) provides for an extra twenty-day period when a party\u2019s failure to file a timely notice of appeal is due to excusable neglect. A request for such an extension of time \u201cmust be made by written motion ... filed not later than 20 days after the expiration of the time for filing a notice of appeal.\u201d Fed. R. Bankr.P. 8002(c)(2). After twenty days have passed from the expiration of the time to file a notice of appeal, an assertion of excusable neglect will not serve to extend period for filing an appeal. <em>Sound Radio, Inc., </em>109 F.3d at 879.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Applying these rules, it is clear that Abrams\u2019 appeal was untimely. Abrams filed no post-judgment motions in the Bankruptcy Court. Abrams also did not file a motion under Rule 8002(c) for an extension of time. Further, since Abrams\u2019 notice of appeal was filed more than five months after the entry of the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order, even if his failure to appeal was due to excusable neglect, it was too late for him to benefit from any extension under Rule 8002(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Abrams argues that he should be excused from Rule 8002(a)\u2019s deadline for filing a notice of appeal because he was called away for a family emergency and did not receive the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order until just before May 18. Further, he argues that the deadlines laid out in the Bankruptcy Rules should not be strictly enforced against him because he is proceeding <em>pro se. </em>Finally, Abrams claims that the entire bankruptcy proceeding is a continuing fraud which makes his notice of appeal timely. None of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-11\">Abrams\u2019 absence due to his family emergency is, at most, excusable neglect, and will not toll the period for filing a notice of appeal absent an application under Rule 8002(c). <em>See Sound Radio, Inc., </em>109 F.3d at 879. We also note that, in the letter accompanying his untimely notice of appeal, Abrams claimed that he had still not received the District Court order at that time. Since Abrams was, in the end, able to discover the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s judgment, even though he had not received a copy of the order, it remains unclear what actually prevented him from filing the notice sooner. Abrams second argument is similarly without merit. We have never held that courts\u2019 obligations to liberally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>interpret <em>pro se </em>pleadings justifies ignoring deadlines for filing an appeal. <em>See e.g. Poole v. Family Court of New Castle County, </em>368 F.3d 263, 266-69 (3d Cir.2004). Finally, regardless of whether the bankruptcy proceeding is a continuing fraud, Abrams is appealing the particular order denying his claim, making the continuing nature of the bankruptcy proceeding irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">In sum, we readily conclude that the District Court correctly dismissed Abrams\u2019 appeal as untimely. Because his appeal lacks merit, we will dismiss it under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). In light of the disposition of the appeal, Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and Appellant\u2019s motion to stay proceedings are denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
