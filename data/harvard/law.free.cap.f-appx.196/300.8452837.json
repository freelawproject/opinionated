Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rainwater\u2019s motion challenged the 1,128-month sentence he received for armed robbery and use of a firearm during a crime of violence. He argues that his sentence should be reduced in light of <em>Booker, </em>and that the amended judgment is incorrect because the sentences imposed on the firearms counts were ordered to run concurrently, rather than consecutively. The Government has filed a motion for summary affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Rainwater may not raise a <em>Booker </em>claim. <em>See United States v. Gentry, </em>432 F.3d 600, 605 (5th Cir.2005). With regard to his remaining claim, Rainwater cannot demonstrate plain error because he cannot show that he was prejudiced by the imposition of concurrent rather than consecutive sentences. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-33, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Accordingly, the Government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">MOTION GRANTED; JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
