The disposition of this appeal is governed by this court\u2019s decisions in <em>United States v. Pho, </em>433 F.3d 53 (1st Cir.2006), and <em>United States v. Navedo-Concepci\u00f3n, </em>450 F.3d 54 (1st Cir.2006), both of which post-dated Taffere\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-25\">Taffere attempts to avoid <em>Pho\u2019s </em>holding that a sentencing court may not categorically substitute a 20:1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio for the 100:1 ratio provided in the guidelines, <em>Pho, </em>433 F.3d at 64, by conceding that such a categorical substitution, which he sought below, is now precluded but arguing that the court nevertheless should have considered the crack/powder disparity in determining whether the resulting sentence was greater than necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). That argument is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-26\">Although <em>Pho </em>left open the possibility that \u201cthe nature of the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline sentence may ... be taken into account on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>case-by-case basis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 65, Taffere points to no case-specific circumstances that would require a lesser sentence here. The judge explicitly considered the only potentially mitigating circumstances brought to his attention by defense counsel \u2014 Taffere\u2019s difficult adjustment to life in the United States, to which he had immigrated at a young age from the Sudan, and his post-conviction efforts at rehabilitation, including obtaining his GED \u2014 but nevertheless concluded that a lesser sentence would not fulfill the criteria set forth in section 3553(a), including deterrence and public protection, and that a reduction based on the crack/powder cocaine differential would create rather than avoid sentencing disparity among different judges and districts. In imposing a sentence below the statutory minimum (pursuant to the safety valve) and just one month above the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, the judge expressed his hope that the relatively light sentence would afford Taffere the opportunity for rehabilitation. He also took into account Taffere\u2019s strong family ties by recommending that he be imprisoned in Pennsylvania, where his family had relatives with whom they could stay while visiting him. Under <em>Navedo-Concepci\u00f3n, </em>450 F.3d at 58, the \u201cnot greater than necessary\u201d language of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) requires no further explanation of why a still lighter sentence would be inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">Accordingly, the sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
