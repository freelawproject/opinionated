No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Garza argues that the district court clearly erred in determining that he was responsible for 80 to 100 kilograms of cocaine. He contends that trial testimony by Charles Anthony Brown about Garza\u2019s drug transactions with Brown was too ambiguous and contradictory for the district court to determine the quantity of cocaine attributable to Garza. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s determination of the quantity of drugs used to establish a base offense level for sentencing purposes under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Simpson, </em>228 F.3d 1294, 1298 (11th Cir.2000). In reviewing the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing, \u201c[w]e accord great deference to the district court\u2019s credibility determinations.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregg, </em>179 F.3d 1312, 1316 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\u201c[T]he base offense level for a possession or a conspiracy drug offense is ordinarily calculated by determining the quantity of drugs attributable to a defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1296 (11th Cir.2005) (citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(a)). \u201cWhere there is no drug seizure or the amount seized does not reflect the scale of the offense, the court shall approximate the quantity of the controlled substance.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 12. For offenses involving at least 50 kilograms but less than 150 kilograms of cocaine, the base offense level is 36. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">In this case, the district court\u2019s drug quantity calculation was based in large part on Brown\u2019s trial testimony. The district court concluded that Brown\u2019s testimony was credible, a determination that is entitled to great deference on appeal. <em>See Gregg, </em>179 F.3d at 1316. Because Brown\u2019s testimony established that Garza was responsible for 80 to 100 kilograms of cocaine, the district court did not clearly err in determining that Garza\u2019s base offense level was 36. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
