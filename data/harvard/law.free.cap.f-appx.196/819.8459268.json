On appeal, Singletary raises a single contention, arguing that the district court judge erred in failing to recuse herself based on remarks she made after sentencing. These are the remarks that Singletary seizes upon in this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-23\">While your lawyer asked me to sentence you to 120 months, I can\u2019t do that. This is \u2014 not because I don\u2019t have the option. I do have the option if I so chose. It\u2019s because of the severity of this crime. I went through it at the last sentencing of your co-defendant [ ], but the amount of drugs involved here is just hard to even fathom, and I think you realize just since you, yourself, have dealt with drug issues in your life, just the amount of damage that that has done to citizens throughout our state, where both you and I reside, where both you and I have children who could use those drugs and have their lives ruined, and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want that for your children as I don\u2019t want that for my children. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>that\u2019s the very \u2014 that\u2019s the situation that you were involved in, by your participation in this scheme. And this was not a situation where law enforcement stopped the drugs before they found a way to the streets of our community and that\u2019s why a strong sentence is warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">Ordinarily we review a district judge\u2019s decision not to recuse herself for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999). However, because Brown failed to raise the issue in any way in the district court, our review is only for plain error. <em>See Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983) (stating that where \u201c[t]he plaintiff ... invoked neither [recusal] statute in the district court[, ... ] the plain error standard of review applies\u201d). Plain error exists when there is: (1) error that is, (2) plain, (3) affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). We have held, however, that an error cannot meet the \u201cplain\u201d requirement of the plain error rule unless it is clear under current binding law. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1321 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Two statutes govern recusal: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144 and 455. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1983). Under \u00a7 144, a party can file a \u201ctimely and sufficient affidavit\u201d complaining of a trial judge\u2019s personal bias. Under \u00a7 455, however, no affidavit is required and a judge must recuse herself whenever proper grounds exist. <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>888 F.2d 732, 744 (11th Cir.1989). The standard under \u00a7 455(a) is whether \u201c[her] impartiality might be reasonably questioned,\u201d and \u00a7 455(b) covers circumstance-specific disqualification, such as where the judge has a personal bias against a party or personal knowledge of disputed facts, has expressed an opinion about the case outside the context of the proceedings themselves, holds a financial interest implicated in the controversy, or has a spouse or relative involved with the business or affairs of one of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-9\">For recusal to occur under \u00a7 455(a), we determine whether \u201can objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2003). Disqualification under \u00a7 455(b) is mandatory because \u201cthe potential for conflicts of interest are readily apparent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). To disqualify a judge under \u00a7 455(a) and (b)(1), the bias \u201cmust stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate \u2018such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bailey, </em>175 F.3d at 968. \u201c[A]dverse rulings alone do not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Here the district court judge did not commit any error, much less plain error, in failing to recuse herself based upon her stated concerns about the effect that illegal drugs could have on the community, including children. We expect that all law-abiding people who are well-informed share the same concern. Not only that but the sentencing statute requires that the judge consider the nature and circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>stances of the crime, its seriousness, and the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1), (a)(2)(A) <em>&amp; </em>(C). An objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would not entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality. <em>See Patti, </em>337 F.3d at 1321. So, recusal was not required under \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Nor was recusal required under \u00a7 455(b). Even Singletary concedes that the record fails to demonstrate that the district court judge had a \u201cpersonal animus toward him.\u201d At most, the judge had a citizen\u2019s bias against Singletary\u2019s crime, and that is not the type of view that requires recusal. If it were, we would have no judges who could sentence murderers, because everyone has strong feelings against murder. In addition, because Singletary did not file an affidavit with the district court, \u00a7 144 is inapplicable to this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
