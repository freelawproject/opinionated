Carl Humbarger appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-24\">The district court reviewed a declaration from the EEOC and examined the documents in camera, and thus had an adequate factual basis for its decision to exempt two EEOC investigative memoranda from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 522(b)(5). <em>See Lion Raisins Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., </em>354 F.3d 1072, 1078 (9th Cir.2004). The declaration explained that the memoranda were predecisional and part of the agency\u2019s deliberative process, so that their disclosure would expose the EEOC\u2019s decision-making process and inhibit the agency\u2019s ability to perform its function. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that the FOIA exemption applied because \u201cdisclosure of the requested information would reveal [somejthing about the agency\u2019s decisional process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>The district court properly dismissed the claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 against the EEOC and individual EEOC employees. There is no express or implied cause of action against the EEOC or its employees by the employee of a third party who is unhappy with the EEOC\u2019s processing of his claim. <em>See Ward v. EEOC, </em>719 F.2d 311, 313-14 (9th Cir.1983). Humbarger therefore failed to state a claim against those defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Humbarger\u2019s second motion to amend his complaint. Humbarger sought to amend to add a <em>Bivens </em>claim against individual employees, but his claim was against the employees in their official capacities, and as discussed directly above there is no right of action against EEOC employees when a plaintiff is unhappy with the agency\u2019s processing of his complaint. Further, Humbarger did not have standing to assert a Fifth Amendment claim against the employees, because even if he was injured by his loss of back pay, he could not show that if the agency had produced two additional memoranda his employers would have settled or a jury would have found for Humbarger, and that he would therefore have received back pay. <em>See Allen v. Wright, </em>468 U.S. 737, 757, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984) (where government conduct is challenged as unlawful, unless plaintiff can show injury fairly traceable to the conduct there is no standing).</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b544-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
