His complaint<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contained five counts. Count I alleged that because of his race and color he was not selected for a lateral transfer to the position of Quality Assurance Weapons Inspector; Count II alleged that for the same reason he was not selected for promotion to the position of Weapons Loading Supervisor. Counts III and IV alleged that after he filed a formal complaint of discrimination with the Secretary, the Air Force retaliated against him by subjecting him to adverse employment actions (Count III) and by creating a hostile work environment (Count IV). Finally, in Count VI, he alleged that by compelling him to take disability retirement, the Air Force constructively discharged him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b825-8\">The Secretary\u2019s answer to Taylor\u2019s complaint denied liability and alleged that the challenged employment decisions were made for legitimate non-discriminatory reasons. Following discovery, the Secretary moved the district court for summary judgment. The court granted his motion, and Taylor took this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-9\">Taylor does not appeal the court\u2019s disposition of Count I. Rather, he seeks the vacation of summary judgment on Counts II, III, IV and VI. We first address Count II, the failure to promote claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-13\">Title VII prohibits employers from discriminating \u201cagainst any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1). Where a plaintiff attempts to prove discrimination by circumstantial evidence, his claims are subject to the burden shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). Under that framework, the plaintiff must first create an inference of discrimination by establishing a <em>prima facie ease. McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. If the plaintiff successfully creates such inference, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate nondiscriminatory basis for the employment action. <em>Vessels v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>408 F.3d 763, 767 (11th Cir.2005). If the employer meets this burden, the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of the evidence that the proffered reasons were a pretext for the alleged discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-14\">In the context of a promotion, \u201c[a] plaintiff must show that the disparities between the successful applicant\u2019s and [his] own qualifications were \u2018of such weight and significance that no reasonable person, in the exercise of impartial judgment, could have chosen the candidate selected over the plaintiff.\u2019\u201d <em>Brooks v. County Commission, </em>446 F.3d 1160, 1163 (11th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 732 (2004), as approved by <em>Ash v. Tyson Foods, Inc. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1195, 1197, 163 L.Ed.2d 1053 (2006)).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>The Secretary concedes that Taylor established a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination on Count II. Notwithstanding that concession, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that Taylor failed to show that the Air Force\u2019s proffered legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for failing to promote him were pretextual. First, Taylor did not meet his burden of showing that the disparities between his qualifications and those of the candidate who was promoted were so significant that no reasonable person could have chosen the other individual. It is undisputed that the individual who received the promotion spent more than ten years as a weapons loader and gained experience in the intricacies of the F-16 aircraft while working as a Crew Chief. Second, Taylor has provided no evidence that the Air Force did not believe that the individual who was promoted was qualified for the position. Taylor admitted that both and he and the other candidate were on the certified list of qualified candidates that the Air Force decision-maker received. Therefore, it was reasonable for the decision-maker to believe that all the candidates on the list were eligible for the position. Finally, Taylor failed to show that the Air Force\u2019s assertion that his poor attitude during his interview was a pretext for discrimination. We therefore affirm the grant of summary judgment on Count II. We turn, then, to the claims of retaliation, beginning with Count III.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Title VII prohibits an employer from retaliating against an employee \u201cbecause [the employee] has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice ... or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this sub-chapter [of Title VII].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>framework, a plaintiff must show (1) participation in protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal connection between the two. <em>Cooper, </em>390 F.3d at 740. To establish an adverse employment action, \u201can employee must show a <em>serious and material </em>change in the terms, conditions, or privileges of employment ... [,] as viewed by a reasonable person in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Davis v. Town of Lake Park, Florida, </em>245 F.3d 1232, 1239 (11th Cir.2001) (emphasis in original). A \u201cplaintiff must show that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse.\u201d <em>Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. White, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 165 L.Ed.2d 345 (2006) (retaliation case). The Supreme Court noted that it phrased the standard in \u201cgeneral terms because the significance of any given act of retaliation will often depend upon the particular circumstances. Context matters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For example, \u201c[a] schedule change in an employee\u2019s work schedule may make little difference to many workers, but may matter enormously to a young mother with school age children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A transfer that results in a diminished opportunity for increases in salary constitutes an adverse employment action. <em>See Bass v. Board of County Commissioners of Orange County, Fla., </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1118-19 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b826-8\">To establish a causal connection between participation in a protected activity and adverse employment action, \u201ca plaintiff need only show that the protected activity and the adverse action were not wholly unrelated.\u201d <em>Brungart v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>231 F.3d 791, 799 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). A substantial delay between the protected activity and the negative employment action, where there is no other evidence of causation, is insufficient to establish a causal connection. <em>See Clark County Sch. Dist. v. Bree</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number><em>den, </em>532 U.S. 268, 273-74, 121 S.Ct. 1508, 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 509 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">In the case at hand, we conclude that the district court erred in concluding that Taylor failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation based on the denial of Taylor\u2019s shift-change request.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, Taylor\u2019s supervisor\u2019s repeated refusal to transfer Taylor to the night shift constituted an adverse employment action. In considering the context, as we must under <em>Burlington, </em>and drawing all inferences in Taylor\u2019s favor, a reasonable worker who (1) had experienced a tense work environment with a particular supervisor; (2) had requested a return to the shift he previously worked before serving abroad in order to take his children to school and avoid a tense environment; and (3) whose request was denied for more than one year, would have considered his employer\u2019s actions a significant change in the terms and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">In addition, Taylor established a causal connection between his supervisor\u2019s failure to transfer him to the night shift and his EEO complaint because when Taylor asked for a shift change, the supervisor commented that Taylor should have thought about the consequences before filing his complaint, which suggests that his supervisor\u2019s decision was not wholly unrelated to the filing. Finally, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to the supervisor\u2019s reason for refusing to transfer Taylor to the night shift in 2001. The supervisor asserted that there were no openings available in 2001, but Taylor provided evidence, which, if viewed in the light most favorable to him, shows that he was ultimately transferred after his attorney wrote a letter to the Air Force and a Judge Advocate ordered that he be transferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-10\">We conflate counts IV and VI because both counts allege that Taylor was subjected to a hostile work environment and both seek essentially the same relief. Count IV alleges that Taylor was retaliated against via a hostile work environment; Count IV alleges that he was constructively discharged due to such hostile work environment and because the Air Force compelled him to take disability retirement. As the district court observed, the real reason for Taylor\u2019s discharge/retirement was his \u201cextremely serious 20-year old injury\u201d that Taylor admitted was causing him \u201cexcruciating\u201d pain. A constructive discharge only occurs when the employer imposes working conditions that are \u201cso intolerable that a reasonable person in [the employee\u2019s] position would have been compelled to resign.\u201d <em>Fitz v. Pugmire, </em>348 F.3d 974, 977 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b827-11\">Here, the district court committed no error in rejecting the Counts IV and VI claims. Taylor adduced no evidence indicating that his working conditions were so intolerable that a reasonable person in his position would have been compelled to resign. And it is clear that he retired due to the injury the district court observed.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-12\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on Counts II, IV and VI. We vacate the court\u2019s judgment on Count III and remand that count for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-13\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-10\">. The complaint before us is Taylor\u2019s amended complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b825-17\">. The amended complaint did not include a Count 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b827-7\">. After he filed his EEO claim of discrimination, Taylor repeatedly asked his supervisor to transfer him to the night shift. He did not receive the transfer. He claims that his supervisor\u2019s refusal to grant it was in retaliation for his filing of the claim of discrimination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
