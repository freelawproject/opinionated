Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). The United States Constitution limits this court\u2019s jurisdiction to live cases and controversies. U.S. Const, art. III, \u00a7 2. The case-or-controversy requirement demands \u201cthat some concrete and continuing injury other than the now-ended incarceration or parole \u2014 some \u2018collateral consequence\u2019 of the conviction \u2014 must exist if the suit is to be maintained.\u201d <em>Spencer v. Kemna, </em>523 U.S. 1, 7, 118 S.Ct. 978, 140 L.Ed.2d 43 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-17\">During the pendency of this appeal, Ward completed his imprisonment term, and he has been released from the custody of the Bureau of Prisons. The district court\u2019s order revoking Ward\u2019s term of supervised release imposed no further term of supervised release. Accordingly, there is no case or controversy for this court to address, and the appeal is DISMISSED AS MOOT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b340-29\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
