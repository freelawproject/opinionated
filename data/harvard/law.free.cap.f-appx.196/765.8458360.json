Lawal, a <em>pro se </em>federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to state a claim, under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-22\">In his \u00a7 1983 complaint, Lawal stated that he purchased a house located at 3068 Chapel Hill Road, Douglasville, Georgia, from Raymond Fowler. After purchasing the house, Lawal was convicted of conspiracy to obtain fraudulent student visas. Lawal began serving his sentence for this offense; and Fowler initiated legal proceedings to recover a wine collection that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>was left in the house that Lawal had purchased. Fowler, aided by his attorney, Leon Jones, obtained a temporary restraining order (\u201cTRO\u201d) from Georgia Superior Court Judge Robert James, which gave the Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s Office the authority to enter Lawal\u2019s house and seize the wine collection.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Lawal\u2019s \u00a7 1983 complaint named Fowler, Jones, Judge James, the \u201cUnnamed Douglas County Sheriff,\u201d and the Douglas County Sheriffs Department (the \u201cdefendants\u201d) in an action alleging that the defendants violated Lawal\u2019s constitutional rights by conspiring to break into his house illegally. Lawal argued that the TRO incorrectly listed the address of his house as 3068 Wesley Chapel Road and did not state with particularity the items to be seized from his home. Lawal also asserted that, when the defendants realized that the TRO listed the incorrect address, the defendants conspired to issue a corrected TRO after the search of Lawal\u2019s house was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal of a suit for failure to state a claim for relief under \u00a7 1915A. <em>Harden v. Pataki, </em>320 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003). We view all fact allegations in the complaint as true. <em>Brown v. Johnson, </em>387 F.3d 1344, 1347 (11th Cir.2004). In addition, we liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>Id. </em>at 1350. To state a claim for relief based on \u00a7 1983, \u201c[plaintiffs] must establish that they were deprived of a right secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States, and that the alleged deprivation was committed under color of state law.\u201d <em>American Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, </em>526 U.S. 40, 119 S.Ct. 977, 985, 143 L.Ed.2d 130 (1999). We address Lawal\u2019s claims against each defendant in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-9\">First, about defendants Fowler and Jones, who are not government agents or employees, Lawal has made no allegation that they acted under color of state law. <em>See id.; Focus on the Family v. Pinellas Suncoast Transit Auth., </em>344 F.3d 1263, 1277 (11th Cir.2003) (explaining that \u201cthe under-color-of-state-law element of \u00a7 1983 excludes from its reach merely private conduct, no matter how discriminatory or wrongful\u201d). Although Lawal asserted that Fowler and Jones conspired with the other defendants to enter his home illegally, his bare assertion that such a conspiracy existed is insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Phillips v. Mashburn, </em>746 F.2d 782, 785 (11th Cir.1984) (\u201cThe naked assertion of a conspiracy between a state judge and private defendants without supporting operative facts provides an insufficient state action nexus for a section 1983 action.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-10\">Second, the district court determined that Judge James would have absolute immunity from liability under \u00a7 1983 for his judicial acts in this case. To determine if a judge who has been sued under \u00a7 1983 is entitled to judicial immunity, we consider a two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-11\">The first part of the test is whether the judge dealt with the plaintiff in a judicial capacity. If the judge was not dealing with the plaintiff in a judicial capacity, then there is no immunity. If the judge was dealing with the plaintiff in his judi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>cial capacity, however, the second part of the test is whether the judge acted in the clear absence of all jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKe\"><em>Simmons v. Conger, </em>86 F.3d 1080, 1084-85 (11th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 1105, 1107, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978)). Here, we, given the pleadings, assume that Judge James dealt with Lawal in a judicial capacity; but our review of the record does not indicate that Judge James acted \u201cin the clear absence of all jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Third, the unnamed Douglas County Sheriff who executed the TRO issued by Judge James is entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Roland v. Phillips, </em>19 F.3d 552, 556 (11th Cir.1994) (\u201c[L]aw enforcement personnel, acting in furtherance of their official duties and relying on a facially valid court order, are entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity from suit in a section 1983 action.\u201d). Lawal asserts that the TRO was \u201cillegal\u201d because it listed incorrectly the address of the place to be searched as 3068 Wesley Chapel Road, instead of 3068 Chapel Hill Road, and because it did not contain a bill of particulars listing the items to be seized. But the TRO directed the Sheriff to refer to Fowler\u2019s complaint accompanying his motion for a TRO, which listed the correct address of Lawal\u2019s house and provided a description of the wine collection to be seized. Therefore, the law enforcement officers who executed the TRO at Lawal\u2019s house as part of their official duties are entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">Finally, Lawal named the Douglas County Sheriff's Department as a defendant in his \u00a7 1983 claim. Because the capacity to be sued is \u201cdetermined by the law of the state in which the district court is held,\u201d Georgia law controls in this case. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 17(b). The Georgia Supreme Court has explained that \u201cin every suit there must be a legal entity as the real plaintiff and the real defendant. This state recognizes only three classes as legal entities, namely: (1) natural persons; (2) an artificial person (a corporation); and (3) such quasi-artificial persons as the law recognizes as being capable to sue.\u201d <em>Georgia Insurers Insolvency Pool v. Elbert County, </em>258 Ga. 317, 368 S.E.2d 500, 502 (1988) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">Because \u201c[sjheriff s departments and police departments are not usually considered legal entities subject to suit,\u201d we see no error in the district court\u2019s decision that Lawal failed to state a claim against the Douglas County Sheriff's Department.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Dean v. Barber, </em>951 F.2d 1210, 1214 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s dismissal of Lawal\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim was not erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-7\">. Lawal also offers as support for his argument about the defendants\u2019 conspiracy that\u2014 after the search of Lawal's house was conducted- \u2014 Judge James issued a \"corrective\u201d TRO, which stated that the TRO used to execute the search inadvertently listed Lawal\u2019s address as 3068 Wesley Chapel Road instead of the correct address that Fowler provided in his TRO motion, complaint, and other pleadings. Georgia courts can correct clerical mistakes appearing in orders, <em>see </em>Ga.Code Ann. \u00a7 9 \u2014 11\u201460(g); and Lawal\u2019s claim does not alter our analysis that Fowler and Jones were not acting under color of state law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-5\">. In his complaint, Lawal stated that the Douglas County Sheriff executed the TRO issued by Judge James; but in his brief before us, Lawal asserts that Douglas County Sheriff\u2019s deputies executed the TRO. Our analysis about absolute quasi-judicial immunity applies regardless if the Sheriff or Sheriff\u2019s deputies executed the TRO in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b792-13\">. We reached a similar conclusion in a recent unpublished decision. <em>See Lovelace v. Dekalb Cent. Probation, </em>144 Fed.Appx. 793, 795 (11th Cir.2005) (agreeing with the district court that the Dekalb County, Georgia Police Department was not a legal entity subject to suit under \u00a7 1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"An8u\">. The district court also concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to make a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>about whether the TRO in this case was unconstitutional because of Fowler\u2019s purported failure to establish ownership of the seized wine collection. Because dismissal of Lawal\u2019s case for failure to state a claim was proper, we need not address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
