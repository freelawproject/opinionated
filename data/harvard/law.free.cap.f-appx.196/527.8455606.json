To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen or reconsider. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the new facts in petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen would not alter its prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 600 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether the new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency deprived them of due process by misapplying the law to the facts of their case does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[traditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b552-10\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision affirming the immigration judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) order denying cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>SocopGonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s underlying order dismissing petitioners\u2019 direct appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision because the instant petition for review is not timely as to that order. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b552-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
