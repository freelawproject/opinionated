For reversal, West argues his sentence is unreasonable, because (1) the district court did not grant credit against the sentence for time he served while state charges against him were pending, (2) the court did not run his sentence concurrently with his state probation-revocation sentence, and (3) in making that decision the court clearly erred in balancing the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-22\">West\u2019s arguments are unavailing. The record shows that the district court carefully considered the relevant circumstances in this case and other appropriate sentencing factors, therefore, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion or imposed an unreasonable sentence when it refused to run West\u2019s sentence concurrently with his undischarged state sentence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), p.s. <em>&amp; </em>comment. (n.3(A) &amp; (Q); <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>451 F.3d 939, 940 (8th Cir.2006) (\u00a7 5G1.3(c) provides court wide discretion to order federal sentence to run consecutively to undischarged state sentence); <em>cf. United States v. Atteberry, </em>447 F.3d 562, 564 (8th Cir.2006) (noting that principal issue for appellate review is whether consecutive sentence is unreasonable, and holding that consecutive sentence was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>unreasonable given defendant\u2019s crimes and district court\u2019s explanation that defendant\u2019s state and federal convictions were separate, that defendant required incarceration following discharge of his state sentence, and that total combined sentence was appropriate),</p>\n<p id=\"Atp\">Accordingly, we affirm,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-24\">.
