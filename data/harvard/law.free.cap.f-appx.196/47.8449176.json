The district court (Batts, J.) granted Appellee\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered final judgment on October 4, 2005. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the relevant facts and the specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and asks whether the district court properly concluded that there were no genuine issues of material fact and that the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). In determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact, this Court is \u201crequired to resolve all ambiguities and draw all permissible factual inferences in favor of the party against whom summary judgment is sought.\u201d <em>Terry v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 128, 137 (2d Cir.2003) (citation omitted). This Court will only affirm the dismissal of a claim on summary judgment if \u201cit appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of [his] claim which would entitle [him] to relief.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Having considered each of Appellant\u2019s arguments, we affirm the judgment of the district court for substantially the reasons given in its decision. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
