Pauley, United States District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b63-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b63-21\">In a separate per curiam opinion filed today, we held that we only have appellate jurisdiction over Plaintiffs-Appellants Roger H. Goodspeed\u2019s and Joann P. Good-speed\u2019s (the \u201cGoodspeeds\u201d) appeal from a judgment of the United States District Court for District of Vermont (William K. Sessions III, <em>Chief </em>Judge) denying what we construe as a Rule 60(b)(1) motion for relief from a judgment. <em>See Feldberg v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Quechee Lakes Corp., </em>468 F.3d 195 (2d Cir.2006). We assume familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history, and issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">We review the district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion. <em>Cody, Inc. v. Town of Woodbury, </em>179 F.3d 52, 56 (2d Cir.1999). A district court abuses its discretion if it bases its ruling on an erroneous view of the law or on a clearly erroneous assessment of the evidence. <em>Transaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana, </em>162 F.3d 724, 729 (2d Cir.1998). In an appeal from a denial of a Rule 60(b) motion, we review only that denial; we do not examine the underlying judgment itself. <em>Cody, </em>179 F.3d at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The only issue before us is whether the district court abused its discretion in adhering to its prior ruling that a December 12, 1983 stipulated Final Judgment (the \u201c1983 Final Judgment\u201d), between Sumner and Ester Feldberg (the \u201cFeldbergs\u201d) and the Quechee Lakes Corporation (\u201cQLC\u201d), did not involve the twenty-five foot right-of-way across the greenbelt between Defendant-Appellee Mark Comora\u2019s property and Allen Family Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court held that the 1983 Final Judgment could not bind non-party successors in interest such as the DefendantsAppellees, and granted their motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">It is well-settled that ordinarily a non-party is not bound by a personal judgment and no one disputes that the DefendantsAppellees were never parties to the 1983 Final Judgment. However, certain judgments involving real or personal property may bind non-party successors in interest to property <em>involved </em>in the action. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Judgments \u00a7\u00a7 34(3), 43(1)(a) &amp; (b); <em>see also Int\u2019l Nutrition Co. v. Horphag Research, Ltd., </em>220 F.3d 1325, 1329 (Fed.Cir.2000); 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller <em>&amp; </em>Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice &amp; Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d </em>\u00a7 4462 (2002). Thus, the key question is whether the 1983 Final Judgment involved Comora\u2019s property and the twenty-five foot right-of-way from this property across the greenbelt to Allen Family Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-10\">A consent decree, such as the 1983 Final Judgment, \u201cis a contract between the parties, and should be interpreted accordingly.\u201d <em>Waldman ex rel. Elliott Waldman Pension Trust v. Riedinger, </em>423 F.3d 145, 148 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the district court sat in diversity, Vermont law applies. Under Vermont law, whether a contract is ambiguous and, in turn, the construction of an unambiguous contract, are both questions of law. <em>See State v. Spitsyn, </em>174 Vt. 545, 811 A.2d 201, 204 (2002). In determining whether a contract is ambiguous, a court \u201cmay consider evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making of the contract,\u201d and in determining the meaning of a contract, a court may consider all parts of the contract, \u201cso they form a harmonious whole,\u201d but should not \u201cread terms into the contract unless they arise by necessary implication.\u201d <em>Morrisseau v. Fayette, </em>164 Vt. 358, 670 A.2d 820, 826 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-11\">No one seriously disputes that the QLC\u2019s decision to build condominiums near the Feldbergs triggered the filing of their complaint in 1982, and eventually led the Feldbergs and the QLC to enter into the 1983 Final Judgment. The 1983 Final Judgment fails to mention Comora\u2019s property or the twenty-five foot right-of-way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>across the greenbelt to Allen Family Road, and there is no evidence in the record that the QLC planned to build condominiums on these parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Nonetheless, the Goodspeeds argue that paragraphs 17 and 19 of the 1983 Final Judgment demonstrate that the portion of the greenbelt at issue was actually \u201cinvolved\u201d in the 1983 Final Judgment. Based solely on the fact that these paragraphs only list lots east of the greenbelt as having access to Allen Family Road, the Goodspeeds argue that these paragraphs implicitly deny access to Allen Family Road from any lot located on the west side of the greenbelt, including Comora\u2019s lot and the twenty-five foot right-of-way across the greenbelt. The Goodspeeds claim that, at the very least, these paragraphs create an ambiguity regarding the interpretation of the Final Judgment that should have precluded the district court\u2019s original ruling on the motion to dismiss, and its subsequent denial of their Rule 60(b)(1) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">We disagree. There are no sufficient references to Comora\u2019s property and the twenty-five foot right-of-way across the greenbelt in the 1983 Final Judgment. The district court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to create ambiguity by implication where there was none. To the contrary, a speculative insertion of references to Comora\u2019s property and the twenty-five foot right-of-way would violate Vermont contract law, which prevents courts from reading terms into a contract \u201cunless they arise by <em>necessary </em>implication.\u201d <em>Morrisseau, </em>670 A.2d at 826 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Moreover, even assuming arguendo that paragraphs 17 and 19 somehow implicitly referred to Comora\u2019s property and the twenty-five-foot right of way, the language of these paragraphs indicates that they were intended as personal judgments between the Feldbergs and QLC and not servitudes on land, because they operate as injunctions <em>(i. e., </em>prohibiting QLC from doing certain things on, about, or with Allen Family Road). <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Judgments \u00a7 43, cmt. f. In fact, other portions of the 1983 Final Judgment explicitly state that they are to operate as restrictive covenants that run with the land to the benefit of the Feldbergs and their successors in interest, while paragraphs 17 and 19 of the 1983 Final Judgment have no such language. Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion in characterizing these portions of the 1983 Final Judgment as personal between the Feldbergs and the QLC, incapable of binding successors in interest to the twenty-five foot right-of-way across the greenbelt from Comora\u2019s property to Allen Family Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\">Finally, we turn to equitable considerations, which are relevant in deciding whether or not to bind non-parties to a judgment involving real property. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) Judgments \u00a7 43, cmt. a. None of the current litigants were parties to the twenty-year old dispute over the construction of condominiums, and the land at issue in this litigation has nothing to do with condominiums. The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the Defendants-Appellees would not have anticipated that the 1983 Final Judgment would ever apply to them, and that binding them to this twenty-year-old judgment would be inequitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">In sum, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that 1983 Final Judgment between the Feldbergs and the QLC primarily concerned the construction of condominiums, was otherwise personal between the two parties, and could not be used to impose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>restrictions on non-parties to the original lawsuit or on unrelated parcels of land.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the Goodspeeds\u2019 Rule 12 60(b)(1) motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b64-7\">. In July 2003, the Goodspeeds moved to reopen this 1983 Final Judgment, and it is considered the complaint in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b66-15\">. Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the Final Judgment cannot bind the DefendantsAppellees, we need not reach the district court\u2019s alternative holding that the Defendants-Appellees had a right of access over the greenbelt that predated the 1983 Final Judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
