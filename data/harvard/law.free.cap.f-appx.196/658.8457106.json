PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">Plaintiff Norma Sileox appeals from a district court order granting summary judgment in favor of her former employer, Via Christi Oklahoma Regional Medical Center (Via Christi), on her claim of illegal discharge in violation of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA or Act), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2901-2654. Because we agree with the district court that Sileox failed to establish that she suffered from a \u201cserious health condition\u201d as that term is defined in the Act, we exercise our jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-8\">Background<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b683-9\">Sileox began working for Via Christi as a certified nurse\u2019s aid in August 1998. On March 14, 2002, she injured her back while at work and left early. On her time card for that day, she reported leaving at 19:50, although she actually left some time in the morning. On March 18, 2002, Sileox visited Dr. Rebecca Bristow, a chiropractor, for the injury to her back. Dr. Bristow did not take any x-rays of Silcox\u2019s spine. She diagnosed Sileox with a spinal subluxation, however, and filled out a disability slip indicating that Sileox was temporarily totally disabled and restricted from working. On March 18 and again on March 20, Dr. Bristow performed manipulative therapy on Silcox\u2019s spine to correct the subluxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-12\">Dr. Bristow released Sileox to return to work on March 27, 2002. On that day, Silcox\u2019s supervisor confronted her about the discrepancy on her time card concerning her clock-out time for March 14, 2002. Sileox explained that she wrote down 19:50 by accident. Nonetheless, she was fired. Via Christi maintains that it fired Sileox for reporting a fraudulent clock-out time. Sileox argues, however, that Via Christi actually fired her for exercising her right to take leave under the FMLA and that the fraud excuse was pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-13\">On February 28, 2005, Sileox sued Via Christi in district court alleging that Via Christi interfered with her right to take medical leave and discriminated against her in violation of the FMLA. She also alleged various state law claims. Via Christi filed a motion for summary judgment seeking dismissal of the FMLA claim based on Silcox\u2019s failure to establish that she suffered from a \u201cserious health condition\u201d within the meaning of the FMLA The court agreed and on November 21, 2005, issued an order granting Via Christi\u2019s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the FMLA claim and declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Silcox\u2019s state law claims. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">\u201cOn appeal, we review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number><em>novo, </em>applying the same legal standards as employed by the district court.... Summary judgment is appropriate if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>B-S Steel of Kan., Inc. v. Tex. Indus., Inc., </em>439 F.3d 653, 660 (10th Cir.2006) (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The district court dismissed Silcox\u2019s federal claim because it found that she failed to establish the applicability of the FMLA. The com\u00ed explained that \u201ca \u2018serious health condition\u2019 entitling an employee to FMLA leave involves either inpatient care, or \u2018continuing treatment by a health care provider\u2019.\u201d Aplt.App. at 242 (citing 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.114). As it further explained, a \u201chealth care provider\u201d is defined in the FMLA as \u201c(A) a doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in which the doctor practices; or (B) any other person determined by the Secretary [of Labor] to be capable of providing health care services.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2611(6). The court noted that under the Secretary\u2019s regulations, chiropractors are among those \u201ccapable of providing health care services\u201d only to the extent that the chiropractor\u2019s treatment \u201cconsist[s] of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation <em>as demonstrated by X-ray to exist.\u201d </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.118(b)(1) (emphasis added). Since it was undisputed that Dr. Bristow did not take x-rays of Silcox\u2019s spine, the court concluded Dr. Bristow was not a health care provider within the meaning of the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">Silcox raises two challenges to the district court\u2019s decision. She argues that the court erred by failing to consider Dr. Bristow\u2019s qualifications under \u00a7 825.118(b)(4)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and that the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of health care provider with respect to chiropractors is arbitrary and capricious. We conclude that neither of these challenges has merit, and that the district court properly dismissed Silcox\u2019s claims for her failure to establish the applicability of the FMLA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The judgment of the district court is, therefore, AFFIRMED for the same reasons stated in its well-reasoned decision of November 21, 2005.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-10\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b683-17\">. In reviewing the district court's order, we view the record in the light most favorable to Sileox, the party opposing summary judgment. <em>B-S Steel of Kan., Inc. v. Tex. Indus., Inc., </em>439 F.3d 653, 660 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b684-5\">. Under that section, ''[o]thers 'capable of providing health care services\u2019 include ... [a]ny health care provider from whom an employer or the employer\u2019s group health plan\u2019s benefits manager will accept certification of the existence of a serious health condition to substantiate a claim for benefits.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.118(b)(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b684-6\">. Silcox\u2019s attempt to invoke 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 825.118(b)(4) is specious given the Secretary's clear intent to limit coverage to chiropractic treatment that is accompanied by diagnostic x-rays. We also note that Silcox\u2019s attack on the validity of the Secretary\u2019s regulations is devoid of any authority and does not even attempt to explain why this court should not defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of the FMLA, a law she is entrusted to administer. <em>See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
