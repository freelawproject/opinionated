The LAU abused its discretion when it refused to consider Huerta-Anguiano\u2019s witness affidavits, based in part on its erroneous observation that the affiants did not state their \u201cwillingness to personally verify the information provided.\u201d <em>See id. </em>The LAU further abused its discretion by basing its decision, in part, on a memo summarizing its interview with a farm owner without providing Huerta-Anguiano an opportunity to rebut the new evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 103.2(b)(16)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-25\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Huerta-Anguiano\u2019s contentions re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>garding her cancellation of removal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and vacate the order of removal.
