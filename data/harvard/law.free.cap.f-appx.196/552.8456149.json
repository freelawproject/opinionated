R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b577-10\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">Eduardo Aleman Cuellar and his wife, Alicia Aurelia Arce Avila, natives and citizens of Mexico, petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order denying their motion to reopen removal proceedings, and its subsequent order denying their motion to reconsider. To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-12\">The evidence Petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that Petitioners failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600 (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether [the] new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations and brackets omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-17\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying their motion to reopen and remand. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-18\">Petitioners contend the BIA violated their due process rights by disregarding their evidence of the female petitioner\u2019s need for further medical evaluation. Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 contention, the proceedings were not \u201cso fundamentally unfair that [they were] prevented from reasonably presenting [their] case.\u201d <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Moreover, Petitioners failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See id. </em>(requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-19\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-20\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b577-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
