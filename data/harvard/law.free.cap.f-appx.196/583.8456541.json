The burden of production having shifted to 3 Day,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the company offered legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for discharging her: the company was consolidating two stores, needed only one manager, and chose the one with the better attitude. \u201cIf the defendant articulates such a reason, the plaintiff bears the ultimate burden of demonstrating that the reason was merely a pretext for a discriminatory motive.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To avoid summary judgment, the plaintiff must produce \u201c \u2018specific, substantial evidence of pretext.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b607-25\">Searcy had no evidence for the pretext beyond her <em>prima facie </em>case and speculation. The employer presented uncontradicted evidence that Searcy had expressed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>a negative attitude about company practices and that the manager with whom she was competing for the single spot was seen by the company as having a positive attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Searcy also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motion for leave to amend her complaint. Searcy was subject to a Rule 16 scheduling order and filed her motion outside of the time provided by the order. Plaintiffs wishing to amend their complaints outside of the time line established in a Rule 16 order must \u201cshow good cause for failing to amend their complaints earlier.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Searcy offered no \u201cgood cause.\u201d She argues that her request did not prejudice 3 Day, but lack of prejudice does not constitute good cause.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any event, the district court found prejudice to 3 Day, and we cannot say that its ruling was an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b607-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
