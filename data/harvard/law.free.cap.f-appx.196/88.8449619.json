We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Johnson\u2019s claim arises out of a series of power struggles within the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, AFL-CIO. Johnson was a member of IBT Local 115. He was employed as Organizing Representative in January 1999, when he brought information about the alleged racketeering activities of several other members to the attention of John Moms, the principal officer of Local 115. Johnson alleged that various union members violated statutes related to trafficking in contraband cigarettes, operating and supervising illegal gambling activities, fraudulently charging Local 115 for \u201crehabilitation services,\u201d and trafficking in controlled substances. Beginning around January 1999 and upon Morris\u2019s direction, Johnson investigated these allegations, over a seven-month period.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">On November 15, 1999, James P. Hoffa, General President of the IBT, imposed an emergency trusteeship over Local 115 and removed Morris as principal officer. Johnson was terminated from his employment both as organizing representative with the union and as an employee at Electro-Nite, a union shop, after the trusteeship was imposed and after appellees reviewed the files connected to Johnson\u2019s investigation. Johnson alleges that shortly thereafter, various appellees intimated, physically assaulted, and extorted him.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Johnson brought this action seeking damages under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson contends the Teamsters engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity and a conspiracy directed at removing Morris as the principal officer of Local 115 in order to impose a trusteeship. He argues the Teamsters\u2019 alleged racketeering activity and Morris\u2019 removal harmed Johnson\u2019s property interests in his employment, his reputation, and his membership in a racketeer-free union. The District Court granted appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, holding Johnson\u2019s did not have standing under \u00a7 1964(c), both because Johnson\u2019s job loss did not occur \u201cby reason of\u2019 the Teamsters\u2019 racketeering activity, and because his property interests in his reputation and membership in a racketeer-free union are not interests RICO protects. Johnson appeals, claiming the District Court erred in its standing determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-17\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>miss for failure to state a claim. <em>Lum v. Bank of Am., </em>361 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir.2004). On an appeal from a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal, we treat all of the allegations in the plaintiffs complaint as true. <em>Anderson v. Ayling, </em>396 F.3d 265, 267 (3d Cir.2005). Johnson\u2019s claim may only be dismissed \u201cif it is clear that no relief could be granted under any set of facts that could be proved consistent with the allegations.\u201d <em>Lum, </em>361 F.3d at 223. But we \u201cneed not accept as true unsupported conclusions and unwarranted inferences.\u201d <em>Doug Grant, Inc. v. Greate Bay Casino Corp., </em>232 F.3d 173, 184 (3d Cir.2000). We also exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s determination that Johnson lacked standing to pursue his claims under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c). <em>See Maio v. Aetna, Inc., </em>221 F.3d 472, 482 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Johnson challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that his job loss did not occur \u201cby reason of\u2019 the Teamster\u2019s racketeering activity. To maintain a civil RICO action, Johnson must show proximate causation between appellees\u2019 RICO violations and his injuries. <em>See Holmes v. Sec. Investor Prot. Corp., </em>503 U.S. 258, 268, 112 S.Ct. 1311, 117 L.Ed.2d 532 (1992). But \u201cinjury caused by an overt act that is not an act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO ... is not sufficient to give rise to a cause of action under \u00a7 1964(c) for a violation of \u00a7 1962(d).\u201d <em>Beck v. Prupis, </em>529 U.S. 494, 505, 120 S.Ct. 1608, 146 L.Ed.2d 561 (2000). For an overt act to qualify as \u201can act of racketeering or otherwise wrongful under RICO,\u201d that act must be \u201cindependently wrongful\u201d under some \u201csubstantive provision\u201d of the RICO statute. <em>Id. </em>at 505-06, 120 S.Ct. 1608. An allegation that a plaintiff is injured \u201cmerely by a non-racketeering act in furtherance of a broader RICO conspiracy\u201d is insufficient to confer standing under the statute. <em>Anderson, </em>396 F.3d at 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Johnson\u2019s allegations do not directly link a substantive RICO violation to his loss of employment. Johnson contends appellees terminated his employment after reviewing files related to his investigation of corruption and racketeering activity. Properly understood, Johnson does not claim the act of termination was itself \u201cindependently wrongful\u201d under any of RICO\u2019s substantive provisions \u2014 rather, he claims the act of termination was related to an overall RICO conspiracy and was intended to further that conspiracy. But this is precisely the kind of circumstance both <em>Beck </em>and <em>Anderson </em>held would not confer RICO standing on a plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In <em>Beck, </em>the plaintiff, an employee at an insurance company, discovered the company\u2019s directors were engaged in racketeering activities. After Beck contacted regulators about the company\u2019s financial statements, the directors falsified a report and used that report to terminate him from his employment. The Supreme Court held that, even though Beck\u2019s job loss was in furtherance of a RICO conspiracy, the racketeering activity did not proximately cause his injury because it was not independently wrongful under any substantive provision of the statute. <em>Beck, </em>529 U.S. at 506, 120 S.Ct. 1608.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\"><em>Beck </em>is precisely on point. Like the plaintiff\u2019s injury in Beck, Johnson\u2019s only injury here \u2014 his employment termination \u2014 was not proximately caused by the appellees\u2019 racketeering activity because it was not independently wrongful under any substantive provision of the RICO statute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>Even though Johnson allegedly lost his job in furtherance of appellees\u2019 RICO conspiracy, RICO standing requires more. None of Johnson\u2019s allegations meet the bar set by <em>Beck.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">In <em>Anderson, </em>we noted the \u201cpossib[ility] that a predicate act of racketeering that <em>directly </em>caused a plaintiff to lose his job could create civil RICO standing.\u201d 396 F.3d at 269-70. But no link between Johnson\u2019s job loss and appellees\u2019 racketeering activities (trafficking in contraband cigarette and controlled substances, operating an illegal gambling business, or fraudulently charging Local 115 for rehabilitation services) is any more direct than was the link between Beck\u2019s job loss and his directors\u2019 racketeering activities. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal was not error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Johnson also alleges other acts \u2014 namely, physical assault, extortion, and mail fraud \u2014 apart from the act of termination, which he argues are all related to his job loss. But he could not have been terminated, as he claims, \u201cby reason of\u2019 these \u201cpredicate\u201d acts: each act occurred after his employment termination. <em>See Anderson, </em>396 F.3d at 271 n. 4 (\u201c[Appellants] also accuse the defendants of other acts of racketeering.... These acts cannot, however, have proximately caused their job loss, for the simple reason that they occurred a week <em>after </em>plaintiffs were terminated from Kurz-Hastings.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-11\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-12\">We will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">. The statute provides, in part, that \"[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court....\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-18\">. Johnson does not challenge the District Court\u2019s holding that his property interests in his reputation and membership in a racketeer-free union are not interests RICO protects. Accordingly, Johnson has waived these issues. <em>See Travitz v. N.E. Dep\u2019t ILGWU Health &amp; Welfare Fund, 13 </em>F.3d 704, <em>711 </em>(3d Cir.1994). Johnson continues to maintain a property interest in his employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-6\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1961(1) catalogues an exhaustive list of \"racketeering activities\u201d RICO en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>compasses. None includes or mentions employment termination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b115-8\">. Johnson also claims the District Court erred by finding he \"was fired because the National Labor Relations Board had an outstanding contempt order against him, and for his violent behavior,\u201d and then by using that finding in its holding. (App.8.) The relevant paragraph in the complaint is part of a reference to Hoffa\u2019s November 15, 1999 notice that he was placing Local 115 in a trusteeship. In his complaint, Johnson claims the allegation (among others) is false. Although Johnson does not explicitly offer any alternative reason for his termination, a fair reading of the complaint as a whole suggests appellees terminated his employment in furtherance of a RICO conspiracy. Although the District Court drew an improper conclusion from the complaint, we nevertheless agree that <em>Beck </em>independently warrants dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"AXo\">. Although they did not argue so below, appellees now argue the claim preclusion bars Johnson\u2019s claims. Even assuming appellees have not waived this argument by failing to raise it in the first instance, our affirmance of the District Court\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal obviates any need to address this issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
