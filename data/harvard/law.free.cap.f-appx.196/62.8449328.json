He then sought modification of his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582 and challenged his conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, failing each time (however, a subsequent \u00a7 3582 motion was granted in part). He later filed a mandamus petition and sought authorization from this Court to file another section 2255 motion, again without success.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-12\">Undeterred, in 2005 Leath filed a habeas corpus petition in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, arguing in essence that his sentence is unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The District Court dismissed the petition because such claims must be brought via \u00a7 2255 in the court where he was convicted unless \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective;\u201d and \u00a7 2255 is not rendered \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d by the petitioner\u2019s mere inability to meet the criteria for filing a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-14\">We agree with the District Court. Leath\u2019s claims clearly fall outside the narrow range of situations in which \u00a7 2255 is \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d for the reasons set forth in <em>In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245 (3d Cir.1997), and <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117 (3d Cir.2002). Accordingly, the appeal is without legal merit and we will dismiss it pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
