Bautista-Enamorado argues that he should have received a minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 and that the district court\u2019s sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">We have held that a district court\u2019s determination of a defendant\u2019s role in an offense is a finding of fact, to be reviewed for clear error. <em>United States v. De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 934 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en banc). </em>The guidelines allow a court to decrease a defendant\u2019s offense level by two points if the court finds the defendant was a minor participant. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). A defendant is a minor participant if he \u201cis less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">The party seeking the downward departure bears the burden of establishing that the defendant\u2019s role was minor by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 939. In determining whether a mitigating role reduction is warranted, a district court examines: (1) the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which he was held accountable, and (2) the defendant\u2019s role in comparison to the other participants. <em>Id. </em>at 940. The first prong assesses the defendant\u2019s actual role in comparison to the relevant conduct. <em>Id. </em>The district court may consider any and all facts probative of the defendant\u2019s role. <em>Id. </em>at 943. Only if the defendant can establish that he played a minor role in the conduct for which he has already been held accountable, not just a minor role in any larger conspiracy, should the district court grant a downward adjustment for a minor role in the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 944. The second prong compares the defendant\u2019s role to the roles played by his co-participants. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Notably, \u201ca defendant is not automatically entitled to a minor-role adjustment merely because [he] was somewhat less culpable than the other diseernable participants,\u201d especially as it is possible that no co-conspirator is a minor participant <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Bautista-Enamorado pled guilty to possession and conspiracy to possess more than 5 kilograms of cocaine, and admitted to the more than 2,400 kilograms of cocaine transported in the offense. Bautista-Enamorado was held accountable at sentencing for these facts. Based on the close convergence between Bautista-Enamorado\u2019s conduct and the conduct for which he was held accountable, he has failed to meet the burden of the first prong. The second prong compares the defendant\u2019s role to the roles played by his co-participants. <em>De Var\u00f3n, </em>175 F.3d at 944. The district court further found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>crew members are folly involved in the smuggling operation, and are integral to ensuring that the product reaches a marketplace. Because Bautista-Enamorado was a crew member, like most of the other co-defendants, he was not less culpable than his co-participants. The district court did not clearly err in determining that Bautista-Enamorado did not qualify for a minor-role reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Bautista-Enamorado argues that the district court erred because it did not adequately consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">Sentences imposed under an advisory guidelines system are reviewed for \u201cunreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 259-60, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Following the <em>Booker </em>decision, we have stated that the district court must first correctly calculate the defendant\u2019s guideline range. Then, using the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, the court can impose a more severe or more lenient sentence as long as it is reasonable. <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1179 (11th Cir.2005). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include the available sentences, the applicable guideline range and policy statements, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the need for the sentence to (1) reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, (2) afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (3) protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, and (4) provide the defendant with needed correctional treatment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201c[Njothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">\u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>A sentence within the advisory guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, but is expected to be reasonable. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cwhen the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d). We have held that a district court\u2019s statement that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone is sufficient in <em>post-Booker </em>sentences to indicate it considered the factors, and have concluded that, in such cases, the defendant\u2019s sentence was reasonable because the district court accurately calculated the guideline range and the defendant\u2019s sentence at the low end of the range reflected the court\u2019s consideration of his evidence in mitigation. <em>See Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">We note that the district court considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, accurately calculated the guideline range, and sentenced Bautista-Enamorado at the low end of the guidelines range. The district court explicitly mentioned the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, but also stated that it believed the large quantity of cocaine on the boat justified a guidelines sentence. Further, Bautista-Enamorado\u2019s sentence was at the low end of the guidelines range, a range that takes into account his offense conduct, his personal characteristics and history, just punishment, and adequate deterrence. Therefore, we conclude that Bautista-Enamorado\u2019s sentence was reasonable. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788; <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1330.
