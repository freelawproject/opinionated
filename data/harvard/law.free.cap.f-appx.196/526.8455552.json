We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">A motion to reconsider must be filed no later than 30 days after the final administrative decision. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(2). Petitioners filed their motion to reconsider on July 26, 2004, more than two months after the BIA issued its final decision on May 6, 2004. The BIA denied the motion on the sole basis that it was untimely, and Petitioners fail to challenge that determination. They have therefore waived the only issue before the court. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Petitioners\u2019 contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s underlying order affirming the IJ\u2019s decision because Petitioners failed to timely petition this court for review of that decision. <em>See id. </em>at 1258.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b551-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
