Although he renews the allegations of his complaint, Watts does not challenge the district court\u2019s conclusion that his claims were improperly brought in a \u00a7 1983 action, were barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), or faded for lack of state action. By failing to brief any argument challenging the district court\u2019s reasons for dismissal, Watts has abandoned the only grounds for appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). The appeal is wholly without arguable merit, is frivolous, and is therefore dismissed. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-15\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Watts\u2019 complaint counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of the instant appeal. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Watts has accumulated two strikes in <em>Watts v. Bailey, </em>196 Fed.Appx. 273, 2006 WL 2474272 (5th Cir.2006). Because Watts has now accumulated more than three strikes, he is barred from proceeding in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-16\">DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b313-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
