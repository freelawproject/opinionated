We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">The evidence petitioners presented with their motion to reopen concerned the same basic hardship grounds as their application for cancellation of removal. <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that they failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600 (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether the new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Petitioners\u2019 contention that the BIA deprived them of due process in reviewing the evidence they submitted with their motion to reopen is not colorable. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[traditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute color-able constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">Petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b550-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
