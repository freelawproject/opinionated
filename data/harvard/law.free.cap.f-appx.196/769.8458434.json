Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously affirmed Appellant\u2019s conviction and 200-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 841(b)(1)(C). See <em>United States v. Edmonds, </em>129 Fed.Appx. 599 (11th Cir.2005) (Table) <em>(\u201cEdmonds I\u201d). </em>Among other things, in <em>Edmonds I, </em>Appellant argued that his sentence violated <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We rejected that claim because, at the time of our decision, the Supreme Court had not decided <em>Booker, </em>in which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>extended its <em>Blakely </em>holding to the Sentencing Guidelines. The Supreme Court vacated our prior decision and remanded the case to us for further consideration in light of <em>Booker. </em>We asked for, and have received, supplemental briefs from the parties on the effect of <em>Booker </em>on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">On reconsideration, we first reiterate that we review Edmonds\u2019s <em>Booker-based </em>claim for only plain error because at sentencing, he made \u201cno reference to the Sixth Amendment, or a right to have the issue of drug quantity decided by a jury rather than the judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 462, 163 L.Ed.2d 351 (2005). There was no citation to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And \u201cthere was no challenge to the role of the judge as fact-finder with respect to sentencing facts,\u201d nor did Edmonds argue that the sentence was contrary to the Sixth Amendment. <em>Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 1246. Moreover, the fact that Edmonds\u2019s sentencing objections referenced the jury verdict, and that Edmonds encouraged the district court to \u201cfollow the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d and \u201cto consider the jury verdict,\u201d does not make those objections constitutional in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 1245-46 (holding that counsel\u2019s statement that \u201c \u2018[t]he jury verdict ... must be respected\u2019 \u201d was insufficient to preserve <em>Booker-type </em>claim because the objection concerned sufficiency of the evidence and not the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights). Accordingly, we review Edmonds\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 1246-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-9\">Under plain error review, appellate courts have a limited power to correct errors that were not timely raised in the district court. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). When reviewing for plain error, we may reverse a sentence based on <em>Booker </em>only if there is: (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). The first two prongs of this test are satisfied where a district court has imposed a sentence under a mandatory Guidelines system based on facts that were neither found by a jury nor admitted by the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 1298-99. The third prong is met, however, only when the defendant shows a reasonable probability that his sentence would have been different absent the error. <em>Id. </em>at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-10\">Following Booker, a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights are violated when his sentence is enhanced under a mandatory guidelines system based upon any fact (other than a prior conviction) that is nei<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ther admitted <em>nor </em>proven to a <em>jury </em>beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756. Moreover, we have held that a defendant\u2019s non-constitutional, or statutory, <em>Booker </em>rights are violated when he is sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system that <em>Booker </em>has rendered advisory, even in the absence of <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">Here, the parties agree that both types of <em>Booker </em>error occurred. That is, the district court used extra-verdict enhancements to reach a Guidelines result <em>(Booker </em>constitutional error), and the court applied the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion <em>(Booker </em>statutory error). Thus, the question of whether Edmonds is entitled to a new sentence under <em>Booker </em>turns on whether he has carried his burden of showing prejudice under the third-prong of the plain error test. We conclude that he has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The third prong of the plain-error test \u201calmost always requires that the error must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1299 (quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201cThe standard for showing that is the familiar reasonable probability of a different result formulation, which means a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks and citations omitted). In his supplemental brief, Edmonds points to nothing in the record to suggest he would receive a different sentence if we were to remand to the district court for resentencing under an advisory scheme. And our own review of the record, with particular attention to the sentencing transcript and PSI, likewise reveals no basis for a conclusion that under an advisory Guidelines scheme, there is a reasonable probability that Edmonds would have received a more lenient sentence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b795-11\">Accordingly, we reinstate our prior opinion, with the exception of our discussion concerning <em>Blakely\u2019s </em>application to the Guidelines, for which we substitute the foregoing, and affirm, once again, Edmonds\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART AND SUBSTITUTED IN PART; AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b793-29\">. The Supreme Court\u2019s remand has no effect on our disposition of Edmonds\u2019s other claims and we REINSTATE our prior opinion as to those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-7\">. In fact, counsel\u2019s only reference to <em>Apprendi </em>was made when he argued that the case was <em>not </em>implicated here: \"Now, Judge, this is not one of those Apprendi cases where the statutory maximum makes a whole lot of difference in the case.\u201d We also note that at various points during the sentencing hearing, counsel stated that the <em>court </em>was required to make factual findings by a preponderance of the evidence, but should consider the juiy's verdict in doing so, an argument that we find runs contrary to the <em>Blakely </em>(now <em>Booker) </em>claim he now says he made below. <em>See, e.g. </em>R4-4 (\"The Court has to find by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of drugs to be used as relevant conduct.\u201d); <em>cf. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d at 1245 (discussing ways in which defendant may preserve a Roo/cer-based challenge, including: by arguing that a fact relevant to a sentencing enhancement must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and by objecting that a fact relevant to a sentencing enhancement \u201cshould go to the juty\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">. In fact, the court expressly rejected the factors Edmonds argued in support of a lower sentence, including his age and mental and physical impairments. In imposing sentence, the district court noted that it was \"very sorry about Mr. Edmonds\u2019s health____ I wish that he were a whole mam, and that he had not had a heart attack, and that he didn\u2019t have the other things that have been described, but I don\u2019t control that. And I don\u2019t think anything I\u2019ve read or heard in this case dictates that the sentence ought to be changed because of that.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
