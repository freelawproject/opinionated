California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but presenting one issue for our review. Although notified of her right to file a pro se supplemental brief, Coggins has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-23\">Counsel suggests that the district court did not comply with Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 in accepting Coggins\u2019 guilty plea. Because Coggins did not seek to withdraw her guilty plea in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir.2002). We have reviewed the record and conclude that the district court\u2019s plea hearing was fully compliant with Rule 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Coggins\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform Coggins, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Coggins requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>state that a copy thereof was served on Coggins.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
