On appeal, Motes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. He also raises the following sentencing claims: (1) that the district court\u2019s consideration of acquitted conduct in calculating the Guidelines range and imposing sentence violated his due process rights and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and (2) that his sentence was unreasonable in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-14\">The relevant facts are straightforward. On May 27, 2004, Motes and co-defendants Marvin King and Thomas Frazier were charged with one count of conspiring to provide false statements on federal firearms records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 371 and 924(a)(1)(A) (Count One), and eight counts of aiding and abetting each other or other persons, both known and unknown to the grand jury, to make false statements on federal firearms records, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) and 2 (Counts 2 through 9). More specifically, the indictment alleged that from January 1, 2001 to September 1, 2002, the defendants conspired to cause false statements to be made on ATF Form 4473 and, on eight separate occasions, aided and abetted in the making of false representations of the name of the purchaser of 19 firearms on this form. Frazier pled guilty to Count One and Motes and King proceeded to a joint jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-15\">At trial, the government presented the testimony of Frazier and various other cooperating individuals who were involved in the transactions at issue, as well as the testimony of several law enforcement officials who conducted the subsequent investigation. Because Motes was found guilty of Counts Eight and Nine, we restrict our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>discussion mainly to the government\u2019s evidence as to the August 22, 2002 and August 27, 2002 transactions, for purposes of considering Motes\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">During the relevant time period of the charged conspiracy, Motes and Frazier, through the use of two \u201cstraw purchasers\u201d named Debra Ann Molden and Samual James Almond, purchased 19 firearms, which they then sold to others. Most of these purchases took place at a pawnshop in Moultrie, Georgia named Kings Jewelry Pawnbroker Shoes, Inc. (\u201cKings Jewelry\u201d), which was owned by King and was registered as a federally licensed firearms dealer. Both Molden and Almond testified for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">On August 22, 2002, Motes drove Almond to Kings Jewelry and provided him with money to purchase one firearm. As of that date, Almond previously had \u201cstraw purchased\u201d four other firearms at Bangs Jewelry, on behalf of Frazier and Motes, each time using money provided by Frazier or Motes and each time completing an ATF Form 4472 that said he (Almond) was the actual purchaser of the firearms. During the August 22nd purchase, Almond again falsely completed an ATF Form 4472, indicating that he was the actual purchaser of a Bryco Jennings, model nine, 9 mm. pistol, and paid for the gun with money supplied by Motes. In a similar transaction five days later, Almond purchased two more Bryco Jennings, model nine, 9 mm. pistols, again with money given to him by Motes. Almond completed two more ATF forms stating that he was the actual purchaser. After both of these purchases, Almond delivered the firearms to the convenience store that Motes owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">After the government rested, Motes moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that Almond had testified that nobody had asked him to lie on the ATF Forms 4472, and thus that the jury could not find that Motes had <em>caused </em>the false statements to be made. The district court denied this motion. In support of his own defense, Motes testified that he had not asked anyone to purchase guns on his behalf, or to lie on an ATF form. Motes then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, which the district court again denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">Although the jury acquitted Motes on the conspiracy counts and the counts alleging \u201cstraw purchases\u201d that occurred prior to the August 22nd and August 27th transactions described by Almond, the jury found Motes guilty on Counts Eight and Nine. Motes then proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">The presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d) assigned Motes a base offense level of 12 and recommended a four-level enhancement because Motes\u2019s conduct involved between 8 and 24 firearms, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(1), and a two-level enhancement based on Motes\u2019s status as an organizer and/or leader of the crime, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(c). With an adjusted offense level at 18 and a criminal history category II, Motes faced a Guidelines sentencing range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. The maximum term of imprisonment for each count was 5 years\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Motes objected to the PSI and argued, in pertinent part, that: (1) he should not be held accountable for all 19 of the firearms alleged in the indictment, since his convictions involved the purchase of only three firearms; and (2) his sentence should not be enhanced because he was a leader or organizer of the <em>crime. At </em>the sentencing hearing, Motes again objected to the PSI, arguing that the offense-level enhancements violated <em>Booker </em>because the jury had found him guilty as to charges involving only three guns and had acquit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>ted on the conspiracy count, thus rejecting that he was a leader of the scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Over Motes\u2019s objections, the district court sentenced Motes to a low-end sentence of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment on each count, to run concurrently. In imposing sentence, the district court noted that the Guidelines were \u201cadvisory\u201d and found that the Guidelines range was justified because Motes \u201cwas responsible for all the guns\u201d and he had \u201ca leadership role.\u201d The court further noted that the sentence was \u201cappropriate\u201d in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">First, Motes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. A properly preserved sufficiency of the evidence claim is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. McDowell, </em>250 F.3d 1354, 1361 (11th Cir.2001). In determining whether the evidence is sufficient to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and decide whether a reasonable juror could have reached a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1324 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence or be wholly inconsistent with every conclusion except that of guilt.\u201d <em>United States v. Harris, </em>20 F.3d 445, 453 (11th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">To establish a violation of \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A), the government was required to prove that Motes knowingly made a false statement with respect to information that the law requires a federally licensed firearms dealer to keep. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A). We have concluded that a principal who uses straw purchasers to purchase firearms on his behalf violates \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A). <em>United States v. Nelson, </em>221 F.3d 1206, 1210 (11th Cir.2000). Section 2 prohibits the aiding and abetting of this offense and punishes an aider and abetter as a \u201cprincipal.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">Almond testified that he falsely represented himself as the actual buyer of the firearms on August 22nd and 27th, the dates reflected in Counts Eight and Nine, respectively, and that he falsely filled out three ATF forms on those dates. Moreover, he said that he actually purchased the firearms for Motes, who provided him with the money to purchase the guns, took possession of the guns after the purchases, and on one occasion accompanied Almond into Kings Jewelry. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the jury\u2019s verdict, as we are required to do, a reasonable juror could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Motes violated \u00a7 924(a)(1)(A) by using a straw purchaser to purchase the firearms, even if Motes never <em>expressly </em>asked the straw purchaser to lie on the ATF forms. <em>Nelson, </em>221 F.3d at 1210. Motes does not cite, and our own review of controlling precedent does not reveal, any case in which we have held that, in order to establish principal liability, the government must show that the aider or abettor expressly directed the straw purchaser to provide the false statements. Accordingly, we affirm his convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>Turning <em>to </em>Motes\u2019s arguments concerning the calculation of his offense level and resulting Guidelines range, \u201cunder an advisory Guidelines scheme, courts can continue to consider relevant acquitted conduct so long as the facts underlying the conduct are proved by a preponderance of the evidence and the sentence imposed does not exceed the maximum sentence authorized by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Faust, 456 F.3d </em>1342, 1348 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe burden of showing something by a preponderance of the evidence ... simply requires the trier of fact to believe that the existence of a fact is more probable than its nonexistence.\u201d <em>United States v. Trainor, </em>376 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Under our long-standing precedent, \u201c[r]elevant conduct of which a defendant was acquitted nonetheless may be taken into account in sentencing for the offenses of conviction,\u201d as long as the government proves the acquitted conduct relied upon by a preponderance of the evidence, and the judge does not impose a sentence that exceeds what is authorized by the jury-verdict. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1304-05 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 432, 163 L.Ed.2d 329 (2005). In fact, after <em>Booker, </em>it remains clear that a sentencing judge may continue to consider relevant acquitted conduct as part of an advisory Guidelines\u2019 scheme, \u201c[f]or when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1305 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Through the testimony of numerous cooperating witnesses who participated in the gun trafficking scheme, the government satisfied its burden to show by a preponderance of the evidence the facts underlying the enhancements for both the possession of between eight and twenty-four firearms, not just the three firearms discussed in the two counts of the indictment for which Motes was convicted, and Motes\u2019s leadership role in the scheme. Moreover, Motes\u2019s ultimate sentence of 30 months\u2019 imprisonment was well below the 5-year maximum sentence authorized by the jury verdict of conviction on each of the two counts of providing a false statement on a federal firearms record. Finally, the district court expressly stated that it understood the Guidelines range to be advisory. On this record, we can discern no <em>Booker </em>error in the district court\u2019s calculation of the Guidelines range, including the court\u2019s imposition of enhancements for the number of firearms involved and Motes\u2019s leadership role in the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-9\">Finally, we reject Motes\u2019s argument that his low-end sentence was unreasonable. We review the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, and we \u201cconsider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, 451 F.3d </em>744, 750 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted). \u201cReview for reasonableness is deferential.\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). We \u201crecognize that there is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose, and when the district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of proving that the sentence was unreasonable in light of both the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-10\">Pursuant to the district court\u2019s correctly calculated offense level and criminal history category, the Guidelines recommended a range of 30 to 37 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court heard Motes\u2019s mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>argument at the sentencing hearing, during which Motes urged the court to impose a sentence below the Guidelines range because the criminal history category \u201coverstate[d] the likelihood that Mr. Motes is a danger, has been a danger, or will be a danger to anyone in the future.\u201d The court also heard from Judge William McIntosh, the mayor of Moultrie, who testified as a character witness and described his longstanding relationship with the Motes family, opined that Motes\u2019s prior convictions were \u201ctotally out of character,\u201d and stated that Motes had a good reputation in Moultrie. Finally, Motes presented the testimony of his uncle who stated that Motes was a provider for his family and an outstanding member of the community.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">In addition to hearing Motes\u2019s mitigating argument and evidence, most of which concerned \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the district also had before it the parties\u2019 legal arguments and the PSI\u2019s calculations, which outlined \u201cthe kinds of sentences available,\u201d as discussed in \u00a7 3553(a)(3). In imposing sentence, the district court specifically noted that the Guidelines\u2019 range was advisory and that the 30-month sentence was \u201cappropriate\u201d in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the totality of the circumstances. From our own review of the record, it is clear Motes\u2019s low-end sentence, which was appreciably below the 60-month statutory maximum he faced, was eminently reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b904-7\">. We also are unconvinced by Motes\u2019s argument that reversible error occurred when the jury reached inconsistent verdicts by acquitting him of the conspiracy charge but finding him guilty of two substantive counts. It is well-settled that so long as a guilty verdict is supported by sufficient evidence, as we have concluded the verdicts as to Counts Eight and Nine are, a conviction will be affirmed, even if the guilty verdict is inconsistent with the jury\u2019s verdict as to other counts. <em>Cf. United States v. Mitchell, </em>146 F.3d 1338, 1344-45 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
