To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of due process violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001). We deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-24\">We reject Lizardi-Barajas\u2019s contention that the IJ violated due process by refusing to let his mother testify because Lizardi-Barajas failed to demonstrate that additional testimony would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (citation omitted) (requiring prejudice to prevail on a due process challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Lizardi-Barajas\u2019s contention that the IJ did not consider all relevant hardship factors is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[tjraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">We lack jurisdiction to review Lizardi-Barajas\u2019s contentions that the IJ was biased, and improperly admitted a police report as evidence, because Lizardi-Barajas failed to raise these issues before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">To the extent Lizardi-Barajas challenges the Id\u2019s discretionary determination that he is not entitled to cancellation of removal, we lack jurisdiction to consider this contention. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b519-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
