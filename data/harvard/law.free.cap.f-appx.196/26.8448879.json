We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-20\">Where the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s findings of fact will be upheld if supported by substantial evidence. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-21\">The IJ found petitioner\u2019s asylum application to be untimely. We have no jurisdiction to review such a finding. <em>Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Just., </em>434 F.3d 144, 154 (2d Cir.2006). Haryanto argues that IJ erred in denying application for asylum, claiming that he \u201cdeserv[es] a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d But this Court lacks jurisdic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>tion to review discretionary decisions of the IJ. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">Petitioner has not challenged the denial of withholding of removal or relief under CAT.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
