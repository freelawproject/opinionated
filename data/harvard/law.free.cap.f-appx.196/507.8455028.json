We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-17\">(1) Santiago first argues that the record contained insufficient evidence regarding his prior state felony conviction. Thus, he says, the district court could not determine that the felony was a crime of violence within the meaning of the relevant Sentencing Guideline. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We disagree. No doubt the district court had to perform a Taylor<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> analysis and, therefore, had to know just what state statute Santiago was convicted under. <em>See United States v. Potter, </em>895 F.2d 1231, 1238 (9th Cir.1990). However, that does not mean that the state record, itself, must cite the precise statutory provision in every case. <em>See United States v. Bonilla-Montenegro, </em>331 F.3d 1047, 1049-50 (9th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Corona-Sanchez, </em>291 F.3d 1201, 1205-07 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). Here, the record makes it perfectly clear that Santiago\u2019s State of Oregon conviction was for first degree voluntary manslaughter. <em>See </em>Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.118 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-18\">(2) Santiago then argues that first degree manslaughter in Oregon is not cate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>gorically<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a crime of violence under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Sentencing Guidelines, even though that Guideline expressly includes manslaughter. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 2L1.2 comment. (n.1(B)(iii)). That, he urges, is because it could have been based upon actions \u201ccommitted recklessly under circumstances manifesting extreme indifference to the value of human life.\u201d Or. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 163.118(1)(a); <em>see also </em>Or.Rev. Stat. \u00a7 161.085(9) (defining recklessly). Again, we disagree. The generic definition of manslaughter does include the concept of recklessness. <em>See United States v. Paul, </em>37 F.3d 496, 499 &amp; n. 1 (9th Cir.1994) (construing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1112(a)); Model Penal Code \u00a7 210.3(1)(a); 2 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Substantive Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 15.2(a) (2d ed. 2003).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Oregon law <em>is </em>within that generic definition. For example, compare Model Penal Code \u00a7 2.02(2)(c) (definition of recklessly) with Or.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 161.085(9) (same). In fact, Oregon adds that the actor\u2019s indifference to human life must be extreme. Therefore, for <em>Sentencing Guideline purposes </em>Santiago\u2019s prior offense was a crime of violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">(3) Finally, Santiago asserts, in effect, that Almendarez-Torres<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> has been so undermined, limited to its facts, or otherwise confined that the district court improperly determined that he had been convicted of the prior offense without first presenting that question to a jury. Suffice it to say that his arguments are foreclosed by our prior decisions to the contrary. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lopez-Torres, </em>443 F.3d 1182, 1185 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1079 &amp; n. 16 (9th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1911, 164 L.Ed.2d 667 (2006); <em>United States v. Yanez-Saucedo, </em>295 F.3d 991, 993 (9th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1127 (9th Cir.2001); <em>United States v.

Moreover, because the sentence was for 93 months imprisonment, it was well within the maximum sentence for a person whose prior conviction was for a \"felony (other than an aggravated felony).\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Aui\">. <em>Almendarez-Torres v.
