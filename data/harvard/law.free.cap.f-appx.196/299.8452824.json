The district court denied IFP, certifying that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for leave to proceed IFP, Martinez is challenging the district court\u2019s certification decision. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); FED. R. APP. P. 24(a)(5). However, Martinez has not demonstrated any nonfrivolous ground for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Martinez argues that his sentence is invalid in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) . As the district court determined, because Martinez\u2019s petition challenges errors that occurred at sentencing, it should not have been brought as a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Padilla v. United States, </em>416 F.3d 424, 426-27 (5th Cir.2005). Martinez\u2019s argument that he is entitled to proceed under \u00a7 2241 based on the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 because relief under that section is \u201cinadequate or ineffective\u201d is unavailing. <em>Id. </em>at 427 (holding that a claim under <em>Booker </em>does not fit within the savings clause of \u00a7 2255).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">The IFP motion is DENIED, and the appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b324-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
