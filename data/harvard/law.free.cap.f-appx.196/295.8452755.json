Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-21\">Applying the de novo standard of review, we affirm the dismissal of Jarrow\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against Judge Calvin Johnson and the district and assistant district attorneys on grounds of absolute judicial and prosecutorial immunity. <em>See Dennis v. Sparks, </em>449 U.S. 24, 27, 101 S.Ct. 183, 66 L.Ed.2d 185 (1980); <em>Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 427-28, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976). We also affirm the dismissal of Jarrow\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims against private attorney Michael Vitt; Jarrow\u2019s allegations of a conspiracy among the defendants to violate his civil rights are purely conclusional and therefore insufficient to establish \u00a7 1983 liability for a private actor. <em>See Brinkmann v. Johnston, </em>793 F.2d 111, 112 (5th Cir.1986). Given that none of the defendants are subject to suit, we pretermit discussion of the issues whether Jarrow had the requisite capacity to bring suit on behalf of his minor children and whether the \u00a7 1983 claims were otherwise barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-22\">Jarrow does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that his \u00a7 2254 claims were subject to dismissal without prejudice for failure to exhaust state court remedies. As such, he has waived review of the exhaustion issue. <em>See Hughes v. Johnson, </em>191 F.3d 607, 613 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-23\">Jarrow\u2019s appeal lacks arguable merit and therefore is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The district court\u2019s dismissal of the \u00a7 1983 claims as frivolous and our dismissal of this appeal count as two strikes for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Patton v. Jeffer</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number><em>son Corr. Ctr., </em>136 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Jarrow is cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b319-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
