The district court determined that he was a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and, applying the guidelines as advisory, sentenced him to 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the bottom of the guidelines range. On appeal Garrity concedes his status as a career offender, but nonetheless argues that the district court incorrectly calculated the drug quantity attributable to him and erroneously imposed a two-level enhancement for possessing a dangerous weapon pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(1). Garrity also challenges his sentence as unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-25\">In March 2005, Garrity brokered a sale of approximately 4.5 ounces of crack co<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>caine between a supplier and an informant of the Drug Enforcement Agency. Garrity met the informant in a parking lot and the two waited in Garrity\u2019s car, along with his girlfriend and infant son, for the supplier to arrive with the drugs. While they were waiting, Garrity reached under the front driver\u2019s seat, partially displayed the black handle of an object he referred to as a \u201c45,\u201d and told the informant that if anything happened he would take care of it. In reality the object under the seat was the black handle of a window squeegee, but the car was dark inside and the informant believed the object to be the handle of a gun. The supplier called with instructions on where to meet and Garrity took the informant to meet him. When they arrived, the supplier delivered 99.8 grams of crack to the informant. A week later, Garrity again attempted to broker a sale of 4.5 ounces of crack between the informant and the supplier, but this time Garrity was arrested when he arrived at the meeting place before any transaction could occur. Garrity subsequently pleaded guilty to distributing more than 50 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">In calculating Garrity\u2019s imprisonment range, the district court began with a base offense level of 34 based on the amount in the first sale and the attempted second sale, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(3), and added two offense levels under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) because Garrity made the informant believe he possessed a gun, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1); <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.1 cmt. n.1(D)(ii)(II); <em>see also United States v. Hart, </em>226 F.3d 602, 605 (7th Cir.2000). The district court then granted Garrity a three-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in a total offense level of 33. However, the court went on to find that Garrity\u2019s previous convictions for burglary, armed robbery, solicitation to commit burglary, and conspiracy to manufacture or deliver drugs rendered him a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, which raised his offense level to 37. Subtracting three levels for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 yielded a sentencing range of 262 to 327 months. The court next examined the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and determined that a sentence in the advisory range was appropriate for Garrity to account for \u201cthe seriousness of the offense, the need to promote respect for the law, the age of the crimes which contributed to [Garrity\u2019s] career offender status, coupled with the need to deter others from committing similar crimes, and to protect the public.\u201d The court also found that Garrity\u2019s remorse and work in the community were redeeming factors that warranted a sentence at the bottom of the sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">On appeal Garrity first argues, as he did in the district court, that the quantity of drugs attributable to him should be only the 99.8 grams of crack from the first sale because he was not reasonably capable of making the second delivery of 4.5 ounces of crack. Further, Garrity argues that the district court erroneously applied the firearm enhancement under \u00a7 2D1.1 because he never actually possessed a weapon during the sales, and the black handle of the squeegee that he displayed to the informant did not \u201cclosely resemble\u201d a weapon, as required in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.1 application note 1(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">Garrity\u2019s arguments are frivolous because the district court\u2019s conclusion that Garrity was a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1 mandated an increased offense level without regard for any specific offense characteristics and rendered the drug quantity and firearm enhancement irrelevant. <em>See, e.g., United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number><em>King, </em>356 F.3d 774, 780 (7th Cir.2004). Garrity did not contest the validity of any of the predicate offenses in the district court and does not do so on appeal. The district court correctly calculated his sentencing range at 262 to 327 months\u2019 incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">The remainder of Garrity\u2019s arguments are not entirely clear from his brief. He appears to argue that the district court, by refusing to impose a below-range sentence, created unwarranted sentencing disparities in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Garrity cites three district court cases in which defendants, who he claims have similar characteristics, received downward departures or sentence reductions. <em>See United States v. Hammond, </em>240 F.Supp.2d 872 (E.D. Wise. 2003); <em>United States v. Noriega, </em>40 F.Supp.2d 1378 (S.D.Fla.1999); <em>United States v. Ayers, </em>971 F.Supp. 1197 (N.D.Ill.1997). But we have held that \u201cit is not enough for a defendant to argue that a few cases from any particular circuit seem to cast doubt on his sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>428 F.3d 685, 689 (7th Cir.2005). In order to evaluate disparities we must know \u201cthe specific facts of the crimes and the defendant\u2019s individual characteristics\u201d because district courts are entitled to conclude that these factors justify more severe sentences. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, there are significant differences between Garrity and the three defendants he cites- \u2014 the most glaring being that only Garrity was determined to be a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">To the extent that Garrity is attempting to challenge his sentence under \u00a7 3553(a)(1) by arguing that the district court did not adequately consider his \u201chistory and characteristics,\u201d he is also unsuccessful. Garrity appears to contend that a lesser sentence was warranted because his prior offenses mostly occurred long ago during his youth when he struggled with an alcohol and drug problem; because he suffered serious mental and physical abuse as a child at the hands of his father; and because he currently struggles with \u201csignificant mental and emotional conditions.\u201d Under \u00a7 3553(a) the district court must weigh a defendant\u2019s history and characteristics, but it is not required to weigh one \u00a7 3553(a) factor more heavily than the others. <em>United States v. Laufle, </em>433 F.3d 981, 988 (7th Cir.2006). The district court here chose to give more weight to other factors in \u00a7 3553(a), such as the seriousness of the offense and the need to promote respect for the law, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), Garrity\u2019s career offender status, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1), and the need to protect the public, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). We will not instruct the district court to lower Garrity\u2019s sentence just because a shorter sentence may also be reasonable. <em>See Laufle, </em>433 F.3d at 988; <em>Newsom, </em>428 F.3d at 686-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
