Watson, a Tennessee resident, has filed a motion to proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) on appeal, effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 199-202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a). In the judgment that Watson has appealed in No. 05-10797, the district court dismissed his civil action as frivolous and for failure to state a claim, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) and (ii). Watson\u2019s action was purportedly filed pursuant to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(n), and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq. Watson had alleged that a prospective employer, Bank of America (BOA), rejected his job application, having conspired with federal agencies to hire more \u201cH-1B\u201d <footnotemark>**</footnotemark> nonimmigrant workers, and he sought declaratory relief stating that the H-1B program was \u201cunlawful\u201d and an injunction revoking all H-1B labor certifications and removing such workers from the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-18\">The district court correctly concluded that Watson failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted because he had no private right of action under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(n)(5), which reserves to the Attorney General the authority to raise such claims as Watson\u2019s in the court of appeals. <em>See Venkatraman v. REI Systems, Inc., </em>417 F.3d 418, 422-24 (4th Cir.2005); <em>Biran v. JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., </em>No. 02 CIV.5506(SHS), 2002 WL 31040345 at **2-3 (S.D.N.Y. Sept.12, 2002); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(n)(5)(B)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-21\">Watson is challenging a different district-court judgment in No. 05-10798, a case in which he argued that his former employer, Electronic Data Systems, terminated him improperly in favor of H-1B nonimmigrant visa workers. Insofar as he is challenging this judgment, he had no private right of action in the first instance under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(n), the subsection governing the H-1B program and providing procedures for enforcing its require<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>ments. <em>See Louisiana Landmarks Soc\u2019y, Inc. v. City of New Orleans, 85 </em>F.3d 1119, 1121, 1125 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Shah v. Wilco Systems, Inc., </em>126 F.Supp.2d 641, 647-48 (S.D.N.Y.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">It is ordered that leave to proceed IFP is denied and that the appeal is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 <em>&amp; </em>n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Watson\u2019s motion for production of transcripts at Government expense, his motion to strike pleadings, his motion to expedite the appeal, and his request for judicial notice are also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">IFP MOTION DENIED; MOTION FOR PRODUCTION OF TRANSCRIPTS DENIED; MOTION TO STRIKE DENIED; MOTION TO EXPEDITE DENIED; REQUEST FOR JUDICIAL NOTICE DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b331-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
