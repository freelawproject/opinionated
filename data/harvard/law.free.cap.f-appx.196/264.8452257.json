In September 2002, he was diagnosed with leukemia and took FMLA leave. After his FMLA leave expired, Draper was still unable to work, and KK Ford terminated Draper\u2019s employment. He obtained a right to sue letter from the EEOC in August 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">The case now before us is the second related suit filed by Draper, alleging causes of action under the ADA, FMLA, Title VII, and ERISA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the first suit, Draper filed a timely response to the Defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment, after successfully requesting an extension, and argued the merits before the district court, which ultimately granted the motion. Draper appealed,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> only to withdraw the appeal and file suit in state court in January 2005. KK Ford removed the case to federal court and again filed a motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">Meanwhile, Draper\u2019s attorney, Grover Hankins, had applied for admission to the Bar of the Northern District of Texas, that application denied. However, after a successful appeal initiated in August 2004,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Hankins was admitted in January 2006. During the pendency of that appeal, Draper failed to file a timely response to KK Ford\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the instant case and, five days after the expiration of the deadline, moved for an extension of time under Fed. R. Civ. P. 6(b),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> which was denied. Draper stated that surrogate, local counsel was \u201cengaged in several homicide cases in state court\u201d and that primary counsel, Hankins, was \u201cmoving his law office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b289-16\">Neither party addresses the merits of the summary judgment. Rather, Draper contends that the district court effectively deprived him of his counsel by not granting an extension under Rule 6(b)(2).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We review for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b289-17\">The district court did not abuse its discretion, as the explanation offered by counsel for the tardiness does little to demonstrate excusable neglect. A busy practice does not constitute excusable neglect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, in the motion before the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>court, counsel did not raise the difficulty in obtaining admission to the local bar as an impediment to a timely submission.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In fact, Hankins had previously managed to make submissions to the court through local counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b288-30\"> Pursuant to the 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b289-7\">.

Team America was a staff leasing company in the position of a co-employer with KK Ford under a client service agreement at relevant times for purposes of Draper\u2019s allegations.
