Taylor is a Delaware prisoner and alleges in his complaint that his legal mail was opened outside of his presence on eight occasions over a four-year period and that this constitutes a pattern and practice of so doing. Defendant Beatrice Oney works in the prison mail room and may be in charge of the mail room. Defendant Joe Hudson is a supervisor for the mail room. Defendant John Walsh is in charge of \u201csupport service\u201d at the prison, but has no particular involvement with the mail room. Defendant Betty Burris is the deputy warden and Defendant Robert Snyder is the warden.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-17\">On one occasion after receiving opened legal mail, Taylor spoke with Oney. She told him that she \u201cdidn\u2019t know how it [the opening of Taylor\u2019s legal mail] happened but she would guarantee [Taylor] that it won\u2019t happen again, and probably somebody was working in the mail room that day.\u201d App. at A-41-42. Other undisputed evidence in the record shows that Taylor does not know who opened his mail or what role, if any, the defendants played in opening his mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-18\">Taylor argued below that he has \u201ca Constitutional right[] to have his incoming legal mail open[ed] in his presence.\u201d Pl. Mot. Summ. J. at 2-3 (citing <em>Bieregu v. Reno, </em>59 F.3d 1445, 1458-59 (3d Cir.1995)). He specifically argued that he \u201calleges a First Amendment violation by prison officials for invading and interfering with his legal mail.\u201d PL\u2019s R. Br. Opp. Summ. J. at 4. The District Court, on cross-motions for summary judgment, granted the defendants\u2019 motion and denied Taylor\u2019s. The District Court appeared to construe Taylor\u2019s claim as solely one for violation of his right to court access, and not for violation of his First Amendment right to free speech. The Court ruled that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996), had effectively overruled <em>Bieregu, </em>and that this overruling was recognized in the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Oliver v. Fauver, </em>118 F.3d 175 (3d Cir.1997). Because Taylor had failed to prove \u201cactual injury\u201d to his right to court access, as <em>Casey </em>requires for court-access claims, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the District Court dismissed Taylor\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate only if, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u201d such that \u201cthe moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>See Emory v. AstraZeneca Pharma. LP., </em>401 F.3d 174, 179 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">Taylor alleged below that a pattern and practice of opening his legal mail, contrary to prison regulations, violated his Constitutional rights. Even though his complaint and papers on summary judgment, generously construed, fairly include a claim that the pattern and practice violated his First Amendment right to free speech, the District Court only considered his claim to be one for denial of court access. On appeal, Taylor argues that the District Court \u201cdid not consider the First Amendment free speech claim and if there was a pattern and practice of deliberate interference or the intent [sic] by the defendants.\u201d Br. Appellant at 6. He requests remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">In a separate decision issued today we reaffirm our prior holding in <em>Bieregu </em>that prison officials impinge upon the First Amendment rights of prisoners when they open prisoners\u2019 legal mail outside the presence of the addressee prisoner. <em>See Jones v. Brown, </em>461 F.3d 353, 359 (3d Cir.2006). When bringing claims based on such a violation, prisoners need not allege or prove any \u201cactual injury\u201d beyond the direct injury to their First Amendment right to use the mails. To the extent the District Court ruled otherwise, this was error. However, we nevertheless will affirm the District Court on the alternative ground that Taylor has failed to produce evidence of personal involvement on the part of the defendants in the alleged pattern and practice of opening his mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">\u201cA defendant in a civil rights action must have personal involvement in the alleged wrongs; liability cannot be predicated solely on the operation of <em>respondeat superior. </em>\u201d <em>Rode v. Dellarciprete, </em>845 F.2d 1195, 1207 (3d Cir.1988). Taylor failed to produce any evidence of the personal involvement of any of the individual defendants in the opening of his legal mail. Taylor asserts in his briefing on appeal that Oney had \u201cdirect participation in the alleged Constitutional violation\u201d and was \u201cpersonally involved and responsible for the opening of [his] legal mail.\u201d R. Br. Appellant at 2. He similarly asserts that defendants Walsh and Hudson are responsible for the \u201ccreation and maintenance of a policy under which the violations occurred\u201d and are guilty of \u201cgross negligence in managing subordinates who committed the unconstitutional acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>He further asserts that defendants Burris and Snyder are liable \u201cfor deliberate indifference for failing to act on information indicating that constitutional violations [were] occurring\u201d. <em>Id. </em>However, he points to no record support for any of these conclusory allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment on the alternative ground that Taylor failed to produce evidence of the personal involvement of the defendants. <em>See Rode, </em>845 F.2d at 1207-08.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
