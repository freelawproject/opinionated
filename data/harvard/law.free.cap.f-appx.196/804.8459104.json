We granted a certificate of appealability on \u201cwhether the district court properly dismissed appellant\u2019s 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition as untimely in light of his Fla.R.Crim.P. 3.800(c) motion for reduction of sentence.\u201d Reversible error has been shown; we vacate and remand for additional proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-22\">In his habeas petition, Stites stated that, after the Florida Fifth District Court of Appeal affirmed his conviction and sentence, he filed two state post-conviction motions \u2014 first, a motion pursuant to Fla. R.Crim.P. 3.800(c) to reduce his sentence and later, a motion pursuant to Fla. R.Crim.P. 3.850 to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence. The district court determined that Stites\u2019s AEDPA limitations period tolled while his Rule 3.850 motion was pending; but the court did not explain whether Stites\u2019s AEDPA limitations period tolled as a result of his Rule 3.800(c) motion. Although Stites\u2019s Rule 3.850 motion tolled his AEDPA limitations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>period, the district court still concluded that his habeas petition was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a habeas petition is time-barred. <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 772 (11th Cir.2002). The AEDPA imposes a one-year limitations period on all habeas corpus petitions. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A) (measuring this one-year period from, among other things, \u201cthe date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review\u201d). While a \u201cproperly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\u201d is pending, however, the limitations period is tolled. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">In this case, the record on appeal does not contain Stites\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion or additional information about the state court\u2019s consideration of the motion. We cannot determine from the record the nature of the claims Stites raised in his Rule 3.800(c) motion nor how the state court disposed of his motion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we are unable to resolve whether the district court correctly applied the AEDPA\u2019s one-year statute of limitations. We vacate and remand for the district court to develop the record in this case and address these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b829-9\">. Stites contends that the trial court held an evidentiary hearing on his Rule 3.800(c) motion and granted him relief on the motion. The State concedes that Stites's sentence was reduced as a result of his Rule 3.800(c) motion. Again, because the record on appeal does not contain additional information about Stites\u2019s Rule 3.800(c) motion, we cannot verify these statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
