We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-22\">We review the denial of a habeas petition <em>de novo. Landrigan v. Schriro, </em>441 F.3d 638, 642 (9th Cir.2006). In reviewing the merits of this petition, we apply the deferential standards of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The district court\u2019s refusal to hold an evidentiary hearing is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Landrigan, </em>441 F.3d at 642.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-23\">Acosta argues that his constitutional rights were violated by the use of physical restraints during trial. There are three basic reasons for the judiciary\u2019s \u201chostility to shackling.\u201d <em>Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 630, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005). First, \u201c[vjisible shackling undermines the presumption of innocence and the related fairness of the factfinding process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, physical restraints can impede a defendant\u2019s ability to participate in his defense. <em>Id. </em>at 631, 125 S.Ct. 2007. Third, \u201c[t]he routine use of shackles in the presence of juries would undermine\u201d the dignity of the judicial process. <em>Id. </em>To obtain habeas relief based on unconstitutional shackling, a prisoner \u201cmust show that the physical restraints \u2018had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Pliler, </em>341 F.3d 897, 903 (9th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993)) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>In this case, the California Court of Appeal concluded that the restraints were improper but that Acosta had not been prejudiced. Because there is no evidence that Acosta was unable to participate in his defense, nor any evidence that the jurors were aware of his restraints, the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Nor did the Court of Appeal unreasonably apply the law, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1), because only <em>visible </em>shackling is inherently prejudicial. <em>See Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 635, 125 S.Ct. 2007. We further conclude that Acosta is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing because he made no effort to develop the factual basis of his claim in state court. <em>See Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 420, 437, 120 S.Ct. 1479, 146 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">We reject Acosta\u2019s contention that his due process rights were violated by the lengthy delay between the time of the offenses and his ultimate arrest. The California Court of Appeal found that Acosta suffered no prejudice, and this determination was not unreasonable. Even if Acosta\u2019s alibi witnesses had fully corroborated his testimony regarding his whereabouts on February 14 and March 5, 1997, that would not necessarily exonerate him because he could have assaulted Griffin at different times on those dates. Acosta has thus failed to demonstrate \u201cactual prejudice\u201d from the delay. <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 325, 92 S.Ct. 455, 30 L.Ed.2d 468 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">We also reject Acosta\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct argument. Habeas relief is only available if \u201cthe prosecutors\u2019 comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (quotation marks omitted). In this case, the California Court of Appeal concluded that Acosta was not prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s questions. That determination was reasonable. <em>Cf. </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). First, there was only a single incident of misconduct. Second, the trial court eliminated any risk of prejudice by issuing a curative instruction, which the jurors are presumed to follow. <em>See Francis v. Franklin, </em>471 U.S. 307, 324 n. 9, 105 S.Ct. 1965, 85 L.Ed.2d 344 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b497-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
