This court does not have jurisdiction to directly review the Board\u2019s order setting aside the representation election. <em>Raley\u2019s, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>725 F.2d 1204, 1205 (9th Cir.1984) (en banc). Systems West\u2019s petition for review is therefore dismissed in part, and the scope of the court\u2019s review is limited to the order to cease and desist unfair labor practices and to post and mail remedial notices to employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">The Board\u2019s findings of unfair labor practices are supported by substantial evidence in the record that under all the circumstances, the supervisor statements characterized by the Board as unlawful interrogations or threats \u201creasonably [tended] to restrain or interfere with the employees in the exercise of their protected rights\u201d under section 7 of the NLRA. <em>NLRB v. Bighorn Beverage, </em>614 F.2d 1238, 1241 (9th Cir.1980) (quoting <em>Penasquitos Village, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>565 F.2d 1074, 1080 (9th Cir.1977)). <em>See also McDaniel Ford, Inc., </em>322 NLRB 956, 962 (1997). The Board also correctly applied <em>NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., </em>395 U.S. 575, 618-19, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), in determining that certain statements regarding the effect of unionization were unlawful threats rather than privileged predictions based on objective fact regarding consequences beyond Systems West\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-9\">The ALJ discredited Systems West\u2019s claim that special circumstances justified the prohibition of union insignia at jobsites based on customer objections. This credibility determination is entitled to deference. <em>Retlaw Broadcasting Co. v. NLRB, </em>53 F.3d 1002, 1006 (9th Cir.1995). Even if Systems West\u2019s explanation for the prohibition is sincere, antipathy of a customer towards a union is not the kind of special circumstance that justifies a blanket prohibition of union campaign material. <em>See Control Services, Inc., </em>303 NLRB 481, 485 (1991); <em>Burger King Corp., </em>265 NLRB 1507, 1507-08 (1982); <em>Pay\u2019n Save Corp. v. NLRB, </em>641 F.2d 697, 700-01 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-10\">Systems West\u2019s due process challenge to the Board\u2019s rule directing the posting of election notices in \u201cconspicuous places\u201d on the ground that it is unconstitutionally vague is also without merit. Systems West advances no plausible argument or authority to suggest that \u201cpersons of common intelligence must necessarily guess\u201d at the meaning of \u201cconspicuous.\u201d <em>Tucson Woman\u2019s Clinic v. Eden, </em>379 F.3d 531, 554 (9th Cir.2004) (internal quotations marks omitted). Relating to the posting of notices, a \u201cconspicuous place\u201d means one which is reasonably calculated to impart the information in question. <em>United States v. Bichsel, </em>395 F.3d 1053, 1055 (9th Cir.2005) (adopting the Black\u2019s Law Dictionary definition of \u201cconspicuous place\u201d for purposes of posting notices of regulations for the protection and administration of federal property under 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 1315).</p>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>PETITION FOR ENFORCEMENT GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b587-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
