We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-24\">An intervening change in the law requires us to remand the petition. Antunez alleged that his 1999 departure to Mexico was not under threat of removal. For purposes of his decision, the IJ accepted Antunez\u2019s version of events as true and concluded that even if his 1999 departure was not knowing and voluntary, it broke his accrual of continuous physical presence. Our intervening decision in <em>IbarraFlores </em>held to the contrary. <em>See Ibarra-Flores v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 614, 619 (9th Cir.2006) (holding that voluntary departure under threat of deportation breaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>the accrual of continuous physical presence only where the alien is informed of and accepts the terms of the removal). Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand for reconsideration in light of <em>Ibarra-Flores.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach Antunez\u2019s due process challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b495-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
