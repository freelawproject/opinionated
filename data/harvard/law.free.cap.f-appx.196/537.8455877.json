We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Perez-Velazquez submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-23\">Perez-Velazquez\u2019s contention that the BIA violated its regulations in denying the motion to reopen fails to state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[traditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute colorable constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-24\">Because the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Perez-Velazquez failed to make a prima facie showing that his child will suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship is dispositive, we do not consider contentions relating to physical presence or voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b561-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
