He was sentenced to 71 months of imprisonment, four years of supervised release, and a $100 special assessment. Because the Government does not seek to invoke Hamilton\u2019s appeal waiver, it is not binding. <em>See United States v. Story, </em>439 F.3d 226, 230-31 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">Hamilton argues on appeal that his post-Booker<footnotemark><em>**</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Booker </em>because it was increased based on facts that were not admitted by him or found by a jury. He contends that the district court\u2019s use of the Guidelines violated the Sixth Amendment, even if the district court labeled them as advisory only, because \u201c[t]he district court continues to use the guidelines in a mandatory fashion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">By rendering the Guidelines advisory only, <em>Booker </em>eliminated the Sixth Amendment concerns that prohibited a sentencing judge from finding all facts relevant to sentencing. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005). Hamilton was sentenced under a <em>post-Booker </em>advisory guidelines system, and there is no indication in the record that the district court erroneously treated the Guidelines as mandatory. Therefore, Hamilton\u2019s argument lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b306-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
