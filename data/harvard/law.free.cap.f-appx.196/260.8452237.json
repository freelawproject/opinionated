Pryor, appearing <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his Title VII<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> race discrimination and retaliation claims against his employer, M.D. Anderson, and his alleged supervisors, Alan Wolfe, Joseph Johnson, Eva Harkless, Joe Ward, Joann Hickerson, Tiffany Williams, and Metha Vasquez. We AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE AND REMAND IN PART.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-21\">Pryor sued the defendants following a dispute about whether sick leave he took in February 2004 should be classified as leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA). Pryor alleges he was charged with FMLA leave against his wishes and that his compensation for the period he was absent from work was reduced. He claims that his absence was classified as FMLA leave because of his race and that classification of his absence as FMLA leave violated M.D. Anderson\u2019s FMLA policy. Pryor does not allege that he had any paid leave benefits or that he was denied those benefits. He claims, however, that the defendants withheld his pay check for hours he worked in Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>ber 2004 after he filed a race discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">The individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss Pryor\u2019s claims pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, arguing that they cannot be held liable in their individual or official capacities under Title VII even if they are all supervisors as Pryor alleges in his complaint. M.D. Anderson also asked the court to dismiss Pryor\u2019s claims under Rule 12(b)(6) because his pleadings do not demonstrate that he suffered an actionable \u201cadverse employment action.\u201d The district court granted the motions to dismiss and dismissed Pryor\u2019s claims without prejudice. Pryor was not afforded an opportunity to re-plead.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">A decision to dismiss a case under Rule 12(b)(6) is reviewed <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>A complaint cannot be dismissed for failure to state a claim \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim [that] would entitle him to relief.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In determining whether to dismiss a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), the allegations in the complaint and its attachments must be liberally construed in the plaintiffs favor and all alleged facts must be taken as true.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In this case, we must also consider that Pryor is appearing <em>pro se </em>and hold his pleadings \u201cto less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We may also consider documents attached to a motion to dismiss if those documents are referred to in the plaintiffs complaint and are central to the plaintiffs claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-12\">Pryor generally complains that the district court improperly considered materials beyond the pleadings in dismissing his claims and found facts that are not supported by the record. If materials outside the pleadings are considered, the motion to dismiss must be treated as a motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c), which requires notice and an opportunity to respond with evidence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The district court did not treat the motions to dismiss as motions for summary judgment; therefore, we confine our review to the allegations in the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-13\">To prevail on his discrimination claim, Pryor must show that he suffered an \u201cadverse employment action\u201d because of his race or because he engaged in an activity protected by Title VII.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In this Circuit, only \u201cultimate employment decisions\u201d such as \u201chiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensation\u201d are actionable \u201cadverse employment actions\u201d under Title VII.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In holding that Pryor\u2019s \u201ccomplaint and other pleadings fail to establish that [M.D. Anderson] committed any act that may be classified as an adverse employment action,\u201d the district court discussed only the allegations in the complaint concerning Pryor\u2019s absence from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>work in February 2004. The court said that neither failure to pay an employee who was absent from work nor classification of an absence as FMLA leave constitutes an \u201cultimate employment decision.\u201d Because we agree that those allegations do not state a claim under Title VII, we AFFIRM dismissal of Pryor\u2019s race discrimination claim against M.D. Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">However, the Supreme Court recently held in <em>Burlington Northern &amp; Santa Fe Railway Co. v. White </em>that Title VII's anti-retaliation provision is not limited to \u201cultimate employment decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, a plaintiff states a retaliation claim under Title VII by \u201cshow[ing] that a reasonable employee would have found the challenged action materially adverse, which in this context means it well might have dissuaded a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court did not consider Pryor\u2019s retaliation claim under this new standard, but because we conclude that the allegations in Pryor\u2019s complaint meet this standard as well as the more stringent \u201cultimate employment decision\u201d standard, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal order as to Pryor\u2019s retaliation claim and REMAND that claim for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Pryor alleges in his complaint that M.D. Anderson did not pay him for work performed from December 21, 2004 to December 31, 2004. According to Pryor\u2019s complaint, other employees were paid for that same pay period on January 5, 2005 but he was \u201cdenied and deprived of his paycheck.\u201d Pryor contends that M.D. Anderson wrongfully withheld his paycheck because Pryor filed a race discrimination complaint with the EEOC on December 29, 2004. Pryor does not specifically allege that M.D. Anderson had notice of the EEOC filing but that is a reasonable inference from the allegations in the complaint. Pryor\u2019s complaint thus alleges that he was deprived of <em>earned compensation </em>in retaliation for filing an EEOC complaint, which if true would constitute an adverse employment action.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, deprivation of earned compensation would almost certainly \u201c \u2018dissuade[] a reasonable worker from making or supporting a charge of discrimination.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Therefore, Pryor\u2019s complaint states a claim under the <em>Burlington Northern </em>standard. Although there is evidence in the record that Pryor\u2019s paycheck was merely delayed, not withheld <em>entirely, this evidence is not included </em>in the documents constituting the \u201cpleadings,\u201d and we have no choice but to conclude that Pryor has stated a retaliation claim under Title VII against M.D. Anderson.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-13\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order dismissing Pryor\u2019s claims against the individual defendants because \u201c[ijndividuals are not hable under Title VII in either their individual or official capacities.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">Pryor also complains that the district court abused its discretion in denying his amended motion to vacate the judgment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>This argument is moot as to Pryor\u2019s retaliation claim against M.D. Anderson, and we find no abuse of discretion regarding the remaining claims.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN PART</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
