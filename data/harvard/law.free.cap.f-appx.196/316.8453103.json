Enciso-Hernandez argues that the district court erred by ordering him to cooperate in the collection of a DNA sample as a condition of supervised release. This claim is not ripe for review on direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Riascos-Cuenu, </em>428 F.3d 1100, 1101-02 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 9, 2006) (No. 05-8662). The claim is dismissed. <em>See id. </em>at 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Enciso-Hernandez argues for the first time on appeal that, in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court plainly erred by sentencing him pursuant to a mandatory sentencing guidelines regime, a so-called <em>Fanfan </em>error. Although he concedes that the issue is foreclosed, he seeks to preserve for further review whether this court should review his <em>Fanfan </em>claim de novo because the remedial provisions of <em>Booker </em>were \u201cunforeseeable and entirely novel\u201d at the time he was sentenced. Enciso-Hernandez also seeks to preserve for further review whether this court\u2019s requirement in <em>United States v. Bringier, </em>405 F.3d 310 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 264, 163 L.Ed.2d 238 (2005), that the defendant prove that the error affected his substantial rights, is inconsistent with the reasonable probability standard set forth in <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Where <em>Fanfan </em>error is raised for the first time on appeal, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). The mandatory application of the Guidelines after <em>Booker </em>is an error that is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 733. EncisoHernandez has not shown that his substantial rights have been affected, however, because the sentencing transcript is silent with regard to whether the district court would have imposed a different sentence had the guidelines been advisory. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Enciso-Hernandez also challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Enciso-Hernandez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Enciso-Hernandez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Enciso-Hernandez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED; APPEAL DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b341-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
