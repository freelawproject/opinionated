He was sentenced to five years of probation. Savala\u2019s probation was subsequently revoked, and Savala was sentenced to serve nine months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release. Savala now appeals the two-year term of imprisonment imposed following the revocation of his supervised release. Savala argues that the district court re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>versibly erred in imposing his revocation sentence because the circumstances of his case do not warrant the statutory maximum two-year term of imprisonment imposed in his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Although the two-year term of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of Savala\u2019s supervised release exceeded the sentencing range indicated by the policy statements in Chapter Seven of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, it did not exceed the statutory maximum term of imprisonment that the district court could have imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). Accordingly, Savala\u2019s revocation sentence was neither \u201cunreasonable\u201d nor \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hinson, </em>429 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1804, 164 L.Ed.2d 540 (2006). Savala has not shown error.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
