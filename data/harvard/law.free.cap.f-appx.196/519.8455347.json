We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo dismissals for failure to state a claim or on ripeness grounds. <em>Ventura Mobilehome Communities Owners Ass\u2019n v. City of San Buenaventura, </em>371 F.3d 1046, 1050 (9th Cir.2004). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-23\">The district court properly concluded Byler\u2019s Fifth Amendment takings claim was not ripe for adjudication, because Byler failed to allege that he obtained a final decision from the government authority implementing the regulations, or that he pursued compensation through state remedies. <em>See id. </em>at 1052-53. Accordingly, this claim was properly dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>at 1054. Moreover, the district court properly dismissed Byler\u2019s due process claim because the \u201calleged violation is addressed by the explicit textual provisions of the Fifth Amendment Takings Clause.\u201d <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">The district court also properly concluded that Byler failed to state a valid equal protection claim, because Byler failed to allege that the regulations burdened a suspect class or fundamental interest, and there is a rational relationship between the regulations and the legitimate state interests of public safety and military base stability. <em>See id. </em>at 1055; <em>Hotel &amp; Motel Ass\u2019n of Oakland v. City of Oakland, </em>344 F.3d 959, 970 (9th Cir.2003) (noting rational basis standard of review is \u201chighly deferential\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">The remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A64\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
