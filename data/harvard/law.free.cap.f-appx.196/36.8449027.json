For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In November 2002, Jones-Edwards filed a request with the NSA under the Freedom of Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, seeking \u201call documents forwarded to National Security Agency, General Accounting Office, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Justice, regarding identity theft.\u201d By letter dated February 21, 2003, the NSA informed Jones-Edwards that it had conducted a search of its records, and found no responsive documents. Jones-Edwards appealed by letter to the United States General Accounting Office; in August 2003, the NSA\u2019s Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Appeals Authority responded to that letter, reiterating its position that it had conducted an adequate search and found no relevant records.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">Jones-Edwards then brought suit in the Southern District of New York, seeking \u201can immediate response\u201d to her request to the NSA. The NSA submitted the declaration of its Director of Policy, again reiterating that the NSA\u2019s FOIA staff had conducted a thorough search of the NSA\u2019s records, and had found no responsive records. Jones-Edwards responded to the motion by filing an amended complaint, claiming that her request \u201cshould have caused the NSA to probe intelligence communications within an integrated circuit of domestic and international networks.\u201d The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the NSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-11\">We have described the procedure by which motions for summary judgment in FOIA cases are resolved:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">In order to prevail on a motion for summary judgment in a FOIA case, the defending agency has the burden of showing that its search was adequate and that any withheld documents fall within an exemption to the FOIA. Affidavits or declarations supplying facts indicating that the agency has conducted a thorough search and giving reasonably detailed explanations why any withheld documents fall within an exemption are sufficient to sustain the agency\u2019s burden. Affidavits submitted by an agency are accorded a presumption of good faith; accordingly, discovery relating to the agency\u2019s search and the exemptions it claims for withholding records generally is unnecessary if the agency\u2019s submissions are adequate on their face. When this is the case, the district court may forgo discovery and award summary judgment on the basis of affidavits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">In order to justify discovery once the agency has satisfied its burden, the plaintiff must make a showing of bad faith on the part of the agency sufficient to impugn the agency\u2019s affidavits or declarations, or provide some tangible evidence that an exemption claimed by the agency should not apply or summary judgment is otherwise inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-14\"><em>Carney v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>19 F.3d 807, 812 (2d Cir.1994) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-15\">The plaintiff is \u201cnot required to present evidence that would be admissible at a trial, but something more than his bare allegations is needed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 813 (quota<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>tions marks and citation omitted). The plaintiff must provide \u201cfactual support,\u201d rather than \u201cmere speculation.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">The NSA\u2019s declaration was sufficient to meet its burden of showing that it had conducted an adequate search of its own records. Jones-Edwards failed to come forward with any factually-supported showing that the agency had conducted this search in bad faith; rather, she sought to have the NSA expand its search to encompass \u201cdomestic and international networks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">An agency is not obliged to conduct a search of records outside its possession or control. <em>See Grand Cent. P\u2019ship., Inc. v. Cuomo, </em>166 F.3d 473, 479 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201cFor requested materials to qualify as \u2018agency records,\u2019 two requirements must be satisfied: (i) \u2018an agency must either create or obtain the requested materials,\u2019 and (ii) \u2018the agency must be in control of the requested materials at the time the FOIA request is made.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>United States Dep\u2019t of Justice v. Tax Analysts, </em>492 U.S. 136, 144-45, 109 S.Ct. 2841, 106 L.Ed.2d 112 (1989)); <em>see also Kissinger v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, </em>445 U.S. 136, 152, 100 S.Ct. 960, 63 L.Ed.2d 267 (1980) (\u201c[P]ossession or control is a prerequisite to FOIA disclosure duties.... The Act does not obligate agencies to create or retain documents; it only obligates them to provide access to those which it in fact has created and retained.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">We do not need to decide here which documents might constitute \u201cagency records\u201d of the NSA, and which should be considered outside its control. To the extent that Jones-Edwards seeks documents <em>outside </em>the NSA\u2019s control, the NSA was clearly not obliged to respond; and she offers nothing other than speculation that there may exist relevant documents <em>within </em>the NSA\u2019s control that were not turned over to her. Mere speculation is not sufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
