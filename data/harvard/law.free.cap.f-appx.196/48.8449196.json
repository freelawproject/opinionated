KATZMANN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b73-16\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b73-17\">Mariame Camara appeals from an October 14, 2005 judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York (Robert P. Patterson, Jr., <em>Judge) </em>sentencing her to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months\u2019 imprisonment upon a jury verdict finding her guilty of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(A), 846. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural posture, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-18\">Camara maintains that the District Court should have sentenced her only on the basis of the 400 grams of heroin seized at the time of her arrest, which would have rendered the 120-month statutory minimum inapplicable and instead exposed her to a 60-month mandatory minimum. <em>Compare </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A)(i) <em>with </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B)(i). In support of that claim, she argues that (1) the District Court was not bound by the jury\u2019s quantity finding and (2) the evidence adduced at trial showed that she agreed to possess with intent to distribute only the 400 grams actually recovered, and thus was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>insufficient to support the jury\u2019s finding of one or more kilograms of heroin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">For two reasons, we disagree. First, in <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>420 F.3d 111, 124-25 (2d Cir.2005), we held that quantity is an element of a section 846 narcotics offense and therefore is committed to the jury in the first instance. Pursuant to <em>Gonzalez, </em>district courts are bound by the statutory minima and maxi-ma that attach to a jury\u2019s quantity finding, so long as the finding is supported by sufficient evidence. <em>See United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 526-27 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that although district court may sentence on the basis of acquitted conduct it has found by a preponderance, it must adhere to the statutory minima and maxima authorized by the jury\u2019s quantity finding). The cases to which Camara cites for the proposition that district courts may entirely disregard a jury\u2019s finding \u2014 and the resulting statutory minimum sentence \u2014 are inapposite because they were decided prior to <em>Gonzalez, </em>when quantity was treated only as a \u201csentencing factor\u201d outside the jury\u2019s prerogative. <em>See United States v. Jacobo, </em>934 F.2d 411, 415 (2d Cir.1991); <em>see also United States v. Hendrickson, </em>26 F.3d 321 (2d Cir.1994) (construing former Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2D1.4).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Second, sufficient evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding that Camara agreed to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, such that the District Court was bound to impose the statutory minimum sentence. In challenging the sufficiency of the evidence, Camara bears a \u201cheavy burden\u201d because she \u201cmust prove that, viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, no rational trier of fact could have found\u201d that she agreed to possess with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin. <em>United States v. Aleskerova, </em>300 F.3d 286, 292 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). In assessing her claim, we \u201cdefer to the jury\u2019s determination of the weight of the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses, and to the jury\u2019s choice of the competing inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Velasquez, </em>271 F.3d 364, 370 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, \u201c[t]he traditional deference accorded to a jury\u2019s verdict is especially important when reviewing a conviction for conspiracy because a conspiracy by its very nature is a secretive operation.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>335 F.3d 170, 180 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted and alterations incorporated).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The government introduced recordings of Camara\u2019s conversations with the government\u2019s confidential source, during which Camara referred to various potential narcotics transactions. In the first such conversation, Camara identified \u201cmerchandise\u201d that was stolen from her and her \u201cboss,\u201d specifically \u201cthree market\u201d worth $24,000. The government introduced expert testimony that drug dealers often converse in code, and that during the relevant time period, the street price of 100 grams of heroin was roughly $8,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In another recorded conversation, Camara referred to a shipment of \u201ctwo big\u201d that she and her \u201cboss\u201d had acquired. Of that \u201ctwo big,\u201d Camara explained, \u201cone big\u201d was going to be provided to a \u201cJamaican.\u201d Regarding \u201cthe other one,\u201d six would be provided to someone in Philadelphia and the remainder would be available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to the confidential source if he traveled to New York soon. If he delayed, Camara warned, \u201c[t]he problem is bag gonna finish.\u201d In a conversation that occurred five days later, Camara told the confidential source that \u201cthe only things that are left out there\u201d consisted of \u201c[s]mall six.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In a subsequent conversation Camara agreed to meet the confidential source in New York to execute a transaction. Camara explained that \u201cthe lady just got here today,\u201d potentially indicating that a new shipment had arrived. A few hours later, the confidential source requested \u201cfive market.\u201d At the subsequent meeting, Camara said she would give the confidential source \u201cone\u201d immediately and \u201cfour\u201d if he approved of the first \u201cone.\u201d He insisted on conducting the entire transaction at once. A black male, whom the confidential source believed possessed the heroin, then entered the car in which Camara and the confidential source were sitting. After receiving the confidential source\u2019s prearranged signal, the police arrested the group and discovered a bag containing 400 grams of heroin on the floor of the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">From the evidence set forth above, a rational juror could infer that Camara had agreed to possess with intent to distribute a total of 2.8 kilograms of heroin, as follows: 300 grams that were stolen from her and her \u201cboss\u201d; 2 kilograms, <em>i.e., </em>\u201ctwo big,\u201d that she sold in lots to the \u201cJamaican,\u201d the person from Philadelphia, and perhaps others; and 500 grams that she and the unidentified black male agreed to sell to the confidential source.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Camara also argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s conclusion that the recordings were of her. However, based upon the testimony of the arresting officer \u2014 who spoke with Camara at the scene and identified her voice on the tapes \u2014 the jury was entitled to conclude that Camara was speaking on the recordings.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Given the sufficiency of the evidence described above, the District Court was not free to set aside the jury\u2019s quantity finding for the purpose of imposing a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See Jackson, </em>335 F.3d at 179-83 (reversing district court\u2019s grant of Rule 29 motion because sufficient evidence supported jury\u2019s quantity finding). Accordingly, it properly sentenced Camara to the 120-month term of imprisonment applicable to section 846 offenses involving one kilogram or more of heroin. The judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-6\">. The government contends that because Camara did not object below to the jury\u2019s finding, we must review her claim for plain error. Camara maintains that she did object below. We do not address this issue because we find no error in the first instance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
