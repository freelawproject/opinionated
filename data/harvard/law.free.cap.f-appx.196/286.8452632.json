The district court denied Craddock\u2019s motion to appeal IFP and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith. By moving for IFP, Craddock is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">Craddock\u2019s motion addresses only his asserted indigent status and does not brief any argument regarding the dismissal of his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 suit as time-barred. Failure to identify an error in the district court\u2019s analysis is the same as if the appellant had not appealed the judgment. <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987). Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments in order to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">Craddock has not shown that the district court\u2019s determination that his appeal would be frivolous was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. Accordingly, Craddock\u2019s request for IFP status is denied, and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-220 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Craddock is cautioned that the dismissal of his \u00a7 1983 suit by the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(1) and our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 385-87 (5th Cir.1996). Craddock is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-14\">IFP MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b311-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
