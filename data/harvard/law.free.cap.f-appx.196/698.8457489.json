Because Day has failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), we deny his request and dismiss the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-11\">Day was indicted by a federal grand jury in September 1999 on four criminal counts: conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute, and to distribute, in excess of fifty grams of methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846, and three counts of knowingly and intentionally distributing a listed chemical (pseudoephedrine) knowing the chemical would be used to manufacture methamphetamine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(d)(2). Day was convicted by a jury of all four counts, and was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 240 months. Day filed a direct appeal challenging the denial of his motion to suppress inculpatory statements he made to law enforcement agents and the grand jury. We affirmed the judgment of the district court, <em>United States v. Day, </em>16 Fed.Appx. 956 (10th Cir.2001), and the Supreme Court denied Day\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari. <em>Day v. United States, </em>534 U.S. 970, 122 S.Ct. 386, 151 L.Ed.2d 294 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b723-15\">On July 11, 2002, Day filed a pro se \u00a7 2255 motion asserting various claims of ineffective assistance on the part of the attorney who represented him at trial and on direct appeal. After briefing was completed on Day\u2019s motion, the district court issued an order appointing counsel to represent Day and granting him a limited evidentiary hearing on certain of his claims. Day\u2019s appointed counsel obtained a psychiatric evaluation of Day and subsequently filed a supplement to the \u00a7 2255 motion in order to add an additional claim of ineffective assistance, i.e., that Day\u2019s trial counsel was ineffective \u201cfor failing to investigate ... Day\u2019s mental health background in a way that would allow him to explain critical legal issues to him and present evidence that, at trial, would go to ... Day\u2019s culpability, or, at sentencing, would allow him to make a meaningful motion for downward departure related to that mental condition.\u201d ROA, Doc. 117 at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-16\">The government responded by moving for a psychiatric examination of Day in order to determine whether (a) he was suffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him unable to understand the nature and consequences of the proceedings against him or to assist properly in his defense, (b) he was insane at the time of the offenses of conviction or, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of his acts, and (c) he suffers from a significantly reduced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>mental capacity to the extent defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.13. The district court granted the government\u2019s motion and ordered that Day \u201cbe examined by at least one qualified psychiatrist or psychologist. ...\u201d <em>Id., </em>Doc. 120 at 1-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">On January 26, 2006, the parties stipulated to two expert reports regarding Day\u2019s mental status. <em>Id., </em>Doc. 138. In the first report, the psychiatrist hired by Day, Dr. Edward Gripon, opined that Day exhibited mild mental retardation, had a limited ability to write, read, and understand, and \u201c[h]is concepts in regard to his ... legal proceedings ... [we]re, at best, unsophisticated and primitive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Exh. 1 at IV. In the second report, the government\u2019s expert witness, forensic psychologist James Bernhardt, opined, in pertinent part, that Day (a) exhibited a \u201cborderline range of intellectual functioning\u201d that was \u201cmost likely a reflection of a learning disability or significant education deficiency,\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>id., </em>Exh. 2 at 8, (b) \u201cdemonstrated an adequate ability to understand the nature and consequences of the court proceedings against him, as well as an adequate ability to properly assist counsel in his defense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 9, (c) \u201cDay\u2019s account of his history, along with information from the psychological tests and supplemental records, suggested] an awareness of the nature, quality, or wrongfulness of his actions during the time period of the offense,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 11, (d) \u201cthere was no evidence to indicate that ... Day suffered from a significantly reduced mental capacity with respect to the instant offense applicable to the Diminished Capacity standard,\u201d <em>id., </em>and (e) \u201cthere is no evidence to indicate that ... Day suffers from a mental disorder that significantly impairs his present ability to understand the nature and consequences of the court proceedings against him, or cooperate and assist counsel in his defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">On February 8, 2006, the district court conducted a limited evidentiary hearing, during which it heard testimony from Day and his trial/appellate counsel, and admitted the above-described reports, along with portions of the transcripts from Day\u2019s pretrial hearing, trial, and sentencing. On March 3, 2006, the district court issued a written order denying Day\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion. In doing so, the district court found that Day\u2019s trial counsel met with Day before trial, explained to Day the likely Sentencing Guidelines calculations, and discussed with Day the possibility of pleading guilty and the potential benefit from an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. The district court further found that, in doing so, Day\u2019s trial counsel \u201cknew [Day] had a limited education and a limited ability to read,\u201d and therefore \u201ctook extra time in explaining things to make sure [Day] understood.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Doc. 143 at 5. As for counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate Day\u2019s mental health background, the district court first \u201caccepted] the opinion of Dr. Bernhardt\u201d on the grounds that his evaluation was more \u201crigorous\u201d than that of Dr. Gripon. <em>Id. </em>at 13. \u201cDr. Bernhardt\u2019s opinion,\u201d the district court concluded, \u201cestablish[ed] that [Day]\u2019s level of functioning gave [his trial counsel] no reason to question his mental competence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court further noted that even Dr. Gripon\u2019s evaluation \u201cmerely showed \u2018limited sophistication\u2019 and \u2018limited ability to write, read, and understand,\u2019 \u201d and that the record established that Day\u2019s trial counsel \u201cwas aware of these limitations and took them into account in representing\u201d him. <em>Id. </em>In this regard, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>court found \u201cfully credible [trial counsel\u2019s] testimony that he made his best effort to explain court proceedings and issues to [Day] in simple terms and gave [Day] a full opportunity to seek clarification of anything he did not understand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 13-14. Moreover, the district court found \u201cno evidence to suggest that a reasonable defense attorney would have requested a mental health evaluation of [Day] or otherwise investigated mental health issues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 14. Further, the district court found that trial counsel actually attempted to utilize Day\u2019s intellectual limitations \u201cwhen pertinent to the issues in th[e] case, such as the voluntariness of [Day]\u2019s self-incriminating statements and his role in the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In sum, the district court concluded that trial counsel\u2019s performance did not fall below \u201cprevailing professional norms....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Day filed a timely notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Because the district court did not address the issuance of a COA, the district court is deemed, pursuant to Tenth Circuit Rule 22.1(C), to have denied Day a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-7\">The denial of a motion for relief pursuant to \u00a7 2255 may be appealed only if the district court or this court first issues a COA. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). \u201cA certificate of appealability may issue ... only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). In order to make such a showing, a petitioner must demonstrate that \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether ... the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-11\">In order to prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must first \u201cshow that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). \u201cThis requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cSecond, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b725-12\">After reviewing Day\u2019s appellate brief and the record on appeal, we are not persuaded that Day has established his entitlement to a COA. Although Day takes issue with the district court\u2019s ultimate rejection of the ineffective assistance claim asserted in his supplement to the \u00a7 2255 motion, he makes no attempt to challenge the factual findings that underpin the district court\u2019s legal conclusions. More specifically, he does not challenge the district court\u2019s finding that Dr. Bernhardt\u2019s opinions regarding his mental status were more rigorous, and thus more persuasive, than those of Dr. Gripon, nor does he challenge the district court\u2019s acceptance of his trial counsel\u2019s testimony at the evidentiary hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, Day does not dispute the district court\u2019s finding that his trial counsel actually attempted to capitalize on Day\u2019s intellectual limitations at relevant points in the trial proceedings. Given these factual findings, we in turn conclude that no reasonable jurist could have disagreed with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the performance of trial counsel was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">The request for a COA is DENIED and the matter is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b723-12\"> This order is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-5\">. It is uncontroverted that Day\u2019s parents were migrant farm workers who regularly traveled up and down the west coast of the United States, in turn causing Day to have to transfer from school to school during his childhood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b725-8\">. After closely examining the two expert reports and the transcript of the evidentiary hearing, we are not persuaded that Day could have successfully challenged the district court\u2019s findings in this regard had he attempted to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
