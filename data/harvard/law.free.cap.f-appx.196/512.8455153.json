He argues that the United States Forest Service improperly cancelled his grazing permit because the agency failed to give him notice and an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 558(c). The APA\u2019s procedural protections do not apply, however, \u201cin cases of willfulness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the agency found Stone\u2019s conduct to be willful, and that finding was not arbitrary and capricious, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-23\">We review the decision below with \u201cno particular deference, because the district court, limited to the administrative record, is in no better position to review the agency than the court of appeals.\u201d <em>Great Western Bank v. Office of Thrift Supervision, </em>916 F.2d 1421, 1426 (9th Cir.1990) (citation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>omitted). Our review of the agency\u2019s action is narrower. We must affirm unless the cancellation decision was \u201c \u2018arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with lav/ or ... failed to meet statutory, procedural, or constitutional requirements.\u201d <em>Anchustegui v. Department of Agriculture, </em>257 F.3d 1124, 1128 (9th Cir.2001) (citations omitted). We apply the arbitrary and capricious standard to the agency\u2019s factual findings. <em>See Muckleshoot Indian Tribe v. U.S. Forest Service, </em>177 F.3d 800, 804 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Stone argues that the Forest Service\u2019s cancellation decision cannot be upheld based on the willfulness exception. He claims that the factual similarities between his case and <em>Anchustegui </em>compel reversal of the agency\u2019s action. But Stone is mistaken, because the circumstances of <em>Anchustegui </em>are different from those here. In <em>Anchustegui </em>the court refused to consider the willfulness exception because that <em>exception was </em>never discussed in the administrative proceedings. <em>See Anchustegui, </em>257 F.3d at 1129 (\u201cthe Forest Service did not find that Anchustegui\u2019s conduct was willful\u201d). Here, by contrast, the Forest Service explicitly found that Stone\u2019s \u201cexcess use of the allotment ... is not considered a minor, technical violation and is considered a willful act.\u201d Because \u201cthe Forest Service did [] find that [Stone\u2019s] conduct was willful,\u201d 257 F.3d at 1129, <em>Anchustegui </em>is not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The only remaining question is whether this willfulness finding was arbitrary and capricious. For purposes of the APA, \u201ca violation is \u2018wilful\u2019 if the violator \u2018(1) intentionally does an act which is prohibited, irrespective of evil motive or reliance on erroneous advice, or (2) acts with careless disregard of statutory requirements.\u2019 \u201d <em>Potato Sales Co. v. Department of Agriculture, </em>92 F.3d 800, 805 (9th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). The record indicates that Stone violated his permit on numerous occasions. In 1999 alone, the Forest Service catalogued at least five separate permit violations. The repeated nature of these violations suggests that Stone was acting \u201cwith careless disregard of statutory requirements,\u201d <em>Potato Sales, </em>92 F.3d at 805, and therefore supports an inference of willfulness. <em>See Holland Livestock Ranch v. United States, </em>655 F.2d 1002, 1007 (9th Cir.1981) (finding substantial evidence of willfulness based on, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca history of trespass and of ignoring the conditions upon his permits\u201d). Because the willfulness finding was neither arbitrary nor capricious, the Forest Service was entitled to cancel Stone\u2019s permit without providing him notice and an opportunity to comply.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b536-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
