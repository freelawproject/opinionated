On appeal, his counsel has moved to withdraw and filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and Thepmontry has filed a pro se supplemental brief. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the district court and grant counsel\u2019s withdrawal motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>Counsel argues that the district court erred by determining the drug quantity for which Thepmontry was responsible at sentencing because a key witness was not credible. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 575, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985) (district court\u2019s finding based on credibility determination is virtually never clear error so long as it is not internally inconsistent or based on testimony that is incoherent, implausible, or contradicted by objective evidence); <em>United States v. Milton, </em>153 F.3d 891, 898 (8th Cir.1998) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Turning to Thepmontry\u2019s pro se arguments, we previously have rejected the contention that Guidelines enhancements must be charged in the indictment and proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Okai, </em>454 F.3d 848, 850-52 (8th Cir.2006). We also conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion by not appointing an interpreter at Thepmontry\u2019s competency examination. <em>See Luna v. Black, </em>772 F.2d 448, 451 (8th Cir.1985) (per curiam) (discussing when interpreter is required); <em>United States v. Coronel-Quintana, </em>752 F.2d 1284, 1291 (8th Cir.1985) (standard of review). As to Thepmontry\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, it must be raised (if at all) in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>449 F.3d 824, 827 (8th Cir.2006) (this court \u201cwill consider ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal only where the record has been fully developed, where not to act would amount to a plain miscarriage of justice, or where counsel\u2019s error is readily apparent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">Finally, after reviewing the record independently under <em>Benson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we conclude that there are no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, and we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-27\">. The Honorable Charles B. Kommann, United States District Judge for the District of South Dakota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
