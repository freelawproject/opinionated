Gomez was charged with conducting an unlicensed money transmitting business. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1960 (West Supp.2006). The district court dismissed the indictment on the basis of its opinion in <em>United States v. Talebnejad, </em>342 F.Supp.2d 346 (D.Md.2004). We agree with the district court that this case is <em>in pan materia </em>with <em>Talebnejad. </em>Accordingly, for the reasons set forth in our opinion reversing the district court, <em>see United States v. Talebnejad, </em>460 F.3d 563 (4th Cir.2006), we reverse the dismissal of the indictment against Gomez and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b169-11\">GREGORY, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ANr\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">For reasons enunciated in my separate opinion in <em>United States v. Talebnejad, </em>460 F.3d 563 (4th Cir.2006), I respectfully dissent. Here, as in <em>Talebnejad, </em>the indictment failed to allege a knowing and willful violation of the Maryland licensing law for activities after October 1, 2002. Because I would hold that the Government must prove a knowing and willful violation of Maryland\u2019s licensing law for conduct occurring after October 1, 2002, I would affirm the dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
