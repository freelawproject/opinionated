Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc), to determine whether the district court would have imposed a materially different sentence had it known that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. The district judge responded that he would not have imposed a materially different sentence. Under these circumstances, the only issue properly presented on this appeal is the reasonableness of Rodriguez-Preciado\u2019s sentence. Based on the entire record, we find that the district judge properly considered the sentencing factors under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and that Rodriguez-Preciado\u2019s sentence, which is at the low point in the Guidelines range, is reasonable. We also find that the district judge\u2019s reference to \u201c \u00a7 3553(1),\u201d rather than to \u201c \u00a7 3553(a),\u201d in his order upon remand was a scrivener\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
