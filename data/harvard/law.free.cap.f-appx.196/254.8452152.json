Breazeale, whose 2000 Dodge Ram pickup truck suffered extensive engine damage, originally brought this action in Mississippi state court, but Daimler-Chrysler removed the case to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. Because Breazeale failed to present a genuine issue of material fact as to the causation of his truck\u2019s engine damage, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Evans v. City of Houston, </em>246 F.3d 344, 347 (5th Cir.2001). Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 332-33, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552-53, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). On a motion for summary judgment, a court must review the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmovant. <em>Walker v. Thompson, </em>214 F.3d 615, 624 (5th Cir.2000). When dealing with the breach of an express warranty, \u201cit is the burden of the plaintiff to prove that the defect in the product or service caused the damage [at issue].\u201d <em>Mitchell v. Rapid Oil Change, Inc., </em>752 So.2d 466, 470 (Miss.App.1999)(citing <em>Crocker v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., </em>346 So.2d 921, 923 (Miss.1977)). A lack of demonstrated causation is fatal to a breach of warranty claim. <em>Easley v. Day Motors, Inc., </em>796 So.2d 236, 241 (Miss.App.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">In the instant case, Daimler-Chrysler sent a technical advisor, Bret Byus, to inspect Breazeale\u2019s truck. In support of the company\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Byus provided an affidavit in which he stated that the cause of damage to the truck\u2019s engine was \u201ceither a missing, misinstalled, or improperly functioning air filter.\u201d Daimler-Chrysler provided a five-year/100,000 mile warranty on Breazeale\u2019s truck; the warranty does not cover damage caused by the use of third-party components. Breazeale concedes that non-Daimler-Chrysler filters had been installed in his truck. As such, Byus concluded that the repairs sought by Breazeale were not covered by the warranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">In response, Breazeale offered affidavits from two mechanics, Randy Lewis and Joe Shows. Even assuming arguendo that Lewis and Shows were competent to offer reliable testimony here, neither man presented evidence sufficient to create a material fact issue as to causation. Lewis\u2019s affidavit has no apparent relevancy; more importantly, he does not offer an opinion as to what caused the engine damage in Breazeale\u2019s truck. Shows states that he examined Breazeale\u2019s truck, and that the problems occurring in the vehicle were consistent with a condition described in a technical bulletin he obtained on the Internet.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In sum, one of Breazeale\u2019s experts had no theory as to what caused the damage to Breazeale\u2019s truck, while the other expert offered an indefinite and unsubstantiated explanation for the engine damage. \u201cConclusional allegations and denials, speculation, improbable inferences, unsubstantiated assertions, and legalistic argumentation do not adequately substitute for specific facts showing a gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>uine issue for trial.\u201d <em>Oliver v. Scott, </em>276 F.3d 736, 744 (5th Cir.2002) (citing <em>SEC v. Recile, </em>10 F.3d 1093, 1097 (5th Cir.1993)). As Breazeale can offer only unsubstantiated assertions and speculation as to the issue of causation, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Daimler-Chrysler is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b278-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b279-8\">. The technical bulletin, obtained from a website not affiliated with Daimler-Chrysler, describes an engine problem that <em>may </em>occur under extreme conditions, specifically downhill off-road driving at grades above 37.5 percent for extended periods of time. As the district court correctly noted, neither Breazeale nor Shows offered any evidence suggesting that the truck had been driven under such extreme conditions.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
