We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo, <em>Molinar-Estrada v. INS, </em>293 F.3d 1089, 1093 (9th Cir.2002), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-21\">The BIA correctly concluded that VelizValdez was ineligible for cancellation of removal as a result of his conviction for possession for sale of a controlled substance. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(B) (defining illicit trafficking in a controlled substance as an aggravated felony); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3) (providing that the attorney general may cancel the removal of a permanent resident who has not been convicted of an aggravated felony). The later expungement of Veliz-Valdez\u2019s conviction pursuant to California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 did not render him eligible for cancellation of removal. <em>See Ramirez-Castro v. INS, </em>287 F.3d 1172, 1175 (9th Cir.2002) (state conviction expunged under California Penal Code \u00a7 1203.4 remains a conviction for purposes of federal law).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-22\">Veliz-Valdez\u2019s due process claim fails because the IJ\u2019s denial of his motion for a continuance did not inhibit Veliz-Valdez\u2019s ability to appeal the order of removal to the BIA. <em>See Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring an alien to demonstrate prejudice to prevail on a due process claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-23\">Veliz-Valdez\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b488-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
