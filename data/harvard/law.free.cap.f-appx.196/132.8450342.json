We have jurisdiction per 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. For the reasons stated below, we will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b157-12\">Liem is an Indonesian native and citizen. He is Christian and of Chinese ethnicity.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-13\">In May 2000, Liem entered the United States on a temporary visitor\u2019s visa. He remained in the country without permission after his visa expired in November 2000. On June 3, 2003, he was served with a Notice to Appear charging him with being removable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B) (alien present in violation of law). Liem conceded removability. On December 10, 2003, he filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-14\">Liem claims to have suffered persecution based on his religion and ethnicity in Indonesia throughout his life, culminating in several incidents that occurred in the wake of a failed business partnership. His account of this persecution is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b157-19\">Liem maintains he suffered periodic slurs as a child because he is Christian and Chinese. Then, in 1998, he entered into a business partnership with several other men, two of whom were native Indonesian and the remainder of whom were Chinese. One of the native Indonesian partners, Lieutenant Edward, was the chief of a local police station. When the other native Indonesian partner, Burhan, absconded with all the money the partners had invested in the business venture, Lieutenant Edward accused the remaining partners, Liem included, of conspiring with Burhan to steal his money. He summoned them by letter to the police station on two occasions. At the station, they were interrogated and forced to sign an agreement promising to repay Lieutenant Edward the money Burhan had taken. Lieutenant Edward also threatened them by saying: \u2018You stupid Chinese, if you refuse to pay we will force you, we will strip off your clothes and take you to the city and humiliate you.\u201d App. 241. A week later, seven \u201carmy soldiers\u201d came to Liem\u2019s house and took him and his wife to the police station, where Lieutenant Edward beat him. Liem\u2019s wife was in the next room at the police station when Edward beat Liem.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-20\">Immediately thereafter, Liem and his wife fled to Jember, the hometown of his wife\u2019s parents. They remained there until May 2000, when they left for the United States. Liem stated that Lieutenant Edward \u201cchased\u201d him to Jember and \u201ctried to look for [him and his wife]\u201d there, but conceded that Edward did not find them and that they did not \u201chave any problems\u201d living in Jember. App. 135-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>After a hearing, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Liem\u2019s asylum application because Liem had filed it outside of the one-year filing deadline, and the IJ found that none of the circumstances that permit waiver of that deadline were present. App. 91-92; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B) &amp; (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The IJ also denied Liem\u2019s withholding of removal claim. She reasoned that Liem had not suffered qualifying past persecution because not only had Lieutenant Edward not been exercising state power, but his motivations were also not religion and ethnicity but \u201ca personal matter, a bad business venture.\u201d App. 94. The IJ further found that Liem \u201cfailed to rebut that his relocation was not a safe haven from the police lieutenant.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> App. 93. Finally, the fact that Liem\u2019s wife was present for the hearing but did not testify, despite Liem\u2019s claim that she was in the waiting room of the police station and heard the beating, lead the IJ to take an \u201cadverse inference on the credibility of respondent\u2019s claim.\u201d App. 94. The IJ had prompted the wife to testify and commented in the decision that because the alleged beating was \u201ca core matter underlying [Liem\u2019s] claim ... his failure to attempt to corroborate through his wife\u2019s testimony is inexplicable.\u201d App. 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">Lastly, the IJ denied Liem\u2019s CAT claim. She then granted Liem voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">The BIA \u201cadoptfed] and affirm[ed] the decision of the Immigration Judge,\u201d agreeing with the reasoning set forth in that opinion. App. 2. In his petition for review, Liem challenges only the IJ\u2019s ruling on his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Because the BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and adopted the IJ\u2019s rationale, this court must review the IJ\u2019s opinion. <em>See, e.g., Korytnyuk v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 272, 286 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cwhere the BIA simply states that it affirms the IJ\u2019s decision for the reasons set forth in that decision ... the IJ\u2019s opinion effectively becomes the BIA\u2019s, and, accordingly, a court must review the IJ\u2019s decision.\u201d) (quotation and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-11\">We review the IJ\u2019s legal conclusions de novo. <em>Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s factual determinations, on the other hand, under a \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d standard, which requires us to treat findings of fact as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-12\">To be eligible for a grant of withholding of removal to a country, an alien must show that it is more likely than not, that his or her \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in that country <em>because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A) (emphasis added); <em>see also Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 469-70 (3d Cir.2003) (explaining that alien\u2019s burden for withholding of removal is \u201cclear probability,\u201d meaning \u201cmore likely than not\u201d). If the alien establishes that he suffered persecution in the past on account of one of those grounds, \u201cit shall be pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>sumed that [the alien\u2019s] life or freedom would be threatened in the future in the country of removal on the basis of the original claim.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1)(i). An alien who has not established past persecution (or whose fear of future persecution is unrelated to his past persecution) may demonstrate his or her eligibility for withholding of removal by establishing that \u201cit is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted <em>on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion </em>upon removal to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(2) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">We find that the IJ\u2019s determination that any past persecution Liem suffered by Lieutenant Edward was not on account of his race or ethnicity \u2014 but was instead caused by money lost in a business deal gone bad \u2014 to be supported by substantial evidence. As we have recognized, \u201c[a] persecutor may have multiple motivations for his or her conduct, but the persecutor must be motivated, at least in part, by one of the enumerated grounds.\u201d <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 535 (3d Cir.2005) (quotation and citation omitted). The only evidence Liem presented to show that Lieutenant Edward was motivated by Liem\u2019s race or ethnicity is that Lieutenant Edward called him and the other business partners \u201cstupid Chinese.\u201d Considering the other evidence the IJ recounted as to Lieutenant Edward\u2019s motivation \u2014 that Edward chose to enter into a business relationship with another native Indonesian and five ethnic Chinese; that the native Indonesian stole the money and fled; that only after this theft did Edward seek out the remaining business partners (all of whom were ethnic Chinese); that Edward\u2019s threats were directed at being reimbursed for his stolen money \u2014 we cannot find that \u201cany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Lie, </em>396 F.3d at 535-36 (finding that substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s determination that attackers who used \u201ca single ethnic slur\u201d were not motivated by ethnicity when significant evidence indicated motivation was money).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">As we have determined that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that any past persecution by Lieutenant Edward is not the sort of persecution the withholding statute is designed to address, any threat to Liem in the future by Lieutenant Edward cannot provide the basis for withholding of removal either for the same reason. Consequently, we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Liem did not show that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted on account of his ethnicity or religion if he returns to Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Liem\u2019s petition for review of the denial of his withholding of removal claim.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b157-15\">. Liem\u2019s wife is a derivative applicant on Liem\u2019s application for relief from removal. Because we deny Liem\u2019s petition for review, his wife is denied relief as well. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(3)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-7\">. Because we find that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s determination that any persecution here was not due to Liem\u2019s ethnicity or religion, it is unnecessary for us to explore whether substantial evidence supports the IJ's finding that Lieutenant Edward was not exercising state power and thus whether the burden of showing the possibility and reasonableness of internal relocation was placed on the proper party. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1208.16(b)(3)(i) &amp; (ii).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
