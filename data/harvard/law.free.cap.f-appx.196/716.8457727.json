MURPHY, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">Following a jury trial, Felipe FrancoGuillen was convicted of a single count of illegal reentry after deportation following conviction for an aggravated felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), (b)(2). Franco-Guillen appeals his conviction and sentence, contending certain comments connecting his ethnicity and a propensity for lying made by the district court judge created a sufficient appearance of bias that the judge should have sua <em>sponte </em>recused himself pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">Franco-Guillen and the government originally entered into a plea agreement. During the plea colloquy, Franco-Guillen acknowledged <em>inter alia </em>that no promises had been made as to the sentence he would ultimately receive and that he was facing a twenty-year maximum penalty. The district court accepted the guilty plea. At the sentencing hearing, the district court asked Franco-Guillen if he was satisfied with the contents of the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d). Franco-Guillen expressed, through an interpreter, either surprise, frustration, and/or dissatisfaction with the sentencing range set out in the PSR; he further stated his attorney had indicated he would receive a sentence of between twelve and fifteen months. In response, the district court abruptly, and without any examination of the reasons for Franeo-Guillen\u2019s discontent, set aside the guilty plea and ordered the case to trial. The colloquy at sentencing indicates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-13\">THE COURT: Is there anything in the [PSR] that you want to change or correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-14\">INTERPRETER WORTHINGON: I would just like the opportunity to speak before I\u2019m sentenced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-15\">THE COURT: But you\u2019re satisfied with the contents of the [PSR]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-16\">INTERPRETER WORTHINGON: Not very well.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-17\">THE COURT: What\u2019s there in this [PSR] that you are not satisfied with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-18\">INTERPRETER WORTHINGON: Because the other time before I came to court, I reached an agreement with my attorney that we were with an agreement between 12 and 15 months. The contract, when I came here, we signed that 12 to 15 month agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-19\">THE COURT: What? You didn\u2019t sign any agreement that said \u2014 with [defense counsel] that said that you were gonna serve 12 to 15 months. Where is a copy of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-20\">INTERPRETER WORTHINGON: No, we had an agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-21\">THE COURT: Oh yeah. Listen, I\u2019m setting this aside. This is going to trial. I will not put up with this from these Hispanics or anybody else, any other defendants. You didn\u2019t have any kind of agreement like that with [counsel]. [Counsel] probably may have given you some idea of what he thought your sentence was; but when I took your guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>plea, you told me under oath that you understood that whatever he told you was merely his advice and was not a promise. Now, I\u2019m not putting up with this. I\u2019ve got another case involving a Hispanic defendant who came in here and told me that he understood what was going on and that everything was fine and now I\u2019ve got a 2255 from him saying he can\u2019t speak English. And he is lying because he told me he could. So this \u2014 the plea agreement is set aside. You\u2019re going to trial my friend. When can you be ready.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">[PROSECUTOR]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">THE COURT: And let me tell you this, sir. You\u2019ve got a long prison record and you\u2019ve got more aliases than I\u2019ve seen anybody have except one individual down in Las Cruces, New Mexico, and you are facing 20 years if you\u2019re convicted by a jury. When can this case be ready for trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">[PROSECUTOR]: Just within a matter of ten days or less, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">THE COURT: Set the case. We\u2019ll notify you when it\u2019s ready. Nobody can come in here and lie to me and get away with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Thereafter, the district court summarily denied Franco-Guillen\u2019s additional requests to waive a jury trial and to have the matter tried to the district court. After the jury convicted Franco-Guillen of illegal reentry, the district court denied FrancoGuillen\u2019s request for a reduction in his offense level for acceptance of responsibility and sentenced Franco-Guillen to a term of forty-six months, a sentence in the middle of the advisory sentencing range.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">On appeal, Franco-Guillen asserts the district court\u2019s references to his ethnicity, especially where those comments seem to link Franco-Guillen\u2019s ethnicity with a propensity to he, created an appearance of bias sufficient to trigger a <em>sua sponte </em>duty on the part of the district court to recuse pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). In an admirable and appreciated expression of candor, the United States agrees that, although the record is devoid of any indication of actual bias, the district court\u2019s comments created a sufficient appearance of bias so that Franco-Guillen\u2019s conviction should be vacated and the matter remanded for further proceedings before a different district court judge.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">\u201cAny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). By its terms, \u00a7 455(a)\u2019s recusal requirement arises <em>sua sponte </em>when the judge\u2019s impartiality might be reasonably questioned. <em>United States v. Pearson, </em>203 F.3d 1243, 1276 (10th Cir.2000). \u201cThe trial judge must recuse himself when there is the appearance of bias, regardless of whether there is actual bias.\u201d <em>Bryce v. Episcopal Church, </em>289 F.3d 648, 659 (10th Cir.2002). \u201cThe test is whether a reasonable person, knowing all the relevant facts, would harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). This court will \u201cconsider the totality of the circumstances when reviewing such claims, disregarding the judge\u2019s actual state of mind, purity of heart, incorruptibility, [and] lack of partiality.\u201d <em>United States v. Lang, </em>364 F.3d 1210, 1217 (10th Cir.2004) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The judge\u2019s statements on the record would cause a reasonable person to harbor doubts about his impartiality, without regard to whether the judge actually harbored bias against Franco-Guillen on account of his Hispanic heritage. <em>See Liteky v. United </em>States, 510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994) (giving as an example of an appearance of bias requiring recusal when a trial judge in a World War I espionage case allegedly said, \u201c[o]ne must have a very judicial mind, indeed, not [to be] prejudiced against German-Americans\u201d because their \u201chearts are reeking with disloyalty\u201d). When at the initial sentencing hearing the district judge perceived that Franco-Guillen was lying about his understanding of the plea agreement, the judge stated, \u201cI will not put up with this from these Hispanics or anybody else, any other defendants.\u201d The judge compounded the impropriety of his reference to defendant\u2019s ethnicity when he then stated: \u201cI\u2019ve got another case involving a Hispanic defendant who came in here and told me that he understood what was going on and that everything was f\u00edne and now I\u2019ve got a 2255 from him saying he can\u2019t speak English.\u201d While the district court\u2019s statements may well reflect frustration with Franco-Guillen\u2019s apparent, albeit unexplored, contradictions between the change of plea hearing and the sentencing hearing, his reference to Hispanics and his use of an example of another Hispanic defendant in discussing Franco-Guillen\u2019s perceived lack of truthfulness would cause a reasonable person \u201cto harbor doubts about the judge\u2019s impartiality\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, this court reverses FrancoGuillen\u2019s conviction and remands the matter to the district court for further proceedings. Upon remand, the case should be reassigned to a different district court judge who must vacate Franco-Guillen\u2019s conviction and begin proceedings anew.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b741-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b742-9\">. The Supreme Court has recognized that \"the United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereign whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done.\u201d <em>Strickler v. Greene, </em>527 U.S. 263, 281, 119 S.Ct. 1936, 144 L.Ed.2d 286 (1999). We laud the government attorneys in this case for living up to that high standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
