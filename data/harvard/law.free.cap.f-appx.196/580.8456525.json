We agree with Petitioner that, under the categorical approach, the Hawaii statute under which she was convicted defines prostitution more broadly than federal law. We therefore exercise jurisdiction over Depasquale\u2019s petition for review and grant it, in part. Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-23\">We have jurisdiction to determine whether we have jurisdiction to consider Depasquale\u2019s petition for review. <em>Naka</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number><em>moto v. Ashcroft, </em>363 F.3d 874, 878 n. 4 (9th Cir.2004). We review this question de novo, <em>Albillo-Figueroa v. INS, </em>221 F.3d 1070, 1072 (9th Cir.2000), and apply a categorical approach in making this determination. <em>Randhawa v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 1148, 1152 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">While the government is correct that the term \u201crelates to\u201d in INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(K) has a broad, commonsense meaning, <em>Albillo-Figueroa, </em>221 F.3d at 1073-74, the government neglects to recognize that the definition of \u201cprostitution\u201d in Hawaii\u2019s statutes encompasses conduct broader than any federal definition of prostitution. Conduct that is \u201cprostitution\u201d in Hawaii is not necessarily \u201cprostitution\u201d within the meaning of the INA. <em>Kepilino v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1057, 1060-62 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">The federal definition of prostitution is \u201cengaging in promiscuous sexual intercourse for hire.\u201d 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.24(b). By contrast, Hawaii\u2019s definition of prostitution includes a broad range of conduct, including but not limited to sexual intercourse. Depasquale\u2019s case is controlled by the Hawaii Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 712-1203 in <em>State v. Richie, </em>88 Hawai'i 19, 960 P.2d 1227, 1241 (1998). The state supreme court affirmed defendant\u2019s conviction under Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 712-1203 where defendant had arranged performances for undercover police officers during which there was \u201crepeated contact with breasts, contact with genitalia, and simulation of sexual intercourse,\u201d some through clothing. Relying on Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 712-1200, the Supreme Court of Hawaii explained that \u201cprostitution\u201d is engaging in \u201csexual conduct\u201d with another person for a fee. <em>Id. </em>at 1238. \u201cSexual conduct\u201d is defined to include \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as well as a wide range of other activity, including other \u201ctouching\u201d and \u201csexual contact\u201d through clothing. Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 707-700.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">A conviction under \u00a7 712-1203 requires \u201cmanaging, supervising, controlling, or owning ... a house of prostitution,\u201d and although the language of the Hawaii statute is nearly identical to the language of INA \u00a7 101(a)(43)(K), as <em>Richie </em>shows, the definition of \u201cprostitution\u201d in the context of \u00a7 712-1203 encompasses a greater range of conduct than 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 40.24(b)\u2019s definition of the same term. Under the Hawaii statute, prostitution may include activity that is not necessarily sexual intercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">Thus, the \u201cfull range of conduct\u201d covered by \u00a7 712-1203 does not categorically fall within the meaning of aggravated felony as defined in \u00a7 101(a)(43)(K).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Therefore, we may exercise jurisdiction over Depasquale\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">We reject Petitioner\u2019s argument that the BIA failed to undertake an independent review of the record in affirming the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Nakamoto, </em>363 F.3d at 882 n. 5; <em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">We grant Depasquale\u2019s petition for review as to whether the IJ should have continued the proceedings until she could file and have adjudicated an 1-130 petition. Because Depasquale asked for a stay, the IJ\u2019s decision not to continue proceedings undermines the full and fair nature of her hearing. <em>See Ngongo v. Ashcroft, </em>397 F.3d 821 (9th Cir.2005) (denying petition for review because petitioner did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>not ask for a stay); <em>Colmenar v. INS, </em>210 F.3d 967, 971 (9th Cir.2000). In addition, because the IJ was incorrect in finding that Depasquale\u2019s conviction under Haw.Rev.Stat. \u00a7 712-1203 constituted an aggravated felony, Petitioner is eligible to seek a waiver of inadmissibility, rendering the IJ\u2019s failure to grant a continuance prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">We therefore grant Depasquale\u2019s petition for review and remand to the BIA for additional proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">PETITION GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b605-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b606-6\">. Because Depasquale\u2019s conviction documents parrot the language of the statute under which she was convicted, providing no specifics as to her underlying conduct, the modified categorical approach is not helpful.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
