In late 2003, Teamsters Union Local 331 began organizing dealers at Caesars and other area casinos. LoManto was involved in the campaign in various ways; including, signing a union authorization card, attending meetings, and distributing literature to coworkers. The campaign gained momentum in January 2004 and, by its end, approximately 200 of Caesars\u2019 800 dealers had signed union authorization cards. However, the campaign ended without an election petition being filed. Near the end of the campaign, LoManto was involved in two heated conflicts with casino customers who were gambling at his table. After the first incident on February 21, 2004, Caesars issued a written warning to LoManto that another such incident would result in his dismissal. Before this warning was delivered to LoManto, however, a second incident occurred on March 5, 2004. LoManto was subsequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>ly placed on investigatory suspension and was discharged shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">After his termination, LoManto filed a charge with the Board, alleging that Caesars had violated the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a)(1), (3), by making anti-union comments, issuing threats of reprisal for union activity, taking disciplinary action against him and discharging him for his union activity. The Regional Director of the Board issued a complaint against Caesars, and a trial was held before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) during which both Caesars and LoManto (through General Counsel for the Board) presented evidence. After the proceedings concluded, the ALJ issued a decision finding that Caesars had not violated the Act and recommending that the complaint be dismissed. LoManto filed an extensive list of exceptions, and Caesars filed an answering brief. In a decision and order issued on June 30, 2005, the Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s recommended order and dismissed LoManto\u2019s complaint. After the Board denied LoManto\u2019s motion for reconsideration, LoManto filed this petition for review, requesting that the Board\u2019s order be set aside.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The Board had jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(a). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f). We review the Board\u2019s findings to determine whether they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f); <em>Hunter Douglas, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>804 F.2d 808, 812 (3d Cir.1986) (citing <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. N.L.R.B., </em>340 U.S. 474, 487-91, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Under section 8(a)(1) of the Act, it is an unfair labor practice for an employer to \u201cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of [their rights]\u201d to engage in union organizing activities. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). The Act also prohibits an employer from encouraging or discouraging membership in any labor organization. <em>See id. </em>at \u00a7 158(a)(3). In order to prove a violation of the Act, General Counsel must first establish that opposition to union activity was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in the employer\u2019s decision to discharge or take other adverse action against an employee. <em>See N.L.R.B. v. Omnitest Inspection Servs., Inc., </em>937 F.2d 112, 122 (3d Cir.1991) (internal citation omitted). The timing of the action, whether the employer knew about the employee\u2019s union activity or was hostile towards the union, and the employer\u2019s reasons, if any, for the action are all relevant to the determination whether an unlawful motive exists. <em>See id. </em>If and when this showing is made, the burden shifts to the employer to show by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have taken the same action even if the employee had not engaged in protected conduct. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>N.L.R.B. v. Transp. Mgmt. Corp., </em>462 U.S. 393, 401-03, 103 S.Ct. 2469, 76 L.Ed.2d 667 (1983)).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">The trial before the ALJ spanned three days and included testimony from LoManto, eight Caesars employees (mostly management level), and a casino patron who was involved in the February 21st incident. In regard to the customer incidents, LoManto testified that customers had been committing rules infractions and he had merely done his job by enforcing the rules. LoManto also testified that the customers were verbally abusive to him. Testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>from Caesars\u2019 witnesses painted an entirely different picture, uniformly portraying LoManto\u2019s behavior as bullying and aggressive towards the customers. Caesars\u2019 witnesses also testified that LoManto had disobeyed a direct order from his immediate supervisor to continue dealing during the March 5th incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">In a detailed decision, the ALJ emphasized that credibility was a key consideration in the case, as LoManto\u2019s uncorroborated testimony constituted the bulk of the General Counsel\u2019s evidence. The ALJ discredited LoManto\u2019s version of events, based both on his assessment of LoManto\u2019s demeanor and his observation that LoManto shifted his story throughout the trial. Crediting the testimony of Caesars\u2019 witnesses, the ALJ found that management had never made anti-union or threatening comments as alleged by LoManto. The ALJ also found that the General Counsel had failed to sustain his burden of proving that anti-union animus motivated Caesars\u2019 warning, suspension, or termination of LoManto, because there was no credited evidence that management knew about LoManto\u2019s involvement in the union campaign. The ALJ also credited Caesars\u2019 version of events surrounding the customer conflicts and found that LoManto\u2019s written warning, suspension, and termination were the direct results of his inappropriate behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">On appeal, LoManto contends that the Board\u2019s credibility determinations were flawed, that each witness\u2019s testimony was self-contradicting, and that the ALJ failed to recognize that some testimony from Caesars\u2019 witnesses actually supported his case. We are not persuaded by these assertions, which are unsupported by the record. After reviewing the record, including LoManto\u2019s numerous exceptions, we find no fault with the Board\u2019s credibility determinations. <em>See Edgewood Nursing Center, Inc. v. N.L.R.B., </em>581 F.2d 363, 365 (3d Cir.1978). <em>See also N.L.R.B. v. Craw, </em>565 F.2d 1267, 1270 (3d Cir.1977) (reviewing court cannot displace Board\u2019s selection between two conflicting views of the evidence). We hold that the Board\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and will, accordingly, deny LoManto\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-12\">.
