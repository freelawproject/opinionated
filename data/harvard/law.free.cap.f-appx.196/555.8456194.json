We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen and reconsider, <em>Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">To the extent Reyes-Garda attempted to present new information in her motion to reconsider, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in construing that part of her motion as a motion to reopen, and denying it on the grounds that Reyes Garcia failed to present evidence to support any of her contentions. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1) (providing that a motion to reopen \u201cshall be supported by affidavits or other evidentiary material\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">Reyes-Garcia\u2019s contention that the BIA violated her due process rights by disregarding her evidence of hardship is not supported by the record and does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-12\">In her opening brief, Reyes-Garcia fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s denial of reconsideration. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b580-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
