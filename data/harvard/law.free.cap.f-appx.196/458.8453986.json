To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review de novo claims of constitutional violations in immigration proceedings. <em>See Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510, 516 (9th Cir.2001). We dismiss in part and deny in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the petitioners\u2019 contentions that the IJ\u2019s factual determinations are not supported by substantial evidence and that the petitioners were denied a full and fair hearing because they failed to raise these contentions before the BIA and thereby failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004) (explaining that this court lacks jurisdiction to review contentions not raised before the agency, including due process contentions that are procedural in nature).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The petitioners\u2019 contention that the agency deprived them of due process by not considering all of the evidence does not state a colorable due process claim. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201ctraditional abuse of discretion challenges recast as alleged due process violations do not constitute color-able constitutional claims that would invoke our jurisdiction.\u201d) <em>see also Sanchez-Cruz v. INS, </em>255 F.3d 775, 779 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the \u201cmisapplication of case law\u201d may not be reviewed).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">We lack jurisdiction to evaluate whether the BIA\u2019s decision to affirm the IJ\u2019s order without opinion was appropriate, where the denial of relief was based on the IJ\u2019s discretionary decision that the petitioners failed to establish exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 854 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">The petitioners\u2019 equal protection challenge is unavailing because they failed to \u201cestablish that [their] treatment differed from that of similarly situated persons.\u201d <em>Dillingham v. INS, </em>267 F.3d 996, 1007 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">Contrary to the petitioners\u2019 contention, the agency\u2019s interpretation of the hardship standard falls within the broad range authorized by the statute. <em>See Ramirez-Perez v. Ashcroft, </em>336 F.3d 1001, 1004-06 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; DENIED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b482-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
