We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review the agency\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion, <em>de Martinez v. Ashcroft, </em>374 F.3d 759, 761 (9th Cir.2004), and we grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-22\">Once Flores-Alvarenga established that his former counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance deprived him of the appellate process, he was entitled to a presumption of prejudice. <em>See Siong v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 1030, 1037 (9th Cir.2004). Although the presumption of prejudice is rebuttable, <em>Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 814, 826 (9th Cir.2003), no rebuttal evidence was presented here. Because the transcript of the removal hearing is not included in the administrative record, it is unclear how Flores-Alvarenga could have satisfied the BIA\u2019s additional requirement that he provide evidence that he would have prevailed on appeal. Accordingly, the BIA abused its discretion in dismissing FloresAlvarenga\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-23\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b489-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
