The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-20\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b641-21\">The IJ denied asylum on the basis of an adverse credibility determination. First, the IJ identified an inconsistency between Ahmed\u2019s declaration and his sworn testimony. This inconsistency is borne out in the record. In his declaration, Ahmed stated he had been interrogated by police for five hours and then held, while being beaten and tortured, for three days; at the hearing, he testified he was held for one night and one day, then interrogated and beaten for ten to fifteen minutes. This inconsistency goes to the heart of his claim and supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination because it involves the alleged persecution Ahmed suffered at the hands of police. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004). The IJ also observed that Ahmed\u2019s testimony was sketchy and lacking in detail. An alien\u2019s lack of specificity when testifying may support an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). Finally, the IJ relied on Ahmed\u2019s failure to provide easily available corroborative materials. Once an alien\u2019s credibility has been questioned, the IJ may consider an alien\u2019s failure to provide corroboration. <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1042 (9th Cir.2001). The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence and we are obliged to uphold it. <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1259 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-22\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b641-23\">Because Ahmed has failed to prove asylum eligibility, his claim for with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>holding of removal fails. <em>Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir.2001). Similarly, discounting his claim of past abuse, Ahmed has not demonstrated he would, more likely than not, be tortured if removed and has not shown he qualifies for relief under the Convention Against Torture. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Fa-rah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b641-18\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
