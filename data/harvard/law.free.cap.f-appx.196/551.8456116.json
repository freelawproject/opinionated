We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-23\">Petitioners have failed to address, and therefore have waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s determination that there was no error of law or fact in its prior order dismissing Petitioners\u2019 appeal as untimely. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. </em>INS, 94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived). We do not consider Petitioners\u2019 remaining arguments because their failure to timely file their notice of appeal before the BIA is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">We also do not consider the new evidence attached to Petitioners\u2019 opening brief. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A) (\u201cthe court of appeals shall decide the petition only on the administrative record on which the order of removal is based.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-25\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b575-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9 th Cir.
