Laurent, a Chapter 13 debt- or proceeding <em>pro se, </em>again appeals the district court\u2019s order relating to his motion to proceed with an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s Order Granting the Chapter 13 Trustee\u2019s Motion to Redirect Payment. We previously vacated the district court\u2019s dismissal order, which was based on the district court\u2019s understanding that it lacked jurisdiction. <em>See In re Laurent, </em>149 Fed.Appx. 833 (11th Cir. 2005) (not published). We held that the district court had jurisdiction to render a decision on Laurent\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we directed the district court to decide, on remand, whether or not to grant the debtor leave to proceed with an interlocutory appeal from the bankruptcy court. On remand, the district court denied leave to proceed. Laurent now appeals that decision. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-15\">The district court in a bankruptcy appeal functions as an appellate court in reviewing the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y v. Sublett, </em>895 F.2d 1381, 1383-84 (11th Cir.1990). District courts may grant leave to hear appeals of interlocutory orders entered by a bankruptcy judge. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a). \u201cBecause [28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) ] does not provide the district court any criteria for determining whether to exercise their discretionary authority to grant leave to appeal, the court[s] look[] to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) which governs discretionary interlocutory appeals from district courts to the court of appeals.\u201d <em>In re Charter Co., </em>778 F.2d 617, 620 n. 5 (11th Cir.1985). In order to obtain leave to proceed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b), a party must demonstrate that: (1) the order presents a controlling question of law; (2) over which there is a substantial ground for difference of opinion among courts; and (3) the immediate resolution of the issue would materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1047-16\">Here, the bankruptcy court\u2019s order granting the Trustee\u2019s motion to redirect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>payment and ordering that any remaining funds, including those returned from Bank Atlantic, be refunded to Laurent, did not meet the criteria warranting leave to file an interlocutory appeal. The order did not present any issue of controlling law over which there is disagreement among courts, but rather, it resolved the practical issue concerning to whom the Trustee should pay the funds she still held. Moreover, the order does not materially advance the outcome of the litigation. At the time of the order, the bankruptcy court had closed the case and discharged the Trustee, and Bank Atlantic, for whom the contested funds had been ear-marked, had rejected the funds. Finally, as noted by the district court, resolution on the merits of an appeal of the order to redirect funds would not grant Laurent the relief he sought: title to the guardianship property had already passed to the guardian, making the guardian the legal owner. Therefore, the district court did not err by denying leave to proceed with an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
