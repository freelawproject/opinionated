Rossin, federal prisoner # 87985-022, is serving a 240-month sentence for conspiracy to distribute marijuana. Rossin has appealed the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition challenging the method used by the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) to compute the good-time credit against his sentence authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-27\">Rossin contends that the BOP formula reduces his sentence by only 46 days of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>good-time credit for each year served, rather than the 54 days of credit specified by \u00a7 3624(b). Rossin argues that, although he is statutorily entitled to 1080 days of credit against his sentence for good behavior, he will receive only 941 days of sentence credit under the BOP formula.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Regardless whether Rossin\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) or his own, Rossin\u2019s release is not imminent. In light of the \u201ctemporally distant and speculative nature of [Rossin\u2019s] claim,\u201d he has failed to establish an \u201cimmediate injury\u201d that would be redressed by the relief that he seeks. <em>See Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, we conclude that Rossin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition is not ripe for review and dismiss the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b335-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
