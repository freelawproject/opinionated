First, he argues that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him based on a prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense that was not charged by the government, admitted by him, or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, he argues that the district court failed to consider adequately 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly subsection (a)(6), and violated his right to equal pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>tection by refusing to depart downward based on the sentencing disparity created by the existence of fast-track programs in other jurisdictions. Lastly, Wright argues that the district court improperly double-counted his prior conviction as part of his criminal history and as a sentencing enhancement factor, and imposed a sentence excessively disproportionate to his offense, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. We affirm Wright\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Wright\u2019s first contention is that the district court violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights when it enhanced his sentence based on a prior conviction for a drug trafficking offense because this offense was not charged by the government, admitted by Wright, or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Although Wright objected to application of the enhancement below, he did not specifically raise Fifth or Sixth Amendment claims, and we therefore review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d 1307, 1315 (11th Cir.) (per curiam), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 457,163 L.Ed.2d 347 (2005). We ask whether there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects substantial rights, and (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">Generally, an alien who has been previously deported or removed from the United States and thereafter reenters without permission faces a maximum imprisonment term of 2 years, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a), but an alien \u201cwhose removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony\u201d faces a 20 year maximum term of imprisonment. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1326(b)(2). The corresponding U.S. Sentencing Guidelines provide for a 16-level increase when the alien was \u201cpreviously deported ... after ... a conviction for a felony that is [ ] a drug trafficking offense for which the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months[.]\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)(i); <em>see United States v. Madera-Madera, </em>333 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.2003). A \u201c \u2018[d]rug trafficking offense\u2019 \u201d is \u201can offense under federal, state, or local law that prohibits ... the possession of a controlled substance (or a counterfeit substance) with intent to manufacture, import, export, distribute, or dispense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv). Here, the district court applied the 16-level enhancement based on Wright\u2019s 1993 conviction for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute in violation of federal law, an offense for which he was sentenced to, inter alia, 74 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-11\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe factual issue of whether a defendant has been convicted of an \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 for 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) enhancement purposes is not to be treated an element of the offense for constitutional purposes, and as a result the prior conviction is not required to be alleged in the indictment.\u201d <em>United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006). We have repeatedly held that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains valid law. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>410 F.3d at 1316 n. 3, for the proposition that the Supreme Court has not overruled <em>Almendarez-Torres). </em>Moreover, \u201c[p]ost<em>Booker, </em>this Court has reaffirmed that there is no Sixth Amendment violation when a district court enhances a sentence based on prior convictions, including those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).\u201d <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1276 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Although Wright asserts that the characterization of his 1993 conviction as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d was a matter involving \u201cdisputed fact findings\u201d by the district court, \u201cwe find no merit in [defendant\u2019s] argument that the Sixth Amendment requires that a jury, not a judge, must determine whether his prior conviction is within the category of offenses specified in \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A)[ ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1277 (citing <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1329 &amp; n. 4 (11th Cir.2005) and <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 24-26, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1262-63, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)); <em>cf. United States v. Gibson, </em>434 F.3d 1234, 1247 (11th Cir.) (\u201c[Wjhether Gibson\u2019s prior convictions were felonies involving a controlled substance is a question of law to be answered by the court, not a question of fact to be found by the jury.\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2911, 165 L.Ed.2d 931 (2006). Wright did not dispute the existence of his 1993 conviction for possession with intent to distribute (and accompanying 74-month sentence) at his sentencing hearing and, as indicated above, the Guidelines classify possession with intent to distribute as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d if the sentence imposed exceeded 13 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 cmt. n. 1(B)(iv). Accordingly, we find no error, much less plain error, in the district court\u2019s application of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) and \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">Wright also contends that the district court failed adequately to consider 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), particularly subsection (a)(6), and violated his right to equal protection, by refusing to depart downward based on the sentencing disparity created by the existence of fast-track programs in other jurisdictions. We review \u201c[i]ssues of constitutional law and statutory interpretation\u201d de novo, but review the sentence imposed for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (quotations and citations omitted). We review for plain error, however, the argument, raised for the first time on appeal, that the sentencing disparity between defendants prosecuted in fast-track participating districts and those in non-participating districts violates the defendant\u2019s equal protection rights. <em>Id. </em>at 1252-53.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">The fast-track departure provision of the Guidelines, \u00a7 5K3.1, is available to defendants who agree to the factual basis of the criminal charges against them and waive certain rights, but only in participating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>judicial districts. <em>See id. </em>at 1250-51. While 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6) requires the district court to consider \u201cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\u201d we held in <em>Castro </em>that \u201csection 3553(a)(6) does not require the district court to depart based on the availability of the [fast-track] departure in only some districts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1253. Furthermore, Wright cannot show plain error with respect to his equal protection claim, because he fails to identify any binding precedent holding that the limited availability of the fast-track departure violates equal protection. <em>See id. </em>at 1252-54. Thus, Wright has not carried \u201cthe burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). Indeed, the district court explicitly stated that it was considering \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a 60-month sentence, which was within the 57-71 month Guidelines range and one-fourth of the 20-year statutory maximum. <em>See United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (district courts do not need to discuss each \u00a7 3553(a) factor); <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>434 F.3d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.) (\u201ceasily\u201d concluding that sentence within the Guidelines range and almost one-third the length of the 20-year statutory maximum was not unreasonable), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2946, 165 L.Ed.2d 976 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">Finally, Wright argues that the district court improperly double-counted his prior conviction as part of his criminal history and as a sentencing enhancement factor, thereby imposing a sentence excessively disproportionate to his offense, in violation of the Eighth Amendment. As with Wright\u2019s equal protection claim, his mere citation to <em>Galvez-Barrios </em>and the district court\u2019s comment that <em>Galvez-Barrios </em>addressed fast-track sentencing disparities did not preserve Wright\u2019s double-counting or Eighth Amendment objections. <em>See Massey, </em>443 F.3d at 819. Accordingly, we review these claims for plain error. <em>See id. </em>at 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">We have upheld, against a due process/equal protection challenge, double counting a defendant\u2019s prior conviction both as part of his criminal history and as a sentencing enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2. <em>See United States v. Adeleke, </em>968 F.2d 1159, 1161 (11th Cir.1992) (\u201cThe Commission clearly intended prior felonies to count against defendants under both the criminal history section and \u00a7 2L1.2, ... and this result is permissible because of the divergent policies [supporting each factor].\u201d); <em>United States v. Huang, </em>977 F.2d 540, 544-45 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (\u201cThe upward departure of the base offense level reflected the seriousness of Huang\u2019s crime, given his admitted smuggling of aliens on at least ten occasions; the criminal history adjustment indicated an attempt by the sentencing judge to deter Huang from future smuggling activity.\u201d); <em>Martinez, </em>434 F.3d at 1323 n. 4 (rejecting double-counting challenge where defendant\u2019s prior convictions were used both to increase his base offense level under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) and to determine his criminal history points). Thus, circuit precedent forecloses Wright\u2019s double counting claim. Furthermore, Wright cannot prove plain error with respect to his Eighth Amendment and disproportionate sentence arguments, given that: (1) the double-counting was permissible; (2) Wright has not established that his sentence is unreasonable; and (3) he has failed to identify any precedent holding that the fast-track disparity or double-counting result in a sentence that violates the Eighth Amendment. <em>See United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number><em>States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1024 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (threshold question in Eighth Amendment cases is whether sentence imposed is grossly disproportionate to the offense committed).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error, and therefore affirm Wright\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b838-8\">. Even if our review of this issue was de novo, it would not change the outcome of our analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-7\">. Wright\u2019s argument that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>does not apply to his case is without merit because nothing in that decision indicates that a defendant must admit to the prior conviction before or during the acceptance of his guilty plea. <em>See Almendarez-Torres, </em>523 U.S. at 248, 118 S.Ct. at 1233. Moreover, we note that Wright was in fact charged with violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), which clearly states that an alien \"whose removal was subsequent to a <em>conviction for commission of an aggravated felony\u201d </em>faces a term of imprisonment not to exceed 20 years, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2) (emphasis added), and Wright acknowledged at his plea hearing that he faced a 20-year statutory maximum sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b839-13\">. Assuming that, at sentencing, the combination of Wright's mere citation to <em>United States v. Galvez-Barrios, </em>355 F.Supp.2d 958 (E.D.Wis.2005) \u2014 which was not an equal protection decision \u2014 and the district court's statement that the holding in <em>Galvez-Barrios </em>concerned the disparity\u2019s relevance under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553, was sufficient to preserve Wright\u2019s \u00a7 3553(a)(6) argument for appeal, it did not, contrary to Wright\u2019s contention, preserve his equal protection argument. <em>See United States v. Massey, </em>443 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
