Because we agree that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine precluded review by the bankruptcy court of the underlying state judgments, we exercise our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) to affirm. For the reasons discussed herein, we also grant the Chapels\u2019 motion for attorneys fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">The dispute between Derringer and his neighbors, the Chapels, dates back more than a decade and stems from the parties\u2019 water rights in Harris Creek in Catron County, New Mexico. In an earlier order and judgment disposing of several related appeals by Derringer and his wife, Susan Nevitt, we included a detailed recitation of the facts of the various state and federal district court proceedings concerning the parties\u2019 dispute. <em>See Derringer v. Chapel, </em>98 Fed.Appx. 728 (10th Cir.2004). We will not recount those facts here, except as necessary to explain the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders under review.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">In 2004, the Chapels attempted to foreclose on Derringer\u2019s property in an effort to satisfy certain state court judgments they obtained against him in 1996, 2001, and 2003. To forestall foreclosure, on October 6, 2004, Derringer filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. The bankruptcy court sent notice of the filing to all of Derringer\u2019s creditors, including the Chapels, on October 8, 2004. The day before the notice was sent, however, the Chapels\u2019 attorney mailed an Amended Notice of Sale to the state court concerning Derringer\u2019s property. Derringer claimed that the act of mailing the Amended Notice of Sale constituted a willful violation of the automatic stay in effect pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362. Accordingly, on October 18, 2004, he filed a \u201cMotion to Take Judicial Notice and Request for Relief, and Motion for Permanent Restraining Order Against Mick Chapel, Jennifer Chapel, and Joseph Manges\u201d (First Motion) (Bankr.docket nos. 4 and 5), arguing that the Chapels had willfully violated the automatic stay. On November 18, 2004, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying the First Motion to the extent it sought injunctive or equitable relief, holding that such relief could only be obtained through an adversary proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">On December 27, 2004, Derringer filed \u201cDebtor David Derringer\u2019s Motion to Take Judicial Notice and Objection to Enforcement of Chapels\u2019 Unconstitutional Claims of Debt\u201d (Second Motion). Bankr.docket no. 85. In the Second Motion, he argued that an injunction that the Chapels obtained against him in state court in 1996 and the subsequent judgments to enforce it were invalid. He requested the following relief from the bankruptcy court: (1) that it take judicial notice of his rights, privileges and immunities under the Constitution and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1982; (2) that it take judicial notice of various criminal conspiracies involving the Chapels and others in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 241; (3) that it hold the Chapels\u2019 judgments unenforceable; (4) that it consider an FBI investigation into the Chapels; and (5) that it consider its own duties under Code of Judicial Conduct Canon 3(D)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-14\">On February 2, 2005, the bankruptcy court entered an order denying the remainder of Derringer\u2019s First Motion and his Second Motion in its entirety. It found that Derringer had failed to show that the Chapels\u2019 violation of the automatic stay was willful as required by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(h). With respect to his Second Motion, the court concluded that res judicata and the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> barred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>review of the underlying state court injunction and subsequent judgments to enforce it.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">On February 11, 2005, Derringer filed what the court construed as a motion for reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59 (Rule 59 Motion). He argued (1) that the res judicata and <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrines were inapplicable because he was not a party to the original lawsuit giving rise to the Chapels\u2019 judgments against him; (2) that the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to enforce the Chapels\u2019 illegal judgments; and (3) that the bankruptcy court had jurisdiction to provide him relief from the Chapels\u2019 judgments. The court denied Derringer\u2019s Rule 59 Motion in an order dated March 2, 2005, finding that the motion failed to raise any errors of law or fact and did not present any newly discovered evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Derringer then filed a notice of appeal before the BAP seeking review of the bankruptcy court\u2019s orders denying his Second Motion and Rule 59 Motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a thorough and well-reasoned order and judgment, 2005 WL 2216327, dated September 6, 2005, the BAP concluded that the issues raised in Derringer\u2019s appeal were identical to those decided in prior state court actions where Derringer or his privy had been a party. Accordingly, it held that res judicata prevented Derringer from relitigating issues that were or could have been raised in the state court proceedings, and that the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine prevented the bankruptcy court from considering the validity of the Chapels\u2019 judgments. It also affirmed the denial of his Rule 59 Motion, holding that he failed to raise any new issues that would qualify as grounds for altering or amending the bankruptcy court\u2019s order. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b647-12\">\u201cOn appeal from BAP decisions, we independently review the bankruptcy court\u2019s decision. We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s legal determinations <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d <em>In re Commercial Fin. Servs., Inc., </em>427 F.3d 804, 810 (10th Cir.2005) (quotations and citations omitted). Having reviewed the entire record on appeal, we see no error in either of the bankruptcy court\u2019s challenged orders. The relief sought by Derringer in his Second Motion was clearly beyond the bankruptcy court\u2019s power to grant, which should have been obvious to him given the long list of court opinions devoted to explaining why the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine bars his federal claims against the Chapels. His Rule 59 Motion was likewise without merit. Therefore, for the reasons stated in the BAP\u2019s order and judgment, dated September 6, 2005, we affirm the bankruptcy court\u2019s February 2, 2005, order denying Derringer\u2019s requested relief, and its March 2, 2005, order denying his Rule 59 Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">CHAPELS\u2019 MOTION FOR DAMAGES, COSTS AND ATTORNEYS\u2019 FEES</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We now turn to the Chapels\u2019 motion for sanctions against Derringer, including attorneys\u2019 fees and double costs incurred in defending this appeal pursuant to Rule 38 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure. Rule 38 \u201cauthorizes a court of appeals to award just damages, including attorney\u2019s fees, and single or double costs if the court determines that an appeal is frivolous or brought for the purposes of delay. An appeal is frivolous when the result is obvious, or the appellant\u2019s arguments of error are wholly without merit.\u201d <em>Braley v. Campbell, </em>832 F.2d 1504, 1510 (10th Cir.1987) (citation and quotation omitted). Under this standard, an award of damages is appropriate here. In our April 12, 2004, order and judgment, we included the following language to warn Derringer of the consequences of filing future frivolous appeals seeking to invalidate the state court judgments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-6\">As we have noted above, the filings before this court by both Susan Nevitt and David Derringer have been filled with factually unsupported, outrageous, scandalous, and vituperative accusations against the parties, including judges of the New Mexico courts, and against the federal district court judge who presided over two of these cases. In addition, the briefs by Nevitt and Derringer have made no attempt to comply with the requirements of Fed. RApp. P. 28 or 10th Cir. R. 28. Derringer has also papered this court with motions, many of which seek relief that is clearly beyond this court\u2019s power to grant. This court will not countenance such conduct. Accordingly, Derringer and Nevitt are hereby warned that if they continue this type of misconduct in these or future appeals before this court, they may be subject to sanctions under this court\u2019s inherent powers to control its docket and under 10th Cir. R. 46.5 and 46.6. These sanctions could include, among other things, monetary sanctions, dismissal of their appeal(s), and future filing restrictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-8\"><em>Derringer, </em>98 Fed.Appx. at 739. We later ordered Derringer to pay the attorneys\u2019 fees incurred by the Chapels and the various judges who were forced to defend his numerous frivolous appeals. And yet, Derringer chose once again to appeal a federal court order denying his request to overturn the Chapels\u2019 state court judgments \u2014 relief that was clearly beyond the court\u2019s power to grant. Since the instant appeal, like those before it, is patently frivolous, multiplicitous, and vexatious, an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and double costs is appropriate under Fed. R.App. P. 38. We therefore remand this case to the bankruptcy court for the limited purposes of determining the amount of fees and costs to be paid by Derringer to the Chapels.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-9\">The BAP\u2019s order and judgment is AFFIRMED, and the case is REMANDED to the bankruptcy court for a determination of the Chapels\u2019 fees and costs. Derringer\u2019s motion to proceed in forma pauperis is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b645-17\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-8\">. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, which takes its names from two United States Supreme Court cases <em>(Rooker v.
