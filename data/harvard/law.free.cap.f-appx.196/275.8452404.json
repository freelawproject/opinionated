He argues that the district court violated the spirit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number><em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it sentenced him after appearing to disagree with the Guidelines and that the district court mistakenly believed that the Guidelines were mandatory. He also argues that the enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in the light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Rodriguez-Santos did not raise his argument concerning the mandatory application of the Guidelines in the district court. Therefore, his sentence is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005); <em>see also United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006). Even if the district court believed it was bound by the Guidelines, Rodr\u00edguez-Santos has not shown he would have received a more lenient sentence otherwise. Therefore, Rodr\u00edguezSantos has failed to demonstrate plain error. <em>See United States v. Robles-Vertiz, </em>442 F.3d 350, 353 (5th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(May 30, 2006) (No. 05-11285).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Rodriguez-Santos\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Rodr\u00edguez-Santos contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
