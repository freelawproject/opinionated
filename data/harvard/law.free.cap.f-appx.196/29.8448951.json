We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">Where the BIA affirms summarily, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum, v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004). Nonetheless, \u201cthe fact that the [agency] has relied primarily on credibility grounds in dismissing an asylum application cannot insulate the decision from review.\u201d <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 178 (2d Cir.2004). An adverse credibility determination must be based on \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d that \u201cbear a legitimate nexus\u201d to the finding. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">The adverse credibility finding rested on three bases: (1) petitioner\u2019s inconsistency over whether he was wearing clothes while fording a river to escape capture, (2) the implausibility that petitioner kept his identification card dry or intact throughout his escape, and (3) a contradiction in dates between petitioner\u2019s testimony and a document entitled \u201cAttestation of Marriage.\u201d The first two grounds were unreasonable bases for the adverse credibility finding: (1) Musenge had consistently stated that he wore shorts while crossing the river (describing his outfit as \u201cno clothes ... shorts only\u201d); and (2) the assumption that the identification card would have been visibly damaged by the water is based on pure speculation. The third basis for the adverse credibility finding, however, is supported by the record: Petitioner claimed to request the marriage certificate in November 1996, while the document reflects issuance in August 1996. This inconsistency is serious, and goes to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim: Petitioner repeatedly claimed to have been imprisoned for eight months, and only thereafter to have requested a copy of his marriage certificate. The issuance of this document three months before the end of petitioner\u2019s purported jail time undermines his claim to ever have been imprisoned. Upon a combination of erroneous and error-free findings, we ask whether \u201cwe can state with confidence that the IJ would adhere to his decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>were the petition remanded.\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 161 (2d Cir.2006). We cannot so state with confidence, but a remand to the IJ may be obviated depending on the BIA\u2019s clarification of an issue of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Protected Ground</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">To be eligible for asylum as a refugee under the INA, an applicant must demonstrate an inability or unwillingness to return to his home country \u201cbecause of persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or [as Musenge claims] <em>political opinion.\u201d </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42) (emphasis added). The BIA has held that an applicant must produce either direct or circumstantial evidence from which it is reasonable to conclude that the harm suffered or feared by the applicant is motivated, at least in part, by an actual or imputed ground. <em>Matter of S-P-, </em>21 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 486, 494 (BIA 1996). Here, petitioner presented testimony that \u2014 if credible \u2014 would tend to show that petitioner was persecuted because of political opinions of his family members. The interrogation described by petitioner reflects a concern with the whereabouts and opinions of petitioner\u2019s brothers and father, but reflects no interest in petitioner\u2019s own political opinions. <em>See </em>Appx. at 169 (\u201cThey ... started to telling me that ... we don\u2019t trust you, and your father and your brother is working for the government, so you\u2019re going to tell us the truth. <em>Where is your brothers?\u201d </em>(emphasis added)); Appx. at 174 (\u201cThey were asking me [because] .... my brother is a soldier, I know, <em>so I know the secrets </em>of [Mobutu].\u201d (emphasis added)). All of these lines of inquiry stress concern with petitioner\u2019s family, without focus on petitioner\u2019s actual or imputed beliefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">This narrative raises a novel question: whether an applicant who is persecuted because of the political opinions of close relatives \u2014 or, in an effort to inflict persecution on those close relatives \u2014 can claim asylum on the basis of persecution for political opinion, absent evidence of persecution on the basis of petitioner\u2019s own actual or imputed political beliefs. In other words, is asylum available to an applicant who suffers persecution brought about by the political opinions of another, even if those opinions are not imputed to the applicant?</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">This issue raises a question of statutory construction: whether the persecution allegedly suffered was motivated by \u201cpolitical opinion\u201d per the meaning of the statute. \u2018Where (as here) the BIA has yet to decide whether a group, a thing, or a situation falls within the ambit of a statutory term, the proper course is for the reviewing court to remand the matter to the BIA in accordance with the well-worn ordinary remand rule.\u201d <em>Ucelo-Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 180, 186 (2d Cir.2006). We therefore vacate and remand to the BIA for consideration of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is GRANTED, the BIA\u2019s May 2004 order is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this decision, including (if necessary) remand to the IJ for further fact-finding. The petition for review of the BIA\u2019s March 2005 decision is DISMISSED as moot. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>late Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(d)(1).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
