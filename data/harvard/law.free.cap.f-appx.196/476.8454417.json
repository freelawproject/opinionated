Mattel Inc., </em>113 Fed.Appx. 272 (9th Cir.2004). Initially, we reversed the district court for using an improper standard of review and provided instructions to enforce the arbitration award unless grounds for not doing so existed under either 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 11. <em>Id. </em>at 272. On remand, the district court again failed to enforce the arbitration award, this time because it was \u201cimplausible.\u201d Implausibility is not a valid ground for avoiding an arbitration award under either 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-24\">Although the arbitrator\u2019s assessment of the merits in this case contains possible errors of law, those errors are not a sufficient basis for a federal court to overrule an arbitration award. <em>See Employers Ins. of Wausau v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, </em>933 F.2d 1481, 1486 (9th Cir.1991) (\u2018We may not predicate reversal on ... erroneous findings of fact or conclusions of law.\u201d); <em>see also Hawaii Teamsters and Allied Workers Union, Local 996 v. United Parcel Serv., </em>241 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cOur task <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>is, in essence, to review the procedural soundness of the arbitral decision, not its substantive merit.\u201d). Furthermore, it cannot be said that the arbitrator\u2019s decision in this case is \u201ccompletely irrational.\u201d <em>See Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs. Inc., </em>341 F.3d 987, 997 (9th Cir.2003) (en banc) (construing 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 10(a)(4), the only subsection of either 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 11 that could conceivably apply to the arbitration award in this case). Thus, we remand the case to the district court with instructions to enforce the original arbitration award and declare Mattel the prevailing party. The district court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees in favor of Hall Street is also reversed and the district court should determine the attorneys\u2019 fees and costs due to Mattel under the arbitration agreement.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b502-5\">GRABER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AQc\">dissenting:</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">I respectfully dissent because, although the majority correctly identifies the governing legal principles, I conclude that the arbitrator\u2019s decision was completely irrational.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">Paragraph 12(a) of the Lease provides, as relevant here, that \u201cTenant shall comply with all federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in its use of the Premises.\u201d Paragraph 12(c) of the Lease provides that the tenant shall not be held liable for certain items \u201c[t]o the extent Tenant has been in compliance with applicable environmental laws.\u201d In context, the only rational reading of the phrase \u201capplicable environmental laws\u201d in Paragraph 12(c) is as shorthand for \u201call federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations in [Tenant\u2019s] use of the Premises,\u201d the longhand description just given in Paragraph 12(a). That is, any environmental law with which the tenant was required to comply in its use of the premises was \u201capplicable\u201d within the meaning of Paragraph 12 as a whole. Paragraph 12(b) confirms the necessity of interpreting \u201capplicable\u201d in this way because it provides that the tenant \u201cassumes all responsibility for the investigation and cleanup\u201d of any hazardous waste on the premises and that the tenant is liable for, and must indemnify the landlord for, all costs resulting directly or indirectly from the \u201cpresence\u201d of any hazardous waste on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">This understanding of Paragraph 12 arises not only from the words and structure of the Lease, but also from the arbitrator\u2019s own findings as to the parties\u2019 intent. The arbitrator found that Mattel agreed to a comprehensive indemnification of Hall Street, irrespective of the time of the occurrence that resulted in the presence of hazardous wastes on the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">It is undisputed that the statute in question here is an \u201cenvironmental law.\u201d The arbitrator\u2019s conclusion that the statute was not \u201capplicable\u201d is completely irrational in view of (a) the clear meaning of Paragraph 12 and (b) the undisputed facts that Mattel failed to test the water supply for eighteen years even though the statute required it to have done so, resulting in Mattel\u2019s signing of a consent order with the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Quality.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">Accordingly, I would either affirm the decision of the district court (albeit on different grounds) or remand the case for reconsideration under the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
