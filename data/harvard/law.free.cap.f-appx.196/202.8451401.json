Yaitsky appeals, contending the district court abused its discretion when it denied her motion to suppress audio recordings that were surreptitiously made by Igors Smolakovs, who was employed by Yaitsky. In the tapes, Yaitsky discussed the murder for hire plot.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-25\">We review the admission of a tape recording for abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Capers, </em>61 F.3d 1100, 1106 (4th Cir.1995). The district court\u2019s determination that the proffered tape was made for a legitimate purpose is reviewed for clear error. <em>See Traficant v. Commissioner, </em>884 F.2d 258, 266 (6th Cir.1989). To withstand clear error analysis, the district court\u2019s determination of facts underlying the findings must be supported by a pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Crump, </em>120 F.3d 462, 468 (4th Cir.1997). Yaitsky contends the district court denied her motion to suppress the audio tapes in violation of the applicable federal statute, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-5\">It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person not acting under color of law to intercept a wire, oral, or electronic communication where such person is a party to the communication or where one of the parties to the communication has given prior consent to such interception unless such communication is intercepted for the purpose of committing any criminal or tortious act in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States or any State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(d) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">Yaitsky contends Smolakovs and his associate made and turned over the recordings to the Government for a criminal or tortious purpose \u2014 namely, as part of a plot to \u201cscam\u201d Yaitsky and assume her business interests while she was incarcerated for the murder for hire plot. The district court rejected this argument in denying Yaitsky\u2019s suppression motion, finding it was speculative, as it was premised primarily on a single sentence contained in the summary of an FBI interview with Smolakovs.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">In assessing the purpose of the interception, courts look to the intended use of the recording. <em>In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., </em>216 F.3d 621, 626 (7th Cir.2000). It is the intended use of the recordings that determines a violation of the Act, not whether the taping itself violates a state law. <em>See id. </em>at 625; <em>Sussman v. American Broadcasting Cos., </em>186 F.3d 1200, 1202-03 (9th Cir.1999). We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Smolakovs\u2019 determinative purpose in recording the conversations was to document Yaitsky\u2019s plot and report it to the Government; any benefit to Smolakovs from Yaitsky\u2019s anticipated incarceration for her illegal conduct does not alter this conclusion. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 2511(2)(d), his purpose for making the tapes was neither criminal nor tortious. <em>See In re High Fructose Corn Syrup Antitrust Litig., </em>216 F.3d at 626 (citing cases holding that making recordings with a purpose of gathering evidence of a violation of law is not criminal or tortious).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
