On appeal, Brooks asserts that the district court erred by applying a two-level upward adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.2 (2004), for reckless endangerment during flight. He also asserts that the court erred by refusing to award a downward adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">In a <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>sentencing, such as this, a district court must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2006), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (citations omitted). In reviewing the calculation of the advisory sentencing guideline range, this court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-13\">Brooks asserts on appeal that the district court erred in failing to apply a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to apply an acceptance of responsibility downward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-14\">Brooks also challenges the district court\u2019s application of the upward adjustment for reckless endangerment during flight. He contends that he did not create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury because there was no high-speed pursuit, there was only minimal property damage from his backing into an officer\u2019s unmarked vehicle, and no one was injured. Because Brooks challenges the application of the reckless endangerment adjustment to the undisputed facts of his case, our review is de novo. <em>See Hampton, </em>441 F.3d at 287; <em>United States v. Butner, </em>277 F.3d 481, 487-88 (4th Cir.2002) (reviewing de novo legal ruling based upon undisputed facts). After thoroughly reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>record on appeal, we are convinced that the adjustment was warranted. <em>See United States v. Galvan, </em>407 F.3d 954, 957-58 (8th Cir.) (upholding upward adjustment under \u00a7 3C1.2 where officers pursued defendant into residential neighborhood, and defendant abruptly made U-turn and drove his car close to officers approaching on foot), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 497, 163 L.Ed.2d 376 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Accordingly, we affirm Brooks\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\"> <em>United.
