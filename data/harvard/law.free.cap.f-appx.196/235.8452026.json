Flores, Texas inmate # 855743, appeals the dismissal of his in forma pauperis complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). In his complaint, Flores claimed that defendants Cecilia Okoye, Dr. Robert Victoria, Lucy Martinez, Eugene Trotter, Dr. Maximiliano Herrera, Ahla Shabaaz, and Rochelle McKinney were deliberately indifferent to his serious medical needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">Flores maintains that the defendants have refused to treat him for Hepatitis C even though a physician at a hospital in Galveston, Texas, has recommended such treatment. He contends that the refusal to treat him for Hepatitis C, which is based on an analysis of his enzyme level, constitutes deliberate indifference.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">A doctor\u2019s failure to follow the advice of another doctor suggests nothing more than a difference in opinion as to the appropriate method of treatment under the circumstances, and is not evidence of deliberate indifference. <em>See Stewart v. Murphy, </em>174 F.3d 530, 535 (5th Cir.1999). Flores has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in dismissing his action as frivolous. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999). To the extent that Flores pleaded other grounds for his deliberate indifference claims, he has abandoned the claims by falling to brief them on appeal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993)</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Flores also contends that his case should be remanded to the district court so that he can add new factual allegations. Flores wishes to allege that the defendants are violating the policy of the Texas Department of Corrections by confining him in administrative segregation and that the defendants have, at times, failed to keep in stock medication prescribed by a rheumatologist and have on other occasions can-celled his medications or reduced his dosage. Because no viable constitutional claim can be perceived with regard to the underlying facts, the district court\u2019s error, if any, in failing to give Flores notice and an opportunity to amend his complaint was harmless. <em>See Jones v. Greninger, </em>188 F.3d 322, 327 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Bazrowx v. Scott, </em>136 F.3d 1053, 1054 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-13\">The district court\u2019s dismissal of Flores\u2019s action as frivolous counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387 (5th Cir.1996). Flores is hereby cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be allowed to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-14\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b260-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
