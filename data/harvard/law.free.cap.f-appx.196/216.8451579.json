Dismissing all other claims, this court granted a certificate of appealability on a single claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in which Robertson alleged that he was denied the right to a direct appeal when counsel failed to comply with his request to file a notice of appeal. For the reasons that follow, we now vacate the district court\u2019s order to the extent that it denied relief on this claim and remand for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-12\">Robertson pled guilty to conspiracy to distribute a variety of drugs in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 (2000). The district court adopted the plea agreement\u2019s recommendation and sentenced him to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment. Robertson did not appeal. In his \u00a7 2255 motion, signed under penalty of perjury, Robertson claims that he told his attorney that he wished to appeal but that counsel failed to comply with his request. Counsel stated under oath that he has no recollection of Robertson\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-14\">In order to establish a Sixth Amendment violation based on counsel\u2019s failure to appeal, Robertson must prove that (1) counsel was ineffective and (2) but for counsel\u2019s ineffectiveness, an appeal would have been filed. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 476-77, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000). Counsel\u2019s failure to file a notice of appeal when requested to do so is per se ineffective assistance. <em>United States v. Peak, </em>992 F.2d 39, 42 (4th Cir.1993). In light of Robertson\u2019s claim, under penalty of perjury, that counsel denied his request to file an appeal, coupled with counsel\u2019s lack of memory, there is a genuine issue of material fact concerning whether Robertson was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">Accordingly, we vacate the portion of the district court\u2019s order denying relief on this claim and remand for the limited purpose of permitting the district court to conduct further proceedings to resolve this issue. The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court. We deny Robertson\u2019s motion to appoint counsel. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">\n<em>VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
