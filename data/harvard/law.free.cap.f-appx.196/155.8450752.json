Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Sutton v. Farford, </em>No. CA-04-900-5 (E.D.N.C. filed July 18, 2006; entered July 22, 2006). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b180-12\"> To the extent Sutton seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s prior order dismissing his complaint as frivolous, we are without jurisdiction to consider his arguments because his notice of appeal was untimely as to that order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
