We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">Marquez contends that the district court\u2019s condition of supervised release requiring her to report to the probation officer within 72 hours of reentry into the United States violates the Fifth Amendment. This contention is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Rodriguez, </em>441 F.3d 767, 772-73 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">However, because Marquez was sentenced under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, and we cannot reliably determine from the record whether the sentence imposed would have been materially different had the district court known that the Guidelines were advisory, we remand to the district court to answer that question, and to proceed pursuant to <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073, 1084 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc). <em>See United States v. Moreno-Hernandez, </em>419 F.3d 906, 916 (9th Cir.2005) (extending <em>Ameline\u2019s </em>limited remand procedure to cases involving non-constitutional error under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b516-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
