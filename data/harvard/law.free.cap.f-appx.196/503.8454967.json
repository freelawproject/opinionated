R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b528-5\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">Alexander Akopian, a native of Azerbaijan and citizen of Armenia, petitions for review of the denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal and protection under the Convention Against Torture by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">The BIA adopted and affirmed the findings of the IJ without opinion. We review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination for substantial evidence and will reverse only if the record compels a contrary conclusion. <em>Ge v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1121, 1124 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found Akopian failed to establish either past persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a) (granting Attorney General discretion to grant asylum status to alien refugees); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (defining \u201crefugee\u201d as an alien who is unable or unwilling to return to his or her country of origin \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\u201c[P]ersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d <em>Ghaly v. INS, </em>58 F.3d 1425, 1431 (9th Cir.1995). Akopian\u2019s five-day detainment while under investigation for murder does not compel a finding of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Tarubac v. INS, </em>182 F.3d 1114, 1118 (9th Cir.1999) (finding persecution where petitioner had been harassed by members of a violent, revolutionary group in her home; threatened with death; kidnaped; blindfolded and held for three days without food; and repeatedly harassed after escape); <em>Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 340 (9th Cir.1995) (affirming BIA\u2019s denial of asylum where petitioner had been arrested, kicked and beaten by police and detained for a day). Though official retaliation for whistleblowing may amount to persecution, the record here does not compel such a conclusion. <em>See Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">Akopian also testified to instances of discrimination based on his inability to speak Armenian which neither rise to the level of persecution nor took place on account of a protected ground. Akopian suffered no alleged persecution during the last three years he lived in Armenia and his wife and children remain in Armenia.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">Cumulatively or severally, these incidents do not compel a finding of persecution. <em>See Chand v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1066, 1074 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">The standard for withholding of removal is stricter than that for asylum. <em>Prasad, </em>47 F.3d at 340. Because the asylum petition fails, Akopian\u2019s petition for withholding of removal fails as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-15\">Akopian\u2019s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture also fails. Akopian has not established that it is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d that he will be the victim of a \u201cparticularized threat\u201d of torture if he returns to Armenia. <em>See Lanza v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 917, 935-36 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>(9th Cir.2004); <em>Kamalthas v. INS, </em>251 F.3d 1279, 1283 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b528-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
