On appeal, Johnson asserts that the district court erred by applying a two-level upward adjustment under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.2 (2004), for reckless endangerment during flight, and that the court erred by refusing to award a downward adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3E1.1 for acceptance of responsibility. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">In a <em>post-Booker </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> sentencing like Johnson\u2019s, a district court must calculate the applicable guideline range after making the appropriate findings of fact, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp. 2006), and impose a sentence. <em>United States v. Moreland, </em>437 F.3d 424, 432 (4th Cir.) (citing <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 546 (4th Cir.2005)), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2054, 164 L.Ed.2d 804 (2006). The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546-47 (citations omitted). In reviewing the calculation of the advisory sentencing guideline range, this court \u201creview[s] the district court\u2019s legal conclusions <em>de novo </em>and its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Hampton, </em>441 F.3d 284, 287 (4th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Johnson asserts on appeal that the district court erred in failing to apply a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility for clear error. <em>United States v. May, </em>359 F.3d 683, 688 (4th Cir.2004) (citing <em>United States v. Ruhe, </em>191 F.3d 376, 388 (4th Cir.1999)). Our review of the record convinces us that the district court did not clearly err in refusing to apply an acceptanee of responsibility downward adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">Johnson also challenges the district court\u2019s application of the upward adjustment for reckless endangerment during flight. He contends that his flight from police was not reckless because he was merely a passenger in the car that hit an officer\u2019s unmarked vehicle and there was no evidence that he knew his co-defendant would hit the officer\u2019s car. Because Johnson challenges the application of the reckless endangerment adjustment to the undisputed facts of his case, our review is de novo. <em>See Hampton, </em>441 F.3d at 287; <em>United States v. Butner, </em>277 F.3d 481, 487-88 (4th Cir.2002) (reviewing de novo legal ruling based upon undisputed facts).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-10\">An adjustment under \u00a7 3C1.2 is warranted \u201c[i]f the defendant recklessly created a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another person in the course of fleeing from a law enforcement officer....\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.2. In making this determination, the normal scope of relevant conduct described in USSG \u00a7 1B1.3 is narrowed by USSG \u00a7 3C1.2 cmt. n. 5. A defendant \u201cis accountable only for his own conduct and for conduct that he aided or abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused.\u201d USSG \u00a7 3C1.2 cmt. n. 5. Because Application Note 5 to \u00a7 3C1.2 \u201climits the defendant\u2019s responsibility for the actions of another,\u201d this court has held that \u201csome form of direct or active participation\u201d on the part of the defendant is necessary for \u00a7 3C1.2 to apply when the reckless flight is the result of another person\u2019s action. <em>United States v. Chong, </em>285 F.3d 343, 346 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-11\">Assuming, without deciding, that the district court may have erred in applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the two-level upward adjustment under USSG \u00a7 3C1.2, we find that any error is harmless. Without the \u00a7 3C1.2 adjustment, Johnson\u2019s total offense level would have been thirty-six. With a criminal history category of III, the applicable advisory guideline range would have been 235 to 293 months of imprisonment. Johnson\u2019s 292-month sentence falls within that range. <em>See United States v. Mashek, </em>406 F.3d 1012, 1017 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]here may be situations where an error in calculating the appropriate guidelines range is harmless and, therefore, does not require immediate remand[,] [such as] where the resulting sentence lies in the overlap between the correct and incorrect guidelines ranges.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s sentence. We deny the motion to relieve counsel and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\"> <em>United States v.
