Evans appeals his sentence, arguing that, because the district court accepted sentence enhancements recommended in the presentence report, his sentence was longer than the maximum authorized by the facts found by the jury and was thus imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The probation officer recommended five enhancements under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2G2.2 (2003). Evans made no objection to the presentence report, but raised a general Blakely<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> objection at the sentencing hearing. The district court noted his objection, adopted the presentence report, imposed a sentence of 246 months imprisonment, and then stated, \u201cShould the sentencing guidelines be deemed nonbinding or unconstitutional, then I impose this sentence under 18 United States Code Section 3553.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Because Evans preserved his Sixth Amendment claim, it is reviewed for harmless error. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 268, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The government bears the burden of showing beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Mackins, </em>315 F.3d 399, 405 (4th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-10\">Even if the grand jury\u2019s special findings attached to the superseding indictment authorized the enhancements under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(1), (b)(2)(B), (b)(3), and (b)(5), the jury verdict did not authorize the enhancement under \u00a7 2G2.2(b)(6)(D) for over 600 images or the obstruction of justice adjustment. Therefore, the parties are correct that Sixth Amendment error occurred. However, because the district court stated that it would impose an identical alternative sentence under \u00a7 3553 if the guidelines were determined to be nonbinding or unconstitutional, the government has met its burden of showing that the Sixth Amendment error was harmless. <em>United States v. Shatley, </em>448 F.3d 264, 267 (4th Cir.2006). The district court followed this court\u2019s recommendation in <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1097, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005), the alternative sentence was within the range recommended by the sentencing guidelines, and this court takes the district court at its word when it states that it would impose the same sentence under an advisory guidelines system. <em>Shatley, </em>448 F.3d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-11\">We therefore affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b219-7\">. The indictment and judgment and commitment order state that Evans was convicted under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2252(A).
