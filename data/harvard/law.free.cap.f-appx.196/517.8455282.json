To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>see Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reconsider because the motion failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision denying their motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1), (c)(1); <em>SocopGonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-24\">We lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s March 31, 2004 order denying Petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen, and its January 28, 2004 order affirming the immigration judge\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>denial of relief, because Petitioners failed to timely petition this court for review of those decisions. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1258 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b541-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
