Shah, a Shiite Muslim, asserts that he fears returning to Pakistan because he was attacked and threatened by Sipah-e-Sihaba-Pakistan, an anti-Shiite organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Shah did not establish that the Pakistani government was unable or unwilling to control Sipah-e-Sihaba Pakistan. The Pakistani government banned Sipah-e-Sihaba Pakistan in 2002, closed many of its offices, and arrested some of its members. Moreover, the Pakistani police responded in a timely manner to each of Shah\u2019s encounters with members of the organization and made arrests or detained the perpetrators when identified. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 968 (9th Cir.1998)</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">Because Shah did not establish eligibility for asylum, it follows that he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir.2003). Shah made no argument in his opening brief regarding the denial of CAT relief, and so has waived the right to challenge this determination. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
