(\u201cSears\u201d). We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Sears.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-25\">Under Alaska law, insurance policies are construed \u201cto give effect to the insured\u2019s reasonable expectations.\u201d <em>C.P. ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>M.L. v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>996 P.2d 1216, 1222 (Alaska 2000). The insured\u2019s reasonable expectations \u2018\u201cwill be honored even though painstaking study of the policy provisions would have negated those expectations.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bering Strait Sch. Dist. v. RLI Ins. Co., </em>873 P.2d 1292, 1295 (Alaska 1994)). The insured\u2019s reasonable expectations are determined by \u201cexam-in[ing] (1) the language of the disputed policy provisions; (2) the language of other provisions in the same policy; (3) extrinsic evidence; and (4) case law interpreting similar provisions.\u201d <em>West v. Umialik Ins. Co., </em>8 P.3d 1135, 1138 (Alaska 2000) (citing <em>Bering Strait, </em>873 P.2d at 1295).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\">The life insurance policy, taken as a whole, does not support appellants\u2019 reading of the disputed provision. Appellants argue that the disputed provision refers to the amount of benefit that <em>each </em>person in the listed categories \u2014 Primary Insured, Spouse, and Each Child \u2014 is due to receive upon the death of any insured. In other words, appellants argue that the policy pays out multiple benefits upon the qualifying death of a single insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The language of the provision does not support appellants\u2019 interpretation. Under appellants\u2019 reading, upon the death of an insured, this provision would require payment directly to an insured decedent. Payments cannot, however, be made to a decedent, only to a decedent\u2019s estate or beneficiaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The language of other relevant policy provisions also does not support appellants\u2019 interpretation. First, although the term \u201cbeneficiary\u201d is not defined in the policy, the policy both prescribes a default order of payment and informs the insured that the beneficiary may be changed at any time. No language in the policy limits who may be designated as a beneficiary. The language of these provisions clearly demonstrates that death benefit payments are to be made to beneficiaries in a predesignated order, unless otherwise indicated by the Primary Insured. Under appellants\u2019 construction, there would be no need to determine the order of payout, because appellants imagine simultaneous payout to each category of person listed in the disputed provisions, nor would there be any way to determine the amount due to a designated beneficiary who did not fall within the categories of \u201cPrimary Insured,\u201d \u201cSpouse,\u201d or \u201cEach Child.\u201d To interpret the policy as appellants suggest would require ignoring these relevant provisions. <em>See Bering Strait, </em>873 P.2d at 1295 (examining \u201cthe policy as a whole\u201d to determine reasonable expectations of insured).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">Appellants point to a single additional provision to support their interpretation. That provision states: \u201c[a]lso if you [the Primary Insured] die, your spouse automatically becomes the Primary Insured and will be entitled to the higher Primary Insured benefit for any covered Loss in an accident that occurs after your death.\u201d As appellants read it, under this provision, in conjunction with the disputed provision, \u201cit is the Primary Insured who is <em>entitled to </em>the higher primary benefit, i.e., $ 1,000,-000[,]\u201d and thus for the qualifying death of any person covered under the policy, the spouse turned \u201cPrimary Insured\u201d receives the $1,000,000 benefit. To accept this construction, however, would again require us to ignore other provisions of the policy. The awkward crafting of this single provision does not lead us to the wholesale conclusion that appellants\u2019 interpretation is reasonable. <em>See Dugan v. Atlanta Cas. Cos., </em>113 P.3d 652, 655 (Alaska 2005) (noting that despite \u201csloppy and careless\u201d drafting of the insurance policy, \u201c[i]t is well settled that in \u2018situations in which reasonable interpretation favors the insurer, and any other would be strained and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>tenuous, no compulsion exists to torture or twist the language of the contract\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Ness v. Nat\u2019l Indem. Co. of Neb., </em>247 F.Supp. 944, 947 (D.Alaska 1965))).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of appellee and AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of appellants\u2019 motion to reconsider.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b503-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
