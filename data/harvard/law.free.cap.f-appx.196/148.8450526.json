Although the district court found that Green had three \u201cstrikes\u201d under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) (2000), we recently held that one of Green\u2019s dismissals did not satisfy the statutory requirement that a qualifying case be dismissed as frivolous, malicious, or for failure to state a claim. <em>See Green v. Young, </em>454 F.3d 405 (4th Cir.2006). Thus, we grant Green leave to proceed under the PLRA on appeal, and we reverse the district court\u2019s determination that Green was barred from proceeding under the PLRA. We remand to the district court for entry of an order granting Green leave to proceed without prepayment of fees under the PLRA and for further proceedings on his complaint. We deny Phillip Morris\u2019s motion for discovery. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-22\">\n<em>REVERSED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
