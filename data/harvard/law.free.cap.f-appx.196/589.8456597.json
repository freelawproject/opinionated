On appeal, Misir claims that, due to an intervening change in law, his conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance no longer constitutes an aggravated felony, and therefore he is no longer statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">The Government contests Misir\u2019s petition on two grounds. First, the Government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review Misir\u2019s claims because Misir filed his second habeas petition, now a petition for review, more than thirty days after the BIA issued its decision. Second, the Government argues that res judicata bars Misir\u2019s claims because this court has already, on direct appeal, addressed the issue of whether Misir\u2019s conviction constitutes an aggravated felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">We find no merit in the Government\u2019s arguments and agree with Misir\u2019s claim. Therefore, we grant the petition for review and remand Misir\u2019s case to the BIA for further proceedings regarding Misir\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-13\">1. <em>Jurisdiction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-14\">We retain jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. <em>See Aragon-Ayon v. I.N.S., </em>206 F.3d 847, 849 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-15\">Under the REAL ID Act of 2005, we convert Misir\u2019s habeas petition to a petition for review. According to section 106(c) of the REAL ID Act, \u201c[t]he court of appeals shall treat [a] transferred [habeas] case as if it had been filed pursuant to a petition for review ..., <em>except that [the thirty-day filing deadline] shall not apply. </em>\u201d (emphasis added); <em>see also AlvarezBarajas v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1050, 1053 n. 2 (9th Cir.2005). Thus, although Misir filed his habeas petition, now a petition for review, more than thirty days after the BIA issued its final decision, we have jurisdiction to review his petition under the REAL ID Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-16\">2. <em>Res Judicata</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-17\">There is an exception to the doctrine of res judicata where there has been an intervening change in law. <em>See Clifton v. Attorney Gen. of Cal., </em>997 F.2d 660, 663 (9th Cir.1993). In <em>Clifton, </em>we recognized a \u201ctraditional exception to res judicata \u2018where between the time of the first judgment and the second there has been an intervening decision or a change in the law creating an altered situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>State Farm v. Duel, </em>324 U.S. 154, 162, 65 S.Ct. 573, 89 L.Ed. 812 (1945)).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-18\">In this case, while Misir\u2019s appeal was pending, there was an intervening change in law with respect to whether Misir\u2019s conviction constitutes an aggravat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>ed felony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As discussed in section 3 of this disposition, under Cazarez-Gutierrez, Misir\u2019s conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance no longer constitutes an aggravated felony for immigration purposes. This intervening change in law creates an \u201caltered situation\u201d and is sufficient to invoke the traditional exception to res judicata presented in <em>Clifton. </em>Therefore, even though we had previously found that Misir\u2019s conviction constituted an aggravated felony, res judicata does not bar Misir\u2019s present petition, and we may review Misir\u2019s final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">3. <em>Change in Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Whether an alien\u2019s prior offense qualifies as an \u201caggravated felony,\u201d so as to make him ineligible for cancellation of removal, is a legal question subject to de novo review. <em>See Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>382 F.3d at 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">In <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>we held that \u201ca state drug offense is an aggravated felony for immigration purposes only if it would be punishable as a felony under <em>federal </em>drug laws or the crime contains a trafficking element.\u201d 382 F.3d at 912 (emphasis added); <em>see also Ferreira v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 1045, 1050 (9th Cir.2004) (holding \u201ca state drug offense is not an aggravated felony for immigration purposes unless it is punishable as a felony under the CSA or other federal drug laws ..., or is a crime involving a trafficking element\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">We already have determined that a conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance under Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11350(a) does not constitute an aggravated felony under <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez. See United States v. Ortiz-Lopez, </em>385 F.3d 1202, 1205 (9th Cir.2004). In <em>Ortiz-Lopez, </em>defendant Ortiz-Lopez was convicted for possession of cocaine, a violation of Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code \u00a7 11350(a). <em>Id. </em>at 1203. Relying on <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>we held that Ortiz-Lopez\u2019s conviction did not constitute an aggravated felony because a violation of section 11350(a) was not a felony under federal law and was not a crime that involved a trafficking element. <em>See id. </em>at 1205.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">Consistent with our holding in <em>Ortiz-Lopez, </em>Misir\u2019s conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance under section 11350(a) is not an aggravated felony. Under the test we set forth in <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez, </em>Misir\u2019s conviction does not constitute an aggravated felony because it is not a felony under federal law and is not a crime involving a trafficking element. Because Misir\u2019s conviction no longer constitutes an aggravated felony, Misir is not statutorily ineligible for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(a)(3). Therefore, we remand Misir\u2019s case to the BIA for further proceedings regarding Mi-sir\u2019s application for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">Petition GRANTED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b615-9\">. Although we dismissed Misir\u2019s appeal for failure to prosecute, we recalled the mandate and reinstated his appeal. Thus, Misir\u2019s petition was pending when <em>Cazarez-Gutierrez v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 905 (9th Cir.2004), was filed and neither res judicata nor <em>Teague v. Lane, </em>489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), is a bar to his petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
