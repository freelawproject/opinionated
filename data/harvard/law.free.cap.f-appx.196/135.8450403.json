He appeals from the District Court\u2019s order denying his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. For the following reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-14\">Following a jury trial in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, Edward Peterson was convicted on March 10, 1988, of two counts of first degree murder. He is currently serving a life sentence for each conviction. Peterson first sought habeas relief in federal court in 1987, before his state trial concluded. His petition was dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. We affirmed on February 29, 1988. While his post-trial motions were pending in state court, Peterson filed a second habeas petition in federal court, which was also dismissed for failure to exhaust state remedies. We dismissed his appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-16\">Peterson returned to state court in May 1992 and filed a petition under Pennsylvania\u2019s Post-Conviction Relief Act (PCRA), seeking to reinstate his right to a direct appeal. After the PCRA court reinstated Peterson\u2019s direct appeal rights, the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed his convictions and sentences. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal on May 22,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-17\">Peterson filed another habeas petition in federal court on May 19, 1997, alleging nine new grounds of ineffective assistance of counsel. The District Court denied the petition without prejudice for failure to exhaust state remedies. Appellees then filed a motion for reconsideration on August 26, 1998, arguing the petition should have been dismissed with prejudice because Peterson\u2019s claims were procedurally barred by the waiver and statute of limitations provisions in the PCRA, and Peterson did not fit within any exceptions to the provisions. The District Court denied appellees\u2019 motion. Peterson returned to state court in 1999 and filed a second PCRA petition, which was dismissed as untimely. His second PCRA proceedings terminated on April 30, 2001, when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-18\">Peterson filed a pro se Verified First Amended Habeas Petition in federal court on May 10, 2001, and a pro se Verified Second Amended Habeas Petition on December 3, 2001. In this petition, he raised forty-seven claims of error, including appellate ineffective assistance of counsel claims, <em>Brady </em>violations, trial court errors, errors by the PCRA court, and loss of exculpatory records and statements made by prosecution witnesses. The Magistrate Judge initially recommended equitably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>tolling the one-year period of limitation prescribed in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). He also concluded that all but four of Peterson\u2019s claims were procedurally defaulted because he did not raise those claims either on direct appeal or in a timely PCRA petition, and that his exhausted claims lacked merit. Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge recommended denying the petition without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Peterson filed objections, and in a letter dated March 7, 2002, requested leave to supplement his habeas petition to include a claim that the accomplice liability jury instruction violated due process because it did not require a jury finding of specific intent in order to convict of first degree murder. He argued that the jury instruction was materially indistinguishable from an accomplice instruction claim held unconstitutional in <em>Laird v. Horn, </em>159 F.Supp.2d 58, 83 (E.D.Pa.2001). Peterson also claimed he did not previously know of the constitutional violation because appellees withheld the trial transcripts from him. Without addressing these issues, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and denied and dismissed Peterson\u2019s amended petition without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">On January 9, 2003, Peterson filed a Motion for Reconsideration under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e), citing twelve grounds. On June 15, 2004, the District Court granted the motion in part and denied it in part. In considering the motion, the District Court denied nunc pro tunc Peterson\u2019s Motion to Supplement setting forth his accomplice instruction claim because the claim was untimely under the AEDPA and did not relate back to his 2001 habeas petition. The District Court ordered Peterson\u2019s Motion to Supplement transferred to this Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 to determine whether the accomplice instruction claim could be considered as a successive habeas petition. The District Court also issued a Certificate of Appealability on whether the PCRA statute of limitations is an adequate state ground to preclude habeas review of the claims raised for the first time in Peterson\u2019s untimely 1999 PCRA petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">In his brief, Peterson contends that his accomplice instruction claim relates back to his 2001 habeas petition and that the District Court has authority to consider it. He also argues that the PCRA statute of limitations is not an adequate state ground to preclude habeas review of his claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-15\">The District Court determined Peterson\u2019s accomplice liability claim, presented in a Motion to Supplement his 2001 habeas petition, was untimely and did not \u201crelate back\u201d to the 2001 petition. Accordingly, the District Court held the Motion to Supplement, setting forth the accomplice instruction claim, was a second or successive habeas petition which the court lacked jurisdiction to consider under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Invoking the federal transfer statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, and citing opinions from the Courts of Appeals for the Seventh and Tenth Circuits, the Dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>trict Court transferred the claim to this Court. While neither party disputes the District Court\u2019s authority to do so, Peterson claims the District Court erred in treating the accomplice liability claim as a second or successive habeas petition. Appellees contend that Peterson failed to obtain a Certificate of Appealability granting us jurisdiction to consider whether the District Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">In our view, the District Court should not have treated Peterson\u2019s claims in his Motion to Supplement as a successive petition. Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631, a district court may transfer a motion requesting authorization to file a second or successive petition to the court of appeals when that motion has been erroneously brought before the district court. <em>See Robinson v. Johnson, </em>313 F.3d 128, 139 (3d Cir.2002). Citing <em>Pridgen v. Shannon, </em>380 F.3d 721 (3d Cir.2004), the District Court held Peterson\u2019s accomplice liability claim \u201cmay only be considered if it is treated as a successive habeas petition.\u201d But <em>Pridgen </em>considered whether, after the district court had already issued a judgment on a habeas petition, a subsequently filed Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion was \u201cin essence a second or successive habeas petition.\u201d 380 F.3d at 724. Here, Peterson filed his Motion to Supplement on March 7, 2002, before the District Court ruled on the habeas petition. But the District Court did not rule on that motion prior to Peterson\u2019s filing his Motion for Reconsideration. Examining Peterson\u2019s claims under his Motion for Reconsideration, the District Court corrected its oversight and considered the Motion to Supplement nunc pro tunc \u2014 that is, as if it had considered it when originally presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">As such, <em>Pridgen </em>is inapposite. The relevant question here is whether Peterson\u2019s Motion to Supplement qualifies as a \u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petition subject to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. This determination depends on whether a final judgment has already been rendered on the merits of a prior habeas petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a) (\u201cNo circuit or district judge shall be required to entertain an application for a writ of habeas corpus ... if it appears that the legality of such detention has been determined by a judge or court of the United States on a prior application for a writ of habeas corpus ...\u201d). Here, \u00a7 2244 does not apply because the District Court had not yet rendered a judgment on the merits of any claims in the petition when Peterson filed his Motion to Supplement or when the District Court denied it as untimely. Because \u00a7 2244(a) does not apply, the District Court erred when it construed Peterson\u2019s accomplice liability claim as a successive habeas petition. For these reasons, we will deny as unnecessary the request for authorization to file a second or successive petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">The District Court was nonetheless correct to consider whether the Motion to Supplement \u201crelated back\u201d to the original habeas petition.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Peterson submitted his Motion to Supplement long after the one-year period of limitation had lapsed. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). As we explained in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>221 F.3d 430 (3d Cir.2000), allowing a habeas petitioner to amend a habeas petition in order to raise a new claim or new theory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>of relief would frustrate Congress\u2019 intent under the AEDPA. <em>Id. </em>at 434, 435. But we also held that, insofar as a petitioner seeks to amend his petition to \u201cprovide factual clarification or amplification after the expiration of the one-year period of limitations,\u201d then Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(2)\u2014 describing when an amendment relates back to an original pleading \u2014 governs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The District Court, invoking <em>Thomas, </em>held the accomplice liability claim did not \u201crelate back\u201d because, contrary to the requirements of Rule 15(c)(2), the claim did not arise \u201cout of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading.\u201d Peterson contends his ability to timely file for habeas review of his accomplice liability instruction claim is \u201cdirectly related\u201d to his failure to obtain trial transcripts \u2014 an issue he had raised in his 2001 petition \u2014 and he should be allowed to supplement his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">We disagree. \u201cThe rationale of Rule 15(c) is that a party who has been notified of litigation concerning a particular occurrence has been given all the notice that statutes of limitations were intended to provide.\u201d <em>United States v. Craycraft, </em>167 F.3d 451, 457 (8th Cir.1999). If the new claim being asserted is \u201ca separate occurrence in both time and type\u201d from the previous claim, then it cannot be said that \u201cthe original petition would provide notice of such a different theory.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(holding an amendment to a petition, seeking to add a claim concerning failure to file an appeal, was distinct from a claim concerning failure to pursue a downward departure, and was thus time barred). Peterson\u2019s claim in his Motion to Supplement is a separate occurrence \u201cin both time and type\u201d from his claim that the appellee allegedly failed to provide him with trial transcripts. It accordingly is an entirely new claim, one which does not \u201crelate back\u201d to the 2001 petition and cannot be added after the limitation period has elapsed. <em>See Crews v. Horn, </em>360 F.3d 146, 154 n. 5 (3d Cir.2004). We see no error in the District Court\u2019s analysis on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">Because we agree with the District Court that Peterson\u2019s Motion to Supplement is time barred, we will affirm its determination in this regard. We disagree, however, that the motion constitutes a second or successive habeas petition, and we deny as unnecessary the request for authorization to file Peterson\u2019s motion under \u00a7 2244(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">We consider next whether the PCRA statute of limitations is an adequate state ground to preclude habeas review of the claims raised for the first time in Peterson\u2019s untimely 1999 PCRA petition. The PCRA provides that a post-conviction petition must be filed \u201cwithin one year from the date that the judgment of sentence becomes final.\u201d 42 Pa C.S.A. \u00a7 9545(b)(1). If not filed within the requisite time, a petition must invoke one of three outlined exceptions. <em>See id. </em>The PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirement is \u201cjurisdictional in nature,\u201d and failure to meet the requirement will render a court powerless to address the merits of the underlying claim. <em>Commonwealth v. Wilson, </em>824 A.2d 331, 334 (Pa.Super.Ct.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">A federal habeas court \u201cwill not review a question of federal law decided by a state court if the decision of that court rests on a state law ground that is independent of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>the federal question and adequate to support the judgment.\u201d <em>Lambrix v. Singletary, </em>520 U.S. 518, 522, 117 S.Ct. 1517, 137 L.Ed.2d 771 (1997). \u201cA state rule provides an independent and adequate basis for precluding federal review of a state prisoner\u2019s habeas claims only if: (1) the state procedural rule speaks in unmistakable terms; (2) all state appellate courts refused to review the petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits; and (3) the state courts\u2019 refusal in this instance is consistent with other decisions.\u201d <em>Doctor v. Walters, </em>96 F.3d 675, 684 (3d Cir.1996) (internal citations omitted). Because of concerns that the \u201cpetitioner should be on notice of how to present his claims in the state courts if his failure to present them is to bar him from advancing them in a federal court,\u201d <em>Cabrera v. Barbo, </em>175 F.3d 307, 313 (3d Cir.1999), the applicable rule must have been \u201cfirmly established\u201d and \u201cregularly applied\u201d at the time of the state court procedural default, <em>Doctor, </em>96 F.3d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Peterson argues the statute of limitations provision of the PCRA is not an adequate state ground for denying habeas review. Relying only on the third <em>Doctor </em>prong, he contends a judicially-created exception to the PCRA time limits \u2014 the \u201crelaxed waiver\u201d rule, invoked by Pennsylvania courts to waive, in certain cases, the PCRA statute of limitations and review untimely petitions on the merits \u2014 has been inconsistently applied, and thus its availability is \u201cless than perfectly clear.\u201d (Appellant Br. 38.) Rejecting Peterson\u2019s argument, the District Court held that the relaxed waiver rule has never been applied in a non-capital case during the relevant time period. Although Peterson concedes that no Pennsylvania court has applied the relaxed waiver rule in non-capital cases, he nevertheless argues that several cases question the clarity of the rule\u2019s application in non-capital cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">Peterson points to two Pennsylvania Supreme Court cases overturning Superior Court efforts to expand the scope of the relaxed waiver, and argues that these decisions illustrate \u201ccase law was clearly evolving from 1999 through 2003.\u201d (Appellant Br. 41.) In <em>Commonwealth v. Eller, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered whether its previous decision in <em>Commonwealth v. Lantzy, </em>558 Pa. 214, 736 A.2d 564 (1999)\u2014in which it held the PCRA \u201cprovides the exclusive remedy for post-conviction claims seeking restoration of appellate rights due to counsel\u2019s failure to perfect a direct appeal\u201d \u2014 was a new rule of procedure that could not be applied retroactively. 569 Pa. 622, 807 A.2d 838 (2002). The Pennsylvania Supreme Court held its decision in <em>Lantzy </em>did not raise retroactivity concerns, despite Superior Court decisions to the contrary, because it merely clarified existing law when it engaged in straightforward statutory interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 842-43 (\u201c[W]hen the Court in <em>Lantzy </em>held that claims seeking restoration of appellate rights due to counsel\u2019s alleged failure to perfect a requested direct appeal are cognizable under the PCRA ... it was not creating a new judicial rule of procedure, but instead was interpreting and applying the plain language of the statute.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In the second case, <em>Commonwealth v. Robinson, </em>the Pennsylvania Supreme Court considered the validity of the \u201cextension theory,\u201d which \u201cconstrues an untimely, serial PCRA petition as if it were an \u2018extension\u2019 of a timely, but previously dismissed, first PCRA petition in cases where an appeal was taken from the denial of the first petition, but the Superior Court ultimately dismissed the appeal when the PCRA appellant failed to file a brief.\u201d 575 Pa. 500, 837 A.2d 1157, 1158 (2003). The <em>Robinson </em>court held \u201cneither the language of the statute nor this Court\u2019s decisional law authorizes suspension of the time-bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>in instances where the petitioner is seeking <em>nunc pro tunc </em>appellate relief or reiterating claims which were litigated on a previous petition,\u201d making it impossible for the statute to \u201cbear the Superior Court\u2019s interpretation\u201d allowing for an extension theory. <em>Id. </em>at 1161-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Peterson points to these cases to argue that the PCRA\u2019s timeliness bar has not been absolutely applied by Pennsylvania courts, and thus cannot be considered an \u201cadequate state ground\u201d to deny habeas relief. But we have never said that a procedural rule must be uniformly and absolutely applied in all instances in order to be considered \u201cconsistently or regularly applied.\u201d Rather, \u201cif a state supreme court faithfully has applied a procedural rule in \u2018the vast majority\u2019 of cases, its willingness in a few cases to overlook the rule and address a claim on the merits does not mean that it does not apply the procedural rule regularly or consistently.\u201d <em>Banks v. Horn, </em>126 F.3d 206, 211 (3d Cir.1997). Although Peterson cites instances in which the Pennsylvania Superi- or Court has relied on certain legal theories to circumvent the PCRA\u2019s timeliness provisions, these cases are few in number and narrowly tailored in both reasoning and application. More importantly, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in the decisions Peterson cites, repeatedly makes plain that the PCRA\u2019s timeliness requirements have been consistently applied. Both <em>Eller </em>and <em>Robinson </em>are efforts to rein in any potential future erosion of the statute of limitations wrought by these \u201coccasional acts of grace ... in excusing or disregarding\u201d the procedural rule. <em>See Banks, </em>126 F.3d at 211. But those \u201coccasional acts of grace\u201d do not point to any application of the relaxed waiver rule so inconsistent as to undermine the adequacy of the PCRA\u2019s timeliness provisions. Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order that the PCRA statute of limitations is an adequate and independent state ground to deny habeas relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">For these reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Peterson\u2019s habeas corpus petition. We also deny as unnecessary the District Court\u2019s transfer of the accomplice liability claim to this Court for authorization to hear the claim as a second or successive habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b162-6\">. We have plenary review of the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding. <em>Johnson v. Rosemeyer, </em>117 F.3d 104 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b162-9\">. The statute reads, in part, \"Before a second or successive application permitted by this section is filed in the district court, the applicant shall move in the appropriate court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider the application.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b163-6\">.

Varner, </em>373 F.3d 327, 337 n. 13 (3d Cir.2004). In light of the District Court\u2019s decision to transfer Peterson\u2019s accomplice liability claim without considering whether a COA would be appropriate, we will expand the COA issued by the District Court to include review of its Rule 15(c) analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b164-5\">.
