He also contends that his classification is cruel and unusual and that he is unconstitutionally confined in maximum isolation.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Courts generally are not concerned with a prisoner\u2019s initial classification level based on his criminal history before his incarceration because an inmate has \u201cno protectable liberty interest in his classification.\u201d <em>Wilkerson v. Stalder, </em>329 F.3d 431, 435-36 (5th Cir.2003). Additionally, a prisoner\u2019s change in custody status, \u201cwithout more, does not constitute a deprivation of a constitutionally cognizable liberty interest.\u201d <em>Luken v. Scott, </em>71 F.3d 192, 193 (5th Cir.1995). Finally, Jones\u2019s conclusional assertion that his custodial classification runs afoul of the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment does not state a constitutional claim because he fails to allege that he was deprived of life\u2019s necessities or a basic human need. <em>See Berry v. Brady, </em>192 F.3d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1999); <em>Woods v. Edwards, </em>51 F.3d 577, 581 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">Jones\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Jones\u2019s complaint for failure to state a claim counts as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), as does the dismissal of this appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). This court cautions Jones that if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-13\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b312-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
