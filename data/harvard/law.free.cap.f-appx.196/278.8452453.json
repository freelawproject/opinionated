Martinez-Vasquez challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government argues that the waiver provision in Martinez-Vasquez\u2019s plea agreement in relation to his unlawful presence conviction precludes his attack on the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in the appeal of his conviction and sentence in that matter and that, as a result of the waiver, Martinez-Vasquez lacks standing to challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b) in his appeal of his unlawful presence conviction. We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar Martinez-Vasquez\u2019s appeal in relation to his unlawful presence conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">Martinez-Vasquez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Martinez-Vasquez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Martinez-Vasquez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. For these reasons, Martinez-Vasquez\u2019s convictions and sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b302-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
