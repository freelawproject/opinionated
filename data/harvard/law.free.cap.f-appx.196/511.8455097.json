INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995). Considering Gyozalyan\u2019s four arrests and the beating he received by unknown assailants together, the record does not compel the conclusion that the events Gyozalyan described amount to persecution on account of his political opinion. Substantial evidence also supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s finding that Gyozalyan failed to establish a well-founded fear of persecution in Armenia. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>134 F.3d 962, 969-70 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-22\">Because Gyozalyan did not establish that he was eligible for asylum, he did not satisfy the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Pedro-Mateo v. INS, </em>224 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-23\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s denial of Gyozalyan\u2019s CAT claim, because Gyozalyan has not shown that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured if returned to Armenia. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 993 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b535-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
