Smith appeals from an order of the district court dismissing his complaint without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-20\">Smith filed this 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging civil rights violations. Defendants Dr. Elizabeth Conley, Dr. Gary Campbell, Deborah Steinmann, and Dave Dormir\u00e9 moved to dismiss for failure to state a claim and for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The district court granted defendants\u2019 motions, noting that Smith\u2019s complaint did not specifically allege full exhaustion of his administrative remedies as to each defendant, and that he did not demonstrate exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-21\">An inmate\u2019s failure to exhaust available administrative remedies, as required by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), is an affirmative defense, which need not be pleaded by plaintiff. <em>See Nerness v. Johnson, </em>401 F.3d 874, 876 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We also note that it is not apparent from the face of the complaint or from the record that Smith had not met the applicable exhaustion requirements when he filed his suit. <em>Cf. Abdul-Muhammad v. Kempker, </em>450 F.3d 350, 352 (8th Cir.2006) (affirming dismissal where careful review of record of case supports district court\u2019s conclusion that administrative remedies had not been exhausted before complaint was filed); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number><em>Myers v. Vogal, </em>960 F.2d 750, 751 (8th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (while statute of limitations is affirmative defense, district court may properly dismiss in forma pauperis complaint before service when it is apparent from face of complaint that statute of limitations has run).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Accordingly, we reverse the district court\u2019s order, and remand to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
