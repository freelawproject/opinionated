He argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Sanchez contends that his plea agreement, which contained a waiver-of-appeal provision, does not bar this appeal because he is challenging the constitutionality of the statute of conviction and his sentence is in excess of the statutory maximum. The Government seeks to enforce the appeal waiver. We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Sanchez\u2019s constitutional challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). Although Sanchez contends that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was incorrectly decided and that a majority of the Supreme Court would overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in light of <em>Apprendi, </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Sanchez properly concedes that his argument is foreclosed in light of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>and circuit precedent, but he raises it here to preserve it for further review. Because Sanchez has shown no error in the judgment of the district court, that judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b307-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
