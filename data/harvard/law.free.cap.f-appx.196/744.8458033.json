He also argues, based on cases such as <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), that our ruling in <em>Wofford v. Scott, </em>177 F.3d 1236 (11th Cir.1999), is \u201ccontrary to the law established by the Supreme Court in reference to the original writ of habeas corpus\u201d because <em>\u201cWofford </em>fails to cite either recent and/or past ruling[s] from the Supreme Court on how the original writ of habeas corpus by way of \u00a7 2241 is now applied.\u201d He contends that, because Congress in enacting the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>did not articulate specific and unambiguous statutory directives to effect the repeal of \u00a7 2241, he does not need to prove that \u00a7 2255 relief is \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d He also claims that the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition violated due process and equal protection, and argues that the district court violated <em>Clisby v. Jones, </em>960 F.2d 925 (11th Cir.1992), by dismissing his \u00a7 2241 petition without addressing the merits of his underlying claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">Typically, collateral attacks on the validity of a federal conviction or sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255. <em>Sawyer, </em>326 F.3d at 1365. However, under limited circumstances, a provision of \u00a7 2255 permits a federal prisoner to file a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2241(a), 2255. That provision, known as the \u201csavings clause,\u201d provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-5\">[a]n application for writ of habeas corpus in behalf of a prisoner who is authorized to apply for relief by motion pursuant to this section, shall not be entertained if it appears that the applicant has failed to apply for relief, by motion, to the court which sentenced him, or that such court has denied him relief, <em>unless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (emphasis added). Accordingly, a court may entertain a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence if the petitioner establishes that the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the movant. <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b770-9\">We have established that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause only applies when (1) the petitioner\u2019s claim is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; (2) the holding of that decision established that the prisoner was convicted of a \u201cnonexistent offense\u201d; <em>and </em>(3) \u201ccircuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised at the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.\u201d <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 (emphasis added). In order for a prisoner to avail himself of the \u00a7 2241 remedy under <em>Wofford, </em>all three criteria must be satisfied. <em>See id. </em>We have made clear that \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause does not apply merely because a \u00a7 2255 motion would be barred as second or successive. <em>McGhee, </em>604 F.2d at 10 (noting that \u201ca prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion is insufficient, in and of itself, to show the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the remedy\u201d). If a prisoner satisfies the elements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, the proper inquiry in the \u00a7 2241 proceeding is whether the prisoner can show actual innocence. <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-10\">We hold that the district court did not err by dismissing Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because he did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause. Campbell did not satisfy this test. His attempt to use <em>Blakely </em>as a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision is without merit. <em>See Varela v. United States, </em>400 F.3d 864, 867-68 (11th Cir.) (Holding that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>do not apply retroactively to \u00a7 2255 cases on collateral review), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>S.Ct. 312, 163 L.Ed.2d 269 (2005). Further, even assuming that <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>were retroactively applicable to Campbell\u2019s case,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he fails to show that he was convicted for a nonexistent offense by merely alleging that his sentencing enhancements were unconstitutionally applied. Cf<em>. Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Accordingly, Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition did not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and the district court correctly determined that the petition should be dismissed. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Moreover, each of the remaining claims from Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition are without merit because they also do not meet the three-part <em>Wofford </em>test. Campbell claimed that: (1) applying the career-offender enhancement to him violated his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights because he only had pled <em>nolo contendere </em>to the Florida state offense; (2) the career-offender enhancement did not apply because adjudication was withheld in his state case and he previously had been sentenced to a term not in excess of one year; (3) he had only one prior qualifying conviction, rendering him actually innocent of the \u00a7 4B1.1 enhancement; and (4) the weapon-possession enhancement was improperly applied to him because that count of his indictment was dismissed. <em>{See </em>R.1-1 at 13-30). None of these claims was based upon a previously unavailable and retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision establishing that Campbell was convicted of a nonexistent offense. <em>See Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244. Therefore, the district court correctly dismissed Campbell\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for his failure to satisfy \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">Upon review of the record and consideration of both parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b769-11\">. As an initial matter, we note that Campbell does not need a certificate of appealability to proceed in this appeal. <em>See Sawyer v. Holder, </em>326 F.3d 1363, 1364 n. 3 (11th Cir.2003) (holding that a federal prisoner proceeding under \u00a7 2241 does not need a certificate of appealability to appeal).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b770-7\">. The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents a question of law that we review <em>de novo. Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b771-6\">. The Supreme Court recently granted <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Waddington, </em>- U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 2352, 165 L.Ed.2d 278 (2006), and will consider whether <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker </em>are retroactive to cases on collateral review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
