See <em>Smith v. Jordan, </em>146 Fed.Appx. 53 (7th Cir.2005) (unpublished order). A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and concluded that Smith is lying. The magistrate believed the contrary statement of a guard who testified that he had visited Smith in his cell to extend an opportunity to attend the hearing, and that Smith had refused point blank. The prison\u2019s contemporaneous log book reflects that decision. After <em>de novo </em>consideration, the district judge agreed with the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-15\">Smith now argues that he was entitled to a jury trial on this factual dispute, but the contention is frivolous. The court is the sole factfinder in collateral proceedings under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. See \u00a7 2254(e). A collateral attack is not an action \u201cat law\u201d to which the seventh amendment applies. Smith also maintains that the court should have subpoenaed additional witnesses, but the magistrate did not abuse his discretion in rejecting this request. The proposed testimony would have been marginally relevant, if relevant at all. Smith\u2019s remaining arguments are addressed to issues that were resolved adversely to him on the first appeal and need not be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
