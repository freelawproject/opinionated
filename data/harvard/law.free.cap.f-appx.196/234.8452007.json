Although the district court did not specifically address the claims against two of the three defendants, we conclude that the judgment is final and appealable because the district court\u2019s judgment reflects an intent to dispose of the entire case in light of Palermo\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies. <em>See Moreau v. Harris County, </em>158 F.3d 241, 244 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-9\">Palermo was required to file a Step 2 grievance in order to exhaust his administrative remedies within the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. See <em>Wendell v. Asher, </em>162 F.3d 887, 891 (5th Cir.1998). The record and Palermo\u2019s pleading show that he did not file a Step 2 grievance and that he incorrectly believed it was unnecessary to do so. Exhaustion of remedies is mandatory, \u201cirrespective of the forms of relief sought and offered through administrative avenues.\u201d <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). We take \u201ca strict approach to the exhaustion requirement,\u201d and the district court need not determine whether Palermo pursued his administrative remedies in good faith. <em>See id. </em>Under a strict application of the exhaustion requirement, the dismissal of all unexhausted claims was correct, and the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b259-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
