Oct. 20, 2005), <em>affg </em>No. A 70 576 938 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 31, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Jiang failed to raise any arguments regarding the denial of his withholding of removal and CAT claims in either his brief to the BIA or this Court. Accordingly, these claims are not exhausted, and they are also waived. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1) (governing exhaustion); <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 343 (2d Cir.2006) (same); <em>Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006) (governing waiver). We therefore review only the denial of Jiang\u2019s asylum claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility findings such as the IJ\u2019s determination in this case, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">We have held that an asylum applicant\u2019s lack of detailed doctrinal knowledge about Christianity does not automatically render incredible his or her claim of religious persecution because \u201cpeople can identify with a certain religion, notwithstanding their lack of detailed knowledge about that religion\u2019s doctrinal tenets.\u201d <em>Rizal v. Gonzales, </em>442 F.3d 84, 90 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the IJ found Jiang\u2019s commitment to Christianity incredible on the ground that he was unable to answer certain questions about Christian doctrine notwithstanding his claims that he had been a practicing Christian in the United States for more than ten years, was currently studying to be confirmed by the Catholic church, and had been active in converting individuals to Christianity in China.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Several bases for the IJ\u2019s finding were erroneous or, at best, insufficient to give us confidence that the IJ would reach the same conclusion in the light of <em>Rizal. </em>Contrary to the IJ\u2019s view that Jiang was unfamiliar with Lent, Jiang appeared to have identified correctly the period of Lent, although there was some subsequent confusion in the translation. The IJ\u2019s reliance on the Pope\u2019s name reversal is also not supported by substantial evidence, particularly given that Jiang identified the Pope\u2019s name correctly on the first day of his hearing and that names are often stated in a different order in Chinese than in English. Finally, despite the IJ\u2019s indication that Jiang could not \u201cspeak about the process of confirmation with any coherency,\u201d Jiang testified, albeit not in detail, that at the time of his hearing he was studying certain materials with a priest as a member of a study group. Jiang, however, did have difficulty explaining any difference between the Old and New Testaments and proffered inconsistent evidence as to the number of people he had converted to Christianity in China.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-11\">Given the IJ\u2019s errors, particularly her overstatement of Jiang\u2019s lack of doctrinal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>knowledge, and our inability to determine the extent to which the IJ was influenced by considerations <em>Rizal </em>held to be mistaken, we cannot confidently predict that absent these flaws the IJ would come to the same conclusion. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>434 F.3d 144, 159-165 (2d Cir.2006). We therefore remand for reconsideration in the light of our decision in <em>Rizal. </em>In remanding this case, however, we do not take any view on the ultimate merits of Jiang\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Accordingly, the petition for review is GRANTED and the case REMANDED. The pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">. We reject Jiang\u2019s argument that he was unable to prove his commitment to Christianity because of an incompetent translator. Jiang\u2019s attorney was specifically asked whether he wanted a <em>de novo </em>hearing, and he stated that he did not think it was necessary. <em>Al</em>though this question was asked prior to any of the testimony relating to Jiang\u2019s knowledge of religious doctrine, Jiang\u2019s attorney did not argue at any other point during the hearing that the translation was inadequate.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
