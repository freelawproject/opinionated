Carrigan challenges his conviction and sentence for conspiracy to possess pseudoephedrine with the intent to manufacture methamphetamine. The district court dismissed the petition because Carrigan did not qualify to proceed under the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Because Carrigan is a federal prisoner seeking to proceed under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a COA. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-25\">Carrigan does not address the basis for the district court\u2019s conclusion that his \u00a7 2241 petition should be dismissed. Although pro se briefs are liberally construed, even pro se litigants must brief arguments to preserve them. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Because Carrigan has not addressed the basis for the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition, he has abandoned any argument that the district court erred when it dismissed his \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-26\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b293-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
