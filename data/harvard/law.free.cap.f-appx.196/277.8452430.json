This court reviews the denial of Alexander\u2019s motion to reopen, construed as a motion for relief from judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, for an abuse of discretion. <em>Seven Elves, Inc. v. Eskenazi, </em>635 F.2d 396, 402 (5th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Although pro se pleadings are afforded liberal construction, <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), even pro se litigants must adequately brief arguments in order to properly present them for consideration. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Alexander has failed to adequately brief his challenge to the denial of his Rule 60(b) motion. Moreover, his arguments regarding the underlying issues of his \u00a7 1983 lawsuit lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">As the instant appeal lacks arguable merit, it is dismissed as frivolous. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2; <em>Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). The dismissal of Alexander\u2019s \u00a7 1983 lawsuit and this appeal each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). We caution Alexander that, if he accumulates a total of three strikes, he may no longer proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
