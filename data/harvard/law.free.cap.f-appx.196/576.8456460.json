We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">The IJ held Sowah inadmissible for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) on the ground that he falsely claimed U.S. citizenship. That statute declares \u201c[a]ny alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself or herself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter ... or any other Federal or State law\u201d to be ineligible for admission. Sowah submitted a counterfeit U.S. birth certificate and misrepresented himself as a U.S. citizen on a passport application. The issuance of passports is governed by federal law. <em>See </em>22 U.S.C. \u00a7 212; 22 C.F.R. \u00a7 51.2(a). Even if Sowah was unsuccessful in his attempt to obtain a passport and thereby failed to receive a \u201cbenefit,\u201d he clearly represented himself as a U.S. citizen for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of receiving a passport. <em>See Toro-Romero v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 930, 936 (9th Cir.2004). The fact that Sowah\u2019s action may also have constituted a ground for holding him inadmissible under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) does not mean that he cannot be cited under subsection (ii) as well. He violated both. Section 1182(a)(6)(C)(ii) is \u201ca non-waivable ground of inadmissibility.\u201d See <em>Pichardo v. INS, </em>216 F.3d 1198, 1201 (9th Cir.2000). Sowah is thus ineligible for a waiver of inadmissibility, and he is deportable under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(3)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Sowah also argues that the IJ violated his due process rights. An individual can assert a due process violation only regarding those things in which he or she has a constitutionally protected property or liberty interest. No protected liberty interest, and thus no due process right, lies in discretionary relief from deportation. <em>Munoz v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 950, 954 (9th Cir.2003) (noting that because \u201cdiscretionary relief is a privilege created by Congress, denial of such relief cannot violate a substantive interest protected by the Due Process clause\u201d). The due process claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
