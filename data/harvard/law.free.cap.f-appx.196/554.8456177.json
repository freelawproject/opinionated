To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We dismiss in part and deny in part the petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s discretionary determination that Luna-Salinas failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-17\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Luna-Salinas submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-18\">We do not consider Luna-Salinas\u2019s contentions regarding physical presence, because Luna-Salinas\u2019s failure to establish hardship is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-19\">No. 05-71572: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-20\">No. 05-74879: PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b579-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
