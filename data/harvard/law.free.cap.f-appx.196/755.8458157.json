On appeal, Fitzgerald advances a new theory of \u201ctwo transfers\u201d that was not raised below in his motion for summary judgment. We decline to review this new theory because it is not properly before us, and we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court with regard to Fitzgerald\u2019s fraudulent transfer claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">We adopt the following background information from the district court\u2019s order dated 13 April 2005.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-17\">Plaintiff Dennis Fitzgerald and Defendant Robert Beringhaus (\u201cMr.Beringhaus\u201d), citizens of Colorado and Georgia respectively, formed two limited liability companies, Bering Motors, LLC and All-Star Automotive Group, [LLC] (\u201cAll-Star\u201d), in connection with the purchase and operation of two automobile dealerships in the metro-Atlanta area. Fitzgerald\u2019s primary role was to provide capital to open the dealerships, while Mr. Beringhaus provided capital and served as the manager of each company. In March 2001, Fitzgerald and Mr. Beringhaus formed All-Star. The parties executed an operating agreement and members\u2019 agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the members\u2019 agreement, Mr. Beringhaus was obligated to purchase Fitzgerald\u2019s interest in the company through a series of annual buy downs, or repurchase obligations. Beginning on May 1, 2002, and concluding on May 1, 2005, Mr. Beringhaus was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>sonally obligated to repurchase 200,000 units of Fitzgerald\u2019s membership interest each year for $1.00 per unit. On May 1, 2002, Mr. Beringhaus repurchased 200,000 membership units for $200,000.00. However, he failed to repurchase Fitzgerald\u2019s interest in 2003 and 2004. In addition, he indicated that he would not repurchase any additional membership units in 2005. Fitzgerald then filed this suit for breach of contract. [The district court] entered partial summary judgment in Fitzgerald\u2019s favor in the amount of $600,000, based on Mr. Beringhaus\u2019s breach and anticipatory repudiation of the All-Star Members\u2019 Agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\">In addition to his claims for breach and anticipatory breach of contract against Mr. Beringhaus, the Plaintiff asserted] a claim for fraudulent transfer against Mr. Beringhaus and his wife, Defendant Shelley Beringhaus (\u201cMrs.Beringhaus\u201d). During a four-day period in September of 2003, Mr. Beringhaus wrote a number of checks to cash drawn on an All-Star account. In total, nine checks were written for a total amount of $411,000.00. The cash from the All-Star account was then given to Mrs. Beringhaus. During this same period of time, Mr. Beringhaus authorized two wire transfers from an All-Star account, one for $325,000.00 and another for $860,000.00, to the Beringhaus\u2019s personal joint account. Fitzgerald contends that these cash and wire transfers rendered All-Star and Mr. Beringhaus insolvent and were done for the purpose of avoiding Mr. Beringhaus\u2019s debt arising out of the breach of the All-Star Members\u2019 Agreement. Thus, he asserts that the transfers constitute fraudulent transfers from Mr. Beringhaus to Mrs. Beringhaus, in contravention of the Georgia Uniform Fraudulent Transfers Act, O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-70 <em>et seq. </em>Fitzgerald move[d] for partial summary judgment on this claim as to both defendants. Mrs. Beringhaus cross-move[d] for summary judgment on this claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">R8-88 at 2-4 (citations and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-8\">In that order, the district court granted Mrs. Beringhaus\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment on Fitzgerald\u2019s fraudulent transfers claim, and denied Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that same claim. Under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74(a), \u201c[a] transfer made or obligation incurred by a debtor is fraudulent as to a creditor ... if the debtor made the transfer or incurred the obligation\u201d and one of two listed conditions are satisfied. The district court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\">Fitzgerald bases his fraudulent transfer claim on transfers made from All-Star accounts. Thus, All-Star, not Mr. Beringhaus, was the transferor of funds. Despite repeated references to the fact that the funds were transferred out of All-Star accounts, Fitzgerald asserts that any distinction between Mr. Beringhaus and All-Star is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">R8-88 at 5. Referencing the law on limited liability companies, such as All-Star, the court noted that \u201cthe transfer of money from the All-Star accounts, although physically performed by Mr. Beringhaus, was an action of All-Star.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6. The district court concluded that \u201cFitzgerald\u2019s claim fails for two reasons: (1) Fitzgerald lacks standing to assert the claim because he has failed to establish a debtor-creditor relationship with the transferor [All-Star]; and (2) the property transferred was property of All-Star, not Mr. Beringhaus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">On 21 April 2005, Fitzgerald filed a motion for reconsideration, which the district court denied on 6 May 2005. On 15 June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>2005, the district court entered final judgment for Mrs. Beringhaus against Fitzgerald in her cross-motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On 5 July 2005, Fitzgerald filed a notice of appeal, designating the 15 June 2005 judgment for Mrs. Beringhaus on her cross-motion for summary judgment and the related 13 April 2005 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">On appeal, Fitzgerald argues that the district court erred in granting Mrs. Beringhaus summary judgment because it ignored the fact that there were two sets of transfers: the first, when All-Star, through Mr. Beringhaus, distributed $1,596,000 from All-Star accounts to Mr. Beringhaus; and the second, when Mr. Beringhaus transferred that money to Mrs. Beringhaus. Before we can proceed to the merits of this argument, we must first determine whether Fitzgerald raised this \u201ctwo-transfers\u201d theory below, and, if so, in what motions it was raised. We also must determine what motions have been appealed to us. There are two groups of memoranda and motions at issue: (1) those relating to Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment and Mrs. Beringhaus\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment and (2) those relating to Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for reconsideration. We address those relating to the motion for reconsideration first.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-8\">While Fitzgerald, who is represented by counsel, clearly raised the \u201ctwo-transfers\u201d theory in his motion for reconsideration, he does not raise the issue of the denial of his motion for reconsideration in his initial brief on appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Fitzgerald does not raise the issue of the denial of his motion for reconsideration on appeal, we will not review it. <em>See Wilkerson v. Grinnell Corp., </em>270 F.3d 1314, 1322 (11th Cir.2001) (holding that issues not raised in the initial brief on appeal are deemed abandoned); <em>see also Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cAny issue that an appellant wants the Court to address should be specifically and clearly identified in the brief.... Our requirement that those claims an appellant wishes to have considered on appeal be <em>unambiguously demarcated </em>stems from the obvious need to avoid confusion as to the issues that are in play and those that are not.\u201d (quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis added)). While Fitzgerald briefly mentions the denial of his motion for reconsideration in his reply brief, Appellant\u2019s Reply Br. at 8, that does not provide us with the grounds to review this issue. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>416 F.3d 1350, 1352 n. 1 (11th Cir.) (explaining that the prudential rule of declining to consider issues not raised in a party\u2019s initial brief is \u201cwell-established\u201d in our circuit), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 784, 163 L.Ed.2d 608 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">Thus, we consider only those antecedent memoranda and motions relating to the denial of Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the grant of Mrs. Berin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>ghaus\u2019s motion for summary judgment on that claim. We review <em>de novo </em>the denial or grant of a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Holloman v. Mail-Well Comp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). Because Fitzgerald conceded during oral argument and in his brief on appeal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that the first transfer from All-Star to Mr. Beringhaus was not fraudulent under O.C.G.A. \u00a7 18-2-74(a), we need not review the lawfulness of that transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In reviewing whether Fitzgerald raised the issue of a second transfer, it is improper for us to re-characterize on appeal the arguments made by Fitzgerald in his motion for summary judgment by reference to his motion for reconsideration. <em>Cf. David v. U.S., </em>134 F.3d 470, 475 (1st Cir.1998) (\u201c[W]e must measure the petitioner\u2019s current argument against that limned in [the] motion [for post-conviction relief] and advanced before [the district court], not by reference to the theory that he belatedly surfaced in his request for reconsideration.\u201d). We have closely examined Fitzgerald\u2019s motion for summary judgment and its related memoranda, R660-1, his response to Mrs. Beringhaus\u2019s motion for summary judgment, R7-73, and his reply memorandum, R8-77, in addition to other relevant materials in the record. In so doing, we conclude that Fitzgerald did not clearly raise the issue of a second transfer before the district court, and, therefore, we will not consider his \u201ctwo-transfers\u201d theory on appeal. At best, any references to a second transfer from Mr. Beringhaus to Mrs. Beringhaus are ambiguous. Unfortunately for Fitzgerald, that is not good enough. <em>See United States v. Reyes-Vasquez, </em>905 F.2d 1497, 1500 (11th Cir.1990). \u201cPlain talk by lawyers is necessary for clear understanding by judges. Whenever a litigant has a meritorious proposition of law which he is seriously pressing upon the attention of the trial court, he should raise that point in such clear and simple language that the trial court may not misunderstand it, and if his point is so obscurely hinted at that the trial court quite excusably may fail to grasp it, it will avail naught to disturb the judgment on appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and citations omitted); <em>see also United States v. Madruga, </em>810 F.2d 1010, 1014 (11th Cir.1987) (\u2018We decline to add the duty to interpret imaginatively what lawyers say to the long list of responsibilities of magistrates and other trial judges.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Because Fitzgerald conceded that the transfer of funds from the All-Star account to Mr. Beringhaus was not a fraudulent transfer under Georgia law and because Fitzgerald has not properly raised the issue of a second transfer either below or on appeal, we will not disturb the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\">.
