On appeal, V\u00e1zquez does not dispute the accuracy of the guideline calculations or argue that his sentence is substantively unreasonable under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rather, his arguments are more procedural in nature. For the reasons discussed below, we find those arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-16\">His first contention \u2014 that the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c) by failing to state the reasons for the sentence in open court \u2014 is easily dispatched. Where, as here, the sentence imposed is within the guideline range, the correctness of that range is undisputed, and the breadth of the range is less than 24 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>months, section 3553(c) does not require \u201c[a] district court ... to cite <em>any </em>reason for sentencing a defendant within [that range].\u201d <em>United States v. Mansur-Ramos, </em>348 F.3d 29, 31 (1st Cir.2003); <em>see also United States v. O\u2019Connell, </em>252 F.3d 524, 529 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">Although reasonableness review, post-<em>Booker, </em>does make it \u201cimportant for [the reviewing court] to have the district court\u2019s reasons for its sentence\u201d even if the sentence is within a narrow guideline range, <em>United States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir.2006) (en banc), \u201ca court\u2019s reasoning can often be inferred by comparing what was argued by the parties or contained in the pre-sentence report with what the judge did,\u201d <em>id. </em>Here, the reasons for the sentence are readily apparent from the sentencing transcript as supplemented by the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">At sentencing, the court responded to the mitigating circumstances proffered by the defendant \u2014 that he was addicted to drugs when he committed his prior offenses but had been drug-free in recent years and that the instant offense was motivated by a desire to improve his financial situation \u2014 by reminding him of his extensive criminal record. The court again referred to that record, \u201cwithout giving the specific details,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> before announcing his sentence. Despite that record, the court adopted <em>both </em>parties\u2019 recommendations to sentence V\u00e1zquez to the bottom of the guideline range. In exercising such leniency, the court was presumably influenced by defense counsel\u2019s argument that a sentence at the lower end of the guideline range \u201cwould provide adequate punishment for the offense committed,\u201d V\u00e1zquez\u2019s own explanation of the circumstances of his instant and prior offenses, and the government\u2019s statement that V\u00e1zquez had been \u201cvery, very cooperative\u201d in quickly accepting responsibility and expressing remorse for his offense. No further explanation was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-10\">Although V\u00e1zquez now proffers an additional ground for leniency \u2014 that the reduced sentence he would have received had he been sentenced in a \u201cfast-track\u201d district<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> would have been \u201csufficient\u201d to serve the purposes of sentencing under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) \u2014 the district court was not required to address that or any other potential ground for leniency that was not brought to its attention. <em>United States v. Alli, </em>444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st Cir.2006). Moreover, it is questionable whether such an argument would constitute a valid reason for leniency in any event, <em>United States v. Mart\u00ednez-Flores, </em>428 F.3d 22, 30 n. 3 (1st Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1449, 164 L.Ed.2d 146 (2006), particularly without a factual basis, <em>Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d at 519.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-13\">V\u00e1zquez\u2019s final grounds for resentencing are premised on two erroneous statements made by the district court at his change of plea hearing \u2014 that probation is not available in this type of case, and that the maximum term of supervised release for this offense is two years.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>cause neither of those grounds was raised below, our review is only for plain error. <em>United States v. Vazquez-Molina, </em>389 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir.2004), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>544 U.S. 946, 125 S.Ct. 1713, 161 L.Ed.2d 520 (2005). Under that appellant-unfriendly standard, \u201can appellant must demonstrate: \u2018(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Duarte, </em>246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">Even assuming that these misstatements satisfy the first two prongs of the plain error standard, V\u00e1zquez cannot show the prejudice necessary to satisfy the remaining two prongs. He does <em>not </em>claim that he would not have pled guilty had those misstatements not been made at that stage. By the time of sentencing, those mistakes had been corrected in the presentence report, which V\u00e1zquez had reviewed without objection and which the court relied upon in sentencing. Given the court\u2019s expressed concern about the seriousness of V\u00e1zquez\u2019s criminal record and the guidelines\u2019 suggestion of a sentence of up to almost six years, any suggestion that the court could have been persuaded to impose a probationary sentence, instead of the 46-month prison sentence actually imposed, is fanciful. The fact that the court ultimately imposed a three-year, rather than a two-year, term of supervised release is also inconsequential, given that V\u00e1zquez will likely be deported long before the additional year begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">Accordingly, the sentence is <em>affirmed. See </em>1st Cir. R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b35-10\">. That range, which was not disputed in the district court and is not challenged on appeal, was computed as follows: a total offense level of 21 (base offense level of 8, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) (Nov.2004 ed.), plus 16 levels because the sentence for one of his prior felony drug trafficking convictions exceeded 13 months, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A), minus 3 levels for acceptance of responsibility, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3A1.1(a)) combined with a criminal history category of III (6 criminal history points for two prior sentences of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.1(a)) yielded a range of 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment, <em>id. </em>ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b36-6\">. As detailed in the presentence report, that record included repeated drug trafficking offenses, some of which were only slightly too old to be counted in calculating his criminal history score. The only gaps in that history occurred when he was incarcerated or deported following two previous illegal entries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b36-7\">. In some districts, where authorized by the Attorney General, Congress has authorized downward departures for illegal reentry defendants who waive certain procedural rights. <em>Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d at 519 n. 3. Puerto Rico is not among those districts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b36-15\">. In fact, although probation is not recommended by the guidelines, U.S.S.G. ch. 5, pt. A; \u00a7 5B1.1, probation is allowed by statute for this Class C felony offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3559(a)(3), 3561; and the maximum term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>of supervised release recommended by the guidelines is three years, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 5D 1.2(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
