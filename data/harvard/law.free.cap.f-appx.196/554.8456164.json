We dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-16\">We lack jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s discretionary determination that Pech failed to show exceptional and extremely unusual hardship. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 930 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">The evidence Pech presented with his motion to remand concerned the same basic hardship grounds as his application for cancellation of removal. <em>See Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602-03 (9th Cir.2006). We therefore lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination that the evidence would not alter its prior discretionary determination that he failed to establish the requisite hardship. <em>See id. </em>at 600 (holding that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i) bars this court from reviewing the denial of a motion to reopen where \u201cthe only question presented is whether [the] new evidence altered the prior, underlying discretionary determination that [the petitioner] had not met the hardship standard.\u201d) (Internal quotations and brackets omitted); <em>see also RamirezAlejandre v. Ashcroft, </em>319 F.3d 365, 382 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cUnder BIA procedure, a motion to remand must meet all the requirements of a motion to reopen and the two are treated the same.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b578-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
