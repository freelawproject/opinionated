We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>See Iturribarria v. INS, </em>321 F.3d 889, 894 (9th Cir.2003). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion to reopen, because the BIA considered the evidence Garcia-Munoz submitted and acted within its broad discretion in determining that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reopening. <em>See Singh v. INS, </em>295 F.3d 1037, 1039 (9th Cir.2002) (The BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen shall be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational or contrary to law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-24\">Garcia-Munoz\u2019s contention that the BIA violated his equal protection rights by denying cancellation of removal does not amount to a colorable constitutional claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>See Martinez-Rosas v.
