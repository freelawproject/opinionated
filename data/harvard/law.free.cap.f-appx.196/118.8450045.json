MCOTA filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). The District Court granted the motion, and also granted Ora-ma leave to file an amended complaint. Orama filed two amended complaints, and MCOTA filed another motion to dismiss or alternatively a motion for summary judgment. The District granted the second motion to dismiss, again finding that Ora-ma had failed to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review of the District Court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss is plenary. <em>Green v. America Online, </em>318 F.3d 465, 470 (3d Cir.2003). We accept as true the factual allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">Collectively, Orama\u2019s multiple complaints allege (1) that MCOTA failed to properly investigate a child support case, resulting in his false imprisonment, post-traumatic stress, and police abuse when arrested on July 21, 1999 for failure to pay child support; (2) that he submitted to genetic testing on July 29, 1999 and the DNA test results received August 24, 1999 excluded Orama as the father; (3) that the child support case against Orama was vacated in October 1999, his driver\u2019s license was restored in November 1999, and he was reimbursed for prior child support payments; (4) MCOTA abandoned him by \u201cleaving [him] homeless in the street\u201d, failing to provide mental help, and failing to provide him \u201cwith everything [he] needed\u201d; and (5) discrimination and violation of civil rights. Complaint dated 10/28/2004; Supplemental Appendix of Appellee (hereinafter \u201cSupp. Appdx.\u201d) at Ma-12 to 31 (amended complaints).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">Construing Orama\u2019s <em>pro se </em>complaint liberally, <em>Alston v. Parker, </em>363 F.3d 229, 234 (3d Cir.2004), we find that he is attempting to raise civil rights claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Orama essentially argues that his constitutional rights were violated when MCOTA failed to investigate or determine paternity prior to the child support order and/or the arrest warrant being issued. To state a claim against a county or its agency under \u00a7 1983, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>plaintiff must allege a policy or custom promulgated by that body\u2019s officers that directed or caused a constitutional deprivation. <em>Marran v. Marran, </em>376 F.3d 143, 156 (3d Cir.2004). Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Orama has properly alleged a constitutional violation, he has not alleged a policy or custom of MGOTA that led to that violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">As to Orama\u2019s other allegations that MCOTA left him homeless and failed to provide him with mental help and other assistance, we find that these vague allegations fail to satisfy the notice pleading requirement of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8, which requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Alston, </em>363 F.3d at 232-33 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Accordingly, Orama has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and we therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Orama\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-13\">. Despite the caption naming the State of New Jersey as a defendant, Orama has made clear that he was not suing the state. See Supp. Appdx. at Ma-12.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
