We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-13\">Stevens contends that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) and 960(b)(1), based on a 1966 conviction. Specifically, Stevens argues that pursuant to <em>Custis v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 485, 114 S.Ct. 1732, 128 L.Ed.2d 517 (1994), he has a constitutional right to collaterally attack his prior conviction at sentencing, despite the fact that such an attack is precluded by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e)\u2019s statute of limitations. Stevens\u2019 contention fails in light of <em>United States v. Davis, </em>36 F.3d 1424, 1438 (9th Cir.1994) (concluding that the Supreme Court in <em>Custis </em>refused to recognize a constitutional right to collaterally attack prior convictions used for sentence enhancement, except for convictions obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s right to counsel). Accordingly, the statute of limitations set forth in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851(e) bars Stevens from challenging the validity of his prior conviction for purposes of enhancing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-16\">Stevens also argues that in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the mandatory m\u00ednimums set forth by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(b) and 960(b) must be struck down, or in the alternative must be construed as advisory. Stevens\u2019 contentions are foreclosed by <em>United States v. Ching Tang Lo, </em>447 F.3d 1212, 1234 &amp; n. 15 (9th Cir.2006) (rejecting the argument that after <em>Booker </em>mandatory m\u00ednimums must be struck down rather than construed as requiring drug quantity and type to be charged in the indictment, reaffirming <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc), and stating, \u201c[t]here is nothing in <em>Booker </em>to suggest that statutorily mandated minimum sentences are merely advisory\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-17\">Finally, Stevens contends that application of the mandatory minimum pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 is unconstitutional, in that it subjects Stevens to enhanced penalties based on the fact of a prior conviction that was neither admitted nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>found to exist by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. Stevens\u2019 contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1079 (9th Cir.2005) (reaffirming that \u201ca district court may enhance a sentence on the basis of prior convictions, even if the fact of those convictions was not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt,\u201d and holding that this Court is bound by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), unless it is expressly overruled by the Supreme Court). <em>See also United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, </em>234 F.3d 411, 414-15 (9th Cir.2001) (rejecting the contention that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>has been limited \u201cstrictly to the facts of that case,\u201d and concluding that <em>\u201call </em>prior convictions \u2014 not just those admitted on the record \u2014 [are] exempt from Apprendi\u2019s general rule\u201d) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b595-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
