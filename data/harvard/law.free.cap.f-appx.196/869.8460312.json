In addition, Barrera asserts that they demonstrated a well-founded fear of future persecution and that they would not be able to safely relocate in Colombia because the FARC presents a country-wide threat. Finally, Barrera concludes that he and his wife would more likely than not be persecuted if they returned to Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">We only review \u201cthe decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Nreka v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>408 F.3d 1361, 1368 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). Because the BIA mostly adopted and affirmed parts of the IJ\u2019s decision and added comments of its own, we review both, excepting the IJ\u2019s finding of adverse credibility and the IJ\u2019s relocation analysis. To the extent that the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, our review is <em>de novo. Nreka, </em>408 F.3d at 1368. The IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201caffirm the [IJ\u2019s] decision if it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Forgue v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations and citations omitted). The substantial evidence test is \u201chighly deferential\u201d and does not allow \u201cre-weighting] the evidence from scratch.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The fact that evidence in the record may also support a conclusion contrary to the administrative findings is not enough to justify a reversal, rather, reversal is only appropriate where the record \u201ccompels\u201d it. <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1027 (11th Cir.2004), <em>cert. denied, </em>544 U.S. 1035, 125 S.Ct. 2245, 161 L.Ed.2d 1063 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">An alien who arrives in, or is present in, the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Secretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney General both have the discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1)(A) (as amended by the REAL ID Act). A \u201crefugee\u201d is defined as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-10\">any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality ..., and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">INA \u00a7 101(a)(42)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish: (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor; or (2) a \u201cwell-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Although neither the INA nor the regulations define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have discussed other circuits\u2019 holdings that \u201cpersecution is an extreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation, and that mere harassment does not amount to persecution.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1231 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotations omitted). If an alien does not establish past persecution, he bears the burden of showing a well-founded fear of future persecution by showing that: (1) he fears persecution based on his membership in a statutorily protected class; (2) there is a reasonable possibility that he will suffer persecution if removed to his native country; and (3) he could not avoid persecution by relocating to another part of his or her country, if, under all of the circumstances, it would be unreasonable to expect relocation. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2), (3)(i). Additionally, \u201can applicant must demonstrate that his or her fear of persecution is subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1289. A petitioner\u2019s claim that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution is undercut by evidence that his family remained without incident in the same region where the petitioner had allegedly been threatened. <em>See Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1259 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">Along with seeking asylum, the alien may also seek withholding of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 241, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). One significant difference between proving asylum eligibility and withholding of removal eligibility is that, to merit the latter, the alien must prove that future persecution would occur \u201cmore likely than not.\u201d <em>See Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). As the more-likely-than-not standard that applies to withholding of removal is more stringent than the well-founded-fear standard that applies to asylum, ineligibility for asylum generally precludes withholding of removal eligibility. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1292-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Barrera and his wife were not entitled to asylum or withholding of removal. First, Barrera failed to demonstrate anything more than a few isolated incidents of harassment insufficient to compel a finding that he and his wife suffered persecution. Furthermore, their allegations are undercut by the fact that Barrera\u2019s family remained in Colombia unharmed, despite their similar political involvement. Barrera\u2019s fear may have been subjectively genuine, but substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that it was not objectively reasonable. Thus, irrespective of whether Barrera\u2019s fear was sufficiently based on his political or union affiliations, or whether relocation was a viable option, the IJ\u2019s conclusion is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Because petitioners failed to demonstrate past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, their claim that they are more likely than not to be persecuted if they return to Colombia necessarily fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">For the above-stated reasons, we deny Barrera\u2019s and Pardo\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
