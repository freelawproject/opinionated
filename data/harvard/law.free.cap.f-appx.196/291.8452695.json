Dominguez contends that he was sentenced illegally pursuant to the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines in violation of the rule in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a so-called Fanfan error. The Government contends that Dominguez has waived the right to bring this issue in his plea agreement. In <em>United States v. Reyes-Celestino, </em>443 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir.2006), the court held that a similar waiver did not bar a preserved Fanfan claim because the defendant did not (1) \u201cunambiguously agree[ ] to a mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines\u201d and (2) did not \u201cexplicitly waive his right to challenge the constitutionality of the Guidelines on appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-23\">Because Dominguez did not preserve Fanfan error in the district court, our review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732 (5th Cir.2005.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, 163 L.Ed.2d 240 (2005). Dominguez cannot show that the district court\u2019s error in sentencing him pursuant to mandatory Guidelines affected his substantial rights. <em>See United States v. RoblesVertiz, </em>442 F.3d 350, 354 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-26\">Dominguez argues that he should not be required to show plain error because an objection would have been futile in light of <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>377 F.3d 464 (5th Cir.2004), <em>vacated, </em>543 U.S. 1101, 125 S.Ct. 1003, 160 L.Ed.2d 1006 (2005). He contends also that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Sentencing Guidelines was plainly erroneous because the error was structural or that prejudice should otherwise be presumed. He concedes that these arguments are foreclosed and states that they are raised to preserve them for further review. <em>See United States v. Malveaux, </em>411 F.3d 558, 560 n. 9 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 194, 163 L.Ed.2d 209 (2005); <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number><em>States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520-21 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 43, 163 L.Ed.2d 76 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Dominguez challenges the constitutionality of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). The Government contends that Dominguez waived the right to assert this question in his plea agreement. We assume, <em>arguendo </em>only, that the waiver does not bar the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), the Supreme Court held that treatment of prior convictions as sentencing factors in \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (2) was constitutional. Although Dominguez contends that a majority of the Supreme Court would now consider <em>AlmendarezTorres </em>to be incorrectly decided in light of <em>Apprendi </em>we have repeatedly rejected such arguments on the basis that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains binding. <em>See United States v. Garza-Lopez, </em>410 F.3d 268, 276 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 298, 163 L.Ed.2d 260 (2005). Dominguez concedes as much, but he raises the argument to preserve it for further review. The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b315-19\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
