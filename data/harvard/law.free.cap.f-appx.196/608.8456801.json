The parties are familiar with the facts and we do not repeat them here.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-19\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b633-20\">To be eligible for asylum, an alien must demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that \u201cthe application has been filed within [one] year after the date of the alien\u2019s arrival in the United States.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). No court has jurisdiction to review a determination by the Attorney General under this section. \u00a7 1158(a)(3). The IJ determined that Sidhu failed to present clear and convincing evidence that her application was timely; the BIA expressly found that the IJ had correctly determined that Sidhu\u2019s application was time barred. We lack jurisdiction to review this determination. <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-21\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b633-22\">The IJ\u2019s determination that Sidhu was not credible is supported by substantial evidence. The IJ based the adverse credibility determination on her finding that Sidhu was \u201ccompletely unresponsive\u201d when questioned about the details of her political activities and arrest and this finding is borne out in the record. An alien\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>lack of specificity when testifying can support an IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1153 (9th Cir.1999). The IJ also pointed to Sidhu\u2019s demeanor while testifying and her failure to provide reliable corroboration of her claims. We accord special deference to an adverse credibility determination based on demeanor, <em>id. </em>at 1151, and when an alien\u2019s credibility is in question, an IJ is permitted to consider the strength or weakness of the corroborating evidence provided. <em>Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004). Because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, we are obliged to uphold it. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an alien must demonstrate there is a clear probability that, if removed to the proposed country, she will be persecuted on account of a protected ground. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To qualify for relief under the Convention Against Torture, Sidhu must prove she would more likely than not be tortured if removed to the proposed country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). Discounting her discredited testimony, Sidhu has shown neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
