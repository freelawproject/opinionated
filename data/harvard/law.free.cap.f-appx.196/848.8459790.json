Howerton, </em>No. 05-17248 (11th Cir. Apr. 8, 2006). Because the district court dismissed the original petition on 18 October 2004 and because the Rule 60(b) motion was filed on 17 October 2005, Turner\u2019s challenge was timely, and the district court was required to consider it on the merits. However, because we deem an aspect of his Rule 60(b) motion to be a successive habeas petition, we lack jurisdiction to consider that aspect of his motion and we AFFIRM that aspect of the district court\u2019s denial. Otherwise, the district court\u2019s judgment is VACATED and the matter is REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-19\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b873-20\">In September 2002, Michael Alan Turner, a Georgia prisoner serving a life plus 20-year sentence for burglary, rape, aggravated sodomy, and aggravated assault, filed a <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 petition, stating eight grounds for relief. On 28 July 2003, the magistrate judge issued an order recommending that Turner\u2019s petition be denied, finding that: (1) parts of the petition were unexhausted for federal habeas corpus purposes; (2) the requisite exhaustion existed, however, because the claims were procedurally barred; and (3) because Turner failed to show cause and prejudice or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>fundamental miscarriage of justice to excuse the procedural default, the court was barred from considering those claims. Next, the magistrate judge determined that Turner was not entitled to federal habeas relief on the merits of his claims raised in the remaining parts of his petition. In an order dated 18 October 2004, the district court adopted, over Turner\u2019s objections, the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and ordered that the petition be \u201cdismissed.\u201d R4-38.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">On 17 October 2005, when Turner submitted his materials to prison officials, the motion currently before us was filed pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and (4),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> stating that he was seeking relief from the district court\u2019s 18 October 2004 order dismissing his habeas petition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In his motion, he first argued that, pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1), the court made a mistake when it failed to give him the option of staying the proceedings while he exhausted his unexhausted claims. Next, Turner contended that the district court inadvertently, in its final order dismissing his petition, found that ground one, subpart \u201cd,\u201d and grounds five through seven, were unexhausted, where it already had found, in its order denying the state\u2019s motion to dismiss, that those claims were exhausted. Turner further asserted that the magistrate judge incorrectly applied the law regarding procedural default, noting that: (1) he timely raised the claims in state court in a motion to amend, which the court was required to grant; (2) the state court never found that his claims were proeedurally barred; and (3) the state never argued, during the state proceedings, that his claims were procedurally barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-8\">Pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), Turner argued that the judgment of the district court was void because, in it, the court relied on state law to resolve an issue of federal law \u2014 that is, whether O.C.G.A. \u00a7 17-10-l(a) created a liberty interest in his not receiving a sentence of life imprisonment unless it was mandatory. Turner argued that the deference given to the state habeas court\u2019s ruling on the issue was \u201cjudicially irresponsible.\u201d R4-59 at 12. Turner further argued that, in finding that he was not deprived of effective assistance of counsel, the district court applied the wrong standard of review. At the conclusion of his motion, Turner pointed out that, had he been informed of his right to appeal his convictions and sentence, he would raised on direct appeal the grounds that he raised in his \u00a7 2254 petition. The district court denied the motion as untimely. <em>See </em>R4-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-9\">On appeal, Turner argues that the district court abused its discretion by denying his Rule 60(b) motion as untimely because he filed the motion within one year of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2254 petition, which was within the time allotted by Rule 60(b) and, also, a \u201creasonable time.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 4. Turner noted that the one-year limitation did not apply to his claim under Rule 60(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Before we address Turner\u2019s claims, we must first address an issue of jurisdiction. Following the resolution of that issue, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"851\">*851</page-number>proceed to address whether the district court\u2019s dismissal of Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">A. <em>Jurisdictional Issue</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">As a threshold matter, although neither party addresses the issue, we first must determine whether the district court had jurisdiction over Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See Williams v. Best Buy Co., </em>269 F.3d 1316, 1318 (11th Cir.2001) (stating that \u201c[a]ppellate courts have a responsibility to examine the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts in actions that they review\u201d); <em>McCoy v. United States, </em>266 F.3d 1245, 1248 n. 2 (11th Cir.2001) (noting that, \u201c[although our review is limited to the issues specified in the COA,\u201d we read the COA to encompass procedural issues that must be resolved in order for it to reach the merits of the issue raised in the COA). We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning a district court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction. <em>Mesa Valderrama v. United States, </em>417 F.3d 1189, 1194 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">A state prisoner who wishes to file a second or successive federal habeas corpus petition is required to move the court of appeals for an order authorizing the district court to consider such a petition. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. 2244(b)(3)(A). \u2018Without authorization, the district court lacks jurisdiction to consider a second or successive petition.\u201d <em>Farris v. United States, </em>333 F.3d 1211, 1216 (11th Cir.2003) (per curiam). In <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>the Supreme Court held that a Rule 60(b) motion that \u201cseeks to add a new ground for relief,\u201d or \u201cattacks the federal court\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits,\u201d constitutes a second or successive habeas petition. 545 U.S. 524, -, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 2648, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005) (emphasis omitted). The Court also held, however, that, \u201cwhen a Rule 60(b) motion attacks, not the substance of the federal court\u2019s resolution of a claim on the merits, but some defect in the integrity of the federal habeas proceedings,\u201d the motion should not be considered a second or successive habeas petition. <em>Id. </em>The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b875-11\">The term \u201con the merits\u201d has multiple usages. We refer here to a determination that there exist or do not exist grounds entitling a petitioner to habeas corpus relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(a) and (d). When a movant asserts one of those grounds (or asserts that a previous ruling regarding one of those grounds was in error) he is making a habeas corpus claim. He is not doing so when he merely asserts that a previous ruling which precluded a merits determination was in error-for example, a denial for such reasons as failure to exhaust, procedural default, or statute-of-limitations bar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b875-12\"><em>Id. </em>at - n. 4,125 S.Ct. at 2648 n. 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-13\">A careful review of Turner\u2019s motion reveals that he did raise one claim that fairly could be construed as an attack on the district court\u2019s resolution of the merits of his habeas petition, namely, he argued that he was not advised that he had a right to direct appeal and specifically requested <em>de novo </em>review of the district court\u2019s resolution of his claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel. Thus, to the extent that Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion challenged the merits of the district court\u2019s resolution of his \u00a7 2254 claims, it constituted a, second or successive habeas petition, and the district court lacked jurisdiction to rule on it. Accordingly, we affirm the denial, with respect to Turner\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel, but remand for the limited purpose of allowing the district court to modify its order to reflect that Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion, to the extent that it challenged the merits of the district court\u2019s resolution of his habeas petition, is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"852\">*852</page-number>B. <em>Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) Motion</em></p>\n<p id=\"Au1\">\u201c[A] district court\u2019s order under Rule 60(b) is reviewable only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla. v. Northwestern Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>198 F.3d 1332, 1338 (11th Cir.1999). The rule provides that \u201cthe [district] court may relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect ... [or] (4) the judgment is void.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). Claims under Rule 60(b)(1) must be filed within one year of the entry of the judgment or order being challenged. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b); <em>see Transit Cas. Co. v. Sec. Trust Co., </em>441 F.2d 788, 790-91 (5th Cir.1971) (noting that the one-year limitations period begins to run from the date on which the order or judgment was entered). Claims brought under Rule 60(b)(4), on the other hand, must be brought \u201cwithin a reasonable time.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). We have approved of the principle that virtually any amount of time is a \u201creasonable time\u201d for making a Rule 60(b)(4) claim. <em>See Hertz Corp. v. Alamo Rent-A-Car, Inc., </em>16 F.3d 1126, 1130 (11th Cir.1994). We need not endorse this strong claim to find that this Rule 60(b)(4) motion was filed within a reasonable time.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">To the extent that Turner\u2019s Rule 60(b) motion challenged the integrity of the habeas proceeding itself, it properly was brought as a Rule 60(b) motion. Turner\u2019s motion was filed for purposes of this deadline on 17 October 2005, and the prior petition was denied less than a year before on 18 October 2004. Because the Rule 60(b)(1) challenge was filed within a year of the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition and because the Rule 60(b)(4) challenge was filed within a reasonable time, the district court abused its discretion by finding that Turner\u2019s motion was untimely. Accordingly, we vacate and remand the remainder of the district court\u2019s order and direct that the district court consider the motion on the merits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b876-8\">Turner has appealed the district court\u2019s order denying, as untimely, his motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), in which he challenged the district court\u2019s 18 October 2004 order dismissing his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition. We granted a COA on the issue of timeliness. Because Turner\u2019s challenge was filed on 17 October 2005, it was timely, and the district court was required to consider it on the merits. However, because we deem an aspect of his Rule 60(b) motion to be a successive habeas petition, the denial of that part of Turner\u2019s claim was proper. AFFIRMED IN PART WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO ENTER JUDGMENT ON ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS, VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b874-5\">. Turner stated that he also was filing the motion pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3) and (6), but made no further argument as to those provisions. <em>See </em>R4-59.

City of Alabaster, </em>881 F.2d 1570, 1573 n. 6 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\">. The filing date stamp on Turner's motion was 19 October 2005.
