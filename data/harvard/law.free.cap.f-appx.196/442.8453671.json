Bennett challenges the district court\u2019s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> denials of (1) his motion for reconsideration of his motion for a new trial, and (2) his motion for a hearing on his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-19\">Upon review, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bennett\u2019s motion for reconsideration of his new-trial motion because the court correctly determined that Bennett would not have been entitled to relief on his new-trial motion, even if it had been timely filed, as it was based solely upon ineffective-assistance claims which could more appropriately be addressed in a proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-22\">We further conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Bennett\u2019s request for a hearing on his ineffective-assistance claims, because Bennett was not prejudiced by the denial of a hearing. <em>Cf. United States v. Holy Bear, </em>624 F.2d 853, 856 (8th Cir.1980) (appellate court\u2019s failure to address incompetency of counsel on direct appeal does not prejudice defendant, who may raise constitutional ineffective-assistance claim in \u00a7 2255 motion, and in such proceeding offer evidence to supplement record).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-23\">Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-20\">. The Honorable David S. Doty, United States District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
