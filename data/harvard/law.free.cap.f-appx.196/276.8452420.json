Ornelas appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>petition challenging the Bureau of Prisons\u2019s (BOP) method of calculating his good time credit under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3624(b). Ornelas contends that the BOP has incorrectly interpreted \u00a7 3624(b) and that he is entitled to earn 54 days of good time credit per year, based on his term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">As Ornelas is proceeding under \u00a7 2241, he is not required to obtain a certificate of appealability (COA) to proceed on appeal. <em>See Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001). In <em>Sample v. Morrison, </em>406 F.3d 310, 312 (5th Cir.2005), we held that we lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the appeal of a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition that, like Ornelas\u2019s, alleges that the BOP was miscalculating his good time credit under \u00a7 3624(b). We concluded that the prisoner, who was not yet eligible for release from prison, did not establish that he would sustain immediate injury that could be redressed by the relief requested. As such, his petition was not ripe for review. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Ornelas requests the same form of relief as the petitioner in <em>Sample. </em>Irrespective of whether Ornelas\u2019s sentence is computed on the basis of the BOP\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 3624(b) or on the basis of his own interpretation, Ornelas is not entitled to release from prison. Thus, like the petitioner in <em>Sample, </em>Ornelas\u2019s petition is not ripe for review. Accordingly, we dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Moreover, even if Ornelas\u2019s request for relief were not premature, his argument would be foreclosed by <em>Moreland v. Federal Bureau of Prisons, </em>431 F.3d 180, 186 (5th Cir.2005), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 1906, 164 L.Ed.2d 583 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">APPEAL DISMISSED; MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
