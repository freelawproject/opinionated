We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-26\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b886-27\">Based on intelligence regarding an ongoing narcotics distribution investigation, the Sheriffs Office of Pinellas County, Florida, executed a search warrant at Childs\u2019s apartment on 22 June 2005. The officers seized 122 grams of crack cocaine and three grams of cocaine powder as well as two firearms, all of which Childs admitted were his.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Childs pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>Because Childs was at least eighteen years of age when he committed the crimes, one of which was a controlled-substance offense, and he had at least two prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses, the probation officer determined that Childs was a \u201ccareer offender\u201d as defined by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 (Nov. 2005). Based on this determination, the probation officer placed Childs\u2019s total offense level at 37, the level for career offenders convicted of an offense for which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The officer deducted three points as an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility and for assisting authorities by providing timely notification of intent to plead guilty, resulting in the final offense level determination of 34. Because Childs was classified as a career offender, his criminal history category was placed at VI. Based on an offense level of 34 and a criminal history category of VI, the Sentencing Guidelines range for Childs\u2019s crimes was 262-327 months of imprisonment. U.S.S.G. Ch. 5, Pt. A.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge considered Childs\u2019s objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d). Childs\u2019s attorney argued that the calculations made by the probation officer were based on an \u201cover-representation\u201d of Childs\u2019s criminal history. R3 at 7. The judge listened to defense counsel\u2019s arguments about past convictions involving the sale of \u201cfake,\u201d rather than actual, drugs, and about Childs\u2019s troubled past. <em>Id. </em>at 8-10. Overruling these objections, the judge concluded that the probation officer\u2019s evaluation in the PSI was \u201cunquestionably correctly scored\u201d and, further, that \u201cthe considerations that trigger that policy are clearly present.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">The district judge also heard testimony from several members of Childs\u2019s family, as well as his girlfriend, regarding Childs\u2019s difficult upbringing, his struggle with criminal activities, his religious faith, and his good character. Childs testified regarding his remorse, his acceptance of responsibility, and his difficult childhood. The government declined to offer additional evidence in aggravation or mitigation of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Childs\u2019s attorney asked for the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of ten years. The judge acknowledged the \u201cimpressive group of people\u201d who spoke on Childs\u2019s behalf and the \u201cdifficulty\u201d presented by Childs\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 32. After noting the \u201cgreat threat\u201d of Childs\u2019s activities, the seriousness of Childs\u2019s offenses, Childs\u2019s mature age, and Childs\u2019s past of \u201csystematically violating the law, and spreading substances widely regarded as poison in the community,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 33, the judge sentenced Childs to 262 months as to Count 1, and 120 months as to Count 2, to run concurrently, <em>id. </em>at 35, and noted that this sentence satisfied the requirements of 18 U.S.C. 3553(a), <em>id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">Childs argues on appeal that his sentence is unreasonable because of mitigating circumstances relating to his prior convictions. Specifically, Childs contends that his classification as a career offender was inappropriate, since one of his prior convictions had been for sale of a counterfeit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>substance, when he was only eighteen years old. Moreover, Childs argues that the district judge gave inadequate consideration to his good character and difficult upbringing.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">\u201cIn reviewing the ultimate sentence imposed by the district court for reasonableness, we consider the final sentence, in its entirety, in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Martin, </em>455 F.3d 1227, 1237 (11th Cir.2006) (citations and alteration omitted). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b888-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b888-7\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam); <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">We have held that a district judge need not state on the record that he or she explicitly has considered each factor or discuss the factors individually. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 784. An acknowledgment by a district judge that he or she has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors will suffice. <em>Id. </em>In reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, \u201c \u2018we must be mindful of the factors to be considered in imposing a sentence, as set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) ], and evaluate these in light of the reasons for the imposition of the particular sentence as stated by the district court\u2019 \u201d; we further consider the district judge\u2019s statements over the entire sentencing hearing. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>435 F.3d 1350, 1355 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (citation omitted) (alteration in original). The burden of proving that the sentence is unreasonable in view of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors is on the challenger. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Although a sentence within the Sentencing Guidelines range will not be considered <em>per se </em>reasonable, the Guidelines remain central to the sentencing process. <em>Id. </em>at 787. \u201c[O]rdinarily we would expect a sentence within the Guidelines range to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788. We previously have rejected a defendant\u2019s argument that a low-end sentence was unreasonable based on the defendant\u2019s assertion \u201cthat the district court had failed to place sufficient weight on his personal characteristics and history.\u201d <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Talley, </em>we rejected a reasonableness challenge where the district judge had considered the defendant\u2019s arguments in mitigation and then sentenced the defendant at the low end of the Guidelines range. 431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">At the sentencing hearing, the district judge considered Childs\u2019s objections to the PSI but concluded that the probation officer\u2019s evaluation was correct and that \u201cthe considerations that trigger that policy are clearly present.\u201d R3 at 11. Because the district judge considered Childs\u2019s arguments in light of the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) and imposed a sentence at the low end of the Sentencing Guidelines recommendation for Childs\u2019s crimes, it did not impose an unreasonable sentence. Before issuing the sentence, the district judge so<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>licited evidence in mitigation of the sentence and considered the testimony of several witnesses, who testified as to Childs\u2019s good character, difficult upbringing, struggle with criminal activities, and religious faith. Additionally, the judge considered Childs\u2019s testimony regarding his remorse, his acceptance of responsibility, and his religious faith. After this testimony, Childs\u2019s attorney asked the judge to impose the ten-year mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">The judge rejected defense counsel\u2019s request that Childs be sentenced to the statutory minimum of ten years and decided instead to impose a sentence of 262 months in prison, a sentence at the low end of the Guidelines range. The judge noted that this sentence was being made \u201cpursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, and to the extent it is applicable after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] and pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 3553.\u201d R3 at 35. Explaining his reasoning for the sentence, the district judge found that Childs had a history of violating the law, particularly, distributing controlled substances. The judge further noted Childs\u2019s mature age and observed that Childs was \u201cgetting on toward 30.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 33. The judge recognized that Childs\u2019s activities had been a \u201cgreat threat ... to the community\u201d and that his was a \u201cserious offense,\u201d which required a \u201cserious penalty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 34. The judge was satisfied that Childs\u2019s sentence complied with the requirements of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Based on this record, Childs has not met his burden of showing that his sentence was unreasonable. The district judge considered all of defense counsel\u2019s arguments and specifically found that the sentence imposed was in compliance with \u00a7 3553(a). The district judge\u2019s findings related to the concerns of \u00a7 3553(a) with \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\u201d \u201cthe seriousness of the offense,\u201d the need \u201cto protect the public,\u201d and the Guidelines \u201csentencing range.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, Childs\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-8\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b889-9\">After pleading guilty to crimes involving possession and distribution of cocaine base and possession of firearms by a convicted felon, Childs challenged the reasonableness of his sentence on appeal. As we have explained, Childs\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-16\">. On a table next to Childs, officers found 32 grams of crack cocaine cut into small block pieces, half of a crack cocaine \u201ccookie\u201d weighing 36 grams, razor blades, $1000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"863\">*863</page-number>cash, and a box containing an additional \"cookie\u201d weighing 54 grams. In the kitchen, the officers found a drug scale, marijuana, a sauce pot with cocaine residue, plastic bags, a .32 caliber handgun, four rounds of ammunition, and an additional three grams of cocaine powder. In Childs\u2019s bedroom, the officers found a Ruger .223 rifle loaded with a full ammunition magazine holding 30 rounds of .223 ammunition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-12\">.
