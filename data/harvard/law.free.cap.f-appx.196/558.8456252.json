We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-16\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b583-17\">A reasonable factfinder would not be compelled to find that De Silva was persecuted on account of his political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Tawadrus v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1099, 1102 (9th Cir.2004) (holding that findings of fact will be upheld unless the evidence compels a contrary result). De Silva was unquestionably treated badly by a drug dealer named Grero who also killed two friends engaged in their common cause to stop drug-peddling activities, the police were unhelpful and were observed at the scene where his friends\u2019 bodies were found, and his uncle was later killed by the same gang. However, there is no evidence that these incidents occurred because of De Silva\u2019s political opinion or a political opinion imputed to him. While De Silva presented some evidence that local police attended parties at Grero\u2019s house, this evidence does not indicate that Grero was an instrument of the police, operated at their behest, or was intertwined with police operations. <em>Cf., e.g., Hasan v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 1114, 1120 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Sagaydak v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 1035, 1042-43 (9th Cir.2005). Thus, the IJ could conclude both that De Silva\u2019s reports pertained to, and that Grero\u2019s retaliation constituted, pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>vate, criminal activity that was not on account of political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Potential torture must be \u201cinflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity\u201d to warrant CAT relief. <em>Kamalthas v. INS, 251 </em>F.3d 1279, 1282 (9th Cir.2001) (quoting 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1)); <em>See also Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194 (9th Cir.2003). Even though De Silva\u2019s fear is genuine, the IJ was not compelled to find a fifty-one percent probability of official acquiescence in torture at Grero\u2019s hands if De Silva is returned to Sri Lanka.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b583-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
