To the extent we have jurisdiction, it is conferred by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reconsider, <em>Oh v. Gonzales, </em>406 F.3d 611, 612 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">The BIA was within its discretion in denying Cervantes de Romero\u2019s motion to reconsider because she failed to identify any error of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s prior decision affirming the IJ\u2019s order denying cancellation of removal. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1180 n. 2 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc). Contrary to Cervantes de Romero\u2019s contention, she failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s conduct at the hearing in her notice of appeal to the BIA or in her appeal brief before the BIA, so the issue was not previously considered and could not be subject to reconsideration. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cThe purpose of a motion to reconsider is not to raise new facts, but rather to demonstrate that the IJ or the BIA erred as a matter of law or fact.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">In her opening brief before this court, Cervantes de Romero fails to address, and therefore has waived any challenge to, the BIA\u2019s determination that the IJ properly evaluated petitioner\u2019s case under prevailing law. <em>See Martinez-Serrano v. INS, </em>94 F.3d 1256, 1259-60 (9th Cir.1996) (holding issues which are not specifically raised and argued in a party\u2019s opening brief are waived).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b555-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
