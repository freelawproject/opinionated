A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqx\">This is an action for damages for the loss of the sight of an eye of the infant plaintiff and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>consequential damages of the other plaintiff, his father, resulting from the explosion of a Pepsi-Cola bottle allegedly caused by the negligence of the defendant in bottling the carbonated beverage. Plaintiffs had a verdict at the hands of a jury in the Law Division, and defendant assigns as error on this appeal the denial by the trial court of motions for involuntary dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case and at the end of the entire case and for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">On the night of November 14-15, 1953, Jerold Bornstein, then a boy of 16, was employed as a counterman (working week-ends only) in a luncheonette on Hawthorne Avenue in Newark. At about 12:30 or 12:45 A. m. on November 15, a Sunday morning, just prior to a 1:00 A. M. closing hour to conclude a Saturday work day and evening, he and a fellow employee, Jay Klugman, began to replenish a soda cooler in the front, or service room of the establishment, with varieties of bottled soft beverages, including Pepsi-Cola, for the next day\u2019s business. Pepsi-Cola was the best seller of these sodas, and the place had just concluded a busy Saturday\u2019s business. The uncooled cases of soda, the Pepsi-Cola in 24-bottle wooden cases with sides higher than the bottles, were stored in a foyer situated between the service room and the kitchen, which was the rear room of the luncheonette suite. On the occasion in question the procedure for stocking the cooler was this: Jerold would carry a case of soda, holding it with two hands, from the foyer to the service room, and then place it on top of a garbage receptacle alongside the cooler, and of even height with it, about waist-high from the floor. From that position he lifted individual bottles out of the case, one in each hand, and set them on a horizontal sliding door on the top of the cooler. From there Klugman placed them in the cooler, one at \u00e1 time. The cases of Pepsi-Cola were the last sodas to be put in the cooler. During the transfer of the contents of a second case of Pepsi-Cola from ease to cooler-top, one of the bottles, which had been placed and was standing on the cooler door, exploded with a \u201cpop,\u201d expelling its contents and pieces of broken glass <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>in all directions. One piece struck the infant plaintiff\u2019s right eye, with the consequence noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Both Jerold and Klugman testified that neither of them struck any bottle against another while thus filling the cooler, nor did any bottle fall. The distance from foyer to cooler is short, and there is no intervening obstruction. The proofs were that on Thursday, November 12 (the place was closed the intervening Friday, November 13), the defendant\u2019s delivery man had carried 12 fresh cases of the beverage from the delivery vehicle and stacked the cases in the foyer, at the same time removing nine empty cases. The last previous delivery, also by defendant\u2019s delivery man, was of 11 cases on November 4, when 11 empty cases were removed. There were \u201ctwo or so\u201d full cases left when the November 12 delivery was made. There was no evidence whether the exploding bottle was from a left-over case or from one of those delivered November 12. There was proof that none of the full Pepsi-Oola (or other soda) cases were handled by any one after delivery to the foyer except that some of the cases may have been brought into the service room for stocking the cooler on occasion, when required, prior to the episode involving the accident. The foyer is unheated except for such incidental warmth as is projected from the grills in the service room and the oven in the kitchen. The service room was \u201ckind of hot\u201d and \u201ckind of humid\u201d on the occasion of the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">Defendant submitted proof to the effect that all of its bottles are purchased from reputable glass manufacturers, under specifications which require that they withstand a pressure of 250 pounds per square inch \u2014 a safety factor of four or five times the internal pressure of 46 to 66 pounds for normal operating conditions (from room temperature to 90 degrees Fahrenheit). The bottles, after purchase, are spot-checked for pressure-capacity by a hydrostatic test. New and used bottles are cleaned, filled and capped by separate machines. The cleaning includes a spray injection at 40 pounds per square inch. The bottles are also visually inspected for flaws. Prior to filling there is a \u201csudden shot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>of forty pounds of air pressure thrown\u201d into the bottle, which, according to the supervisor of production for the defendant, would \u201ccompletely disintegrate\u201d any bottle \u201cdefective for any reason.\u201d The system of bottling was described by the same witness as \u201cused in 95% of the bottling industry.\u201d The witness did not, however, purport to be a glass expert. Moreover, there does not seem to have been any procedure for testing filled bottles.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The motions for involuntary dismissal raised the question as to whether the doctrine of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was applicable in the circumstances of this case, there having been no direct evidence of negligence on the part of defendant in producing the bottled product which exploded or burst. Most of the early cases held that the rule of <em>res ipsa </em>was not applicable on the basis of proof of a single explosion, the incident occurring after the bottle passed from the control of the defendant manufacturer or bottler. See <em>Annotation, </em>4 <em>A. L. R. </em>1094 (1919). One of the early decisions, however, <em>Payne v. Rome Coca Cola Bottling Co., </em>10 <em>Ga. App. </em>762, 73 <em>S. E. </em>1087 <em>(Ct. App. </em>1912), held that where the plaintiff can \u201cby direct or circumstantial evidence\u201d (73 <em>S. E., </em>at <em>page </em>1088) negative any inferences that such an explosion was due to mishandling by any custodian of the bottle between the time of its passage from possession by the bottler and the mishap there will survive a permissible inference that the manufacturer is to blame. Probably the majority of cases decided since the <em>Payne </em>ease follow its broad rationale. The cases are collected in <em>Annotation, </em>4 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>466 (1949); see <em>Prosser, Law of Torts (2d ed. </em>1955), \u00a7 42, <em>pp. </em>203, 204; 2 <em>Harper and James, Law of Torts </em>(1956), \u00a7 19.5, <em>p. </em>1077, <em>n. </em>7 (\u201cit is submitted that proof of the fact of the accident coupled with a showing that the bottle was subjected to neither extreme temperature nor negligent handling after it left the bottler\u2019s control will constitute a <em>prima facie </em>ease of negligence against the bottler\u201d). Some jurisdictions follow the so-called North Carolina rule under which <em>res ipsa </em>does not apply unless there is evidence of the bursting of other bottles produced by the same defendant in substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>similar circumstances and reasonably proximate in time. <em>Ashkenazi v. Nehi Bottling Co., </em>217 <em>N. C. </em>552, 8 <em>S. E. </em>2d 818 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Although the courts of this State appear committed broadly to acceptance of the extended concept of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in this class of case, <em>Taylor v. Berner, </em>7 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>597, 146 <em>A. </em>674 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1929), reversed on the point of damages but affirmed on the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in 106 <em>N. J. L. </em>469 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1930); <em>MacPherson v. Canada Dry Ginger Ale, </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>365 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943); <em>Markowitz v. Liebert &amp; Obert, </em>23 <em>N. J. Misc. </em>281, 288, 43 <em>A. </em>2d 794 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1945); but see <em>Dunn v. Hoffman Beverage Co., </em>126 <em>N. J. L. </em>556 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1941); <em>cf. Alston v. J. L. Prescott Co., </em>10 <em>N. J. Super. </em>116, 120, 121, 124-126 <em>(App. Div. </em>1950); and see <em>Kramer v. R. M. Hollingshead Corp., 5 N. J. </em>386, 390 (1950), yet in none of the decided cases did the court have occasion to consider, as here we do, the precise nature of the function of appraisal by the trial court of the proofs purported to exclude inferences of causative connection between the conduct of others than the bottler-defendants and the damaging incident. How air-tight a factual case was required to be presented by the plaintiff negating any causal relationship between the conduct of others than the defendant and the explosion, in order to justify an affirmative answer to the question whether <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was properly invoked here to aid the plaintiff, at the conclusion of his case ? Must the proofs on that issue be such that <em>a jury </em>could, under normal rules of sufficiency of proof to make a jury issue, decide it adversely to the hypothesis of such a relationship ? Or is the criterion a finding <em>by the court </em>that the proofs are not of sufficient potency to destroy the continued subsistence of the <em>probability </em>that \"in the ordinary course of things\u201d the mishap could not have resulted unless there had been a lack of due care by the defendant? In other words, does the net balance of the probabilities from all the proofs at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case continue to preponderate for the hypothesis of defendant\u2019s negligence and its proximate causal relationship with the accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>In the <em>Taylor </em>case, <em>supra, </em>the question posed was not raised because no consideration at all was given to the possibility of negligence after delivery by the bottler; <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>was applied flatly on the basis of the assumption that an explosion of a bottle of vichy \u201cdoes not ordinarily result\u201d \u201cwith the exercise of reasonable care\u201d by the bottler (7 <em>N. J. Misc., </em>at <em>page </em>598).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">In the <em>Dunn </em>case, <em>supra, </em>which is defendant\u2019s principal reliance, the bottled sarsaparilla had been sold by the defendant bottler to a tavern and stored there for an unknown period of time prior to its sale to the plaintiff; it had then been transported in the trunk of a car some 30 miles, part way over dirt roads, before the plaintiff was injured when the bottle burst in his hand. There was no evidence as to the nature of the handling of the bottle in the tavern. The court held <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>not applicable. The court deemed that plaintiff had failed to discharge the obligation of showing, as part of his affirmative case, that there was due care in the handling of the bottle by all of its custodians after it left the control or management of defendant. Significantly, for purposes of our present inquiry, the court said (126 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>559) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">\u201cAt the conclusion of the case, when the motion for a direction of a verdict for defendant was made, it was just as reasonable to infer that while in the custody of Poole\u2019s tavern the tensile strength of the bottle had been weakened by careless handling there, as it was to infer that the defendant had been negligent in the bottling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In other words, although not thus expressly articulated, the conclusion was that on the basis of the proofs presented the basic requirement of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>no longer obtained, t. <em>e., </em>an apparent state of facts indicating that \u201cin the ordinary course of things\u201d the explosion would not have taken place if the defendant were exercising due care. <em>Mumma v. Easton &amp; Amboy Railroad Co., </em>73 <em>N. J. L. </em>653, 658 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1906). The probabilities did not preponderate toward the hypothesis of defendant\u2019s negligence as the cause of the explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>In the most recent of the New Jersey exploding beverage cases, <em>MacPherson v. Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., supra, </em>the situation closely approximated that presently involved. The plaintiff was an employee in a confectionery store and was injured when a bottle already in a cooler exploded as she opened the cooler to put other bottles in. There was no evidence as to when the offending bottle was delivered, but, as in the present case, delivery to the store was by the defendant and \u201cdue care had been used at all times\u201d in handling the bottles in the store. <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>was not mentioned, but the court relied upon <em>Taylor v. Berner, supra. </em>In affirming a judgment for the plaintiff the court said (129 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>366): \u201cThe case was one of fact. The trier of the facts was at liberty to accept the testimony of due care in subsequent handling and rest a verdict thereon.\u201d While this language is unexceptionable insofar as it may refer to the ultimate finding of the facts supporting the judgment for plaintiff, it will not serve to explain the implicit determination as to the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">A review of fundamentals reminds us that the determination of the applicability of that doctrine is a function of the court, not the jury. If the factual situation at the end of the plaintiff\u2019s case warrants its application, the court thereby determines that a <em>prima facie </em>case has been presented by the plaintiff which permits, but does not require the jury to find for him. <em>Wildauer v. Rudnevitz, </em>119 <em>N. J. D. </em>471 <em>(E. &amp; </em>A. 1938); <em>Marzotto v. Gay Garment Co., </em>11 <em>N. J. Super. </em>368, 375 (App. <em>Div. </em>1951), affirmed 7 <em>N. J. </em>116 (1951). Ordinarily, of course, the court may not determine the rule to be applicable unless it first finds that \u201cthe instrumentality or thing\u201d involved in the injurious occurrence was under the control of the party charged with liability \u25a0or his agents. <em>Hamrah v. Clements, </em>3 <em>N. J. </em>285, 289 (1949); <em>Oelschlaeger v. Hahne &amp; Co., </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>490 (1949). In these exploding bottle cases, however, the adherence to <em>res ipsa </em>notwithstanding passage of the instrumentality from control \u2022of the defendant manufacturer or bottler prior to the accident is sometimes rationalized on the theory that control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>at the time of the act of negligence, rather than at the time of injury, is sufficient. <em>Bradley v. Conway Springs Bottling Co., </em>154 <em>Kan. </em>282, 118 P. <em>2d </em>601, 604 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1941); <em>Benkendorfer v. Garrett, </em>143 <em>S. W. 2d </em>1020, 1022 <em>(Tex. Civ. App. </em>1940); and see <em>Kramer v. R. M. Hollingshead Corp., supra </em>(5 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>390); <em>Alston v. J. L. Prescott Co., supra </em>(10 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>125). But it has been aptly observed that this approach begs the question as to whether it was the bottler\u2019s negligence that proximately caused the explosion. Case Comment, 36 <em>Marquette L. Rev. </em>205, 206 (1952). It would appear preferable to discard the fiction of constructive control and rest the applicability of <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>in this type of case upon its underlying philosophy\u2014 that it is simply a device for measuring the sufficiency of one kind of circumstantial evidence, where direct evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence is typically inaccessible to plaintiff, to make out a <em>prima facie </em>case of negligence, <em>Shaw v. Calgon, Inc., </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>319, 327 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955)\u2014and that the element of control in the defendant at the time of the accident is dispensable in this kind of case, if, in the light of all the circumstances reflected by the plaintiff\u2019s proofs, including the strength of his negation of causative relationship between the conduct of the plaintiff and others than the defendant and the harmful event, it still appears probable \u201cin the ordinary course of things\u201d that the accident (explosion) was the proximate result of defendant\u2019s negligence. 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 19.7, <em>p. </em>1087; <em>Prosser, op. cit., supra </em>(\u00a7 42, <em>p. </em>205).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">It should now be clear that of the two alternative criteria posed earlier in this opinion for determining the sufficiency of the plaintiff\u2019s case to withstand a motion for dismissal in this kind of action, absent any evidence of defendant\u2019s negligence other than the event of the explosion of the bottle, the second is the appropriate one. It is for the court itself to determine, on the basis of its own judgment \u201cas to the general experience of mankind\u201d <em>(cf. Cicero v. Nelson Transportation Co., Inc., </em>129 <em>N. J. L. </em>493, 495 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1943), whether the probabilities still preponderate for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>hypothesis of defendant\u2019s negligence as the cause of the explosion after weighing the force of plaintiff\u2019s evidentiary exclusion of other possible factors, including his own conduct. If they do, <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>applies, entirely apart from the circumstance that it will ultimately be for the jury to consider all the facts and to determine whether the parties have sustained the burden of proof normally allocable to them, respectively, as to such matters as negligence, contributory negligence and proximate cause (including the incidence of responsible intervening cause). See 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cit., supra, </em>\u00a7 19.8, <em>p. </em>1093.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><em>We </em>thus arrive at the question as to whether -the trial court correctly determined that <em>res ipsa loquitur </em>precluded a dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case. Factually the situation is closely comparable with that presented in the <em>MacPherson </em>case, <em>supra. </em>It is stronger in the sense that here the offending bottle was shown not to have been in the luncheonette more than 11 days, and probably only three days. In the <em>MacPherson </em>case there was no evidence as to when the bottle was delivered to the store. It is strongly inferable from the proofs that the exploding bottle was not touched from the time the case was delivered by defendant until the plaintiff carried it into the service room. The proofs tend to negate any untoward handling of the bottle at that time. Contrary to the factual conclusion by the court in the <em>Dunn </em>case, <em>supra, </em>as to the particular situation there manifested, it does not here appear from the proofs, as they stood at the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s case, to be as probable that the explosion was the result of mishandling of the bottle by others than defendant, <em>or of </em>other causes not defendant\u2019s responsibility, as that the responsible and proximate cause was lack of due care by defendant in putting out the product. <em>Res ipsa loquitur </em>precluded dismissal at the end of plaintiff\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\"> <em>We </em>do not reach a more favorable conclusion upon defendant\u2019s contentions that there should have been a dismissal at the end of the entire ease, or the grant of a new trial on the thesis that the jury verdict was against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>weight of the evidence. The weight to be accorded defendant\u2019s detailed proofs concerning its exercise of care in bottling the beverage was for the jury. <em>MacPherson v. Canada Dry Ginger Ale, Inc., supra </em>(129 <em>N. J. L., </em>at <em>page </em>366). As tort duty is measured by the scope of the risk which negligent conduct foreseeably entails, 2 <em>Harper and James, op. cii., supra, </em>\u00a7 18.2, <em>p. </em>1018, it is fair to assess the duty of a producer of bottled carbonated beverages which have the capacity for sudden explosion and serious hurt to bystanders in terms of such reasonable care as takes account of the kind of handling and the range of atmospheric change to which bottles of such beverages are commonly and foreseeably subjected in ordinary commercial experience. <em>Cf. Harpell v. Public Service Coordinated Transport, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>309, 315-317 (1956). \u201cThe public * * * does not expect to handle beverage bottles with all the tenderness of a new father for his first born child.\u201d <em>Dingwall, \u201cExploding Bottles,\u201d </em>11 <em>NACCA L.
