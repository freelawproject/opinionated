J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AX2\">Plaintiff, as general administrator and as administrator <em>ad prosequendum, </em>appeals from a Superior Court, Law Division, judgment in favor of defendant Carras in an intersectional automobile negligence action resulting in the death of his decedent, George D. Mitilenes.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">Decedent was a passenger in the Carras automobile travelling east on Branford Place, Newark, at 6 A. M. on the morning of the accident. Defendant Eobert Snead was driving defendant Walter Snead\u2019s car north on Washington Street.- The intersection at Branford Place and Washington Street is controlled by traffic signals. As in all actions of this nature, each defendant places the blame on the other. Carras claims that the green light was in his favor as he proceeded through the intersection. He testified that the first time he saw the Snead car was \u201ca split second before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>the impact,\u201d and this was repeated several times during direct and cross-examination. He tried to apply his brakes and veer to the left, but these efforts to escape collision were unsuccessful; his testimony was \u201cThe moment I saw it, it hit.\u201d The jury returned a verdict in favor of plaintiff against Eobert Snead, a verdict of no cause of action against Carras, and a verdict in favor of Carras on his cross-claim against Snead. The claim against Walter Snead was dismissed with prejudice at pretrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Eobert Snead filed no appeal from either of the judgments against him. However, by letter sent through counsel he informally sought leave to adopt appellant\u2019s brief and join in the appeal. Such leave cannot be granted. There was no timely filing and service of a notice of appeal from either of the judgments, and they cannot be disturbed. <em>In re Pfizer's Estate, </em>6 <em>N. J. </em>233, 239 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">The basis of plaintiff\u2019s present appeal is that the trial court improperly refused to permit Carras to be cross-examined as to testimony given in a previous criminal proceeding, arising out of the same accident, the contention being that it was inconsistent with Carras\u2019 testimony in the instant proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">The cross-examination in question was by counsel for Snead, not plaintiff. Carras was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-7\">\u201cQ. Was this question asked you [in the criminal proceeding] : \u2018When you first saw this ear you say it was just a question of a second before the impact occurred. Is that right?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-8\">And at that point the Court said: \u2018He saw the other car a split second before the impact.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-9\">Then the question: \u2018At that time can you tell the Court and the jury where the car was, the car that struck you?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-11\">Your answer: T did not see that car, sir.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-12\">Was that your answer to that question at the time?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-13\">Eollowing extended colloquy, the court refused to allow the question to be answered. After reading the page of the transcript from which counsel was quoting, as well as the preceding page where Carras had testified that he first saw the Snead car \u201ca split second before\u201d the collision, the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>judge stated that he did not see \u201ca sufficient clarity in contradiction to allow it.\u201d Counsel acquiesced in the ruling. Thereupon plaintiff\u2019s attorney, who had already completed his cross-examination, began to importune the court to change its ruling. After further colloquy, the trial judge adhered to his position and said: <em>\u201cI </em>will not permit the taking of one question out of context. * * * [U]nder the <em>Then </em>case <em>[State v. Then, </em>118 <em>N. J. L. </em>31 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1937), affirmed 119 <em>N. J. L. </em>429 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1938)] everything that was said on the point at that moment should be admitted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Counsel for plaintiff did not undertake to offer the remainder of the transcript. The court\u2019s adherence to its ruling is the sole basis of the present appeal. Plaintiff\u2019s argument is that the testimony sought to be adduced under cross-examination by counsel for Snead was directly relevant to the issue. He claims that had the latter successfully attacked the witness\u2019 credibility in this regard, the jury might well have refused to accept Carras\u2019 testimony, which Snead disputed, as to the color of the light, and this under the familiar doctrine of false in one thing, false in everything. <em>Clark v. Public Service Electric Co., </em>86 <em>N. J. L. </em>144 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1914). He asserts, further, that had the conflicting testimony been admitted, the jury might then have reasonably found that Carras\u2019 failure to see the Snead car was occasioned by his failure to make a proper observation, or any observation at all. <em>Duffy v. Cratsley, </em>29 <em>N. J. Super. </em>141 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">It is elementary that a prior contradictory declaration of any party to the litigation, inconsistent with or contradictory of his present claim, is admissible by the opposing party to neutralize the testimony of the declarant, and once admitted into evidence it may be used as substantive, affirmative proof. <em>New Amsterdam Casualty Co. v. Popovich, </em>18 <em>N. J. </em>218, 224 (1955); <em>Link v. Eastern Aircraft, etc., </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>540, 541 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). The extent to which the introduction of such evidence is permitted on cross-examination of a party has in this State often been said to be within the sound discretion of the trial court, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>exercise will not be interfered with in the absence of palpable mistake. <em>Palkoski v. Garcia, </em>32 <em>N. J. Super. </em>343, 351 <em>(App. Div. </em>1954), affirmed 19 <em>N. J. </em>175 (1955); <em>Disque v. State, </em>49 <em>N. J. L. </em>249, 250 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1887), where Chief Justice Beasley observed that the general practice in both civil and criminal cases is to permit a testifying party \u201cto be cross-examined [as] to the whole case, and such judicial action, being founded in discretion, is not a matter on which error can be assigned.\u201d However, in the more recent case of <em>State v. Bartell, </em>15 <em>N. J. Super. </em>450, 455 <em>(App. Div. </em>1951), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>by an equally divided court in 10 <em>N. J. </em>9 (1952), where the cases are reviewed, this court declared that althoxrgh cross-examination solely tending to test the credibility of a witness rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge, subject only to the consequences of its abuse, \u201ccross-examination of a party on matters directly in issue or directly relevant to the issue is a matter of right.\u201d To the same effect see <em>Prout v. Bernards Land &amp; Sand Co., </em>77 <em>N. J. L. </em>719, 721 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1909); <em>Fidelity Union Trust Co. v. Sayre, </em>137 <em>N. J. Eq. </em>179, 181 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1945). And where failure to permit cross-examination seriously affects the substantial rights of a party to the suit, a judgment based upon such failure will not be permitted to stand. <em>Liberatori v. Yellow Cab Co. of Philadelphia, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super. </em>470, 478 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">But an unhampered right to probe the recesses of doubt and uncertainty should not be mistaken for a free rein to put to a witness questions as to statements previously made, when the fair meaning of those statements has not survived the separation of them from their original context. We have examined the pages of the transcript of the prior criminal proceeding, having permitted the appendix to be supplemented on motion of defendant Carras. Now that we have the benefit of that transcript, and considering it in relation to the cross-examination attempted by Snead\u2019s counsel in the present ease, we cannot reasonably say that the trial judge erred when he said that he saw no \u201csufficient clarity of contradiction\u201d to warrant the question being pressed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>counsel. His ruling was that he would not permit the taking of one question out of context unless everything that was said on the point at that moment were admitted. Such a ruling was within the trial court\u2019s discretion. It did not impede proper cross-examination as to relevant matters, but required only that it be done in fairness to the party-witness being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">We do not address ourselves to the present attempt of plaintiff\u2019s counsel to fasten upon the trial court\u2019s alleged error in limiting cross-examination of Carras by Snead\u2019s counsel. In referring to the <em>Then </em>case and stating that \u201ceverything that was said on the point at that moment should be admitted,\u201d the trial court in effect invited plaintiff\u2019s counsel to present to the court and jury all of the evidence given by Carras in the prior proceedings, so that his testimony at that time would appear in a comprehensive setting. Counsel did not take advantage of the opportunity thus afforded him. Paraphrasing <em>Grobart v. Society for Establishing Useful </em>Manufactures, <em>2 N. J. </em>136, 146 (1949), neither the trial court nor the opposing party could be forced into the position of buying a pig in a poke \u2014 that is, the answer \u201cI did not see that car\u201d divorced from its full context.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">We should observe that the protracted colloquy which followed immediately after the attempt by Snead\u2019s counsel to cross-examine Carras as to what he said in the previous proceeding was carried on within hearing of the jury, so that it was fully exposed to what Carras had said by way of alleged contradiction in the criminal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">We perceive no prejudice visited upon plaintiff. It has not been demonstrated that the trial court\u2019s ruling was inconsistent with substantial justice. <em>R: B. </em>1:5-3(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
