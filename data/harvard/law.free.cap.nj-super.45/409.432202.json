A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"As0\">This is an appeal by defendant, an upland property owner, from a judgment of the Law Division of this court, sitting without a jury, in the amount of $1,375, awarded to plaintiff, a lowland property owner, for damages sustained when the foundation wall of his home collapsed from the force of surface waters during the hurricane \u201cConnie.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">The defendant, in the spring of 1954, constructed an athletic field on a 10- or 11-acre tract to the northeast of plaintiff\u2019s premises, separated from it by a wooded area 150 feet wide. Prior to the athletic field construction the tract had naturally sloped downwardly toward the intervening wood lot, and continued in its down-slope toward the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>tiff\u2019s premises. In the construction, however, soil was taken from the tract\u2019s higher end and used to fill in the lower end, thus leveling it except for a slight rise in the center with a tapering off toward the sides for the drainage of surface waters. Additionally, for adequate drainage of the surface water over the westerly half of the athletic field there was installed a system of five catch basins, connected by means of a series of pipes to a drainage outlet where the water discharges into a riprap or rubble stone to retard its flow. This outlet is about 25 feet higher in elevation than plaintiff\u2019s house and approximately 300 feet from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">On August 13, 1955, more than one year subsequent to the leveling of the athletic field and the installation of the drainage system, hurricane \u201cConnie\u201d struck with all its fury and plaintiff\u2019s foundation wall crumbled \u2014 so he testified \u2014 \u25a0 from the waters rushing from defendant\u2019s drainage outlet. According to his testimony, he was awakened at 4:00 in the early morning to find that the \u201cwhole rear of the house was all pushed in\u201d and \u201cthe cellar was full of mud and water\u201d and he saw \u201ca steady stream of water * * * just like a small brook.\u201d When he followed the water to its source he found it was coming out of the drainage outlet on defendant\u2019s property and he then worked until 6:00 or 7:00 in the morning to build a barrier which temporarily diverted the flow of water away from his house. He testified that the water was not from natural drainage, but exclusively from the drainage outlet; and that it passed over a ditch which had been dug prior to the mishap as the consequence of a complaint by him that water was flowing toward his property. The ditch, he' testified, had gradually \u201cfilled up with silt, sand and mud\u201d during previous rainstorms. He admitted, however, that prior to this mishap there had been \u201cno water to come up close to the house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Mr. Waer, a mason contractor, and plaintiff\u2019s brother-in-law, testified that plaintiff\u2019s basement wall had been constructed with eight-inch blocks and was \u201ca very safe wall.\u201d However, although he was at plaintiff\u2019s premises 15 to 30 minutes after the mishap, when asked whether he could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>see where the water was coming from, he testified \u201cJust out of the woods.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">The testimony given on defendant\u2019s behalf was that the intercepting ditch was not dug because of a complaint but to lay a wall footing for a fence; that after the hurricane there was no evidence of erosion which would indicate that water had passed over this 20 inch deep ditch rather than along it and away from the plaintiffs premises; and that the ditch was not filled with silt at the place plaintiff claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Mr. Burris, an engineer, testified that the flow-off of water from the field in its present state is no different from that which occurred in its original natural state. This testimony was later modified somewhat to the effect that there is \u201cno appreciable increase of run-off\u201d but a concentration of it at the drainage outlet. He also testified that, in his opinion, the wall collapse was not occasioned by surface water drainage from the athletic field, but subsurface pressure which had built up because of the percolation of rain waters into the clay soil that surrounds plaintiff\u2019s house; that this pressure could have been alleviated and the damage averted by a drain pipe around the base of its foundation; and lastly, that if the water had been entering the plaintiff\u2019s basement at the rate claimed it would have filled within an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">The defendants argue three grounds for reversal: (1) that plaintiff failed to establish that the alleged negligence was the proximate cause of his injury; (2) that the trial court erred in failing to consider the hurricane \u201cConnie\u201d to be an extraordinary act of nature not reasonably to bo guarded against \u2014 more familiarly put, \u201can act of God\u201d; and (3) that the trial court\u2019s conclusions were not supported by the evidence. The latter ground merely restates the contentions previously made and will not be treated separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The litigants agree that the present case is controlled by the principles of law set forth and reconsidered at length in two recent cases of <em>Yonadi v. Homestead Country Homes, 35 N. J. Super. </em>514 <em>(App. Div. </em>1955), on petition for recall of mandate, 42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>521 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956); and <em>Armstrong v. Francis Corp., </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>320 (1956). In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>Yonadi </em>case, Judge Clapp reviewed the decisional law of this State which until that time had subscribed to the so-called \u201ccommon enemy\u201d rule, <em>Town of Union v. Durkes, </em>38 <em>N. J. L. </em>21 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1875). This rule recognizes the often harmful effects of surface waters and upholds each landowner\u2019s privilege to rid his land of them by any means he chooses. Judge Clapp there stated that \u201cThe general rule is that neither the diversion nor the altered transmission, repulsion or retention of surface water gives rise to an actionable injury,\u201d <em>Bowlsby v. Speer, </em>31 <em>N. J. L. </em>351 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1865). He observed, however, that to this general rule has been engrafted the exception that \u201ca defendant renders himself absolutely liable if by means of * * * an artificial device [such as drains, ditches, and other contrivances] he causes surface water to be carried in a body large enough to do substantial injury (usually drainage from a large tract) and thereby casts it on plaintiff\u2019s lands away from where it otherwise would have flowed.\u201d <em>Yonadi v. Homestead Country Homes, supra, </em>35 <em>N. J. Super., </em>at <em>page </em>519.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Subsequently, however, in the <em>Armstrong </em>case, Justice Brennan, speaking for a unanimous court, observed that while our decisions have long recited the common enemy rule, the exception set forth in the <em>Yonadi </em>case and others are in fact more closely reconciled with the more realistic doctrine of \u201creasonable use.\u201d He states, as his opinion, that these were but applications of the reasonable use rule applied under the guise of exceptions to the common enemy rule. He then concluded that the court would adhere in terms as well as in actual practice prospectively to the doctrine of \u201creasonable use.\u201d Thus, New Jersey, by the <em>Armstrong </em>case, has adopted the rule of \u201creasonable use\u201d which provides \u201cthat each possessor is legally privileged to make a reason*able use of his land, even though the flow of surface waters is altered thereby and causes some harm to others, but incurs liability when his harmful interference with the flow of surface waters is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Armstrong v. Francis Corp., supra, </em>20 <em>N. J., </em>at <em>page </em>327; <em>vide, \u201cInterferences with Surface Waters,\u201d </em>24 <em>Minn. L. Rev. </em>891, (1940), <em>Prosser, Torts </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>(2d ed. </em>1955), <em>sec. </em>72, <em>p. </em>415; Restatement, <em>Torts, sec. </em>833, <em>p. </em>269, (1939); <em>Annotation, </em>12 <em>A. L. R. 2d </em>1338. This rule in its application has the particular virtue of flexibility, each ease presenting questions of fact as to the amount and character of harm caused, its foreseeability, and the purpose or motive of the possessor in dispelling water from his property, as well as other relevant matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\"> The application of this principle of law to the facts found by the trial court in the instant case brings us to the same result. The questions posed for review are principally factual in nature and the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to them will not lightly be disturbed unless these conclusions are so unsupported by the evidence as to offend the interests of justice. <em>New Jersey Highway Authority v. J. &amp; F. Holding Co., </em>40 <em>N. J. Super. </em>309, 317 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956). As to the determination of causation, the factor of credibility played an important role. The trial court in his determination chose to believe the plaintiff, the only eyewitness to the mishap, that the basement wall was pushed in because of the volume of surface water directed toward it, and that in seeking a method to stem the onrush of water the plaintiff found the source to be the \u201csteady stream of water coming out of the open drain.\u201d Also, that the flow of the water was not stemmed by the ditch, which had filled with silt and. mud, and though its force was appreciably spent while flowing down the hillside, the water nevertheless reached his house as a \u201csteady stream.\u201d The testimony offered to refute the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, is that of witnesses who viewed the scene only after the storm had subsided and found no evidence of the waters having passed over the ditch, or of silt and mud in it, and the testimony of an expert witness that the more likely cause was subsurface pressure. We find no convincing reason for disturbing the trial court\u2019s conclusions as to the cause of plaintiff\u2019s damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\"> In support of defendant\u2019s contention that \u201cConnie\u201d was an unforeseeable \u201cact of God\u201d defendant relies principally upon <em>Bauer v. 141-149 Cedar Lane Holding Co., </em>42 <em>N. J. Super. </em>110 <em>(App. Div. </em>1956), affirmed 24 <em>N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>139 (1957), where this court stated that the hurricanes \u201cEdna\u201d and \u201cConnie\u201d were extraordinary acts of nature, \u201cnot reasonably to be guarded against.\u201d In the context of that case \u2014 where a cellar wall of leased premises was to be coated with a water-proofing compound to keep out water seepage and dampness * * * the hurricanes were not reasonably to be guarded against. But that conclusion is not so easily reached in the instant matter where the problem is the disposal of surface water, and the consequences of the system used might well result, as they did here, in the destruction of the foundation wall of the lowland house. It is true that there was no damage to plaintiff\u2019s house for more than a year after the construction of the athletic field, and this is a compelling factor. There is conflicting testimony of an earlier complaint but we find it to be unconvincing. However, can it be seriously contended that one can point a drain outlet, fed by five catch basins, as a cannon, at his neighbors land and then plead surprise when a heavy rain, or even a hurricane, provides the ammunition for the resulting damage? We think not. The trial court concluded that the damage to plaintiff\u2019s house was not caused solely by an act of God, but that a contributing cause was the collection of surface waters expelled through an artificial device. It has long been settled that when there has been a finding of wrongdoing which is an efficient and cooperative cause of the mishap, the wrongdoer is not relieved from liability by proof that an act of God was a concurring cause. <em>New Brunswick Steamboat Canal Transp. Co. v. </em>Tiers, 24 <em>N. J. L. </em>697 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1853); <em>Van Cora v. Trowbridge Outdoor Adv. </em>Corp., 18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>1, 4, <em>(App. Div. </em>1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">We are of the view that the trial court properly concluded that under the facts here present the damage to neighboring property from the accumulation of surface waters on defendant\u2019s land during the early stages of hurricane \u201cConnie\u201d and their propulsion onto the plaintiff\u2019s land by the drainage system defendant had installed was reasonably to be guarded against by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
