A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AYA\">Appellant was convicted of armed robbery. His previous conviction of the same offense was reversed for error in admitting a purported confession. <em>State v. Petrolia, </em>21 <em>N. J. </em>453 (1956). The present appeal is predicated upon an alleged error in the charge of the trial court on the subject of flight by an accused, and on asserted improper limitation in the cross-examination of a self-confessed accomplice.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-14\">The record discloses that Petrolia was arrested and charged with the crime on August 7, 1950. He was released in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>substantial bail and shortly thereafter disappeared. Pour years later he was located in Chicago where he was living and working under an assumed name. Extradition was waived and he was returned for trial. The explanation given at the trial for his departure was not persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae2\">In charging the jury on the subject the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">\u201cThere has also been brought out in the testimony the fact that the defendant, Benjamin Petrolia, left the jurisdiction of the State of New Jersey and went to Chicago, Illinois, and there changed his name, while he was under bail, and that he was picked up there about four years later on a fugitive warrant. In the law that is what is known as flight. The courts have held that flight does not carry with it a rebuttable presumption of guilt, because there can be no presumption of guilt in a criminal matter, and is merely a circumstance which may tend to show consciousness of guilt, which should be weighed by the jury with all other facts and circumstances. Unexplained flight by a person charged with crime is sufficient to raise an inference of guilt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The asserted objection thereto was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">\u201cThe next point, your Honor, is number 9. Tour Honor has correctly charged the law of flight as far as your Honor went, but your Honor did not say as requested, and as is proper to charge, that he gave an explanation for the flight, namely, fear of a repetition of the police brutality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">Obviously, the criticism has to do with the failure to discuss the factual explanation given by the defendant for leaving the State and the failure to charge request number 9 in that connection as presented by the defense. The text of the request makes plain this conclusion. It is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-11\">\u201c9. Plight by a person accused of crime, when unexplained, raises an inference or presumption of guilt. Such inference or presumption is rebutted by the defendant\u2019s testimony that he left the State of New Jersey because he feared a repetition of the specific brutality inflicted upon him by the Paterson Police, as put in evidence by the defendant and his witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">Manifestly it would not have been proper to instruct the jury as a matter of law that the defendant\u2019s explanation of his flight \u201crebutted\u201d the \u201cinference or presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>guilt\u201d -which, according to his own request to charge, arose from his departure from the State. The probative force of the defendant\u2019s explanation, of course, was a matter for jury determination. And it is significant to note that refusal to charge this request is not made a ground of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">When the objection was made and request to charge number 9 was referred to, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">\u201cWell, I did not need to charge that. I left it up to the jury to decide whether there was an explanation or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">Mr. Bozza : Otherwise, it is a most commendable charge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">Now defendant argues that prejudicial error was committed when the jury was told that unexplained flight is sufficient to raise an \u201cinference\u201d of guilt. Patently no objection of that nature was interposed. In fact, defendant asked the court to charge that such flight raises \u201can inference or presumption of guilt.\u201d The word \u201cpresumption\u201d has a more unfavorable impact than the words actually used. See <em>State v. D\u2019Amato, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>185 <em>(App. Div. </em>1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The earlier cases on the subject of unexplained flight say that it raises \u201csome presumption of guilt akin to the presumptions deemed to arise upon the fabrication of false evidence, or the suppression of true evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Jaggers, 71 N. J. L. 281 (E. &amp; A. </em>1904); <em>State v. Harrington, </em>87 <em>N. J. L. </em>713 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1915). Later ones say that it raises \u201can inference\u201d of guilt. <em>State v. Menzel, </em>136 <em>N. J. L. </em>233 <em>(Sup. Ct. </em>1947), affirmed <em>per curiam </em>137 <em>N. J. L. </em>616 <em>(E. &amp; A. </em>1948). And the latest expressions of the doctrine seem to be that such flight \u201cis a circumstance tending to prove consciousness of guilt.\u201d <em>State v. Centalonza, </em>18 <em>N. J. Super. </em>154, 161 <em>(App. Div. </em>1952); <em>State v. D\u2019Amato, supra, </em>26 <em>N. J. Super. </em>188. In fact, in <em>D\u2019Amato </em>a flat statement that flight \u201ccarries with it a rebuttable presumption of guilt\u201d was declared prejudicially erroneous. In our judgment the preferable instruction to the jury, and the one which accords to a greater extent with the theory of criminal trials, is that which speaks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>of unexplained flight as a circumstance tending to prove a consciousness of guilt. 20 <em>Am. </em>Jur., Evidence, \u00a7 293, at 274 (1939). However, it cannot be said that the use of the term inference of guilt in the context of the charge constitutes error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The point pursues another tack. The suggestion is that when the court said: \u201cIn the law that is what is known as flight,\u201d in effect he charged as a matter of law that the defendant on the facts proven was guilty of the type of flight which gives rise to an inference of guilt. We do not think such an interpretation is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">It will be noted that the charge first outlined expressly and by implication the facts relied upon by the State, namely, that after Petrolia had been arrested, charged with the crime and released on bail, he left the jurisdiction, went to Chicago, changed his name and four years later was apprehended there on a fugitive warrant. Then in effect the court said that accepting those facts \u201cthat is what is known as flight.\u201d In view of the language which followed, it would be hypercritical to say that prejudice resulted from the characterization of those specific facts as flight. The statement continued that flight (meaning the departure under the circumstances stated) \u201cdoes not carry with it a rebuttable presumption of guilt, because there can be no presumption of guilt in a criminal matter, and is merely a circumstance which may tend to show consciousness of guilt, which should be weighed by the jury with all other facts and circumstances.\u201d And finally it concluded that \u201c[ujnexplained flight by a person charged with crime is sufficient to raise an inference of guilt.\u201d That is, the departure was a circumstance which may tend to show a consciousness of guilt or which raises an inference of guilt, if unexplained. Of course, if the defendant\u2019s reason for leaving New Jersey was sufficiently credible or adequate to prevent or neutralize any tendency to indicate a consciousness of guilt or any inference of guilt, the departure could have no adverse influence against him. His reasons were laid fully before the jury and it was up to them to appraise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>their substance as preventive or neutralizing agents. Under the circumstances, while it would have been more explicit and more desirable to conform the language used to that appearing in the <em>Centalonza </em>case, we find no plain error on this score which warrants reversal. <em>State v. Picciotti, </em>12 <em>N. J. </em>205 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Finally, it is contended that the cross-examination of a self-confessed accomplice of the defendant was unduly restricted. For example, complaint is made as to the propriety of sustaining the objection to the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-6\">\u201cQ. Isn\u2019t it a fact that the reason why yon aren\u2019t now incriminating Mike Leonforte [a co-indictee], <em>who is named to the police in your </em>statement, is because you are afraid of Trigger Mike Leonforte?\u201d (Insertion and emphasis ours)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">The witness had denied that he ever knew the person named in the question. No such person was tried for the offense. There was no proof whatever or offer of proof that such a person was named in his statement to the police, and no offer of proof of any kind to support the suggestion that the witness was or might be afraid of Leonforte. In our judgment, the refusal to allow this question and the others referred to in the brief does not constitute reversible error. The jury was instructed fully as to the care and caution that should be exercised in scrutinizing the accomplice\u2019s testimony and on the whole record it cannot be said that the defendant suffered any prejudice as the result of the interrogation of the confessed associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
