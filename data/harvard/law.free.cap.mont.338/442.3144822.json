K.M. informed Ariegwe that she also lived in Great Falls, and she directed him to the online profile associated with her screen name (online pseudonym). The profile contained descriptive information-including K.M.\u2019s age, which was listed as 15-and her picture. The two of them chatted for awhile, and Ariegwe gave K.M. his telephone number.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">\u00b64 K.M. called Ariegwe the following evening (January 16) and again the next morning (January 17). In the course of these conversations, Ariegwe mentioned that he was divorced and that he had a 9-year-old son. K.M. informed Ariegwe that his age did not bother her \u201cbecause [she] wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything with him.\u201d (K.M. later explained at Ariegwe\u2019s trial that because she was homeschooled and worked upwards of thirty hours a week as a babysitter, contact over the Internet was one way for her to make friends.) K.M. and Ariegwe also discussed alcoholic beverages, and K.M. disclosed that she had previously tried mm.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">\u00b65 During the conversation on January 17, K.M. and Ariegwe arranged to meet later that morning at a local car dealership, where K.M. would be dropping off her mother\u2019s car for servicing. Upon arriving at the dealership, Ariegwe found K.M. in the waiting area. The two talked briefly and then decided to leave. Ariegwe drove K.M. to his house (which he shared with his ex-wife, his son, and his daughter), and upon arriving, they proceeded down to Ariegwe\u2019s living quarters in the basement. As for what transpired next, KM.\u2019s and Ariegwe\u2019s stories diverge dramatically.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">\u00b66 According to K.M., Ariegwe went upstairs to get some glasses in which to serve them each an alcoholic beverage. Meanwhile, he had given her permission to play Nintendo, but K.M. was not able to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the game to work, so she just sat on the couch and waited. When Ariegwe came back downstairs, he poured K.M. a glass of liquor and she drank it. Ariegwe then sat next to K.M. on the couch and they watched television. After a couple of minutes, Ariegwe began playing with KM.\u2019s hair and kissing her neck. K.M. told him to stop doing this, but he replied that she should give him a chance to show her that he\u2019s good with his tongue. Ariegwe then pulled K.M. onto his lap and, in so doing, bruised her left arm. He continued to kiss her neck and then pulled up her shirt and her bra and began kissing her breasts, notwithstanding KM.\u2019s insistence that he stop. He also stuck his hands between her legs and started rubbing her, after which he got on his knees on the floor and began biting in between her legs.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">\u00b67 K.M. tried to push Ariegwe away. She told him that she wanted to leave, at which point he served her two more glasses of liquor, which she drank, as she later explained, \u201c[b]ecause I was stupid.\u201d Thereafter, Ariegwe and K.M. stood up and he hugged her. She thought he was going to take her back to the car dealership, but instead he moved her over to the bed a short distance away where he laid her down, straddled her, removed most of her clothing, and performed oral sex-again, notwithstanding KM.\u2019s demand that he stop. Ariegwe then attempted several times to penetrate K.M. The first attempt occurred on the bed, but K.M. managed to slide out from underneath him. She fell on the floor, where he persisted to attempt to penetrate her, but K.M. kept sliding out from underneath him. Eventually, K.M. ended up at the bottom of the stairs, where Ariegwe finally penetrated her for about twenty seconds. He apparently pulled away before climaxing, which enabled KM. to retrieve her clothing and get dressed. Ariegwe asked KM. if she was okay, to which she replied, \u201cNo.\u201d He then got dressed and drove her back to the car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">\u00b68 According to Ariegwe, by contrast, he did not have any sexual contact with K.M. Rather, upon arriving at the house, K.M. accompanied Ariegwe down to the basement and they sat down to talk. KM. stated that she wanted an alcoholic beverage, so Ariegwe retrieved a bottle of liquor from the utility room, set the bottle on top of his entertainment center, and went upstairs to get drinking glasses. When he returned to the basement, he found K.M. sitting on the couch and playing the Nintendo game without his permission. He also observed that she was drinking directly from the bottle of liquor, was becoming \u201ctoo playful\u201d and \u201cvery hyper,\u201d and was \u201ctouching everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">\u00b69 Ariegwe put the liquor away and brought K.M. back to the couch to talk and watch televsion. After about ten or twenty minutes, KM. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>indicated that she wanted to leave, at which point the two of them walked over to the stairs. When K.M. took the first step, she staggered and fell backwards, prompting Ariegwe to grab K.M.\u2019s arm to stabilize her. He led her up the stairs and then drove her back to the car dealership.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">\u00b610 That afternoon, K.M. telephoned her best friend R.K. Although she did not disclose all of the details, K.M. confided to R.K. that she had had sex with a man in his thirties. Unbeknownst to K.M., this brief conversation was recorded on an answering machine at R.K.\u2019s house. R.K\u2019s parents heard the conversation and contacted KM.\u2019s parents, who confronted K.M. the next morning. K.M. acknowledged a sexual encounter and stated that it had been involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\u00b611 K.M.\u2019s parents contacted the police and took K.M. to the hospital for an examination. The police questioned K.M. at the hospital and then asked her to show them the house where she had been taken the previous morning (i.e., Ariegwe\u2019s house). The police later obtained a warrant to search the residence. They seized two shot glasses from the upstairs sink and a bottle of rum, a computer, and bedding from the basement. They also went to K.M.\u2019s home and retrieved the clothing she had worn while at Ariegwe\u2019s house. Meanwhile, Ariegwe\u2019s ex-wife contacted Ariegwe, who was at work at the time, and told him that the police were investigating his encounter with K.M. Ariegwe turned himself in at the police station later in the day (January 18), believing that he was in trouble only for providing an alcoholic beverage to a minor. The police arrested him and executed a body search warrant (which involves the collection of biological samples, such as blood, saliva, and hair). Ariegwe was then incarcerated for four days before he posted bond securing his release.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">\u00b612 On February 7, 2003, the State filed an information charging Ariegwe with Count I, sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA (2001), and Count II, unlawful transactions with children, a misdemeanor, in violation of \u00a7 45-5-623(l)(c), MCA (2001). Ariegwe pleaded not guilty to these charges on February 20, 2003, and the District Court set trial for May 13, 2003. Five postponements of the trial date ensued. (Each of the postponements is detailed under Issue One, <em>infra.) </em>Then, on December 16,2003, the State filed an amended information adding an alternative charge under Count I-namely, <em>attempted </em>sexual intercourse without consent, a felony, in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 45-4-103 and 45-5-503, MCA (2001)-to which Ariegwe pleaded not guilty on December 18, 2003. Five days later, the District Court vacated the existing January 5, 2004 trial date, since the parties were waiting for test results from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>crime lab, and the court set a status hearing for January 22, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"A4b\">\u00b613 At the status hearing, defense counsel stated that he had received the crime lab reports, and the court and the parties then agreed on a March 1,2004 trial date. Defense counsel also indicated, however, that he would be filing a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. That motion was filed, as was a response by the State, and the District Court denied the motion following a hearing on February 17,2004. The case then proceeded to trial on March 1 and concluded on March 3, 2004. On March 4, the jury acquitted Ariegwe of sexual intercourse without consent but convicted him of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful transactions with children.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\u00b614 On March 24, 2004, Ariegwe filed a motion for a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-702, MCA. He argued that he had been denied a fair trial because the prosecutor, during closing arguments, had inaccurately represented certain scientific evidence adduced at trial and because defense counsel, during trial, had failed to object to allegedly improper testimony by the State\u2019s trace hair and fiber examination expert. The State filed a response opposing the motion, and Ariegwe filed a reply. The District Court thereafter denied Ariegwe\u2019s motion, noting that the court had given a curative instruction to the jury concerning the prosecutor\u2019s inaccurate representations of the evidence, that the trace hair and fiber examination expert\u2019s allegedly improper testimony was of limited evidentiary value, and that there was ample remaining evidence upon which the jury could have found Ariegwe guilty of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful transactions with children.</p>\n<p id=\"AcN\">\u00b615 The District Court sentenced Ariegwe on June 17, 2004, to fifty years in the Montana State Prison, with fifteen years suspended, and six months in the Cascade County Detention Center, to run concurrently with the fifty-year sentence. The court also ordered Ariegwe to pay restitution as follows: $3,332.68 to K.M.\u2019s family, $38.40 to the Montana State Crime Victims Compensation Unit, and $10,863.58 to EBMS Insurance Co., for a total of $14,234.66. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">\u00b616 Additional facts are provided below where relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">\u00b617 <em>Issue One. Did the District Court err in denying Ariegwe\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">I. Our Framework for Analyzing Speedy Trial Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">\u00b618 Ariegwe\u2019s first contention on appeal is that the District Court erred in denying his motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>last clarified the framework by which we analyze speedy trial claims in <em>City of Billings v. Bruce, </em>1998 MT 186, 290 Mont. 148, 965 P.2d 866, and we have consistently applied the <em>Bruce </em>test to such claims that have since come before this Court. In so doing, however, it has become apparent that certain aspects of the test are now in need of clarification or modification. Thus, we have determined at this juncture to revisit our approach to speedy trial claims, in particular because our doing so here does not affect the outcome of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AVC\">\u00b619 We begin in Part A by reviewing the speedy trial test articulated by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo, </em>407 U.S. 514, 92 S. Ct. 2182 (1972), followed in Part B with a discussion of the framework we adopted in <em>Bruce. </em>We then set forth, in Part C, a detailed explanation of our revised speedy trial test, including several important rules for applying that test, after which we provide a summary and an outline of the revised speedy trial test in Part D. Lastly, in Part E, we specify the rules pertaining to the timing of a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and the corresponding ruling by the trial cotut.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">A. The <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>Balancing Test</p>\n<p id=\"AXk\">\u00b620 A criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial is guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>Klopfer v. North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 222-26, 87 S. Ct. 988, 993-95 (1967); Mont. Const. art. II, \u00a7 24. In <em>Barker, </em>the United States Supreme Court set forth the approach under which the Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial is to be evaluated. Specifically, the Corut adopted \u201ca balancing test, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant are weighed.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S. Ct. at 2191-92. Acknowledging that such an approach \u201cnecessarily compels courts to approach speedy trial cases on an <em>ad hoc </em>basis,\u201d the Court identified \u201csome of the factors which courts should assess in determining whether a particular defendant has been deprived of his right\u201d: (1) the length of the delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) the defendant\u2019s assertion of the right to a speedy trial, and (4) the prejudice to the defendant as a result of the delay. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S. Ct. at 2192; <em>see also Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 651, 112 S. Ct. 2686, 2690 (1992) (articulating these factors as four separate inquiries: \u201cwhether delay before trial was uncommonly long, whether the government or the criminal defendant is more to blame for that delay, whether, in due course, the defendant asserted his right to a speedy trial, and whether he suffered prejudice as the delay\u2019s result\u201d). The Court explained that \u201cthese factors have no talismanic qualities\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>rather, \u201cthey are related factors and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">\u00b621 In <em>State v. Sanders, </em>163 Mont. 209, 516 P.2d 372 (1973), we noted that this Court had been considering \u201c[essentially the same factors\u201d when analyzing speedy trial claims. <em>Sanders, </em>163 Mont. at 213, 516 P.2d at 375; <em>accord Fitzpatrick v. Crist, </em>165 Mont. 382, 388, 528 P.2d 1322, 1325 (1974) (\u201cThe United States Supreme Court and this Court have adopted essentially the same test to determine whether a trial is \u2018speedy/ \u201d). Indeed, in <em>State v. Steward, </em>168 Mont. 385, 543 P.2d 178 (1975), we explained that this Court had adopted the <em>Barker </em>factors in <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. District Court, </em>151 Mont. 1, 438 P.2d 554 (1968), based on an earlier listing of those factors in <em>United States v. Simmons, </em>338 F.2d 804 (2nd Cir. 1964). <em>See Steward, </em>168 Mont. at 389, 543 P.2d at 181. Thus, following the <em>Barker </em>decision, we merely incorporated the Supreme Court\u2019s clarification of the four factors into our existing analytical framework. <em>See e.g. Sanders, </em>163 Mont. at 213-15, 516 P.2d at 375-76; <em>Fitzpatrick, </em>165 Mont. at 388-90, 528 P.2d at 1326; <em>Steward, </em>168 Mont. at 389-94, 543 P.2d at 181-83; <em>State v. Keller, </em>170 Mont. 372, 377-81, 553 P.2d 1013, 1016-19 (1976); <em>see also State v. Tiedemann, </em>178 Mont. 394, 398, 584 P.2d 1284, 1287 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">B. The <em>Bruce </em>Test</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">\u00b622 Twenty-six years after <em>Barker </em>was decided, we observed that the four-factor balancing test had, unfortunately, led to \u201cseemingly inconsistent results\u201d nationwide. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>see also Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-49 (identifying varied and inconsistent applications of the test in our own caselaw). Therefore, seeking to achieve more consistent dispositions of speedy trial claims in Montana, we articulated a more structured method for analyzing such claims. As described below, we retained the four factors identified in <em>Barker, </em>but we incorporated objective, bright-line criteria into three of them, and we modified the function and importance each factor plays in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">\u00b623 Under Factor One (the length of the delay), we explained that we would continue to consider the length of the delay from the date of accusation (e.g., when the charges were filed) until the defendant\u2019s trial date \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether there is a basis for conducting a speedy trial analysis.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55. We then established 200 days-irrespective of fault for the delay-as \u201cthe necessary length of time to trigger further speedy trial analysis.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55. If less than 200 days have passed, then further speedy trial analysis is unnecessary. Thus, we fashioned Factor One as a threshold criterion; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>however, we indicated that the length of the delay would also be considered later in the analysis. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">\u00b624 Under Factor Two (the reason for the delay), we retained our approach of assigning responsibility or \u201cfault\u201d for the various periods of delay to either the State or the defendant. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. However, we then created a burden-shifting scheme based on the number of days of delay attributable to the State. Specifically, we stated that if less than 275 days of delay are attributable to the State, then the defendant has the burden (under Factor Four) to demonstrate that he or she <em>has </em>been prejudiced by the delay. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. Conversely, if 275 or more days of delay are attributable to the State, then a rebuttable presumption of prejudice arises and the State has the burden to overcome this presumption by demonstrating that the defendant <em>has not </em>been prejudiced by the delay. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39, 56. We explained that the rebuttable presumption of prejudice \u201c \u2018mandates the conclusion [that the defendant has been prejudiced] in the absence of contradictory evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 33 (quoting 22A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 695 (1985)); <em>see also Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-39 (discussing and reaffirming this presumption). Finally, we stated that if the State overcomes the presumption of prejudice, then the burden shifts to the defendant to demonstrate that he or she has been prejudiced by the delay, and the district court then weighs the evidence of each party. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">\u00b625 Next, under Factor Three (whether the defendant timely asserted the right to a speedy trial), we stated that \u201cif the right to speedy trial is invoked at any time prior to the commencement of trial, either by demanding a speedy trial, or by moving to dismiss for failure to provide a speedy trial, the third prong is satisfied.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">\u00b626 Finally, under Factor Four (prejudice to the defendant), we indicated that we would continue to consider pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern to the defendant, and impairment of the defense. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 58, 68. We noted, however, that \u201cthe importance of this factor and the degree of prejudice to establish denial of speedy trial will vary based upon other considerations, such as the length of delay and the reason for delay.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 58.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">\u00b627 In sum, the <em>Bruce </em>framework requires (1) a determination that the length of the delay from the date of accusation until the defendant\u2019s trial date is at least 200 days, (2) a determination of who has the burden to demonstrate prejudice (the defendant) or to demonstrate lack thereof (the State) under Factor Four, (3) notation of whether the defendant asserted the right to a speedy trial prior to the commencement of trial, and (4) an assessment of the proof offered by the defendant (to prove prejudice) or the State (to disprove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>prejudice) based on pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern to the defendant, and impairment of the defense, with due consideration for the length of the delay and the reason for the delay. Although these modifications to our speedy trial test resulted in a more structured analytical approach, we recognize, for the reasons which follow, that our method of analysis has strayed considerably from the actual balancing approach envisioned in <em>Barker </em>and that it is necessary to reexamine certain features of our existing analytical framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b628 First, both Ariegwe and the State refer to speedy trial analysis under <em>Bruce </em>as \u201ca balancing of four factors.\u201d We too have used this characterization. <em>See e.g. State v. Hardaway, </em>1998 MT 224, \u00b6 13, 290 Mont. 516, \u00b6 13, 966 P.2d 125, \u00b6 13 (\u201c[T]his Court recently established a four-part balancing test in <em>[Bruce].\u201d); State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 14, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 14 (\u201cWe analyze and balance each of the four factors.\u201d); State <em>v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 14, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 14, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 14 (\u201c[C]ourts must engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process.\u201d); <em>State v. Doyle, </em>2007 MT 125, \u00b6 18, 337 Mont. 308, \u00b6 18, 160 P.3d 516, \u00b6 18 (\u2018We engage in a lengthy and difficult balancing process.\u201d). Yet, the approach we adopted in <em>Bruce </em>does not actually involve a \u201cbalancing\u201d of all four factors. Factor One is a threshold criterion; Factor Two determines who has the burden of proof under Factor Four; Factor Three, which is satisfied if the right to a speedy trial is invoked at any time prior to the commencement of trial, is properly characterized as a \u201cnon-weighted, \u2018either you asserted the right or you did not\u2019 \u201d criterion, <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 81 (Leaphart, J., specially concurring); and Factor Four involves an assessment of prejudice to the defendant pursuant to the burden established under Factor Two. This approach more closely approximates a four-step analytical progression than it does a four-factor balancing test. Moreover, it channels the focus of the analysis to the issue of prejudice (Factor Four), rendering the reasons for the delay (Factor Two) and any efforts by the defendant to move the case along (Factor Three) relatively inconsequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">\u00b629 The District Court\u2019s speedy trial analysis in the case at hand illustrates this point. The court noted that more than 200 days of delay had occurred, that at least 275 days of that delay were attributable to the State, and that Ariegwe had asserted his right to a speedy trial prior to the commencement of trial. Hence, the court focused on the issue of prejudice, ultimately concluding that the State had met its burden of demonstrating that Ariegwe had not been prejudiced by the delay and that he therefore had not been denied his right to a speedy trial. Factor Four, thus, seems to have been dispositive; indeed, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court\u2019s analysis does not reflect a \u201cbalancing\u201d of Factor Four against the three other factors, thus prompting Ariegwe\u2019s contention on appeal that the District Court \u201cgave undue weight to this factor, to the exclusion or minimization of the other factors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b630 Yet, the District Court\u2019s approach is consistent with the analytical progression set forth in \u00b6\u00b6 55-58 of <em>Bruce, </em>which contradicts the notion that speedy trial analysis under <em>Bruce </em>involves \u201ca balancing of four factors.\u201d However, given that the right to a speedy trial is \u201cnecessarily relative\u201d and \u201cdepends upon circumstances,\u201d <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S. Ct. 773, 776 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted), we believe that an actual balancing of all four factors is preferred and, in fact, is more likely to produce an accurate assessment of a speedy trial claim than is an approach under which three of the factors function, essentially, as mere preludes to the fourth.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b631 Second, based on the rebuttable presumption of prejudice articulated in <em>Bruce </em>and restated in several of our subsequent precedents, Ariegwe suggests that once the State has caused 275 days of delay, the defendant need not come forward with any proof that he or she has been prejudiced as a result of the delay unless the State rebuts the presumption of prejudice (citing <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 26, <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 17, and <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56). This interpretation of the presumption is consistent with our explanation of rebuttable presumptions in <em>Bruce:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cA presumption ... attaches definitive probative value to certain facts. If the presumption is conclusive, it mandates a particular conclusion; if it is rebuttable, <em>it mandates the conclusion in the absence of contradictory evidence.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-7\"><em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 33 (ellipsis in original, emphasis added) (quoting 22A C.J.S. <em>Criminal Law </em>\u00a7 695 (1985)); <em>see also State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 25, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 25, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 25 (\u201c[O]nce the presumption attached, it was not incumbent on the defendant to prove prejudice. It was incumbent on the State to disprove prejudice. Because it did not do so, the presumption of prejudice prevails.\u201d); <em>State v.

Yet, presuming prejudice based on nothing more than the State\u2019s failure to prove the contrary is not, in our view, an accurate basis on which to evaluate a speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">\u00b632 Lastly, we held in <em>Bruce </em>that so long as the defendant asserts the right to a speedy trial prior to the commencement of trial, he or she has satisfied the third prong of the <em>Barker </em>test and \u201cfurther analysis of that prong is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 48. For reasons we detail below, however, we are no longer of the view <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>that further analysis under Factor Three is \u201cunnecessary\u201d and \u201cinappropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b633 Accordingly, we take this opportunity to revisit the process by which speedy trial claims are to be analyzed by the courts of this State and to revise our analytical framework in several significant respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">C. Our Revised Speedy Trial Test</p>\n<p id=\"ACy\">\u00b634 At the outset, we reaffirm that <em>Barker\u2019s </em>balancing approach is \u201cthe correct and most complete standard available to judge speedy trial questions.\u201d <em>State v. Tiedemann, </em>178 Mont. 394, 398, 584 P.2d 1284, 1287 (1978). Furthermore, although the Supreme Court indicated in <em>Barker </em>that the factors which courts should assess when analyzing a speedy trial claim might be expressed in different ways, <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S. Ct. at 2192, we find the four factors suggested by the Supreme Court-the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, assertion of the right, and prejudice to the defendant-to be suitable for our method of speedy trial analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">\u00b635 However, while we are guided by <em>Barker\u2019s </em>general approach for analyzing speedy trial claims, the test we articulate below is grounded in Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, which provides a speedy trial guarantee that is independent of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. <em>See Buckman v. Montana Deaconess Hosp., </em>224 Mont. 318, 324, 730 P.2d 380, 384 (1986) (\u201cBecause the federal constitution establishes the floor and not the apex of constitutional rights, state action may violate our Montana Constitution, but not violate any federal constitutional guarantee.\u201d). Accordingly, we may \u201cgive our own meaning\u201d to <em>Barker\u2019s </em>four factors. <em>State v. Britton, </em>213 Mont. 155, 158, 689 P.2d 1256, 1258 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">\u00b636 We now detail the inquiries a court is to make under each factor of the balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">1. Factor One: The Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">\u00b637 In <em>Barker, </em>the Supreme Court stated with respect to Factor One that \u201c[u]ntil there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. In <em>Doggett v. United States, </em>505 U.S. 647, 112 S. Ct. 2686 (1992), however, the Supreme Court clarified that Factor One \u201cis actually a double enquiry.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 651, 112 S. Ct. at 2690. The Court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">Simply to trigger a speedy trial analysis, an accused must allege that the interval between accusation and trial has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>delay, since, by definition, he cannot complain that the government has denied him a \u201cspeedy\u201d trial if it has, in fact, prosecuted his case with customary promptness. If the accused makes this showing, the court must then consider, as one factor among several, the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the bare minimum needed to trigger judicial examination of the claim. This latter enquiry is significant to the speedy trial analysis because . . . the presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-4\"><em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 651-52, 112 S. Ct. at 2690-91 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AfR\">\u00b638  Thus, under the Supreme Court\u2019s approach, the first inquiry under Factor One-whether a speedy trial analysis has been triggered-is a threshold matter, while the second inquiry under Factor One-the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the trigger date-is a matter to be weighed in the overall balancing. We agree with this approach and adopt it. Thus, consistent with the distinction explained in <em>Doggett, </em>and for the sake of clarity in the analysis, trial courts henceforth must address the length of the delay clearly, and first, as a threshold matter and then, if the speedy trial test has been triggered, as a factor to be weighed in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"A1dS\">i. The 200-Day Threshold</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b639  Accordingly, the first question to be answered with every speedy trial claim is whether the interval between accusation and trial is sufficient to trigger the four-factor balancing test. This interval is measured without regard to fault for the delay. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55; <em>State v. Collier, </em>277 Mont. 46, 54, 919 P.2d 376, 382 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">\u00b640 As for what constitutes a sufficient interval between accusation and trial, the Supreme Court stated in <em>Barker </em>that \u201cbecause of the imprecision of the right to speedy trial, the length of delay that will [trigger a speedy trial analysis] is necessarily dependent upon the peculiar circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530-31, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. However, the Supreme Court also cautioned that \u201c[n]othing we have said should be interpreted as disapproving a presumptive rule adopted by a court in the exercise of its supervisory powers which establishes a fixed time period within which cases must normally be brought.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530 n. 29, 92 S. Ct. at 2192 n. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">\u00b641  In <em>Bruce, </em>we established 200 days as \u201cthe necessary length of time to trigger further speedy trial analysis.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55. We arrived at this number based on the varying lengths of delay we had considered sufficient (or insufficient) in our prior decisions. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-23. We believe that this length of time is still appropriate, given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>the reality of crowded court dockets throughout the State and certain built-in pretrial delays, such as reciprocal discovery; pretrial motions, appearances, and hearings (some of which are statutorily mandated); defense investigation; and obtaining the results of tests and analyses of evidence from the crime lab. It is true that the amount of delay that is customary is also a function of the complexity of the charged offense(s). <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. However, for the sake of retaining a bright-line trigger date, we will address the complexity of the charged offense(s) under Factor Two (the reasons for the delay). Accordingly, we reaffirm the 200-day threshold: A speedy trial claim lacks merit as a matter of law if the interval between accusation and trial is less than 200 days (again, irrespective of fault for the delay).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">\u00b642 As for when the speedy trial clock begins to run, we stated in <em>State v. Longhorn, </em>2002 MT 135, 310 Mont. 172, 49 P.3d 48, that \u201c[t]he right of a defendant to a speedy trial commences when he becomes an accused.\u201d <em>Longhorn, </em>\u00b6 22. We explained this concept in greater detail in <em>State v. Larson, </em>191 Mont. 257, 623 P.2d 954 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-5\">The right to a speedy trial is guaranteed to an \u201caccused\u201d by the Montana and United States constitutions. Consequently, the protection afforded by the guarantee is activated when a criminal prosecution has begun and extends to those persons who have been formally accused or charged in the course of that prosecution whether that accusation be by arrest, the filing of a complaint, or by indictment or information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>Larson, </em>191 Mont. at 261, 623 P.2d at 957-58; <em>accord State v. Morris, </em>230 Mont. 311, 315, 749 P.2d 1379, 1381 (1988); <em>see also Dillingham v. United States, </em>423 U.S. 64, 65, 96 S. Ct. 303, 303-04 (1975) (per curiam) (\u201c \u2018[I]t is either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge that engage the particular protections of the speedy trial provision of the Sixth Amendment.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 320, 92 S. Ct. 455, 463 (1971)). We reaffirm the rule set forth in <em>Larson </em>and add that the speedy trial clock begins to run at the earliest of the enumerated occurrences.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>\u00b643  Lastly, it bears repeating that the interval between accusation and trial runs not to the date on which the accused\u2019s speedy trial motion is considered by the court but, rather, to the scheduled trial date or the date on which a plea of guilty is entered, whichever date represents the date of disposition of the case. <em>State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 9, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 9, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 9; <em>State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 16, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 16, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 16; <em>see also State v. Mooney, </em>2006 MT 121, \u00b6 15, 332 Mont. 249, \u00b6 15, 137 P.3d 532, \u00b6 15 (holding that the right to a speedy trial applies through sentencing).</p>\n<p id=\"ARE3\">ii. The Extent to which the Delay Stretches beyond the Trigger Date</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">\u00b644 The Supreme Court stated in <em>Doggett </em>that if the accused shows that \u201cthe interval between accusation and trial has crossed the threshold dividing ordinary from \u2018presumptively prejudicial\u2019 delay,\u201d \u201cthe court must then consider, as one factor among several, the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the [trigger date].\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 651-52, 112 S. Ct. at 2690-91. The significance of this inquiry, the Supreme Court explained, is that \u201cthe presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652, 112 S. Ct. at 2691.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">\u00b645 Like the Supreme Court, this Court has recognized that \u201ca delay sufficient to trigger further analysis also creates a presumption of prejudice.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 24. Beyond this, however, our approach has diverged substantially from that of the Supreme Cotut. Whereas the Supreme Court characterizes the presumption of prejudice as something which \u201cintensifies over time,\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652, 112 S. Ct. at 2691, this Court has followed a bright-line rule pursuant to which prejudice is either presumed or not presumed and the burden of presenting evidence on the issue of prejudice \u201cshifts\u201d from the accused to the State, <em>see Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21, 39, 56. Because we intend herein to adopt Doggett\u2019s articulation of the role played by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>presumption of prejudice in the overall balancing, we shall explain in detail how that presumption operated in our past cases and why we now conclude that the presumption of prejudice serves a more practical purpose under the approach set forth in <em>Doggett.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">\u00b646 The starting point for this discussion is <em>Barker\u2019s </em>articulation of Factor One-in particular, the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[u]ntil there is some delay which is <em>presumptively prejudicial, </em>there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance,\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 530, 92 S. Ct. at 2192 (emphasis added). Consistent with this language, this Court long followed the rule that a delay sufficient to trigger the speedy trial test is also sufficient to impose on the State the burden of showing that the accused has not been prejudiced by the delay or to create a presumption of prejudice that the State must then rebut. Indeed, our <em>pre-Bruce </em>cases on this point are legion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">\u00b647 In <em>Bruce, </em>we modified our approach by establishing the 275-day rule. Pursuant to this rule, the presumption of prejudice arises not on the 200-day trigger date but, rather, when 275 days of delay are attributable to the State. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56. Thus, there is an interval after the balancing test has been triggered-between 200 days of total <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>delay and 275 days of delay attributable to the State-during which the presumption does not exist. However, once the presumption arises, it mandates the conclusion that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay unless it is overcome by contradictory evidence presented by the State. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 33. In other words, the accused need not come forward with evidence of prejudice unless and until the State overcomes the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">\u00b648 Upon further scrutiny of the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Doggett, </em>the premise upon which our approaches to the presumption of prejudice rested is no longer compelling. Barker\u2019s reference to \u201cpresumptively prejudicial\u201d delay was not meant to place the burden of proof with respect to the issue of prejudice entirely on the State or to mandate a finding of prejudice absent evidence to the contrary. Indeed, the Supreme Court clarified in <em>Doggett </em>that \u201cas the term is used in this threshold context, \u2018presumptive prejudice\u2019 does not necessarily indicate <em>a statistical probability </em>of prejudice; it simply marks the point at which courts deem the delay unreasonable enough to trigger the <em>Barker </em>enquiry.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652 n. 1, 112 S. Ct. at 2691 n. 1 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">\u00b649 This does not mean, however, that presumptive prejudice plays no further role in the speedy trial analysis. To the contrary, a presumption of prejudice arises at the point when the balancing test is triggered; our cases simply misinterpreted the function of that presumption under <em>Barker. </em>Rather than establishing a bright-line point in time at which the accused is relieved of the burden of proving prejudice and the State takes on the burden of disproving prejudice, the presumption\u2019s significance is in its intensifying effect: the further the delay stretches beyond the trigger date, the more likely the delay has prejudiced the accused. <em>See Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652, 112 S. Ct. at 2691 (\u201c[T]he presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time.\u201d). In this respect, the length of the delay (Factor One) and the necessary showing of prejudice (Factor Four) are inversely related: as the delay gets longer, the quantum of proof that may be expected of the accused decreases, while the quantum of proof that may be expected of the State increases. Thus, the intensifying nature of the presumption of prejudice suggests simultaneously increasing (the State\u2019s) and decreasing (the accused\u2019s) burdens under Factor Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">\u00b650 We have not heretofore considered the propriety of such an approach for purposes of our own speedy trial test. We do so now and conclude, for the reasons which follow, that an intensifying presumption of prejudice is a more practical application of presumptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>prejudice than is <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>bright-line 275-day rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">\u00b651 For one thing, the point of the presumption of prejudice is not to relieve the accused of coming forward with evidence of prejudice; rather, it is simply an indicator of the <em>quantum </em>of evidence required: the less the delay extends beyond the trigger date, the smaller the presumption of prejudice and, thus, the greater the accused\u2019s burden to show prejudice (and the smaller the State\u2019s concomitant burden to disprove prejudice). To be sure, there is a point in time at which prejudice may be presumed without affirmative proof thereof. <em>See Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655, 112 S. Ct. at 2693 (\u201c[W]e generally have to recognize that excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify.\u201d). However, we do not believe that that point is reached simply because the State is responsible-perhaps due to institutional forces beyond the prosecutor\u2019s control-for 275 days of delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">\u00b652 Furthermore, presuming prejudice merely because the State has presented insufficient evidence to the contrary is not always justified and would, in some cases, provide the accused with an undeserved windfall. Indeed, a finding of prejudice based on nothing more than the State\u2019s failure of proof does not provide an accurate basis on which to weigh Factor Four against the other three factors in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">\u00b653 In this regard, we note that the accused generally has better access than does the State to evidence showing whether he or she has suffered oppressive pretrial incarceration, unduly prolonged anxiety and concern, and impairment of his or her ability to prepare an effective defense. The State, by contrast, is in the position of having to overcome a presumption by proving a negative-namely, that the accused\u2019s interests in being brought to trial promptly have <em>not </em>been infringed and that the defense has <em>not </em>been impaired-a task that we have recognized in some instances is all but impossible. <em>See e.g. State v. Keating, </em>285 Mont. 463, 476, 949 P.2d 251, 259 (1997) (\u201cFrom a practical standpoint, it would be virtually impossible for the State to rebut presumed prejudice from an allegedly impaired defense without some showing by the defendant of actual impairment resulting in prejudice.\u201d); <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56 (noting \u201cthat direct proof of a defendant\u2019s state of mind may not always be possible and that the State\u2019s ability to anticipate the nature of the defendant\u2019s defense may vary from case to case\u201d); <em>State v. Haser, </em>2001 MT 6, \u00b6 32, 304 Mont. 63, \u00b6 32, 20 P.3d 100, \u00b6 32 (\u201c[S]ince it is nearly impossible for the State to prove that anxiety and concern do not exist, the State\u2019s burden to show a lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>anxiety becomes considerably lighter in the absence of more than marginal evidence of anxiety.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>State v. Boese, </em>2001 MT 175, \u00b6 16, 306 Mont. 169, \u00b6 16, 30 P.3d 1092, \u00b6 16 (observing that \u201cimpairment to one\u2019s defense is the most difficult form of speedy trial prejudice to prove\u201d and, conversely, that \u201cprejudice is difficult to <em>disprove\u201d </em>(emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">\u00b654 It is true that the State might present evidence tending to establish the absence of prejudice indirectly. For instance, if the accused\u2019s own actions during the periods of delay suggest that he or she did not actually want to be brought to trial, then it seems less likely that he or she was actually prejudiced by the delay. <em>See e.g. State v. Keyes, </em>2000 MT 337, \u00b6 18, 303 Mont. 147, \u00b6 18, 15 P.3d 443, \u00b6 18 (observing that Keyes had fled from Montana\u2019s jurisdiction, had remained a fugitive from justice for nearly two years, and, during that time, had demonstrated absolutely no interest in obtaining a speedy trial, preserving evidence or witnesses, or advancing his legal defenses). Or, if previously unknown or unavailable exculpatory evidence came to light dining the pendency of the trial, then it seems plausible that the delay worked to the accused\u2019s advantage. <em>Cf. State v. Stuart, </em>2001 MT 178, \u00b6 23, 306 Mont. 189, \u00b6 23, 31 P.3d 353, \u00b6 23 (noting that \u201cdelay would have provided more-not less-time to locate [exculpatory] witnesses\u201d). Alternatively, the State might demonstrate that all of the potential evidence in the case has been preserved and that all of the accused\u2019s potential witnesses are available to testify at trial and possess adequate memories of the events in question, which suggests that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense has not been impaired. <em>See e.g. State v. Bowser, </em>2005 MT 279, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 329 Mont. 218, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23, 123 P.3d 230, \u00b6\u00b6 22-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">\u00b655 Nevertheless, requiring the State to disprove the considerations that make up the prejudice inquiry under Factor Four in order to overcome an otherwise mandated presumption of prejudice is, as a general rule, impractical. More importantly, the accuracy of the overall balancing is enhanced when <em>both </em>the accused <em>and </em>the State present evidence on the issue of prejudice and neither party relies solely on the existence (the accused) or nonexistence (the State) of the presumption of prejudice (except, perhaps, in cases of unusually long delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">\u00b656  For these reasons, we are not retaining <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>275-day rule in our speedy trial framework. Instead, the presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused exists as of the 200-day trigger date for speedy trial analysis (at which point it is minimal) and intensifies (escalates) over time. Furthermore, the accused should come forward <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>with evidence tending to establish prejudice, the State should come forward with evidence tending to establish the contrary, and the court must weigh each party\u2019s evidence (or lack thereof) pursuant to the principles discussed above. Thus, the State\u2019s failure to make a persuasive showing of no prejudice weighs more heavily against it in the overall balancing when the delay is long, but such failure is of little weight where the delay is relatively brief. Likewise, a persuasive showing of prejudice by the defendant is more important where the delay is short and less important where the delay is long.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">\u00b657 Before proceeding to Factor Two, three additional aspects of our <em>Bruce </em>decision bear on the instant discussion and, therefore, require attention. First, we discussed \u201cthe rebuttable presumption of prejudice\u201d at length in <em>Bruce. See Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 21-39. After identifying reasons for presuming prejudice, and after acknowledging the Supreme Court\u2019s observations that affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim, <em>see Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-38, we concluded \u201cthat the rebuttable presumption of prejudice established by our earlier cases is not only the better public policy, but that it is <em>constitutionally required,\u201d Bruce, </em>\u00b6 39 (emphasis added). Later in the opinion, we articulated \u201cthe point at which and the circumstances under which the presumption of prejudice will attach\u2019-namely, when 275 or more days of delay are attributable to the State. <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 39, 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">\u00b658 Although we are not retaining <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>275-day rule in our revised speedy trial framework, we do not intend this as an implicit overruling of our statement that the rebuttable presumption of prejudice is \u201cconstitutionally required.\u201d Rather, we conclude only that <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>particular construct of that presumption is neither constitutionally required nor supported by the Supreme Court precedents from which it purportedly derives. For the reasons set forth above, the presumption of prejudice does not establish mutually exclusive burdens of proving and disproving prejudice but, instead, determines the necessary showings <em>both </em>parties must make under Factor Four. Under this interpretation, both the accused and the State should come forward with evidence on this issue; but because \u201cthe presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time,\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 652, 112 S. Ct. at 2691, the necessary showing by the accused of particularized prejudice decreases, and the necessary showing by the State of no prejudice correspondingly increases, with the length of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">\u00b659 Second, we opined in <em>Bruce </em>that \u201c[a]t some point in time (which we leave for future consideration). . . the mere passage of time must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>necessarily be considered sufficient to conclusively establish denial of the right to speedy trial.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 56 (citing <em>Doggett </em>generally). Yet, <em>Doggett </em>does not preclude the State from attempting to rebut the presumption of prejudice, as would a <em>conclusive </em>presumption <em>(see Bruce, </em>\u00b6 33). Indeed, in reaching the conclusion that Doggett was entitled to relief, the Supreme Court noted specifically that the government had not \u201cpersuasively rebutted\u201d the presumption of prejudice in that case. <em>See Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 658, 112 S. Ct. at 2694.</p>\n<p id=\"ApE\">\u00b660 Furthermore, nothing in <em>Doggett </em>supports the proposition that the mere passage of time may be sufficient to establish <em>denial of the right. </em>While the mere passage of time may give rise to a presumption of prejudice so compelling that the accused need not make any showing under Factor Four, the Supreme Court clarified that such presumptive prejudice \u201ccannot alone carry a Sixth Amendment claim without regard to the other <em>Barker </em>criteria.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655-56, 112 S. Ct. at 2693. Indeed, the Supreme Court stated that generally a speedy trial claim would fail, \u201chowever great the delay,\u201d if the government had pursued the accused with reasonable diligence and the accused could not show specific prejudice to his or her defense as a result of the delay. <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 656, 112 S. Ct. at 2693. Thus, it was a combination of lack of diligence on the part of the government and excessive delay that led the Supreme Court to conclude that Doggett was entitled to relief. <em>See Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 656-58, 112 S. Ct. at 2693-94. For this reason, it is doubtful that the mere passage of time could \u201cconclusively\u201d establish that the accused has been denied his or her right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">\u00b661 Lastly, in our discussion of the significance of Factor One in the overall balancing, we have focused, thus far, on the relationship between the length of the delay (Factor One) and prejudice (Factor Four), explaining that the further the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, the more likely the delay has prejudiced the accused. This is not to say, however, that the extent of the post-trigger-date delay bears only on Factor Four. Indeed, the State\u2019s burden under Factor Two to provide valid justifications for the delay likewise \u201c \u2018 \u201cincreases with the length of delay.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 26 (quoting <em>State v. Steward, </em>168 Mont. 385, 389, 543 P.2d 178, 181 (1975), in turn quoting <em>United States v. Rucker, </em>464 F.2d 823, 825 (D.C. Cir. 1972)). In other words, the further the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, the more compelling the State\u2019s justifications for the delay must be. <em>See e.g. Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 657, 112 S. Ct. at 2693 (\u201c[T]he weight we assign to official negligence [in bringing an accused to trial] compounds over time as the presumption of evidentiary prejudice grows. Thus, our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>toleration of such negligence varies inversely with its protractedness.\u201d); <em>Rucker, </em>464 F.2d at 825 (\u201cWhen the delay approaches a year and a half, as in this case, the Government must provide a justification which convincingly outweighs the prejudice which can normally be assumed to have been caused the defendant.\u201d); <em>State v. Barker, </em>261 Mont. 379, 383-84, 862 P.2d 1112, 1115 (1993) (\u201cBecause the State was unable to demonstrate either compelling circumstances to warrant such a lengthy delay, or that it diligently pursued bringing Barker\u2019s case to trial, we conclude that, in this instance, the delay weighs heavily against the State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">\u00b662  Thus, to sum up the speedy trial inquiries under Factor One, the first question to be answered is whether the interval between accusation and trial is at least 200 days (irrespective of fault for the delay). If not, then further analysis is unnecessary and the claim should be denied. But if the interval is at least 200 days, then the four-factor balancing test is triggered and the court must proceed with a full analysis. With respect to the second inquiry under Factor One, the court must consider the extent to which the delay (again, irrespective of fault for the delay) stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date. The significance of this latter inquiry is twofold: first, the presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time, and second, the State\u2019s burden under Factor Two to justify the delay likewise increases with the length of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">2. Factor Two: The Reasons for the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"Aq8\">\u00b663 Turning now to Factor Two, under this factor the court first identifies each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial. Because the question is one of \u201cdelay,\u201d the court does not consider any actions taken by the State or the accused which do not result in a postponement of the trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">\u00b664 Second, the court attributes each period of delay to the appropriate party. In this regard, \u201c[a] defendant has no duty to bring himself to trial; the State has that duty.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190 (footnote omitted); <em>accord State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 23, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 23, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 23 (\u201c[A] defendant is under no obligation to ensure diligent prosecution of the case against him or to help the State avoid dismissal for failure to timely prosecute him.\u201d); <em>In re A.G., </em>2002 MT 111, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 491, \u00b6 26, 47 P.3d 831, \u00b6 26 (\u201c[I]t is up to the State to move the case towards prosecution.\u201d). Furthermore, \u201csociety has a particular interest in bringing swift prosecutions, and society\u2019s representatives are the ones who should protect that interest.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190; <em>see also Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 519-21, 92 S. Ct. at 2186-87 (discussing \u201c[the] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>societal interest in providing a speedy trial which exists separate from, and at times in opposition to, the interests of the accused\u201d). Accordingly, the State bears the burden of explaining the pretrial delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">\u00b665  The Ninth Circuit reached the same conclusion in <em>McNeely v. Blanas, </em>336 F.3d 822 (9th Cir. 2003), reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-5\">The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the prosecutor and the court have an affirmative constitutional obligation to try the defendant in a timely manner and that this duty requires a good faith, diligent effort to bring him to trial quickly. <em>See Moore v. Arizona, </em>414 U.S. 25, 26, 94 S.Ct. 188, 38 L.Ed.2d 183 (1973) (stating that courts should inquire whether the state \u201cdischarge[d] its \u2018constitutional duty to make a diligent, good-faith effort to bring [the defendant to trial]\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 384, 89 S.Ct. 575, 21 L.Ed.2d 607 (1969))); <em>Dickey v. Florida, </em>398 U.S. 30, 38, 90 S.Ct. 1564, 26 L.Ed.2d 26 (1970) (\u201c[T]he right to a prompt inquiry into criminal charges is fundamental and the duty of the charging authority is to provide a prompt trial.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b489-6\">Numerous lower courts have, thus, held that the prosecution bears the burden of explaining delay in bringing an accused to trial. <em>See e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>169 F.3d 344, 349 (6th Cir. 1999) (stating that government had the burden of proving that defendant was actually culpable in causing the delay by evading arrest on the indictment, or was aware of the issuance of the indictment and intentionally hid himself from law enforcement agents); <em>United States v. Graham, </em>128 F.3d 372, 374 (6th Cir. 1997) (holding that the state has the burden to explain pretrial delay); <em>Jones v. Morris, </em>590 F.2d 684, 686 (7th Cir. 1979) (finding that where reason for 23-month delay did not clearly appear in the record, \u201cthe absence of any reason for the delay should weigh against the state\u201d); Morris <em>v. Wyrick, </em>516 F.2d 1387, 1390 (8th Cir. 1975) (stating that where the record does not demonstrate reason for the delay and the state has provided no reasonable explanation, the court will \u201cassume that there is no justifiable reason and weigh this factor heavily against the state\u201d); <em>Georgiadis v. Superintendent, Eastern Correctional Facility, </em>450 F.Supp. 975, 980 (S.D.N.Y.), <em>aff'd, </em>591 F.2d 1330 (2d Cir. 1978) (stating that where actions of the defendant do not account for entire period, \u201cthe responsibility for these unexplained delays should rest with the state\u201d). Although <em>Barker </em>did not explicitly identify the burden of proof for pretrial delay, it refers to the reason for the delay as \u201cthe reason the government assigns to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>justify the delay.\u201d 407 U.S. at 531, 92 S.Ct. 2182. We likewise hold that the prosecution bears the burden of explaining pretrial delays.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-4\"><em>McNeely, </em>336 F.3d at 826-27 (alterations in original). Any delay not demonstrated to have been caused by the accused or affirmatively waived by the accused, therefore, is attributed to the State by default. <em>See McNeely, </em>336 F.3d at 827, and cases cited therein; <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 60-63; <em>State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 16, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 16, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 16; <em>see also State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6\u00b6 29-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">\u00b666 In attributing each period of delay, however, the court must bear in mind that delay requested by a particular party may be attributable to the other party. <em>See e.g. State v. Diaz, </em>2006 MT 303, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 334 Mont. 479, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33, 148 P.3d 628, \u00b6\u00b6 32-33 (holding that delay requested by the State but necessitated by the accused\u2019s unlawful acts was attributable to the accused); <em>State v. Keyes, </em>2000 MT 337, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 303 Mont. 147, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14, 15 P.3d 443, \u00b6\u00b6 13-14 (holding that the time associated with Keyes\u2019 application to this Court for a writ of supervisory control was attributable to the State, given that the necessity of the application and the delay occasioned by our consideration of the application were due to the confusing nature of the charges under which the State had sought to prosecute Keyes).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">\u00b667  Lastly, after identifying and attributing each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial, the court assigns weight to each period based on the specific cause and motive for the delay. This is necessary because the weight assigned to a particular period of delay will depend on the party\u2019s culpability in causing it. The following examples provided by the Supreme Court in <em>Barker </em>illustrate this point with respect to delay attributable to the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">A <em>deliberate </em>attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper the defense should be weighted heavily against the government. A more neutral reason such as <em>negligence </em>or <em>overcrowded courts </em>should be weighted less heavily but nevertheless should be considered since the ultimate responsibility for such circumstances must rest with the government rather than with the defendant. Finally, <em>a valid reason, </em>such as a missing witness, should serve to justify appropriate delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-8\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192 (emphases added, footnote omitted); <em>see also Strunk v. United States, </em>412 U.S. 434, 436, 93 S. Ct. 2260, 2262 (1973) (\u201cUnintentional delays caused by overcrowded court dockets or understaffed prosecutors are among the factors to be weighed less heavily than intentional delay, calculated to hamper the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>defense, in determining whether the Sixth Amendment has been violated.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">\u00b668 With respect to deliberate attempts by the prosecution to delay the trial versus overcrowded court dockets, our cases already require that these two types of delay be attributed to the State but weighed differently. In <em>State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, 324 Mont. 444, 103 P.3d 538, for example, we characterized delay inherent in the criminal justice system and caused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor and the accused as \u201cinstitutional delay,\u201d and we attributed such delay to the State. <em>See Blair, </em>\u00b6 19; <em>see also State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 26, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 26, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 26 (\u201c[The accused] cannot be held responsible for the court\u2019s policy regarding the setting of trial dates and its management of its criminal caseload.\u201d); <em>Kipp, </em>\u00b6 14 (\u201cWhen a trial court, for its own reasons, vacates the trial date and does not set a new date, this delay is not attributable to the defendant.\u201d). However, we explained that institutional delay weighs less heavily against the State than does intentional delay, because institutional delay \u201cis not one the State actively pursued,\u201d whereas intentional delay \u201cexposes the defendant to \u2018oppressive tactics of the prosecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">\u00b669 As for negligence, the Supreme Court explained in <em>Doggett </em>that \u201c[b]etween diligent prosecution and bad-faith delay, official negligence in bringing an accused to trial occupies the middle ground.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 656-57, 112 S. Ct. at 2693. The Court stressed that \u201c[although negligence is obviously to be weighed more lightly than a deliberate intent to harm the accused\u2019s defense, it still falls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it has begun.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 657, 112 S. Ct. at 2693. We too have treated negligence (or lack of diligence) in bringing the accused to trial as an unacceptable reason for delay. <em>See e.g. State v. Tiedemann, </em>178 Mont. 394, 399-405, 584 P.2d 1284, 1288-91 (1978); <em>State v. Fife, </em>193 Mont. 486, 490, 632 P.2d 712, 715 (1981); <em>State v. Barker, </em>261 Mont. 379, 383-84, 862 P.2d 1112, 1115 (1993); <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 24; <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 12, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 12, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 12 (\u201cAs a general matter, the right to a speedy trial places on the State the burden of diligent prosecution at all stages of a criminal proceeding.\u201d); <em>Kipp, </em>\u00b6 16 (same); <em>State v. Longhorn, </em>2002 MT 135, \u00b6 22, 310 Mont. 172, \u00b6 22, 49 P.3d 48, \u00b6 22 (\u201cIf the accused is out of state, the State must act diligently and in good faith to acquire jurisdiction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">\u00b670 Finally, besides delay caused by bad faith on the part of the prosecution, delay caused by negligence or lack of diligence, and delay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>caused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor and the accused (e.g., overcrowded court dockets), there are \u201cvalid reasons\u201d for delay attributable to the State. For instance, if the charged offense is particularly complex, additional time to prepare for trial may be required. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192 (\u201c[T]he delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is considerably less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Bretz, </em>185 Mont. 253, 264, 269, 605 P.2d 974, 981-82, 984 (1979); <em>State v. Kills on Top, </em>243 Mont. 56, 77, 80, 793 P.2d 1273, 1287, 1289 (1990). Another \u201cvalid reason\u201d is a missing witness. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. In <em>Johnson, </em>for example, we observed that \u201cthe two continuances requested by the State in this trial were supported by good cause, namely, the unavailability of key prosecution witnesses on the scheduled trial dates.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>\u00b6 20. We therefore weighed such delay less heavily against the State in the overall balancing. <em>See Johnson, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20, 39.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">\u00b671 The crucial point of these distinctions and examples is that there are gradations of culpability in the delay attributed to the State-with bad-faith delay at one extreme and a valid reason, such as a missing witness, at the other extreme-which depend on the cause, the motive, and other surrounding circumstances. And the same is true of delay attributed to the accused. Delay caused by the accused to avoid being brought to trial or for tactical reasons weighs more heavily against him or her than does delay caused by a missing witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">\u00b672  The function of Factor Two in the overall balancing, therefore, is no longer \u201cto conclusively establish a burden shift for the determination of prejudice,\u201d <em>State v. Haser, </em>2001 MT 6, \u00b6 25, 304 Mont. 63, \u00b6 25, 20 P.3d 100, \u00b6 25; <em>see also State v. Doyle, </em>2007 MT 125, \u00b6 21, 337 Mont. 308, \u00b6 21, 160 P.3d 516, \u00b6 21 (\u201cThe court allocates the total number of days of delay between the parties for the purpose of determining which party carries the burden of proof under the prejudice factor.\u201d); <em>State v. Stanko, </em>1998 MT 323, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 292 Mont. 214, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30, 974 P.2d 1139, \u00b6\u00b6 29-30 (stating that it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>\u201cimmaterial\u201d whether the delay at issue was attributed to the State or to Stanko, since the burden under Factor Four was on Stanko either way). Rather, this factor\u2019s significance is in the specific cause and culpability for each period of delay. Obviously, the more delay in bringing the accused to trial that is due to lack of diligence or other \u201cunacceptable\u201d reasons, the more likely the accused\u2019s speedy trial right has been violated. Likewise, the more delay caused by the accused for \u201cunacceptable\u201d reasons, the less likely the right has been violated. Lastly, because \u201cthe primary burden\u201d to assure that cases are brought to trial is \u201con the courts and the prosecutors,\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191, the further the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, the more compelling the State\u2019s justifications for the delay must be (see \u00b6 61, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">3. Factor Three: Assertion of the Right (hereinafter, The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay)</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">\u00b673 In <em>Bruce, </em>we held that \u201cthere is no magical time for assertion of the right to a speedy trial which should be weighed more favorably to the defendant than some other time\u201d; so long as the accused asserts the right to a speedy trial at any time prior to the commencement of trial, he or she \u201chas satisfied the third-prong of the <em>Barker </em>test and... further analysis of that prong is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 48. In establishing this bright-line rule, we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-6\">Analysis of when in a long period of delay, or how often during a long period of delay a defendant asserts the right to a speedy trial, makes an already subjective and arbitrary review process even more so. In the interests of consistency, predictability, and justice, our purpose should be to establish more objective criteria for prosecutors, defense lawyers, and district courts to evaluate speedy trial issues. The trend of subjectively evaluating the date on which each appellant has asserted his or her right to a speedy trial is the antithesis of that objective.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-7\"><em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">\u00b674 It is true that analyzing when and how often the accused asserted the right to a speedy trial is a less objective approach than the \u201cnon-weighted, \u2018either you asserted the right or you did not\u2019 approach\u201d we adopted in <em>Bruce (see Bruce, </em>\u00b6 81 (Leaphart, J., specially concurring)). Moreover, there is indeed no \u201cmagical time\u201d for assertion of the right. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 521, 92 S. Ct. at 2187 (noting that \u201cthere is no fixed point in the criminal process when the State can put the defendant to the choice of either exercising or waiving the right to a speedy trial\u201d). That said, we conclude, for the reasons which follow, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>that the overall accuracy of the balancing test is enhanced when the totality of the accused\u2019s responses to pretrial delays is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">\u00b675 The right to a speedy trial is \u201cgenerically different\u201d from any of the other rights enshrined in the Constitution for the protection of the accused. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 519, 92 S. Ct. at 2186. One difference is that deprivation of the right may actually work to the accused\u2019s advantage. For instance, as the time between the commission of the crime and the trial lengthens, witnesses may become unavailable or their memories may fade; and if these witnesses support the prosecution, its case will be weakened, sometimes seriously so. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 521, 92 S. Ct. at 2187.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">\u00b676  Thus, as <em>Barker </em>makes clear, whether the accused actually wanted to be brought to trial promptly is an \u201cimportant\u201d consideration in ascertaining whether his or her right to a speedy trial has been violated. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 534, 92 S. Ct. at 2194. Indeed, the fact that Barker seemingly did not want to be tried was the primary factor that counterbalanced the \u201cextraordinary\u201d delay of over five years between his arrest and trial. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 533-36, 92 S. Ct. at 2193-95. It is not always readily apparent whether the accused actually wanted a speedy trial, but some useful indicators identified in <em>Barker </em>are whether and how the accused asserted the speedy trial right, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192, the frequency and force of the accused\u2019s objections to pretrial delays, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191, and the reasons for any acquiescence by the accused in pretrial delays, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 534-36, 92 S. Ct. at 2194-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">\u00b677 For instance, the Supreme Court observed that Barker initially acquiesced for tactical reasons in most of the prosecution\u2019s motions to continue; but once it became clear to Barker that he had lost his tactical gamble, he began to object to further continuances. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 534-36, 92 S. Ct. at 2194-95. On these facts, the Supreme Court concluded that Barker had not been deprived of his right to a speedy trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-7\">We do not hold that there may never be a situation in which an indictment may be dismissed on speedy trial grounds where the defendant has failed to object to continuances. There may be a situation in which the defendant was represented by incompetent counsel, was severely prejudiced, or even cases in which the continuances were granted <em>ex parte. </em>But barring extraordinary circumstances, we would be reluctant indeed to rule that a defendant was denied this constitutional right on a record that strongly indicates, as does this one, that the defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>want a speedy trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-4\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 536, 92 S. Ct. at 2195; <em>see also Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 536-37, 92 S. Ct. at 2195 (White, J., concurring) (\u201cAlthough the Court rejects [Barker\u2019s] speedy trial claim..., it is apparent that had Barker not so clearly acquiesced in the major delays involved in this case, the result would have been otherwise.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">\u00b678 The accused\u2019s various responses to delays, aside from providing some insight into whether he or she actually wanted to be brought to trial promptly, also serve as a useful gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b495-6\">Whether and how a defendant asserts his right is closely related to the other factors we have mentioned. The strength of his efforts will be affected by the length of the delay, to some extent by the reason for the delay, and most particularly by the personal prejudice, which is not always readily identifiable, that he experiences. The more serious the deprivation, the more likely a defendant is to complain. The defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right, then, is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ado\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531-32, 92 S. Ct. at 2192-93.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">\u00b679  Thus, Factor Three serves an important role in the balancing test by providing insight into whether the accused actually wanted a speedy trial and what weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the analysis. For this reason, we are departing from the non-weighted, \u201ceither you asserted the right or you did not\u201d approach of <em>Bruce. </em>We hold that under Factor Three, the court must evaluate the accused\u2019s responses to the delay-i.e., his or her acquiescence in and objections to pretrial delays. (An objection to delay could take the form of a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, an objection to a motion by the prosecution for a continuance, a motion to compel requested discovery, etc.) The sum of this evaluation-i.e., the totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial-should then be considered together with the other three factors of the balancing test.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">\u00b680 We caution, however, that we are not suggesting that the accused should complain early and often. The timing and number of instances in which the accused objects to pretrial delay are not talismanic. Indeed, a pro forma motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds is itself only marginal evidence of a desire to be brought to trial. At the same time, however, acquiescence in delay requested by the prosecutor is not conclusive evidence of a desire <em>not </em>to be brought to trial. Rather, the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays must be evaluated based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the surrounding circumstances-such as the timeliness, persistence, and sincerity of the objections, the reasons for the acquiescence, whether the accused was represented by counsel, the accused\u2019s pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right), and so forth. <em>See United States v. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. 302, 314, 106 S. Ct. 648, 655-56 (1986) (noting that the accused\u2019s assertion(s) of the speedy trial right \u201cmust be viewed in the light of [his or her] other conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">\u00b681 Thus, a situation in which the accused\u2019s pretrial conduct has been consistent with a sincere desire to be brought to trial promptly would be weighed differently than a situation in which the accused has objected repeatedly to pretrial delays but, at the same time, has filed indisputably frivolous pretrial motions that necessitated postponements of the trial date. <em>See e.g. Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 314-15, 106 S. Ct. at 656 (observing that while the defendants were making a record of their speedy trial claims in the district court, they also filled that court\u2019s docket with repetitive and unsuccessful motions). Likewise, a situation in which the accused has acquiesced in a well-founded request by the prosecution to continue the trial would be weighed differently than a situation in which the circumstances demonstrate that the accused acquiesced in long delay in order to gain a tactical advantage. <em>See e.g. Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 535, 92 S. Ct. at 2194 (\u201c[T]he record strongly suggests that while he hoped to take advantage of the delay in which he had acquiesced, and thereby obtain a dismissal of the charges, [Barker] definitely did not want to be tried.\u201d). Finally, a situation in which the accused knowingly failed to object to delay would be weighed differently than a situation in which the accused was unaware that he had been charged with a crime. <em>See e.g. Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 653, 112 S. Ct. at 2691 (noting that Factor Three would have weighed heavily against Doggett had he known of the indictment); <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191 (observing that a court may attach a different weight to a situation in which the accused knowingly failed to object as opposed to a situation in which his attorney acquiesced in long delay without adequately informing his client).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">\u00b682 We note here that the court may not infer that the accused did not want a speedy trial <em>solely </em>because he or she did not object to pretrial delay often or at all. For one thing, <em>Barker </em>does not stand for such an inference. In concluding that Barker did not want a speedy trial, the Supreme Court relied on corroborating facts: counsel\u2019s concessions to this effect dining oral argument, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 535, 92 S. Ct. at 2194, and Barker\u2019s apparent goal of gaining a tactical advantage, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 535-36, 92 S. Ct. at 2194-95. Furthermore, such an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>inference would conflict with the fact that while the accused has \u201csome responsibility\u201d to object to pretrial delay, <em>see Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191, he has \u201cno duty to bring himself to trial,\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 527, 92 S. Ct. at 2190. Thus, failure to object to pretrial delay does not, by itself, establish that the accused did not want a speedy trial or that the speedy trial right has not been violated. <em>See Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 536, 92 S. Ct. at 2195 (\u201cWe do not hold that there may never be a situation in which an indictment may be dismissed on speedy trial grounds where the defendant has failed to object to continuances.\u201d). At the same time, however, an absence in the record of any objections to delay will make it difficult for the accused to prove that he or she was denied a speedy trial. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">\u00b683 In a similar vein, the court may not infer waiver of the speedy trial right based on silence or inaction on the part of the accused. In <em>Barker, </em>the Supreme Court explicitly rejected the rule, followed by a number of courts at the time, under which \u201ca defendant waives any consideration of his right to speedy trial for any period prior to which he has not demanded a trial.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 525, 528, 92 S. Ct. at 2189, 2191. Among other things, the Court pointed out that \u201cwaiver\u201d is \u201can <em>intentional </em>relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\u201d and that courts \u201cshould not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 525-26, 92 S. Ct. at 2189 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">\u00b684  In smn, Factor Three is no longer a procedural formality. Rather, this factor serves as an indicator of whether the accused actually wanted a speedy trial, which in turn informs the inquiry into whether there has been a deprivation of the right to a speedy trial. Factor Three also serves as a useful gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">\u00b685 Under Factor Three, therefore, the court must evaluate, based on the surrounding circumstances, the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial. The sum of this evaluation \u2014 i.e., the totality of the accused\u2019s responses-should then be considered together with the other three factors of the balancing test. For instance, conduct evidencing a sincere desire to be brought to trial promptly weighs in favor of the accused in the overall balancing, whereas conduct demonstrating a desire to avoid trial weighs against the accused in the overall balancing. Furthermore, in the analysis of prejudice under Factor Four, the court may take account of the timeliness and persistence of the accused\u2019s objections to pretrial delay-though, as explained above, the number of such objections does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>not equate with the degree of actual prejudice suffered. Finally, because the pertinent focus here is on the totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to pretrial delays, and not simply whether and when he or she filed a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds, we are abandoning the \u201cAssertion of the Right\u201d label and henceforth will refer to Factor Three as \u201cThe Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">4. Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused</p>\n<p id=\"Ao9\">\u00b686 Lastly, under Factor Four, the court inquires into whether the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. Because the speedy trial guarantee \u201cdoes not purport to protect a defendant from <em>all </em>effects flowing from a delay before trial,\u201d <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 311, 106 S. Ct. at 654 (emphasis added), prejudice should be assessed \u201cin the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect,\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">\u00b687 Two such interests are minimizing impairment of liberty and shortening disruption of life:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">The speedy trial guarantee is designed to minimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial, to reduce the lesser, but nevertheless substantial, impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail, and to shorten the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-7\"><em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982). A third interest is \u201c \u2018limiting] the possibilities that long delay will impair the ability of an accused to defend himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 377-78, 89 S. Ct. 575, 577 (1969) (quoting <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S. Ct. 773, 776 (1966)).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">\u00b688 The Supreme Court has expressed these interests as follows: (i) to prevent oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused, and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired by dimming memories and loss of exculpatory evidence. <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193; <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 654, 112 S. Ct. at 2692. We recognized these same three considerations in <em>Bruce, see Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19, 56, 58, and we now reaffirm them as the pertinent considerations when evaluating whether the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. We also reaffirm that prejudice may be established based on \u201cany or all\u201d of these considerations. <em>State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 23, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 23, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">i. Prevent Oppressive Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">\u00b689 The first interest-preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration-reflects the \u201ccore concern\u201d of the speedy trial guarantee: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cimpairment of liberty.\u201d <em>Loud Hawk, </em>474 U.S. at 312, 106 S. Ct. at 654. In <em>Barker, </em>the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-4\">The time spent in jail awaiting trial has a detrimental impact on the individual. It often means loss of a job; it disrupts family life; and it enforces idleness. Most jails offer little or no recreational or rehabilitative programs. The time spent in jail is simply dead time. Moreover, if a defendant is locked up, he is hindered in his ability to gather evidence, contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare his defense. Imposing those consequences on anyone who has not yet been convicted is serious. It is especially unfortunate to impose them on those persons who are ultimately found to be innocent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-5\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532-33, 92 S. Ct. at 2193 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">\u00b690  In assessing whether the pretrial incarceration in a given case is \u201coppressive,\u201d the court must consider all of the circumstances of the incarceration. Foremost among these is duration, given that one of the purposes of the speedy trial guarantee is to ensure that the prosecution \u201c \u2018will move with the dispatch that is appropriate to assure [the accused] an early and proper disposition of the charges against him,\u2019 \u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 7, 102 S. Ct. at 1501 (quoting <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 313, 92 S. Ct. 455, 459 (1971)), and thereby \u201cminimize the possibility of lengthy incarceration prior to trial,\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502. <em>See also State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 28, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 28, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 28 (concluding that \u201cthe fact of 342 days of pretrial incarceration suffices to establish this element in this case\u201d). Thus, the longer the pretrial incarceration, the more likely it has been oppressive and the more likely the accused has been prejudiced by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">\u00b691 At the same time, however, while justice should be administered with dispatch, \u201c \u2018the essential ingredient is orderly expedition and not mere speed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 313, 92 S. Ct. at 459 (alteration omitted) (quoting <em>Smith v. United States, </em>360 U.S. 1, 10, 79 S. Ct. 991, 997 (1959)). Thus, the complexity of the charged offense(s) is also relevant here. As noted above, the Supreme Court observed in <em>Barker </em>that \u201cthe delay that can be tolerated for an ordinary street crime is considerably less than for a serious, complex conspiracy charge.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531, 92 S. Ct. at 2192. Likewise, the length of the pretrial incarceration that is \u201coppressive\u201d is less for a relatively simple offense than it is for a complex charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b692 Another pertinent consideration is any misconduct on the part of the accused directly related to the pretrial incarceration. For instance, if the accused has demonstrated a likelihood to flee the jurisdiction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>the court, <em>see e.g. State v. Keyes, </em>2000 MT 337, \u00b6 18, 303 Mont. 147, \u00b6 18, 15 P.3d 443, \u00b6 18 (\u201cAs to any prejudicial effects of Keyes\u2019 lengthy pretrial incarceration, there can be no doubt in this case that a high bail and resulting incarceration were necessary in light of . . . his demonstrated ability and willingness to abscond from justice.\u201d), or if the accused has engaged in misconduct while incarcerated awaiting trial, <em>see e.g. State v. Ellenburg, </em>2000 MT 232, \u00b6 37, 301 Mont. 289, \u00b6 37, 8 P.3d 801, \u00b6 37 (\u201cEllenburg\u2019s incarceration was the result of... [his] misconduct while incarcerated.\u201d), thus necessitating confinement, then it is less likely that the incarceration was oppressive. In a similar vein, the fact that the accused was incarcerated on a separate charge while awaiting trial on the instant charge informs the issue of oppressiveness. <em>See State v. Highpine, </em>2000 MT 368, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 422, \u00b6 26, 15 P.3d 938, \u00b6 26, and cases cited therein; <em>State v. LaGree, </em>2007 MT 65, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 336 Mont. 375, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, 154 P.3d 615, \u00b6\u00b6 24-26, and cases cited therein. We note, however, that while the fact of incarceration on a separate charge is relevant, it is not dispositive. <em>See Smith v. Hooey, </em>393 U.S. 374, 378, 89 S. Ct. 575, 577 (1969).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Azi\">\u00b693 Lastly, the conditions of the incarceration are relevant in assessing oppressiveness. <em>See Wells v. Petsock, </em>941 F.2d 253, 257 (3rd Cir. 1991) (observing that \u201c[a]ll pretrial detention is not equally oppressive\u201d and that \u201cthe seriousness of a deprivation of liberty due to pretrial incarceration will vary with the conditions of the defendant\u2019s confinement\u201d); <em>see also State v. Johnson, </em>2000 MT 180, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6\u00b6 27-29 (assessing Johnson\u2019s claim that he was prejudiced by the inadequate medical treatment he allegedly received while incarcerated, and concluding that \u201c[n]either the length nor the conditions of incarceration indicate that Johnson\u2019s pre-trial incarceration was oppressive\u201d). In particular, incarceration in facilities that are overcrowded or lacking in recreational opportunities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>adequate food, climate control, proper medical care, cleanliness, or legal research capabilities may be considered in assessing whether the incarceration was oppressive. Where such conditions have been present, it is more likely that the pretrial incarceration has been oppressive. We emphasize, however, that any evidence presented concerning the conditions of the incarceration must be tied to the speedy trial inquiry; a speedy trial motion is not an avenue for pursuing grievances that are properly pursued through administrative channels or for attacking the inner workings of the prison system generally. Furthermore, it is insufficient for speedy trial purposes that the conditions of the incarceration have at times been disagreeable. The question here is one of oppressiveness, not merely occasional unpleasantness.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b694  In sum, there is no bright-line date on which the pretrial incarceration becomes \u201coppressive.\u201d Rather, this determination will vary from case to case based on the specific circumstances of the incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">ii. Minimize the Accused\u2019s Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"AZF\">\u00b695  The second interest-minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges-is more subjective, not to mention difficult to demonstrate. Nonetheless, it is an interest protected by the right to a speedy trial. <em>United States v. Marion, </em>404 U.S. 307, 320, 92 S. Ct. 455, 463 (1971) (noting that one purpose of the speedy trial guarantee is \u201c \u2018to minimize anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S. Ct. 773, 776 (1966))). As such, it is a pertinent consideration under Factor Four.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">\u00b696 The Supreme Court has described the interest in minimizing anxiety and concern in relatively broad terms. For instance, in <em>Barker, </em>the Court pointed out that \u201ca defendant awaiting trial on bond might be subjected to public scorn, deprived of employment, and chilled in the exercise of his right to speak for, associate with, and participate in unpopular political causes.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532 n. 33, 92 S. Ct. at 2193 n. 33 (citing <em>Klopfer v. North Carolina, </em>386 U.S. 213, 221-22, 87 S. Ct. 988, 992-93 (1967)). Similarly, in <em>Marion </em>the Court observed that \u201c[a]rrest is a public act that . . . may disrupt [the accused\u2019s] employment, drain his financial resources, curtail his associations, subject him to public obloquy, and create anxiety in him, his family and his friends.\u201d <em>Marion, </em>404 U.S. at 320, 92 S. Ct. at 463. We too have recognized economic hardship and damage to the accused\u2019s reputation in the community as types of prejudice that can flow from the presence of unresolved criminal charges. <em>See e.g. State v. Bailey, </em>201 Mont. 473, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>480-81, 655 P.2d 494, 498-99 (1982); <em>State v. Haskins, </em>220 Mont. 199, 203, 714 P.2d 119, 121-22 (1986). \u201c \u2018These factors are more serious for some than for others, but they are inevitably present in every case to some extent, for every defendant will either be incarcerated pending trial or on bail subject to substantial restrictions on his liberty.\u2019 \u201d <em>Moore v. Arizona, </em>414 U.S. 25, 27, 94 S. Ct. 188, 190 (1973) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 537, 92 S. Ct. at 2195 (White, J., concurring)); <em>see also Hooey, </em>393 U.S. at 379, 89 S.

Ct. at 2193 (\u201c[E]ven if an accused is not incarcerated prior to trial, he is still disadvantaged by restraints on his liberty and by living under a cloud of anxiety, suspicion, and often hostility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b697 In evaluating the interest in minimizing anxiety and concern, therefore, the focus is on the ways in which the presence of unresolved criminal charges has disrupted the accused\u2019s life. The court may infer from evidence of such disruption that the accused has suffered anxiety and concern, which in turn suggests that he or she has been prejudiced. However, a certain amount of anxiety and concern is inherent in being accused of a crime. <em>State v. Chavez, </em>213 Mont. 434, 444, 691 P.2d 1365, 1371 (1984); <em>State v. Van Voast, </em>247 Mont. 194, 201, 805 P.2d 1380, 1385 (1991); <em>State v. Spang, </em>2007 MT 54, \u00b6 22, 336 Mont. 184, \u00b6 22, 153 P.3d 646, \u00b6 22. Furthermore, the speedy trial guarantee is designed \u201cto <em>shorten </em>the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges,\u201d <em>United States v. MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. 1, 8, 102 S. Ct. 1497, 1502 (1982) (emphasis added), not to eliminate the disruption altogether. Accordingly, the extent to which the disruption of life and the associated anxiety and concern will support a finding of prejudice will depend on their duration and intensity. In other words, the crucial question here is whether the delay in bringing the accused to trial has unduly prolonged the disruption of his or her life or aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime. <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S.

Limit the Possibility that the Defense Will Be Impaired</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">\u00b698 Finally, the third interest concerns itself with issues of evidence, witness reliability, and the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>defense. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 36, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 36, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 36; <em>Haser, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35, 38; <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 654-55, 112 S. Ct. at 2692. In <em>Barker, </em>the Supreme Court characterized this interest as \u201cthe most serious\u201d of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect, \u201cbecause the inability of a defendant adequately to prepare his case skews the fairness of the entire system.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this regard, the Supreme Court observed that \u201c[i]f witnesses die or disappear during a delay, the prejudice is obvious\u201d and that \u201c[t]here is also prejudice if defense witnesses are unable to recall accurately events of the distant past.\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 532, 92 S. Ct. at 2193. Likewise, we recognized in <em>Jefferson </em>that \u201ctime may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence.\u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>see also State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 23, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 23, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 23 (\u201cThe loss of a \u2018main witness\u2019 as a result of delay attributable to the State is prejudicial to the defense.\u201d). Thus, we stated that \u201cthis factor often carries more weight than the other bases for concluding a defendant has been prejudiced by a pretrial delay.\u201d <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36; <em>see also State v. Good, </em>2002 MT 59, \u00b6 29, 309 Mont. 113, \u00b6 29, 43 P.3d 948, \u00b6 29 (\u201cImpairment of defense is arguably the most important of the three factors to consider because a defendant\u2019s inability to adequately prepare his case undermines the fairness of the entire trial system.\u201d); <em>State v. Price, </em>2001 MT 212, \u00b6 28, 306 Mont. 381, \u00b6 28, 34 P.3d 112, \u00b6 28 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"AxS\">\u00b699  Impairment of one\u2019s defense, however, \u201cis the most difficult form of speedy trial prejudice to prove because time\u2019s erosion of exculpatory evidence and testimony can rarely be <em>shown.\u201d Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655, 112 S.

Ct. at 2193 (\u201cLoss of memory... is not always reflected in the record because what has been forgotten can rarely be shown.\u201d). For this reason, the accused\u2019s failure to make an affirmative showing that the delay weakened his or her ability to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>raise specific defenses, elicit specific testimony, or produce specific items of evidence does not preclude a finding that the defense has been impaired. Indeed, \u201cconsideration of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable,\u201d since \u201cexcessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655, 112 S.

In sum, these factors have no talismanic qualities; courts must still engage in a difficult and sensitive balancing process. But, because we are dealing with a fundamental right of the accused, this process must be carried out with full recognition that the accused\u2019s interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-8\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 533, 92 S. Ct. at 2193 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">\u00b6102 We have made similar observations, <em>see e.g. State v. Johnson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>2000 MT 180, \u00b6 14, 300 Mont. 367, \u00b6 14, 4 P.3d 654, \u00b6 14 (\u201cNo single factor of the <em>Barker </em>test is indispensable or dispositive.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>State v.

Rather, the factors must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">\u00b6103 As for each factor\u2019s relative importance in the overall balancing, we indicated in <em>Bruce </em>that we were adopting a method of analysis that includes features of both the \u201cstraight balancing test\u201d and the \u201cmotive test.\u201d <em>See Bruce, </em>\u00b6 54. The former \u201cconsiders each of the four factors equally, and no single factor is decisive,\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 51 (citing Brian P. Brooks, <em>A New Speedy Trial Standard for </em>Barker v. Wingo: <em>Reviving a Constitutional Remedy in an Age of Statutes, </em>61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 587, 592-93 (1994)), whereas the latter \u201cgives greatest consideration to the second <em>Barker </em>factor, the reason for delay,\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 53 (citing Brooks, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 610).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">\u00b6104 The right to a speedy trial, however, is \u201cnecessarily relative\u201d and \u201cdepends upon circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Ewell, </em>383 U.S. 116, 120, 86 S. Ct. 773, 776 (1966) (internal quotation marks omitted). As such, speedy trial analysis is necessarily case-specific. A defendant whose trial has been delayed twelve months due to stonewalling by the State, but who has not objected to the delay and has not been prejudiced to any significant degree by the delay, presents a markedly different claim than does a defendant whose trial also has been delayed twelve months due to stonewalling by the State, but who has repeatedly demanded a speedy trial during this period and has been prejudiced to a significant degree by the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">\u00b6105 For this reason, we decline to state, as a general rule, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Factor Two (the reason for the delay)-or any other factor, for that matter-deserves the \u201cgreatest consideration\u201d in the balancing. Rather, each factor\u2019s significance will vary from case to case, and a court assessing a speedy trial claim must weigh the four factors accordingly-i.e., based on the facts and circumstances of the particular case. For example, if the length of the delay is great enough, or if the State is sufficiently culpable in causing delay, a lesser showing of prejudice is necessary. On the other hand, if prejudice is extreme, the length of the delay required to establish a violation of the right is less. This approach, which is consistent with the \u201cstraight balancing test\u201d <em>(see Bruce, </em>\u00b6 51), best reflects the inherently case-specific nature of speedy trial claims and the reality that a given factor may outweigh all of the others in one case but be of little consequence in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">D. Summary of the Revised Speedy Trial Test</p>\n<p id=\"AN0\">\u00b6106 In sum, we are revising our framework for analyzing speedy trial claims so that it more closely tracks the balancing approach envisioned by the Supreme Court in <em>Barker, Doggett, </em>and other post-<em>Barker </em>cases. A court presented with a speedy trial claim is to analyze and then balance the following four factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">\u00b6107 Factor One: The Length of the Delay. Under Factor One, the court first ascertains whether the interval between accusation and trial is at least 200 days (irrespective of fault for the delay). If it is not, then further analysis is unnecessary, and the claim should be denied; but if the interval is at least 200 days, then the four-factor balancing test is triggered and the court must proceed with a full analysis. Second, the court considers the extent to which the delay (again, irrespective of fault for the delay) stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date. The significance of this latter determination is twofold. First, the presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time. Thus, the further the delay stretches beyond the trigger date, the stronger is the presumption under Factor Four that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay. Second, the State\u2019s burden under Factor Two to justify the delay likewise increases with the length of the delay. Thus, the further the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, the more compelling the State\u2019s justifications for the delay must be under Factor Two.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u00b6108 Factor Two: The Reasons for the Delay. Under Factor Two, the court first identifies each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial. The court then attributes each period of delay to the appropriate party, with any delay not demonstrated to have been caused by the accused or affirmatively waived by the accused being attributed to the State by default. Finally, the court assigns weight to each period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>delay based on the specific cause and motive for the delay. Reasons for the delay may include institutional circumstances, such as overcrowded court dockets, and \u201cvalid\u201d reasons, such as a missing witness. Both of these types of delay weigh less heavily against the State than do lack of diligence in bringing the accused to trial, which occupies a middle ground on the culpability scale, and bad-faith delay, such as a deliberate attempt to hamper the defense, which is weighed most heavily against the State. Weight is similarly assigned to acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delay caused by the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"AcV\">\u00b6109 The significance of Factor Two in the balancing process, therefore, is in the specific cause and culpability for each period of delay. The more delay caused by the State for \u201cunacceptable\u201d reasons (e.g., lack of diligence or bad-faith delay), the more likely the accused\u2019s speedy trial right has been violated. Likewise, the more delay caused by the accused for such reasons (e.g., to avoid being brought to trial), the less likely the right has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">\u00b6110 Factor Three: The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay. Under Factor Three, the court evaluates the accused\u2019s responses to the delay-i.e., his or her acquiescence in and objections to pretrial delays. The number of instances in which the accused acquiesces in or objects to pretrial delay is not talismanic. Rather, the court\u2019s evaluation must be based on the surrounding circumstances, such as the timeliness, persistence, and sincerity of the objections, the reasons for the acquiescence, whether the accused was represented by counsel, the accused\u2019s pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right), and so forth. The sum of this evaluation-i.e., the totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial-is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial, which in turn informs the inquiry into whether there has been a deprivation of the right. The evaluation also serves as a gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">\u00b6111 Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused. Under Factor Four, the court assesses whether the accused has been prejudiced by the delay in light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect-namely, (i) preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, (ii) minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges, and (iii) limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired. With respect to the first interest, the court considers whether the pretrial incarceration is \u201coppressive\u201d in light of all of the circumstances of the incarceration. With respect to the second interest, the issue is whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>the delay in bringing the accused to trial has unduly prolonged the disruption of his or her life or aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime. And with respect to the third interest, the court considers whether the delay has weakened the accused\u2019s ability to raise specific defenses, elicit specific testimony, or produce specific items of evidence. However, because affirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim, impairment of the defense may be evaluated based on other factors in the analysis, such as the length of the delay (the greater the delay, the greater the erosion of exculpatory evidence and testimony), the accused\u2019s responses to the delay (the more imperiled the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense becomes, the more likely he or she is to complain about the delay), and the duration of the pretrial incarceration (an accused who is locked up is hindered in his or her ability to gather evidence, contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare his or her defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">\u00b6112 Balancing. Lastly, the court determines whether the accused has been deprived of the right to a speedy trial by balancing each of the foregoing four factors. No one factor is dispositive by itself; rather, the factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">\u00b6113 For the convenience of the bench and bar, we are providing the following outline of our revised speedy trial test.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">I. Factor One: The Length of the Delay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">A. Is the delay long enough to trigger the four-factor balancing test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-8\">1. When did the defendant become an accused?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-9\">2. When is the defendant\u2019s trial date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-10\">3. Is the interval between accusation and trial at least 200 days?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-11\">B. To what extent does the delay stretch beyond the trigger date?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-12\">1. The presumption that pretrial delay has prejudiced the accused intensifies over time; thus, as the delay gets longer, the quantum of proof that may be expected of the accused under Factor Four decreases, while the quantum of proof that may be expected of the State under Factor Four simultaneously increases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-13\">2. The State\u2019s burden under Factor Two to justify the delay likewise increases with the length of the delay; thus, the further the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date, the more compelling the State\u2019s justifications under Factor Two must be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-14\">II. Factor Two: The Reasons for the Delay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-15\">A. Identify each period of delay in bringing the accused to trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>B. Attribute each period of delay to the appropriate party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-4\">1. The prosecution bears the burden of explaining the pretrial delays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-5\">2. Any delay not demonstrated to have been caused by the accused or affirmatively waived by the accused is attributed to the State by default.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">C. Assign weight to each period of delay based on the specific cause and culpability for the delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">1. Bad-faith delay, such as a deliberate attempt to gain a tactical advantage or to avoid trial, weighs heavily against the party that caused it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-8\">2. Negligence or lack of diligence in bringing the accused to trial occupies the middle ground on the culpability scale. It is weighed more lightly against the State than a deliberate attempt to hamper the defense, but it still falls on the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it has begun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-9\">3. Delay inherent in the criminal justice system and caused by circumstances largely beyond the control of the prosecutor and the accused is \u201cinstitutional delay,\u201d which is attributed to the State but weighs less heavily against the State than bad-faith delay and lack of diligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-10\">4. Delay for \u201cvalid\u201d reasons, such as a missing witness or a particularly complex charged offense, is weighed least heavily of all the types of delay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">III. Factor Three: The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-12\">A. Evaluate the accused\u2019s responses to the delay-i.e., his or her acquiescence in and objections to pretrial delays-in light of the surrounding circumstances. Some considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-13\">1. The timeliness, persistence, and sincerity of the objections</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-14\">2. The reasons for the acquiescence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-15\">3. Whether the accused was represented by counsel</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-16\">4. The accused\u2019s pretrial conduct (as that conduct bears on the speedy trial right)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-17\">B. The totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays in bringing him or her to trial is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial, which in turn informs the inquiry into whether there has been a deprivation of the right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-18\">C. The totality of the accused\u2019s various responses to the delays also serves as a gauge of the weights the court should assign to the other three factors in the balancing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-19\">IV. Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>A. Was the pretrial incarceration oppressive, given the circumstances of that incarceration? Some considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-4\">1. Duration of the incarceration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">2. The complexity of the charged offense(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-6\">3. Any misconduct on the part of the accused directly related to the pretrial incarceration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">4. The conditions of the incarceration</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">B. Has the delay in bringing the accused to trial unduly prolonged the disruption of his or her life caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges or aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime? Some considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">1. Public scorn or obloquy; damage to reputation in the community</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">2. Deprivation of employment</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">3. Drain of financial resources or economic hardship</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">4. Curtailment of associations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-13\">C. Has the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense been impaired by the delay? Some considerations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-14\">1. The availability of witnesses and their ability to recall accurately events related to the charged offense(s)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-15\">2. The accused\u2019s ability to raise specific defenses, elicit specific testimony, or produce specific items of evidence</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-16\">3. The length of the delay (excessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-17\">4. The accused\u2019s responses to the delay (the more imperiled the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense becomes, the more likely he or she is to complain about the delay)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-18\">5. The duration of the pretrial incarceration (an accused who is locked up is hindered in his or her ability to gather evidence, contact witnesses, or otherwise prepare his or her defense)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-19\">V. Balancing</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-20\">A. Given the length of the delay, the cause and culpability for each period of delay, the totality of the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, the strength of the presumption of prejudice in the case, and the strength of the parties\u2019 respective showings on the issue of prejudice, has the accused been deprived of his or her right to a speedy trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-21\">B. None of the four factors is either a necessary or a sufficient condition to the legal conclusion that the accused has been deprived of the right. Rather, the four factors must be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>together with such other circumstances as may be relevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">E. Timing of the Motion and Ruling by the Court</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">\u00b6114 We noted <em>in Bruce, </em>\u201cas a practical matter, that unless a motion to dismiss for speedy trial has been made at least ten days prior to the commencement of trial, it may be difficult for the State to adequately brief the issue, and for the court to adequately consider the issue, without postponing the existing trial date.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57. Thus, we stated that \u201cany delay directly attributable to a motion to dismiss based on denial of speedy trial which is filed less than ten days prior to the commencement of trial will be assigned to the defendant.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57; <em>see also State v. Kipp, </em>1999 MT 197, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 399, \u00b6 12, 984 P.2d 733, \u00b6 12 (\u201cWhen a defendant files an \u2018eve of trial\u2019 motion, which raises a complex legal issue or requires an evidentiary hearing which thereby makes the original trial date impracticable, the <em>reasonable </em>period of delay caused thereby is attributable to the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">\u00b6115 The negative implication of this ten-day rule is that any delay directly attributable to a speedy trial motion that is filed <em>ten or more </em>days prior to the commencement of trial will be assigned to the State. This time frame, in our view, is too short and places on the State an unwarranted amount of responsibility for a trial postponement. To be sure, it is not the accused\u2019s duty to ensure that the briefing and argument schedule proceeds in a manner that will insure that he or she is prosecuted in a timely fashion. <em>Kipp, </em>\u00b6 14. However, due consideration of a speedy trial motion generally requires time for an evidentiary hearing and a careful analysis of the facts pursuant to the four-factor balancing test set forth above (not to mention the time required for the parties to brief the issues fully), which cannot realistically be accomplished in less than thirty days without postponing the existing trial date.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">\u00b6116  Accordingly, we are modifying <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>ten-day rule such that any delay directly attributable to the filing of a speedy trial motion less than <em>thirty </em>days prior to the scheduled trial date should be charged to the accused. Conversely, any delay directly attributable to the filing of such a motion <em>thirty or more </em>days prior to the scheduled trial date should be charged to the State (as institutional delay). We believe that this rule equitably balances responsibility for any such delay and affords the court and the parties a reasonable time frame in which to address the speedy trial motion fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">\u00b6117  We also stated in <em>Bruce </em>that \u201conce a motion to dismiss for denial of speedy trial has been made,... it [must] be ruled upon by the district court before commencement of trial.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57. We reaffirm <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>this requirement and add that the court must, of necessity, enter findings of fact and conclusions of law with respect to each of the four factors <em>and </em>how the four factors were balanced against each other. Without these findings of fact and conclusions of law, appellate review of the court\u2019s final disposition of the claim is, as a practical matter, impossible, and we will be forced to remand the case to the trial court in such situations.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">\u00b6118 With that, we now turn to Ariegwe\u2019s speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u00b6119 A court presented with a speedy trial claim must first make factual findings and then determine whether the factual circumstances amount to a speedy trial violation. We, in turn, review the factual findings underlying the court\u2019s speedy trial ruling to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>State v. Spang, </em>2007 MT 54, \u00b6 7, 336 Mont. 184, \u00b6 7, 153 P.3d 646, \u00b6 7. The court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous if they are not supported by substantial credible evidence, if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Ray v. Nansel, </em>2002 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 135, \u00b6 19, 53 P.3d 870, \u00b6 19. However, whether the defendant has been denied a speedy trial-i.e., whether the factual circumstances, when evaluated pursuant to the four-factor balancing test, amount to a speedy trial violation-is a question of constitutional law. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Spang, </em>\u00b6 7. We review a trial court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation and application of the law are correct. <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Spang, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 7, 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">III. Application of the Balancing Test to Ariegwe\u2019s Speedy Trial Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">\u00b6120 Although the District Court and the parties analyzed Ariegwe\u2019s speedy trial motion in accordance with the approach articulated in <em>Bruce, </em>which we have now clarified and modified in several significant respects, we find it unnecessary to vacate the court\u2019s ruling and remand this case for reconsideration in light of the clarifications and modifications set forth above. <em>See e.g. State v. Hardaway, </em>1998 MT 224, \u00b6 13, 290 Mont. 516, \u00b6 13, 966 P.2d 125, \u00b6 13 (remanding for reconsideration in light of <em>Bruce). </em>The factual record before us, which includes a complete transcript of the parties\u2019 arguments at the hearing on Ariegwe\u2019s motion, is well-developed, thus enabling us to evaluate his speedy trial claim pursuant to the revised speedy trial test. Moreover, because the process by which the four factors are to be analyzed and balanced under our revised speedy trial test is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>substantially different from our approach under the <em>Bruce </em>test, we believe that it would be helpful and appropriate to illustrate that process for the benefit of the courts and the litigants who will be applying the test in future cases. <em>Cf. Bruce, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 59-75 (applying the approach articulated therein to the facts of that case). Accordingly, we will proceed with an analysis of Ariegwe\u2019s speedy trial claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">A. Analysis of the Four Factors</p>\n<p id=\"ALj\">1. Factor One: The Length of the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"A3B\">\u00b6121 The threshold question is whether the interval between accusation and Ariegwe\u2019s scheduled trial date (March 1, 2004) is at least 200 days, thereby triggering further speedy trial analysis. The District Court found the interval to be 388 days; however, this finding was based on an incorrect determination of when the speedy trial clock began to run. Although the court\u2019s error does not change the outcome under this threshold question (the court ultimately concluded, correctly, that further speedy trial analysis was required), it is still necessary, for purposes of the analysis below, to ascertain the correct length of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">\u00b6122 Relying on <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 55 (\u2018We will first consider the length of delay from <em>the time charges are filed . </em>. . until the defendant\u2019s trial date.\u201d (emphasis added)), the District Court measured from the date the State filed the original Information (February 7, 2003). However, as clarified above:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">[T]he protection afforded by the [speedy trial] guarantee is activated when a criminal prosecution has begun and extends to those persons who have been formally accused or charged in the course of that prosecution whether that accusation be by <em>arrest, </em>the filing of a complaint, or by indictment or information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\"><em>State v. Larson, </em>191 Mont. 257, 261, 623 P.2d 954, 957-58 (1981) (emphasis added). Here, Ariegwe became an \u201caccused\u201d for speedy trial purposes on January 18,2003, when he was arrested in relation to the charges subsequently filed on February 7. Thus, the interval between accusation and trial was 408 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">\u00b6123 The second inquiry under Factor One is the extent to which the delay stretches beyond the 200-day trigger date. Here, the delay in bringing Ariegwe to trial stretched 208 days beyond the trigger date-more than twice the amount of delay that is considered sufficiently prejudicial to trigger the speedy trial test. As a result, the State must provide particularly compelling justifications for the delay under Factor Two; and under Factor Four, the State must make a highly persuasive showing that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the delay, while the quantum of proof that may be expected of Ariegwe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>under this factor is correspondingly lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">2. Factor Two: The Reasons for the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">\u00b6124 The issue under Factor Two is whether the justifications proffered by the State for the various periods of delay weigh for or against the conclusion that Ariegwe was deprived of his right to a speedy trial. To make this determination, it is necessary to identify each period of delay in bringing Ariegwe to trial, to attribute each period of delay to the State or Ariegwe, and to assign appropriate weight to each period of delay based on the specific cause and culpability.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">\u00b6125 First Trial Setting: The first trial date set in this case was May 13, 2003, which the District Court selected at Ariegwe\u2019s February 20, 2003 arraignment. This constitutes a 115-dav delay (measured from January 18,2003, the date on which Ariegwe became an accused). The District Court attributed one of these days to Ariegwe because he had filed a request for substitution of judge on February 18, 2003. However, the question here is one of \u201cdelay,\u201d and Ariegwe\u2019s request did not result in a later trial date. Thus, all 115 days are attributable to the State. This delay, however, is of the type inherent in the criminal justice system due to the court\u2019s docket and built-in requirements such as reciprocal discovery, the omnibus and status hearings, and pretrial motions. As such, the 115 days constitute institutional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-8\">\u00b6126 Second Trial Setting: The second trial date was September 15, 2003, which added an additional 125 days of delay. The District Court charged 20 days of this delay to Ariegwe \u201cas a result of the Court\u2019s scheduling accommodation of defense counsel\u2019s summer vacation.\u201d The remaining 105 days were charged to the State \u201cbecause it was caused by the State\u2019s failure to timely provide discovery to the defendant\u201d-a finding that is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. Specifically, the prosecution was twice ordered to comply with \u00a7 46-15-322, MCA (requiring the prosecutor, upon request, to make enumerated items within his or her control available to the defendant for examination and reproduction)-first in the District Court\u2019s February 20,2003 Order Setting Trial Date, Requiring Discovery, and Setting Omnibus Hearing, and second in the court\u2019s March 19, 2003 Omnibus Hearing Memorandum and Order. However, the prosecution did not fully comply with these discovery orders. Thus, in his Pretrial Motions filed April 15,2003, Ariegwe stated that he had been unable \u201cto carry out [his] pretrial factual and legal investigation and otherwise prepare for trial.\u201d Of particular concern was the hard drive of his computer, which he believed might contain exculpatory evidence. In response, the prosecutor explained that while the computer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>been seized at the time of the initial search of Ariegwe\u2019s living quarters (on January 18, 2003), a detective had not been assigned to this case. \u201cAnd so rather than sending the computer over to Helena to the Department of Justice, it was sitting in Evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">\u00b6127 This justification does not suggest a deliberate attempt to delay the trial in order to hamper Ariegwe\u2019s defense; rather, it suggests a combination of understaffing and lack of diligence on the part of the State. Such delay occupies the middle ground on the culpability scale, though the lack of diligence is clearly \u201con the wrong side of the divide between acceptable and unacceptable reasons for delaying a criminal prosecution once it has begun,\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 657, 112 S. Ct. at 2693.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">\u00b6128 Accordingly, of the 125 days of delay resulting from the second trial setting, 105 days are attributable to the State as a result of understaffing and lack of diligence<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 20 days are attributable to Ariegwe as a result of the District Court\u2019s scheduling accommodation of defense counsel\u2019s summer vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">\u00b6129 Third Trial Setting: The third trial date was October 27,2003, which added an additional 42 days of delay. This postponement was the result of the prosecutor\u2019s September 9, 2003 motion to continue and, thus, was attributed by the District Court to the State. As for categorizing this delay (e.g., as bad-faith, lack of diligence, institutional, or for valid reasons), the motion does not disclose the particular reason for the prosecutor\u2019s request. A postponement brought about by a motion that does not reveal the basis therefor is presumed to be unjustified and is weighed heavily against the proponent, unless evidence elsewhere in the record establishes otherwise. <em>See Morris v. Wyrick, </em>516 F.2d 1387, 1390 (8th Cir. 1975) (assuming on a record that did not reveal the reason for the delay that there was no justifiable reason and, accordingly, weighing that delay heavily against the state). Here, the record reveals that the motion was necessitated by the State\u2019s delay in delivering evidence for testing at the crime lab. Thus, the 42 days are attributable to the State as the result of lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>diligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">\u00b6130 Fourth Trial Setting: The fourth trial date was November 24, 2003, which added an additional 28 davs of delay. This postponement was the result of the prosecutor\u2019s October 10,2003 motion to continue, which she filed on the ground that \u201cthe evidence in this matter is currently being tested at the Montana State Crime Laboratory, and... the testing will not be completed in time for the current trial setting.\u201d This delay, which the District Court charged to the State, is institutional in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u00b6131 Fifth Trial Setting: The fifth trial date was December 8, 2003, which added an additional 14 davs of delay. This postponement was the result of a sua sponte order by the District Court due to a conflict in the court\u2019s calendar. As such, it is institutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\u00b6132 Sixth Trial Setting: The sixth trial date was January 5, 2004, which added an additional 28 davs of delay. This postponement was the result of Ariegwe\u2019s November 25, 2003 motion to continue, which he filed on the ground that the parties were still waiting for test results from the crime lab. The delay, which the District Court correctly charged to the State, is institutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">\u00b6133 Seventh Trial Setting: The seventh, and final, trial date was March 1, 2004, which added an additional 56 davs of delay. This postponement was the result of Ariegwe\u2019s December 22, 2003 motion to continue, which he filed on the grounds that he had not yet received the trace evidence report and that he needed time to review the serology and DNA report, which he had received four days earlier. The District Court vacated the January 5,2004 trial date and scheduled a status hearing for January 22,2004. At that hearing, defense counsel stated that he had received all crime lab reports, and the court and the parties then agreed on the March 1 trial date. In attributing this period of delay, the District Court determined that the State\u2019s failure to produce the crime lab reports in a timely manner had necessitated Ariegwe\u2019s motion to continue. Thus, the court attributed the 56 days to the State as institutional delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">\u00b6134 Summary: In sum, the interval between accusation and trial in this case was 408 days. Of that, 241 days are attributable to the State as institutional delay, 42 days are attributable to the State due to lack of diligence, and 105 days are attributable to the State as delay caused in part by understaffing and in part by lack of diligence, for a total of 388 days. Ariegwe is responsible for the remaining 20 days, which were the result of the District Court\u2019s scheduling accommodation of defense counsel\u2019s summer vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">\u00b6135 As discussed under Factor One, the State was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>provide particularly compelling justifications for the delay in this case, given the extent to which the delay stretched beyond the 200-day trigger date. The foregoing analysis establishes, however, that 95% of the delay in this case is attributable to the State. Significantly, more than half of the State\u2019s delay was institutional in nature (i.e., due to circumstances largely beyond the prosecutor\u2019s control), but that fact takes the State only so far, given that the primary burden to assure that cases are promptly brought to trial is \u201con the courts and the prosecutors,\u201d <em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 529, 92 S. Ct. at 2191. In this regard, a significant portion of the delay here was necessitated, according to the District Court, by \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to timely provide discovery to the defendant\u201d and \u201cthe State\u2019s failure to timely produce the [crime lab] reports.\u201d The fact that evidence seized from Ariegwe\u2019s living quarters was left \u201csitting in Evidence\u201d for several months, rather than being promptly sent to the crime lab for analysis, is inconsistent with a diligent prosecution of this case. For these reasons, we conclude that Factor Two weighs in favor of the conclusion that Ariegwe was deprived of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">3. Factor Three: The Accused\u2019s Responses to the Delay</p>\n<p id=\"ATg\">\u00b6136 The focus under Factor Three is on the accused\u2019s responses to the delay, which are evaluated based on the surrounding circumstances. The totality of the accused\u2019s responses-which is indicative of whether he or she actually wanted a speedy trial-is then balanced with the other three factors in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">\u00b6137 During the time period at issue here, however, Ariegwe was operating under our <em>Bruce </em>test, which required only that the right to a speedy trial be \u201cinvoked at any time prior to the commencement of trial, either by demanding a speedy trial, or by moving to dismiss for failure to provide a speedy trial.\u201d <em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 57. There is no suggestion in <em>Bruce\u2019s </em>articulation of Factor Three that a court may infer, based on the timing of the accused\u2019s assertion of the right and the accused\u2019s other responses to pretrial delays, that he did or did not want a speedy trial. Indeed, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-6\">there is no magical time for assertion of the right to a speedy trial which should be weighed more favorably to the defendant than some other time. So long as the defendant asserts his or her right to a speedy trial by a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds filed prior to the time of trial, we conclude that the defendant has satisfied the third-prong of the <em>Barker </em>test and that further analysis of that prong is not only unnecessary, but inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AnM\"><em>Bruce, </em>\u00b6 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">\u00b6138 For these reasons, any inference that Ariegwe did or did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>want a speedy trial, given the timing of his motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds and his other responses to pretrial delays, would be of questionable accuracy. On the other hand, as explained above, we are applying the revised speedy trial test to the facts of this case to illustrate the process for the benefit of the courts and the litigants who will be applying the test in future cases, and omitting an analysis of revised Factor Three would undermine that goal. Under these circumstances, therefore, we will proceed with a full analysis of Factor Three in this case; however, we will accord little weight to this factor in the overall balancing, given that Ariegwe was operating under the mandates of <em>Bruce.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">\u00b6139 We begin by noting that Ariegwe filed his motion to dismiss on January 26,2004 (35 days before trial). However, as a general rule the mere fact that the accused filed a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds sometime prior to the commencement of trial is itself of little probative value on the question of whether the right has been violated. Rather, we must view the assertion of the right in the context of the case as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">\u00b6140 In this regard, we observe that Ariegwe\u2019s motion was filed on the 373rd day of the delay in this case. (Actually, he first asserted his speedy trial right four days earlier at the January 22, 2004 status hearing and indicated that a written motion would be forthcoming.) If not for the fact that he was operating under the mandates of <em>Bruce, </em>Ariegwe\u2019s waiting this long past the 200-day trigger date to assert the right would suggest that he was not particularly interested in being brought to trial sooner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">\u00b6141 Other facts in the record, however, support a contrary conclusion. For instance, during the period immediately following his arraignment, Ariegwe requested a number of discoverable items from the State (e.g., his computer hard drive, certain physical evidence, photographs taken by the police, medical records concerning the examination and treatment of K.M., the tape-recording of the conversation between K.M. and R.K., and telephone records); and when the State did not respond to these requests, which Ariegwe had made \u201con an informal basis,\u201d he filed his April 15, 2003 Pretrial Motions asking the court to order the State to provide the items. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>persistence in the early stages of this case appears elsewhere in the record, suggesting that Ariegwe sought to move the case along, not to delay it. Indeed, as noted under Factor Two, he was responsible for only 20 days of the 408-day delay in this case, which indicates no stonewalling on his part. Furthermore, although Ariegwe appears to have acquiesced in some of that delay, he explained in his affidavit attached to his motion to dismiss as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-4\">I do understand that my attorneys have on three occasions requested trial be delayed. To the extent that I was consulted at all, I only consented to these delays because my attorneys convinced me delay, no matter how painful to me personally, was necessary to obtain and have the opportunity to review what might be essential evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Given these circumstances, it appears that Ariegwe wanted to be brought to trial sooner rather than later.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\u00b6142 In <em>Barker, </em>the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">The more serious the deprivation, the more likely a defendant is to complain. The defendant\u2019s assertion of his speedy trial right, then, is entitled to strong evidentiary weight in determining whether the defendant is being deprived of the right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\"><em>Barker, </em>407 U.S. at 531-32, 92 S. Ct. at 2192-93. Here, Ariegwe did \u201ccomplain\u201d about the State\u2019s delay in providing discovery (which necessitated the first postponement), but no additional complaints appear in the record until the January 22, 2004 status hearing-the 369th day of the delay-when defense counsel indicated that he would be filing a motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. While these facts would be entitled to significant weight in a case where the accused was operating under the revised speedy trial test, we accord them little weight here since Ariegwe was operating under the <em>Bruce </em>test. We simply observe that the totality of Ariegwe\u2019s various responses to the pretrial delays in this case, including his apparent reluctance to acquiesce in delay notwithstanding the advice of counsel, is consistent with a desire to be brought to trial. Thus, we conclude that Factor Three weighs slightly in favor of the conclusion that Ariegwe was deprived of his right to a speedy trial, though we will accord this factor little weight in the overall balancing.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">4. Factor Four: Prejudice to the Accused</p>\n<p id=\"A_f\">\u00b6143 Lastly, the issue under Factor Four is whether Ariegwe was prejudiced as a result of the delay in bringing him to trial. As explained above, a presumption that the accused has been prejudiced by the delay arises on the 200-day trigger date for speedy trial analysis (at which point it is minimal) and intensifies over time. Thus, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>both parties should come forward with evidence on the question of prejudice, the court must weigh each party\u2019s evidence (or lack thereof) in light of this intensifying presumption. Specifically, as the delay gets longer, the necessary showing by the accused of particularized prejudice decreases while the necessary showing by the State of no prejudice simultaneously increases. For purposes of this case, we concluded under Factor One that the presumption had intensified to the point at which the State must make a highly persuasive showing that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the delay, while the quantum of proof that may be expected of Ariegwe under this factor is correspondingly lower.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">\u00b6144 Prejudice is assessed in light of the interests that the speedy trial right was designed to protect: preventing oppressive pretrial incarceration, minimizing anxiety and concern caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges, and limiting the possibility that the accused\u2019s ability to present an effective defense will be impaired. Here, the extent of Ariegwe\u2019s pretrial incarceration was four days following his arrest, which he conceded in the District Court was not oppressive. Likewise, in response to the State\u2019s argument that all of the potential evidence in the case had been preserved and that all of Ariegwe\u2019s potential witnesses were available to testify at trial, he conceded that he could not point to any specific impairment of his ability to present an effective defense (though he did point out that a certain amount of impairment-e.g., dimming memories-must be presumed given the length of the delay).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">\u00b6145 Accordingly, Ariegwe emphasized the interest in minimizing anxiety and concern. In an affidavit attached to his motion to dismiss, he described numerous consequences that had flowed from the existence of the charges against him. Specifically, his being accused of sexual relations with a minor had caused tension between him and his ex-wife (with whom he shared a residence), and they had sought counseling as a result. Their oldest child had been taunted at school. Ariegwe had resigned his position as a counselor to troubled youth at A.W.A.R.E., Inc. because the charges were \u201cso especially humiliating due to the nature of my work.\u201d He stated that the pendency of the charges was precluding him from employment in his chosen field as a youth counselor and was making employment opportunities in other fields uncertain. Lastly, acknowledging that \u201call defendants suffer at least some distress,\u201d he asserted that his \u201cis particularly acute in that I live with not only the prospect of imprisonment and disqualification from my chosen employment, I also face deportation [to Nigeria]\u201d and \u201closs of the society of my children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b521-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>\u00b6146 Ariegwe attached two supporting exhibits to his affidavit. One was a December 15, 2003 letter from a licensed clinical social worker and board certified psychotherapist, who stated that Ariegwe was experiencing \u201cmoderate to at times a severe level of anxiety.\u201d The other was a November 22, 2003 letter from Ariegwe\u2019s ex-wife, who stated that she had been having trouble sleeping at night, was fearful of what people were thinking about her and her family, and was worried about the effects the case was having on her children. She also testified to this effect at the speedy trial hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b6147 Unquestionably, the experiences described by Ariegwe and his ex-wife constitute disruptions to his life, which in turn created anxiety and concern in him and his family. However, the speedy trial guarantee serves \u201cto <em>shorten </em>the disruption of life caused by arrest and the presence of unresolved criminal charges,\u201d <em>MacDonald, </em>456 U.S. at 8, 102 S. Ct. at 1502 (emphasis added), not to eliminate the disruption altogether. Thus, the question here is whether the delay in bringing Ariegwe to trial unduly prolonged the disruption or aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime. Furthermore, as the prosecutor correctly pointed out during the speedy trial hearing, the focus is on the anxiety and concern experienced by Ariegwe, to whom the speedy trial right applies; the anxiety and concern experienced by his family are relevant only to the extent that they affected the anxiety and concern experienced by Ariegwe.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b6148 In response to Ariegwe\u2019s motion and affidavit, the State took the position that the anxiety and concern cited by Ariegwe were not caused by the delay in bringing him to trial. For instance, the prosecutor argued that Ariegwe\u2019s decision to resign his position as a youth counselor was due to the nature of the charges against him, which he had characterized as \u201cespecially humiliating.\u201d Likewise, she contended that his concern about a future devoid of contact with his children was due to the possibility that he would be deported upon conviction, not the delay in bringing him to trial. She acknowledged that the delay may have contributed to the strain on his relationship with his ex-wife, but she opined that this strain was due more to the nature of the charged offenses than to the length of the delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b6149 In response to the prosecutor\u2019s argument, Ariegwe pointed out that although some of the anxiety and concern articulated in his affidavit was either inherent in being charged with a crime or due to the nature of the charged offenses, \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between being subject to these kinds of stressors in one\u2019s life for a period of 90 days or 180 days ... and being subjected to those stresses for a period of 380 days.\u201d The District Court, however, ultimately agreed with the State, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>finding that \u201cthe primary source\u201d of Ariegwe\u2019s anxiety and concern was the nature of the charged offenses and that while the delay in bringing him to trial had \u201ccontributed somewhat\u201d to Ariegwe\u2019s anxiety and concern, \u201cit did not substantially, aggravate it ... to the extent warranting dismissal on that factor alone.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b6150 Ariegwe assigns error to the District Court\u2019s analysis on two grounds. First, he claims that the court erroneously required him \u201cto apportion his anxiety and concern between the nature of the offense charged, and the delay.\u201d Such apportionment, however, is necessary, given that the speedy trial guarantee serves to shorten the disruption of life caused by the presence of unresolved criminal charges, not to make the criminal charges themselves less \u201chumiliating\u201d or unsettling. On the other hand, Ariegwe is correct that anxiety and concern caused by the nature of the charged offenses may be unduly prolonged in a given case. But he has not demonstrated that his anxiety and concern were unduly prolonged in this case. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court\u2019s apportionment of Ariegwe\u2019s anxiety and concern is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b6151 Second, Ariegwe claims that the District Court erroneously required him to show \u201ca demonstrable, direct effect\u201d that the delay had on his anxiety and concern and his ability to present an effective defense. Relying on <em>Doggett, </em>he argues that \u201ca requirement that the accused demonstrate actual, provable prejudice is inappropriate.\u201d This interpretation of <em>Doggett, </em>however, is too broad. It is true that \u201cconsideration of prejudice is not limited to the specifically demonstrable,\u201d that \u201cexcessive delay presumptively compromises the reliability of a trial in ways that neither party can prove or, for that matter, identify,\u201d and that \u201caffirmative proof of particularized prejudice is not essential to every speedy trial claim.\u201d <em>Doggett, </em>505 U.S. at 655, 112 S. Ct. at 2692, 2693. However, as explained above, the extent to which an accused may rely on presumptive prejudice depends on the extent to which the delay extends beyond the 200-day trigger date. In the case at hand, while the presumption of prejudice did operate in Ariegwe\u2019s favor by requiring the State to make a highly persuasive showing that he had not been prejudiced by the delay, the presumption was not so strong that Ariegwe was relieved entirely of making a showing of some particularized prejudice. Accordingly, we conclude that the District Court did not err in requiring a showing by Ariegwe of some demonstrable prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b6152 Proceeding, then, with an evaluation of Factor Four, we conclude that the State made the required highly persuasive showing that Ariegwe was not prejudiced by the delay in bringing him to trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>First, the State demonstrated, and Ariegwe conceded, a complete absence of oppressive pretrial incarceration. Second, the State demonstrated that Ariegwe\u2019s ability to present an effective defense had not been demonstrably impaired. Third, the delay in this case somewhat aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime; however, the State demonstrated, and the District Court found, that \u201cthe primary source\u201d of Ariegwe\u2019s anxiety and concern was the nature of the charged offenses. Taking these three considerations together, we conclude that the State\u2019s showing outweighs the presumption of prejudice established under Factor One and that Factor Four, therefore, weighs against the conclusion that Ariegwe was deprived of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">B. Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b6153 A court assessing a speedy trial claim must balance the four factors based on the facts of the particular case and the weights assigned to each factor. None of the factors is dispositive by itself; rather, the factors are related and must be considered together with such other circumstances as may be relevant. But because the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right of the accused, this process must be carried out with full recognition that the accused\u2019s interest in a speedy trial is specifically affirmed in the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b6154 Here, Factor One weighs in Ariegwe\u2019s favor. It establishes that a significant delay of 408 days occurred in this case. Likewise, Factor Two weighs in Ariegwe\u2019s favor, given that 95% of the 408-day delay was attributable to the State and that the record reflects a significant lack of diligence on the part of the State in providing discovery and sending evidence to the crime lab in a timely manner. Factor Three weighs slightly in Ariegwe\u2019s favor; however, we are according this factor relatively little weight in the overall balancing, given that Ariegwe was operating under the <em>Bruce </em>test during the time period at issue here and, thus, the inferences we have drawn based on his responses to the pretrial delays in this case are of questionable accuracy. We simply observe that the totality of Ariegwe\u2019s various responses is consistent with a desire to be brought to trial. Finally, Factor Four weighs in the State\u2019s favor. Although the delay in this case somewhat aggravated the anxiety and concern that are inherent in being accused of a crime, the State made a highly persuasive showing that Ariegwe\u2019s anxiety and concern were due primarily to the nature of the charged offenses rather than to the delay in bringing him to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">\u00b6155  We conclude that the State\u2019s highly persuasive showing of no prejudice (Factor Four) outweighs the extent of the delay (Factor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>One) and the State\u2019s culpability in causing the delay (Factor Two). We further conclude that although the totality of Ariegwe\u2019s responses to the pretrial delays in this case is consistent with a desire to be brought to trial (Factor Three), the relatively little weight we have assigned to this factor is not enough to tip the scale in Ariegwe\u2019s favor. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Ariegwe was not deprived of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">\u00b6156 <em>Issue Two. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying Ariegwe\u2019s motion for a new trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u00b6157 Ariegwe contends that the District Court abused its discretion in not granting his motion for a new trial. The basis of that motion was that (1) defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to allegedly improper hair comparison testimony by one of the State\u2019s experts during trial and (2) the prosecutor\u2019s inaccurate representations of certain scientific evidence during closing arguments had denied Ariegwe a fair and impartial trial. Although the motion was specifically \u201cpremise[d]... on the conduct of both defense counsel and the prosecutor,\u201d Ariegwe has not renewed his claim based on defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the hair comparison testimony. Accordingly, we will focus only on the prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">\u00b6158 During trial, the State called Michelle Griffin, a forensic scientist specializing in serology and DNA analysis at the State Crime Lab. Griffin had examined a blanket seized from Ariegwe\u2019s bed and found eight stains on the blanket. One of these stains tested positive for amylase (an enzyme found in saliva), and a subsequent DNA analysis revealed the presence of multiple contributors to the stain, two of whom <em>could </em>have been K.M. and Ariegwe. More specifically, Griffin testified that K.M. and Ariegwe \u201ccannot be excluded as contributors to that mixture\u201d and that \u201cthere is data there present [in the stain] not associated with [K.M. and Ariegwe].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">\u00b6159 Paraphrasing Griffin\u2019s testimony during closing argument, the prosecutor stated that the mixture of DNA found in the saliva stain, from which Ariegwe and K.M. could not be excluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">is consistent with the Defendant performing oral sex with [K.M.] on that bed, and body fluids mixing and running onto that blanket. And that\u2019s what they found. <em>Their genetic material was found on that bed, mixed together. </em>Right in the area where [K.M.] says this took place. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Defense counsel did not object at this point to the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement. Rather, he pointed out during his closing argument that Griffin had testified only that K.M. and Ariegwe \u201ccannot be excluded\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>as contributors to the mixture of DNA found in the saliva stain.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\">\u00b6160 During her rebuttal, however, the prosecutor again suggested that KM.\u2019s and Ariegwe\u2019s DNA had, in fact, been found mixed together on the blanket. Specifically, she argued that in order to buy Ariegwe\u2019s story, the jury would have to believe that 15-year-old K.M. was \u201cso savvy and so smart\u201d that she knew to plant forensic evidence to support a claim of rape. \u201cIt\u2019s ludicrous. She . .. knew that she needed to plant some of the Defendant\u2019s saliva with some of her vaginal fluid on that blanket in the very spot-\u201d At this point, defense counsel did object: \u201cThat is not supported by testimony, by any evidence, as to the source of the DNA that they found. There\u2019s no evidence. There was no testimony as to any vaginal fluid.\u201d The court sustained the objection. Notwithstanding, the prosecutor then continued: \u201c[K.M.] knew that she had to place some form of DNA substance of hers mixed in with some DNA substance of his on the blanket, at the very place where saliva is found, and she claims oral sex occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">\u00b6161 Following the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal, the judge called counsel to the bench for a sidebar conference regarding his ruling on defense counsel\u2019s objection. The judge stated that the jury had probably not heard him sustain the objection, because he had done so \u201cunder [his] breath.\u201d Since he wanted to make sure that there were no errors in the case, the judge indicated that he would instruct the jury that there was no evidence that Ariegwe\u2019s DNA had been found in any of K.M.\u2019s vaginal fluid. The prosecutor and defense counsel agreed, and the judge then instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-6\">Before we proceed with deliberations, jurors, Mr. Sehestedt made an objection during Miss Weber\u2019s rebuttal argument that I sustained. I did that almost under my breath. I\u2019m not sure that that was audible to you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">And so that there\u2019s no confusion in this case, I\u2019m telling you for the record right now that there is no evidence in this case that the Defendant\u2019s DNA was found in any vaginal fluid of the alleged victim in this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">Immediately thereafter, the jurors began their deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">\u00b6162 In his motion for a new trial, Ariegwe argued that \u201c[w]hile prosecutors have the right to suggest inferences-identified as such-which they wish the jury to draw from the evidence, they have no right to go beyond the record or make greater the weight of the evidence presented.\u201d He asserted that the prosecutor had done so in this case by making \u201cinaccurate and untrue representations about the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">\u00b6163 The District Court agreed. In its order on Ariegwe\u2019s motion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>court observed that \u201cthe State\u2019s counsel did in fact improperly and inaccurately represent to the jury that \u2018[t]heir genetic material was found on that bed, mixed together\u2019 \u201d (alteration in original). The court further observed that \u201c[t]he State\u2019s counsel then compounded the problem during rebuttal argument\u201d when she suggested that K.M.\u2019s vaginal fluid and Ariegwe\u2019s saliva had been found mixed together on the blanket. However, the court noted that it had, sua sponte, given a curative instruction and that Ariegwe had not requested any further clarification or curative instruction. Accordingly, the court concluded that \u201cto the extent that State\u2019s counsel improperly or erroneously characterized the evidence to the jury during closing arguments, the error was contemporaneously cured by the Court\u2019s curative instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">\u00b6164 Section 46-16-702(1), MCA, provides that \u201c[following a verdict or finding of guilty, the court may grant the defendant a new trial if required in the interest of justice.\u201d Our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial depends on the basis of the motion. <em>See Giambra v. Kelsey, </em>2007 MT 158, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 338 Mont. 19, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 162 P.3d 134, \u00b6\u00b6 24-27 (clarifying that our standard of review of a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for a new trial based on insufficiency of the evidence is de novo, not manifest abuse of discretion, given that the trial court\u2019s conclusion as to whether sufficient evidence exists to convict is ultimately an analysis and application of the law to the facts, not a matter of discretion). Here, the basis of the new trial motion is that the prosecutor\u2019s inaccurate representations of certain evidence during closing arguments denied Ariegwe a fair and impartial trial. The analysis of this claim entails an evaluation of the prejudicial effect of the inaccurate representations and the remedial value of the court\u2019s curative instruction. The trial judge, having been present throughout the course of the trial and having observed the jurors firsthand, is in a better position than are we to conduct such an evaluation. We thus will review the District Court\u2019s ultimate determinations that Ariegwe was not denied a fair and impartial trial and that a new trial, therefore, was not required in the interests of justice for abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Goettle, </em>253 Mont. 111, 113, 831 P.2d 595, 596-97 (1992); <em>State v. Staat, </em>251 Mont. 1, 9-10, 822 P.2d 643, 648-49 (1991); <em>cf. State v. Dubois, </em>2006 MT 89, \u00b6\u00b6 57-61, 332 Mont. 44, \u00b6\u00b6 57-61, 134 P.3d 82, \u00b6\u00b6 57-61. In order to establish that the court abused its discretion, Ariegwe must demonstrate that the court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason and, further, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>court\u2019s abuse of discretion was prejudicial. <em>State v. Price, </em>2006 MT 79, \u00b6 17, 331 Mont. 502, \u00b6 17, 134 P.3d 45, \u00b6 17; \u00a7 46-20-701(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\">\u00b6165 In light of the District Court\u2019s finding that the prosecutor had \u201cimproperly and inaccurately\u201d represented to the jury that KM.\u2019s and Ariegwe\u2019s DNA had been found \u201cmixed together\u201d on the blanket, Ariegwe focuses on the issue of whether he was prejudiced by the inaccurate representations. In this regard, he argues that KM.\u2019s testimony alone could not have carried the State\u2019s case. For one thing, the jury acquitted him of sexual intercourse without consent, which in his view indicates that the jurors did not fully credit KM.\u2019s testimony. In addition, he points to the following argument by the prosecutor during her rebuttal argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-5\">[L]adies and gentlemen, this is not a he said, she said case. You don\u2019t need to rely only on [KM.\u2019s] testimony in this case. You have photographic evidence that supports what she told the police. You have hair evidence. You have fiber evidence. You have DNA saliva evidence. You have physical evidence of injury and you have psychological evidence of injury, all of which support [K.M.\u2019s] version of what happened on that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">Given this argument and his acquittal on the charge of sexual intercourse without consent, Ariegwe contends that the forensic expert\u2019s testimony \u201cplayed a crucial part in the state\u2019s case\u201d and that the prosecutor\u2019s inaccurate representations about \u201cmixed\u201d DNA, therefore, prejudiced his right to a fair and impartial trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">\u00b6166 The prosecutor\u2019s inaccurate representations, however, were addressed by the District Court in its curative instruction to the jury, and we have said that \u201c[t]he potential prejudicial effect of improper arguments may be cured when the jury has been admonished not to regard those statements as evidence,\u201d <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 31, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6 31, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6 31. Thus, the specific issue here is whether the court\u2019s instruction was not sufficient to cure any prejudice that resulted from the misstatements about \u201cmixed\u201d DNA.</p>\n<p id=\"A9US\">\u00b6167 In this regard, Ariegwe contends that \u201c[i]n light of the repeated representations in the state\u2019s closing, one curative instruction, following a ruling on an objection which the judge himself was unsure the jury even heard, cannot be said, with confidence, to have remedied the problem.\u201d In response, the State contends that by instructing the jury that \u201cthere is no evidence in this case that the Defendant\u2019s DNA was found in any vaginal fluid of the alleged victim in this case,\u201d the court\u2019s instruction actually \u201caided\u201d Ariegwe\u2019s defense, given that he was acquitted of the charge of sexual intercourse without consent. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>the very least, the State argues, the court did not abuse its discretion in denying Ariegwe\u2019s motion on the ground that the instruction cured the prosecutor\u2019s error.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">\u00b6168  We agree with the State\u2019s latter point. As noted above, the District Court reasoned in its order denying Ariegwe\u2019s motion that \u201cto the extent that State\u2019s counsel improperly or erroneously characterized the evidence to the jury during closing arguments, the error was contemporaneously cured by the Court\u2019s curative instruction.\u201d The record supports this conclusion, as does the fact that the jury is presumed to have followed the court\u2019s instruction. <em>See State v. Turner, </em>262 Mont. 39, 55, 864 P.2d 235, 245 (1993) (\u201cIt is a well recognized principle of law that juries are presumed to follow the law as given them.\u201d); <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 25, 327 Mont. 238, \u00b6 25, 113 P.3d 290, \u00b6 25 (\u201c[T]he jury cannot be presumed to ignore their duties to respect the instructions of the court.\u201d). Accordingly, applying our standard of review to the court\u2019s ruling on Ariegwe\u2019s motion for a new trial, we hold that he has not demonstrated that the court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason in denying that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">\u00b6169 Before concluding this discussion, we note Ariegwe\u2019s brief argument that he was also prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s misstatement of testimony regarding blanket fibers found in K.M.\u2019s underwear. Alice Ammen, an expert in trace hair and fiber examination, testified on direct examination that it was \u201chighly probable\u201d that KM.\u2019s underwear had come in contact with the blanket recovered from Ariegwe\u2019s bed. However, Ammen acknowledged on cross-examination that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that blanket fibers on K.M.\u2019s outer garments-her socks, jeans, sweater, and blouse-had transferred to KM.\u2019s underwear when all of these items were placed together in a pile at KM.\u2019s house following the incident. Furthermore, on redirect examination, Ammen would only say that the number of blanket fibers found on KM.\u2019s underwear was \u201cmore indicative\u201d of direct transfer than indirect transfer. During her rebuttal argument, however, the prosecutor stated: \u201cThe cross-contamination issue was ruled out by Alice Ammen. She told you that the fiber transfer in [K.M.\u2019s] underwear was direct.\u201d Ariegwe objected that these statements were not supported by the evidence, but the court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">\u00b6170 Ariegwe now argues that he was prejudiced by the prosecutor\u2019s incorrect statements concerning fiber cross-contamination and by the District Court\u2019s failure to sustain his objection. Yet, Ariegwe did not make this argument in his motion for a new trial. (He did mention <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Ammen\u2019s testimony regarding the fibers, but he did not fist the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements of that testimony as a basis for a new trial, and the District Court, therefore, did not address it.) Accordingly, the prosecutor\u2019s statements concerning fiber cross-contamination are not relevant in determining whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Ariegwe\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">\u00b6171 In sum, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Ariegwe\u2019s motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">\u00b6172 <em>Issue Three. Is the District Court\u2019s restitution order illegal?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">\u00b6173 The District Court found that as a result of Ariegwe\u2019s offenses, K.M. and her family had sustained a pecuniary loss of $3,332.68 due to uninsured medical, counseling, and related travel expenses; that the Montana State Crime Victims Compensation Unit had incurred costs in the amount of $38.40 as partial compensation to K.M. and her family; and that K.M. and her family had incurred medical and counseling expenses that were covered by EBMS Insurance Co. in the amount of $10,863.58. The court, therefore, ordered Ariegwe to pay restitution to these victims in the specified amounts. In so doing, however, the court acknowledged that it had no information regarding Ariegwe\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution. For this reason, Ariegwe contends that the restitution requirement is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">II.

Sprinkle, </em>2000 MT 188, \u00b6 6, 300 Mont. 405, \u00b6 6, 4 P.3d 1204, \u00b6 6 (\u2018We review the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing statutes to determine whether the district court was correct.\u201d). This determination is a question of law and, as such, our review is de novo. <em>Seals, </em>\u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u00b6176 Asa preliminary matter, we will address the State\u2019s argument that Ariegwe should not be allowed to challenge the District Court\u2019s restitution order on appeal. The State claims that Ariegwe \u201crefused to cooperate [with the probation and parole officer who prepared the presentence investigation report] and therefore he cannot now benefit from his own wrong.\u201d The State cites no support for this argument in the pertinent statutes, but instead relies on <em>Sikora v. Sikora, </em>160 Mont. 27, 30-33, 499 P.2d 808, 810-11 (1972), where we held that a surviving widow, who had pleaded guilty to the voluntary manslaughter of her husband, could not benefit from her wrongful act and share in his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">\u00b6177 As Ariegwe points out, however, the State\u2019s argument is factually incorrect. When the probation and parole officer arrived at the jail to interview Ariegwe, he simply stated that he would like to consult with his attorney before meeting with the officer. He was aware that his motion for a new trial was pending at the time, and he explained that he had been trying to get a hold of his attorney for four weeks but had been unable to do so. On this record, we cannot agree with the State\u2019s assertion that Ariegwe \u201crefused to cooperate\u201d with the officer. Furthermore, we have been presented with no authority for the proposition that an offender is not entitled to consult with his or her attorney before meeting with the probation and parole officer. We therefore reject the State\u2019s contention that Ariegwe should be precluded from challenging the District Court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"A2J\">\u00b6178 The sentencing statutes in effect at the time of the commission of the offense control as to the possible sentence. <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 220, \u00b6 16, 113 P.3d 297, \u00b6 16. Ariegwe committed the crimes of attempted sexual intercourse without consent and unlawful transactions with children on January 17, 2003. Thus, the 2001 sentencing statutes apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u00b6179 Section 46-18-201(5), MCA (2001) provides that \u201cif the sentencing judge finds that the victim of the offense has sustained a pecuniary loss, the sentencing judge shall require payment of full restitution to the victim as provided in 46-18-241 through 46-18-249.\u201d Section 46-18-242(l)(a), MCA, in turn, requires the probation officer, restitution officer, or other designated person to include \u201cdocumentation of the offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution\u201d in the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AmxB\">\u00b6180 In <em>State v. Pritchett, </em>2000 MT 261, 302 Mont. 1, 11 P.3d 539, we held that the \u201cgeneral mandate\u201d of \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA, \u201cis subject to the detailed procedures and qualifications found in \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 to 249, MCA,\u201d and that district courts \u201care not authorized to impose a sentence of restitution until all these additional statutory requirements are satisfied.\u201d <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6 7. Thus, given that the PSI in that case failed to document Pritchett\u2019s financial resources and his future ability to pay restitution, we held that the district court\u2019s restitution order was illegal. <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6 13. We reached the same conclusion in <em>State v. Hilgers, </em>1999 MT 284, 297 Mont. 23, 989 P.2d 866, and <em>State v. Muhammad, </em>2002 MT 47, 309 Mont. 1, 43 P.3d 318. <em>See Hilgers, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14; <em>Muhammad, </em>\u00b6 47; <em>accord State v. Dunkerson, </em>2003 MT 234, \u00b6 18, 317 Mont. 228, \u00b6 18, 76 P.3d 1085, \u00b6 18 (\u201cFailure of a PSI report to contain documentation of... an offender\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay renders a district court\u2019s sentencing of restitution illegal.\u201d); <em>but see </em>\u00a7 46-18-242(2), MCA (\u2018When a presentence report is not authorized or requested, the court may receive evidence of the offender\u2019s ability to pay ... at the time of sentencing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">\u00b6181  Likewise, in the case at hand, the PSI did not contain documentation of Ariegwe\u2019s financial resources and future ability to pay restitution. Nor was such evidence presented at the sentencing hearing pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-242(2), MCA. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court was \u201cnot authorized to impose [the] sentence of restitution,\u201d <em>Pritchett, </em>\u00b6 7, and that the restitution order is illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">\u00b6182 We affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Ariegwe\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. We also affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Ariegwe\u2019s motion for a new trial. However, we reverse the portion of Ariegwe\u2019s sentence requiring him to pay restitution under \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA (2001) and remand this case to the District Court for a restitution hearing followed by resentencing pursuant to a correct and complete application of \u00a7\u00a7 46-18-241 through -249, MCA (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>\u00b6183 Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b532-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, COTTER, LEAPHART, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b469-10\"> For a basic description of Internet chat rooms, see <em>United States v.

But the fact is that delay in bringing such a person to trial on a pending charge may ultimately result in as much oppression as is suffered by one who is jailed without bail upon an untried charge. First, the possibility that the defendant already in prison might receive a sentence at least partially concurrent with the one he is serving may be forever lost if trial of the pending charge is postponed. Secondly, under procedures now widely practiced, the duration of his present imprisonment may be increased, and the conditions under which he must serve his sentence greatly worsened, by the pendency of another criminal charge outstanding against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\"><em>Hooey, </em>393 U.S. at 378, 89 S.
