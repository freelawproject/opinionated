(collectively referred to as \u201cCenex\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b66-10\">\u00b62 The Landowners provide the following \u201cSTATEMENT OF ISSUES PRESENTED FOR REVIEW\u201d at the outset of their opening brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">1. Whether the district court erred in granting AppelleeDefendants\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">2. Whether the district court erred in denying Appellants-Plaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">3. Whether the district court erred in ignoring and refusing to apply \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, in interpreting the granting language in the easements at issue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">4. Whether the district court erred in ignoring the principle that an instrument should be construed against the drafter and refusing to apply precedent established in a strikingly similar case in Mississippi?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-15\">The argument section of the Landowners\u2019 brief, however, does not conform to this statement of the issues. Rather, the Landowners\u2019 two issue headings are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">\n<em>A. The District Court Failed to Consider the Circumstances </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\n<em>Surrounding the Procurement of the Easements in Violation of\u00a7 1-4-102, MCA. The District Court Also Failed to Interpret the Easement Granting Language in the Light Most Favorable to the Landowners.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">\n<em>B. In the Alternative, the Easement Granting Language is Ambiguous, Thereby Requiring Consideration of the Surrounding Circumstances. The Landowners\u2019 XJnrefuted Summary Judgment Evidence Supports the Entry of Summary Judgment in Their Favor or, in the Further Alternative, Consideration by a Jury.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The Landowners\u2019 \u201calternative\u201d arguments under Issue \u201cB\u201d do not appear in their opening statement of the issues presented for review. Furthermore, within the discussion under Issue \u201cA\u201d the Landowners present an argument that does not match any of their issue statements-namely, that the District Court erred in construing a term in the easement granting language contrary to the dictionary definition of that term.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b63 Given this disconnect between the issues as articulated at the outset of the Landowners\u2019 opening brief and the issues as articulated and argued in the argument section of the brief, this Court is in the position of having to divine precisely what issues the Landowners are presenting to this Court. The Rules of Appellate Procedure, however, place the responsibility of matching arguments with issue statements on the Landowners, not this Court. <em>See </em>M. R. App. P. 23(a)(2) (requiring an appellant\u2019s brief to contain \u201c[a] statement of the issues presented for review\u201d); M. R. App. P. 23(a)(4) (requiring the argument section of the brief to contain the contentions of the appellant \u201cwith respect to the issues presented\u201d). Accordingly, we will address the merits of the Landowners\u2019 actual arguments without regard to their uncoordinated issue statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">\u00b64 In their first argument, the Landowners agree with the District Court that the language of the right-of-way agreements by which the Landowners granted easements across their properties to Cenex is unambiguous, but they disagree with the court\u2019s conclusion that Cenex has not exceeded the scope of those easements as defined in the right-of-way agreements. The Landowners contend (1) that the District Court erroneously construed the term \u201ctogether with\u201d as that term is used in the granting language; (2) that the District Court erred by failing to interpret the granting language in the light most favorable to the Landowners; and (3) that the District Court erred by refusing to consider the circumstances under which the easements were granted. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>As an alternative argument, the Landowners contend that the granting language is ambiguous, thus (1) requiring consideration of the circumstances under which the easements were granted or (2) creating a genuine issue of material fact and thereby precluding summary judgment for either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b65 Accordingly, having studied the Landowners\u2019 arguments, we perceive the following five issues on this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-5\">1. Did the District Court erroneously construe the term \u201ctogether with\u201d as that term is used in the unambiguous granting language?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">2. Did the District Court err by failing to interpret the unambiguous granting language in the light most favorable to the Landowners?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\">3. Did the District Court err by refusing to consider the circumstances under which the easements were granted?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-8\">4. Did the District Court err in determining that the granting language is unambiguous?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">5. Did the District Court err in determining that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">\u00b66 The Front Range Pipeline is a system of crude oil pipelines that extends approximately 320 miles from the United States/Canadian border to Laurel, Montana, by way of Santa Rita, Montana. The stretch from Santa Rita to Laurel consists of one 16-inch pipeline and a 36-strand fiber optic cable. For most of this distance, the fiber optic cable is buried in the same trench as the pipeline. The dispute in this case concerns Cenex\u2019s use of the fiber optic cable.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-12\">\u00b67 Cenex began acquiring easements for the pipeline and cable in 1994. This process continued into 1996 and involved approximately 450 parcels of land on the route between Santa Rita and Laurel. Cenex entered into a right-of-way agreement with Eklund on November 12, 1994, and with Baker Trust on February 13, 1995. Both agreements, which had been prepared by Cenex, contained the following granting language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-13\">[Grantors] do hereby grant, sell and convey unto [Cenex] ... its successors and assigns, hereinafter referred to as Grantee, the right to construct, maintain, inspect, operate, protect, repair, replace, change the size of or remove a pipeline or pipelines or other appurtenances, for the transportation of oil, liquids and/or gases and the products thereof, together with a buried fiber optic communications cable, in, on, under or upon and along a strip of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>land Fifty Feet (50 ft.) in width to be selected by Grantee on, in, over and through the following described lands ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The agreements further provided that \u201c[t]he rights herein granted may be assigned in whole or in part\u201d and that \u201c[t]he terms, conditions and provisions of this agreement shall extend to and be binding upon the heirs, executors, administrators, personal representatives, successors and assigns of the parties hereto.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b68 During this same period, Cenex and TRI Touch America, Inc. (\u201cTRI\u201d) negotiated a Fiber Optic Agreement. Pursuant to this agreement (dated June 26,1995), TRI agreed to install the fiber optic cable in the trench opened by Cenex for the pipeline and to maintain the cable, but the agreement specified that Cenex would own the cable. For its part, Cenex granted TRI an exclusive, indefeasible right to use 32 strands of the cable for an initial term of 25 years. The four remaining strands were specifically dedicated to the exclusive use of Cenex for the transmission of data, voice, and video communication along the pipeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b69 Ultimately, the pipeline project was completed in late 1995, and the fiber optic cable became operational in mid 1996. Cenex assigned its rights, title, and interest in the pipeline and fiber optic cable to Front Range Pipeline, L.L.C., in September 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">\u00b610 The Landowners initiated the instant action on March 21, 2003. In essence, they alleged as follows: that the right-of-way agreements permitted Cenex to use the fiber optic cable only for purposes of operating and monitoring the pipeline; that Cenex had exceeded the scope of the easements by using and allowing a third <em>party to </em>use the cable for purposes other than operating and monitoring the pipeline; that Cenex had done so without the Landowners\u2019 authorization and without compensating the Landowners; that Cenex, thus, had surreptitiously created a valuable revenue-producing corporate asset; that Cenex had retained the revenues and profits generated by this asset; and that these wrongful acts and omissions amounted to an unlawful scheme to convert money derived from the trespass upon the Landowners\u2019 properties. The Landowners claimed breach of contract, trespass, conversion, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, civil conspiracy, and unjust enrichment, and they requested certification under M. R. Civ. P. 23 as a class consisting of \u201c[a]ll persons and entities who own land over which fiber optic cable has been strung or laid in the Cenex Front Range Pipeline right-of-way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b611 Cenex filed an answer denying the allegations concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>scope of the easements and the allegations of wrongdoing. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b612 The Landowners, in their summary judgment motion, asserted that the granting language in the right-of-way agreements \u201cis crystal clear in its scope.\u201d Focusing on the words \u201ctogether with,\u201d they argued that this term means \u201cin union with\u201d and that \u201c[authority to bury a fiber optic cable \u2018in union with\u2019 the pipeline clearly suggests its use is limited to operating and monitoring the Pipeline.\u201d They also set forth a number of \u201ccircumstances under which the Easements were obtained\u201d as support for their interpretation of \u201ctogether with,\u201d citing \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, as authority for the District Court to consider these circumstances. One such \u201ccircumstance\u201d was that Cenex allegedly had obtained the easements by threatening to condemn the Landowners\u2019 properties pursuant to \u00a7 69-13-103(1), MCA. Finally, the Landowners argued that use of the fiber optic cable by parties other than Cenex \u201cclearly creates added physical and legal burdens\u201d on the Landowners\u2019 properties. They provided a number of examples of such burdens-e.g., \u201c[i]f there is a break in the line . . . multiple companies\u2019 repair crews must physically enter the land to replace and/or repair the cable,\u201d and \u201cby going beyond the scope and intent of the Easement granting language, Cenex has saddled the land with a significant, additional legal burden - a potential cloud on their titles.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">\u00b613 In its summary judgment motion, Cenex agreed that the granting language is \u201cclear and unambiguous\u201d; however, contrary to the Landowners\u2019 interpretation, Cenex argued that the language \u201cplacets] no limits on how the fiber optic cable may be used\u201d and \u201cexpressly give[s] Cenex the right to assign any of its rights, in whole or in part, to any third party.\u201d According to Cenex, therefore, it did not breach the right-of-way agreements by using or allowing the use of the cable for purposes other than operating or monitoring the pipeline, and all of the Landowners\u2019 claims, which were predicated on the same alleged violation of the terms of the right-of-way agreements, should be dismissed accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b614 The District Court agreed with Cenex. First, the court noted that the Landowners were not challenging the validity of the right-of-way agreements. Second, the court determined that the granting language in the agreements is unambiguous. Third, the court read the granting language as placing no limitations upon the use of the fiber optic cable. In so doing, the court rejected the Landowners\u2019 \u201cgrammatical gymnastics,\u201d concluding that that the term \u201ctogether with\u201d means \u201cand\u201d in the context of the granting language.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>\u00b615 With respect to the Landowners\u2019 reliance on \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, the court stated that since the granting language was not ambiguous, the court could not consider the circumstances under which the right-of-way agreements had been made. The court also refused to construe the right-of-way agreements by reference to \u00a7 69-13-103(1), MCA, reasoning that this statute had no application here because the easements had been obtained by voluntary agreements, not condemnation. Lastly, the court concluded that the language of the right-of-way agreements gave Cenex authority to assign its rights thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">\u00b616 Based on this analysis, the District Court dismissed all of the Landowners\u2019 claims, noting that each claim was predicated on Cenex\u2019s using the fiber optic cable for purposes other than operating and monitoring the pipeline and Cenex\u2019s assigning a portion of the easements to TRI, both of which the court had determined were not wrongful acts. The court also denied the Landowners\u2019 motion for class certification as moot. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. <em>Redies v. Attorneys Liability Protection Soc., </em>2007 MT 9, \u00b6 26, 335 Mont. 233, \u00b6 26, 150 P.3d 930, \u00b6 26; <em>Montana-Dakota Utilities Co. v. City of Billings, </em>2003 MT 332, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 407, \u00b6 6, 80 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 6. Rule 56(c) provides that a motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Porter v. Galarneau, </em>275 Mont. 174, 179, 911 P.2d 1143, 1146 (1996). Summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact. <em>In re Dorothy W. Stevens Revocable Trust, </em>2005 MT 106, \u00b6 13, 327 Mont. 39, \u00b6 13, 112 P.3d 972, \u00b6 13; <em>Montana Metal Buildings, Inc. v. Shapiro, </em>283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b618 The breadth and scope of an easement are determined by the actual terms of the grant. <em>Mularoni v. Bing, </em>2001 MT 215, \u00b6 32, 306 Mont. 405, \u00b6 32, 34 P.3d 497, \u00b6 32 (citing \u00a7 70-17-106, MCA, and <em>Van Hook v. Jennings, </em>1999 MT 198, \u00b6 12, 295 Mont. 409, \u00b6 12, 983 P.2d 995, \u00b6 12). The construction of a writing granting an interest in real property, in turn, is governed by the rules of contract interpretation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 70-1-513, MCA (\u201cGrants are to be interpreted in like manner with contracts in general, except so far as is otherwise provided in this part.\u201d); <em>Mularoni, </em>\u00b6 32 (\u201cIn interpreting the meaning of an easement grant, contract principles apply.\u201d). Thus, we begin by setting forth a number of the rules of contract interpretation that are pertinent to the issues discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">\u00b619 The construction and interpretation of a contract is a question of law. <em>Ophus v. Fritz, </em>2000 MT 251, \u00b6 19, 301 Mont. 447, \u00b6 19, 11 P.3d 1192, \u00b6 19; <em>Van Hook, </em>\u00b6 10. Likewise, whether an ambiguity exists in a contract is a question of law. <em>Mularoni, </em>\u00b6 32; <em>SVKV, L.L.C. v. Harding, </em>2006 MT 297, \u00b6 43, 334 Mont. 395, \u00b6 43, 148 P.3d 584, \u00b6 43. If the language of a contract is unambiguous-i.e., reasonably susceptible to only one construction-the duty of the court is to apply the language as written. <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Carelli v. Hall, </em>279 Mont. 202, 209, 926 P.2d 756, 761 (1996). However, if the language of a contract is ambiguous, a factual determination must be made as to the parties\u2019 intent in entering into the contract. <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 30, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 30, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 30; <em>Klawitter v. Dettmann, </em>268 Mont. 275, 281, 886 P.2d 416, 420 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b620  The determination of whether an ambiguity exists in a contract is to be made on an objective basis. <em>See </em>Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 11 \u00a7 30:4, at 51 (4th ed., West 1999). Thus, \u201ca conclusion of ambiguity is not compelled by the fact that the parties to a document, or their attorneys, have or suggest opposing interpretations of a contract, or even disagree as to whether the contract is reasonably open to just one interpretation.\u201d <em>Williston on Contracts </em>\u00a7 30:4, at 51-54 (footnotes omitted); <em>accord </em>E. Allan Farnsworth, <em>Farnsworth on Contracts </em>vol. II, \u00a7 7.12a, at 305-06 (2d ed., Aspen 1998); <em>Holmstrom v. Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>139 Mont. 426, 428, 364 P.2d 1065, 1066 (1961) (\u201cAmbiguity does not exist just because a claimant says so.\u201d); <em>Heggem v. Capitol Indem. Corp., </em>2007 MT 74, \u00b6 30, 336 Mont. 429, \u00b6 30, 154 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 30 (\u201c[A] mere disagreement over the meaning of an insurance provision does not render the provision ambiguous.\u201d). Rather, an ambiguity exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>only if the language is susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Van Hook, </em>\u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b621 \u201cA contract must be so interpreted as to give effect to the mutual intention of the parties as it existed at the time of contracting, so far as the same is ascertainable and lawful.\u201d Section 28-3-301, MCA; <em>accord </em>\u00a7 1-4-103, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of an instrument, the intention of the parties is to be pursued if possible.\u201d). The mutual intention of the parties, in turn, is to be ascertained from the writing if possible. Section 28-3-303, MCA (\u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone if possible, subject, however, to the other provisions of this chapter.\u201d). In addition, evidence of the circumstances under which the contract was made and the matter to which it relates may be considered. Section 28-3-402, MCA (\u201cA contract may be explained by reference to the circumstances under which it was made and the matter to which it relates.\u201d); \u00a7 28-2-905(2), MCA (\u201c[The parol evidence rule] does not exclude other evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made or to which it relates.\u201d). However, such evidence of circumstances and subject matter is not admissible to add to, vary, or contradict the terms of the contract. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-2-904, MCA (\u201cThe execution of a contract in writing, whether the law requires it to be written or not, supersedes all the oral negotiations or stipulations concerning its matter which preceded or accompanied the execution of the instrument.\u201d); \u00a7 28-2-905(1), MCA (\u201cWhenever the terms of an agreement have been reduced to writing by the parties, it is to be considered as containing all those terms. Therefore, there can be between the parties and their representatives or successors in interest no evidence of the terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing except ... (a) when a mistake or imperfection of the writing is put in issue by the pleadings[, or] (b) when the validity of the agreement is the fact in dispute.\u201d (paragraph breaks omitted)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AXb\">\u00b622 With these principles in mind, we now turn to the Landowners\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b623 <em>Issue 1. Did the District Court erroneously construe the term \u201ctogether with\u201d as that term is used in the unambiguous granting language?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b624 The Landowners do not contest Cenex\u2019s authority under the right-of-way agreements to construct and operate the fiber optic cable. But they claim that the \u201cplain and- unambiguous\u201d granting language \u201cconfirms that the fiber optic cable is <em>incidental </em>or <em>subservient </em>to the clearly dominant grant of a petroleum pipeline easement\u201d and \u201climits its use to operating and monitoring the Pipeline.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b625 As support for this position, the Landowners renew their contention that the term \u201ctogether with\u201d in the granting language unambiguously limits Cenex\u2019s use of the fiber optic cable to operating and monitoring the pipeline. Again, the granting language provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">[Grantors] do hereby grant, sell and convey unto [Cenex]... the right to construct, maintain, inspect, operate, protect, repair, replace, change the size of or remove a pipeline or pipelines or other appurtenances, for the transportation of oil, liquids and/or gases and the products thereof, <em>together with </em>a buried fiber optic communications cable, in, on, under or upon and along a strip of land Fifty Feet (50 ft.) in width to be selected by Grantee on, in, over and through the following described lands .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The Landowners argue that because the language pertaining to the fiber optic cable is prefaced with the words \u201ctogether with,\u201d and because this term is defined as \u201cin union with\u201d or \u201calong with\u201d (citing <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1487 (6th ed. 1990), and <em>Gilmore v. Mulvihill, </em>109 Mont. 601, 613, 98 P.2d 335, 341 (1940)), the granting language \u201cclearly limits\u201d the use of the fiber optic cable to operating and monitoring the pipeline. In the Landowners\u2019 view, the import of the term \u201ctogether with\u201d is \u201cin connection with\u201d; in other words, the fiber optic cable is to be used \u201cin connection with\u201d the pipeline.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b626 The District Court however, reasoned that \u201c[the words \u2018together with\u2019] mean nothing more than \u2018and\u2019 in the context of the granting language.\u201d The court stated that <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>79 (5th ed. 1979) defines \u201cand\u201d as meaning \u201ctogether with\u201d and \u201calong with,\u201d and that <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>2404 (1971) defines the term \u201ctogether with\u201d as \u201calong with,\u201d \u201cin addition to,\u201d and \u201cas well.\u201d (The court consulted <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>because this Court had relied on <em>Webster\u2019s New International </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number><em>Dictionary </em>in <em>Gilmore </em>when defining the word \u201ctogether.\u201d) Thus, under the District Court\u2019s interpretation of \u201ctogether with,\u201d the Landowners granted Cenex the right to bury a pipeline and a fiber optic cable, not a pipeline and a fiber optic cable \u201cto be used in connection therewith.\u201d \u00b627 We agree with the District Court and reject the Landowners\u2019 strained interpretation of \u201ctogether with.\u201d Whether \u201ctogether with\u201d is defined as \u201cin union with,\u201d \u201calong with,\u201d \u201cin addition to,\u201d \u201cas well,\u201d or \u201cand,\u201d the term-on its face-simply does not carry the meaning the Landowners ascribe to it. As support for their \u201cin connection therewith\u201d interpretation, the Landowners rely on the Mississippi Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>McDonald v. Mississippi Power </em>Co., 732 So.2d 893 (Miss. 1999). <em>McDonald, </em>however, does not support the Landowners\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b628 The Mississippi Power Company (\u201cMPC\u201d) obtained easements through a number of properties by way of condemnation, eminent domain proceedings, and voluntary easements. The easements gave MPC the right to</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">\u201cconstruct, operate and maintain electric lines and all telegraph and telephone lines, towers, poles, wires, and appliances and equipment necessary or convenient <em>in connection therewith </em>from time to time and counterpoise wire and other counterpoise conductors, upon, over, under, and across a strip of land . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ARB\"><em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 2 (ellipsis in original, emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b629 In <em>McDonald, </em>MPC sought a declaratory judgment that it had the right under the easements to install, utilize, and sublet space on fiber optic cables. The chancery court determined that laying fiber optic cables was \u201cwell within the express or implied language of the easements\u201d and that MPC had the right to \u201cleas[e] or sell[] excess capacity on said lines, without further compensation to the landowners.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 4 (internal quotation marks omitted). The Mississippi Supreme Court agreed with the first conclusion but disagreed with the latter. The court observed that the clear intent of the easements was \u201cto grant MPC the right to install and maintain telephone lines\u201d and a fiber optic cable \u201cis nothing more than a technologically advanced or new type of telephone line.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 9. However, with respect to MPC\u2019s desire to sublet space on the fiber optic cables to third parties for uses other than providing electricity, the court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">MPC\u2019s current easements contain limiting language which precludes them from utilizing the fiber optics cable for anything but services provided in connection with supplying electricity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>According to the phrase in question, MPC\u2019s use of \u201ctelegraph and telephone lines, towers, poles, wires, and appliances and equipment\u201d is limited to \u201cin connection therewith\u201d MPC\u2019s service of providing electricity to its customers. Although it would not constitute an additional servitude on the property, MPC without more definite easements simply does not have the authority. Since MPC drafted a number of the easements in question, they are interpreted most favorably to the landowner. We find that the chancellor erred in holding that the language of the above easements permitted MPC to sublease space on its fiber optics cables for purposes other than those which are in connection with providing electricity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10 (citation omitted). The court reached the same conclusion with respect to the easements that had been obtained through condemnation or eminent domain proceedings. <em>See McDonald, </em>\u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b630  In the case at hand, by contrast, there is no such limiting language. The Landowners insist that \u201cthere is little difference between the words \u2018together with\u2019 in the instant case and \u2018in connection therewith\u2019 in <em>McDonald\u201d </em>and that use of the word \u201ctogether\u201d in the instant case and \u201cconnection\u201d in <em>McDonald </em>\u201cis a distinction without a difference.\u201d We disagree. It seems that the Landowners would have us rewrite the granting language to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEj\">[Grantors] do hereby grant, sell and convey unto [Cenex] .. . the right to construct, maintain, inspect, operate, protect, repair, replace, change the size of or remove a pipeline or pipelines or other appurtenances, for the transportation of oil, liquids and/or gases and the products thereof, together with and a buried fiber optic communications cable to be used in connection therewith ....

They contend that \u201cwith a very few minor exceptions, Cenex drafted all of the [right-of-way agreements]\u201d; thus, \u201c[i]f Cenex truly intended the Easement granting language to be unlimited in its use, Cenex should have said so.\u201d As support for this argument, the Landowners rely on <em>McDonald, </em>in which the Mississippi Supreme Court stated: \u201cSince MPC drafted a number of the easements in question, they are interpreted most favorably to the landowner.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>\u00b6 10. The Landowners also cite <em>United States v. Seckinger, </em>397 U.S. 203, 210, 90 S.

Baker, </em>196 Mont. 494, 501, 641 P.2d 1035, 1039 (1982) (noting that in \u201c \u2018take-it-or-leave-it\u2019 situations, where adhesion contracts are involved, . . . the terms are to be construed against the drafter and any ambiguities are to be resolved in favor of the party having no voice in arriving at the document\u2019s terms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">\u00b633 Cenex contends that \u201c[i]t is only when the terms of an agreement or contract are uncertain or ambiguous that they are construed against the party causing the uncertainty\u201d; thus, \u201c[s]ince the district court found the [granting language] unambiguous, there is no reason to construe [it] against Cenex.\u201d As support for this argument, Cenex cites <em>C &amp; L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi Tribe of Oklahoma, </em>532 U.S. 411, 423, 121 S. Ct. 1589, 1596-97 (2001) (stating that \u201cthe common-law rule of contract interpretation that a court should construe ambiguous language against the interest of the party that drafted it\u201d was inapposite because the contract in question was not ambiguous (internal quotation marks omitted)), and <em>Matter of Estate of Thies, </em>273 Mont. 272, 276, 903 P.2d 186, 188 (1995) (stating that our decision in <em>Matter of Estate of Flasted, </em>228 Mont. 85, 741 P.2d 750 (1987), in which we construed a contractual ambiguity against the drafter, did not apply in <em>Thies </em>because the agreement in question was \u201c \u2018straightforward and simple\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">\u00b634 We agree with Cenex. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts explains the rationale for the construction-against-drafter principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-7\">Where one party chooses the terms of a contract, he is likely to provide more carefully for the protection of his own interests than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>for those of the other party. He is also more likely than the other party to have reason to know of uncertainties of meaning. Indeed, he may leave meaning deliberately obscure, intending to decide at a later date what meaning to assert.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 206 cmt. a (1981). Thus, the Restatement provides that \u201c[i]n choosing among the reasonable meanings of a promise or agreement or a term thereof, that meaning is generally preferred which operates against the party who supplies the words or from whom a writing otherwise proceeds.\u201d <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 206.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b635 Yet, it is not necessary to \u201cchoos[e] among ... reasonable meanings\u201d when the promise, agreement, or term thereof is reasonably susceptible to only one meaning. In other words, the general maxim that a court should construe contract language against the party that drafted it presupposes that the language is reasonably susceptible to more than one construction. <em>See C &amp; L Enterprises, </em>532 U.S. at 423, 121 S.

Therefore, the Landowners contend, \u201c[u]nder \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, a court may look to the surrounding circumstances in order to construe an instrument <em>even when that instrument is unambiguous on its face.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b639 Cenex counters that \u00a7 1-4-102 applies only where an ambiguity exists in the language of the instrument.

At trial, Donnell sought to prove that the \u201cPark ditch\u201d was included in this conveyance. To that end, Donnell offered the following testimony: that the Silver Bow Ditch Company\u2019s ditches were made up of and included what was then known as the \u201cupper ditch,\u201d the \u201clower ditch,\u201d and the \u201cPark ditch\u201d; that the upper and lower ditches carried water from Silver Bow creek and its tributaries to the placer mines, in the vicinity of Butte City; that the Park ditch was built to supply water from a branch of Bolder creek to Silver Bow creek and, in turn, to the upper and lower ditches; that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>Park ditch, thus, was a feeder of the upper and lower ditches; that at the time of the conveyance, the waters from the Park ditch had always flowed through the upper and lower ditches; and that the three ditches were known and reputed as the Silver Bow Ditch Company\u2019s ditches and, more particularly, as the Humphreys and Allison ditches. <em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 523. The trial court sustained an objection to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">\u00b643 On appeal, the Supreme Court of the Montana Territory considered whether the trial court had erred in rejecting the proffered testimony. In so doing, the Court first observed that \u201cparol contemporaneous evidence is inadmissible to contradict or vary the terms of a valid written instrument\u201d because \u201cwhen parties have deliberately put their contracts in writing in such terms as import a legal obligation, without uncertainty or ambiguity as to the object, nature and extent of their agreements, it is conclusively presumed that the whole of the contract was reduced to writing.\u201d <em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 525-26. The Court explained, however, that parol evidence is always admissible to give effect to the contract:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">And so the intent of the parties must be gathered from what is written rather than from parol evidence, but the language of the instrument may be construed by the light of surrounding circumstances, and, so far as possible, the court may put itself in the place of the parties, and may interpret the language from this standpoint, but nothing can be added to or taken from the written words.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">So extrinsic parol evidence is always admissible to give effect to a written instrument, by applying it to its proper subject-matter, by proving the circumstances under which it was made, thereby enabling the court to put themselves in the place of the parties with all the information possessed by them, the better to understand the terms employed in the contract, and to arrive at the intention of the parties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Instruments are to be interpreted according to their subject-matter, and parol evidence may be resorted to in order to ascertain the nature and qualities of the subject to which the instrument refers. Whatever indicates the nature of the subject, is a just medium of interpretation of the language of the parties, and is also a just foundation for giving the instrument an interpretation when considered relatively, different from that which it would receive if considered in the abstract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">It is necessary to the validity of a grant that the thing granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>should be capable of being distinguished from all other things of the kind, but it is not necessary that the description should be such as to identify the object without the aid of extraneous testimony. And when the description alludes to facts beyond the deed, parol evidence may be offered, not to contradict the description, but to locate the deed upon the land.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 526 (citations and emphases omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b644 The Court reasoned that it was not possible for the trial court, looking at the language of the deed alone, to say how many ditches were known as \u201cthe Humphreys and Allison ditches\u201d and whether the Park ditch was an essential component of a system of ditches by which water was carried from Silver Bow creek to the mines of Butte City. <em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 527. In this regard, the Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">If the upper and lower ditches were valueless without the Park ditch, and all three were known as the Humphreys and Allison ditches, then we must suppose that the party paying more than $6,000 for the Humphreys and Allison ditches, and the party receiving that sum in consideration of the conveyance, intended to convey the three ditches in question, for the value of each would so depend upon the other as to make the three one property, one subject-matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 528. Accordingly, the Court held that parol evidence was admissible to apply the deed to its proper subject matter and that Donnell\u2019s proffered testimony should not have been rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b645 The Court provided an insightful clarification of the foregoing principles in <em>Taylor v. Holter, </em>1 Mont. 688 (Mont. Terr. 1872). At issue in that case was a deed by which Hoyt and Holter granted Taylor, Smith, and Cleveland \u201c[a]ll the water of the right-hand fork of Oro Fino gulch.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>1 Mont. at 691 (internal quotation marks omitted). At trial, testimony was offered to prove that the grantors had intended to convey, and that the grantees had intended to receive by virtue of this deed, the waters of the left-hand fork of Oro Fino gulch. The trial court sustained an objection to this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u00b646 On appeal, the Supreme Court restated the principles set forth in <em>Donnell </em>(quoted above in \u00b6 43) and then clarified the applicability of these principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-10\">The true rule is, to give effect to the intention of the parties if the words they employ will admit of it. But if the words used, by their clearness and certainty, absolutely forbid the aid of extrinsic evidence in their interpretation, it would be changing the certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>written contract of the parties to let in outside parol proof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b83-4\">Parties must contract for themselves, courts cannot make contracts for them, and the rules of interpretation are utterly unavailing to aid a contract or agreement that is specific and certain in its terms, and clearly speaks what the parties intended it should. If parties convey the right-hand fork of Oro Fino gulch, courts nor witnesses cannot say they thereby intended the left-hand fork. As well might they say they intended the left fork of the Missouri river, or the north fork of the Yellowstone, and all the circumstances and surroundings of the parties, however plausible they may appear, cannot blot out the language of the deed and supply other language in its place. Such circumstances and surroundings may aid the language but cannot destroy it. They can apply the deed to its proper subject, and when thus applied, the language must describe such subject, and be entirely consistent with it. The language must control and not the circumstances. The written words must stand and no parol proof can destroy them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-5\"><em>Taylor, </em>1 Mont. at 698-99 (emphases omitted). The Court held, therefore, that the proffered parol evidence had been properly rejected by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b647  Thus, as a general rule, evidence of the circumstances under which an instrument was made may not be considered where the language of the instrument is clear and certain in its terms. <em>Taylor, 1 </em>Mont. at 698-99; <em>see also Ming v. Pratt, </em>22 Mont. 262, 265, 56 P. 279, 280 (1899) (stating that resort to evidence of the surroundings of the parties, the subject matter, and prior and contemporaneous oral negotiations and promises illumining the design and intent of the parties is not permissible where the intention and understanding are explicitly declared upon the face of the writing itself); <em>Kimball v.

However, as recognized in the authorities discussed below, this rule does not preclude consideration of surrounding circumstances for the purpose of determining, as a preliminary matter, whether the instrument contains an ambiguity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>For instance, borrowing the illustration set forth in <em>Taylor, </em>1 Mont. at 694, if a grantor conveys \u201cmy house and lot in Helena,\u201d it would be proper for the court to consider the circumstance that the grantor owned two houses and lots in Helena, thus rendering \u201cmy house and lot in Helena\u201d susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings; and extrinsic evidence would also be admissible in this situation to show which of the two houses the grantor intended to convey. By contrast, if the grantor conveyed \u201cmy brick house on Main Street,\u201d the fact that the grantor also owned a wooden house on Rodney Street would not render \u201cmy brick house on Main Street\u201d ambiguous; and extrinsic evidence would not be admissible to show that the grantor intended to convey the wooden house.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b648 It is thus stated in the <em>Restatement (Second) of Contracts </em>\u00a7 212 cmt. b (1981): \u201cIt is sometimes said that extrinsic evidence cannot change the plain meaning of a writing, but meaning can almost never be plain except in a context.\u201d Accordingly, the Restatement takes the position that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b84-5\">[a]ny determination of meaning or ambiguity should only be made in the light of the relevant evidence of the situation and relations of the parties, the subject matter of the transaction, preliminary negotiations and statements made therein, usages of trade, and the course of dealing between the parties.

But the same thing cannot be said of every court and jury that may be called on to interpret their contract. To enable the court and jury to be as wise as the parties, and so to arrive at and give application to the words they have used, and thus carry out their intentions, the law permits them to hear a full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>description, from evidence, of the subject matter of the contract, and of all the circumstances that surrounded the parties at the time it was made; and to learn what were the motives and inducements that led to the contract, and the object to be attained by it; .... The object or tendency of this evidence is not to contradict or vary the terms of the instrument, but to enable the court to come to the language employed, with an enlightened understanding of the subject matter in reference to which it has been used.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><em>Hildebrand v.

Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Taubel, </em>175 A. 55 (N.J. 1934), where the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">The standard of interpretation of an integrated agreement, supported by the weight of modem authority, is the meaning that would be attached to the integration by a reasonably intelligent person acquainted with all operative usages and knowing all the circumstances prior to and contemporaneous with the making of the writing, other than oral statements by the parties of what they intended it to mean, except where it produces an ambiguous result, or is excluded by rule of law establishing a definite meaning. This has been termed a primary rule of interpretation which is always applicable, whether the writing seems clear or ambiguous. The underlying theory is that as all language will bear some different meanings, evidence of surroundings is always admissible in the interpretation of integrated agreements, but not for the purpose of giving effect to an intent at variance with any meaning that can be attached to the words.... So far as the evidence tends to show, not the meaning of the writing, but an intention wholly unexpressed in the writing, it is irrelevant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG\"><em>Corn Exchange, </em>175 A. at 58 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">\u00b651 Likewise, in <em>S.W.

The rule regards the circumstances of the parties, and executes their real intention, and prevents either of the parties to the instrument from committing a fraud on the other by claiming it to be what it in fact is not. In other words, the real transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>may be proved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">And as long ago as <em>Newell v. Nicholson, </em>17 Mont. 389, 43 P. 180 (1896), we recognized that words, while they may be perfectly clear to the contracting parties, may not be correctly understood by the court tasked with the construction of the contract. The dispute <em>in Newell </em>was over the meaning of the words \u201cDon\u2019t sell we to exchange any goods that don\u2019t sell; credit for same,\u201d and \u201cSales guarantied.\u201d Citing \u00a7\u00a7 632 and 633 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Comp. St. 1887) (now \u00a7\u00a7 1-4-102 and -107, MCA, respectively), we held that the trial court had not erred in considering the testimony of a number of merchants, salesmen, and businessmen showing that the words had a technical or peculiar signification and were so used and understood in the particular instance. <em>Newell, </em>17 Mont. at 392-93, 43 P. at 181.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b652 This same point was made in <em>AM Intern. v.

Wichelhaus, </em>2 H. &amp; C. 906, 159 Eng.Rep. 375 (Ex. 1864),... was clear on its face. It called for the shipment of a specified amount of cotton from one port to another on the ship <em>Peerless. </em>Clear as a bell. Only there were two (if not more) ships <em>Peerless, </em>and it was impossible to tell which one the contract referred to. The contract was unclear because clarity in a contract is a property of the correspondence between the contract and the things or activities that it regulates, and not just of the semantic surface.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-7\">Take another example. Suppose the parties to the contract in <em>Raffles </em>had been members of a trade in which the term \u201ccotton\u201d was used to refer to guncotton rather than to the cotton used in textiles. The ordinary reader of English would not know about this special trade usage, and so would suppose the contract unambiguous. Again, the ambiguity is in the reference, that is, the connection between the word and the object that it denotes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3E\"><em>See also </em>Margaret N. Kniffin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>vol. 5, \u00a7 24.7, at 30-39 (Joseph M.

We emphasize, however, that not all \u201ccircumstances\u201d are admissible for this purpose. As stated earlier, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>instrument does not contain an ambiguity simply because the parties have or suggest opposing interpretations thereof or disagree as to whether the language is reasonably open to just one interpretation. Rather, the determination of whether an ambiguity exists in a contract is made on an objective basis. <em>See </em>\u00b6 20, <em>supra. </em>Addressing this subject in some detail, the Seventh Circuit (interpreting Illinois law) explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">[A contract] may be extrinsically ambiguous, being clear on its face but someone who knows the context of the contract would know that the contract means something other than what it seems to mean. In that situation, we distinguish between \u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cobjective\u201d evidence of ambiguity. \u201cSubjective\u201d evidence of ambiguity is the testimony of the parties themselves as to what they believe the contract means, which is invariably self-serving, inherently difficult to verify and thus, inadmissible. ... \u201cObjective\u201d evidence, on the other hand, is evidence of ambiguity that can be supplied by disinterested third parties, such as custom or usage of the trade. This kind of evidence is admissible because the ability of one of the contracting parties to fabricate such evidence is limited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><em>Home Ins. Co. v.

Thus, for the purpose of aiding the court in determining, as a preliminary matter, whether the instrument contains an ambiguity, objective evidence of \u201cthe circumstances under which [the instrument] was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument and of the parties to it,\u201d may be shown and considered. Section 1-4-102, MCA. If the court determines that the instrument contains no ambiguity, then the extrinsic evidence may not be considered further. <em>See Doble v.

But if the court determines that an ambiguity is present in the instrument, then the extrinsic evidence may be introduced at trial to allow the trier of fact to determine the intent of the parties in entering into the contract. <em>See Olson v.

It spoke exclusively of the parties\u2019 agreement concerning the Mint Bar and made no mention of the Diablo Mobile Repair business. Nevertheless, the district court allowed parol evidence of an earlier agreement between the parties concerning the Diablo Mobile Repair business to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>alter and vary the terms of the written contract concerning the Mint Bar. We held this was error, noting that none of the exceptions to the parol evidence rule applied. With respect to \u00a7 1-4-102, we stated that \u201c[w]hen the contract is clear and unequivocal on its face, section 1-4-102, MCA, does not apply.\u201d <em>Spraggins, </em>192 Mont. at 12, 625 P.2d at 1153 (citing <em>Ryan v. </em>Ald, <em>Inc., </em>146 Mont. 299, 406 P.2d 373 (1965)). This statement is consistent with the principle that surrounding circumstances may not be considered once the court has determined that the instrument is unambiguous. Thus, <em>Spraggins </em>comports with our clarifications of \u00a7 1-4-102 above.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b658 The written contract at issue in <em>Payne </em>gave Payne the exclusive right to sell property owned by Buechler. It also provided that Buechler would pay Pasme the 10% commission if Buechler sold the property herself or withdrew Payne\u2019s authority under the contract prior to the stated expiration date. <em>Payne, </em>192 Mont. at 312-13, 628 P.2d at 647. Following a bench trial, the district court found that Buechler had not intended to grant Payne the exclusive right to sell the property. This finding was based on testimony by Buechler that she did not intend to give Pasme an exclusive listing and that she had previously given listings to other agencies which were still in effect at the time she entered into the contract with Pasme. On appeal, Buechler argued that the district court had properly admitted this testimony pursuant to \u00a7 1-4-102. We disagreed, observing that the language of the parties\u2019 contract was \u201cplain and unambiguous\u201d and that, under such circumstances, \u201cthe language alone controls and there is nothing for the Court to interpret or construe.\u201d <em>Payne, </em>192 Mont. at 317, 628 P.2d at 650.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b659 As in <em>Spraggins, </em>this statement is consistent with the principle that surrounding circumstances may not be considered <em>once </em>the court has determined that the instrument is unambiguous. However, our subsequent statement that \u00a7 1-4-102 \u201conly applies where an ambiguity exists in the language of the contract,\u201d <em>Payne, </em>192 Mont. at 317, 628 P.2d at 650, was overbroad. As explained above, \u00a7 1-4-102 also applies to aid the court in determining whether an ambiguity exists in the first place, and our statement in <em>Payne </em>that the statute \u201conly applies where an ambiguity exists in the language of the contract,\u201d which was correct on the facts of that case, should not be read as precluding this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>additional purpose of \u00a7 1-4-102.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b660 Next, parol evidence abounded in the briefs and in the record before this Court in <em>Yellowstone II </em>due to the inherent complications of the case. <em>See Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6 36. Yet, the documents at issue in the case were not ambiguous. <em>Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6 35. Thus, we clarified that we would disregard the parol evidence in the briefs and the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AS\">While we may properly consider evidence of the circumstances under which the agreement was made, <em>see, e.g., Weinberg v. Farmers State Bank of Worden </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 10, 24, 752 P.2d 719, 728; \u00a7 28-2-905, MCA, we will not consider evidence presented <em>for the singular purpose </em>of establishing that a contract includes supplemental promises or mutual understandings or conditions of performance that were never incorporated into a written agreement that by its own terms purports to represent the entire agreement between the parties. [Citations to \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-904 and 70-20-202, MCA.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-5\">Suffice to say, this Court must therefore disregard all attempts by Yellowstone II to establish that, in addition to the express, unambiguous terms of the written agreement, the \u201ccontract\u201d should include additional parol promises or representations or mutual understandings allegedly made by the parties prior to and at the time of formation ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-6\"><em>Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 36-37 (emphasis added). These statements are merely applications of the parol evidence rule, \u00a7\u00a7 28-2-904 and -905(1), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">\u00b661 Cenex points out that we also stated: \u201cDetermining whether a term in a contract is ambiguous ... is not a question involving parol evidence, but merely one of law concerning interpretation and potential use of extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6 35 (citing <em>In re Marriage of Holloway, </em>2000 MT 104, \u00b6 5, 299 Mont. 291, \u00b6 5, 999 P.2d 980, \u00b6 5, and \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA). Our use of the term \u201cparol evidence\u201d in this sentence, however, must be understood in the context of the discussion in \u00b6\u00b6 35-37 of <em>Yellowstone II. </em>The documents at issue were unambiguous; and the point of the discussion in \u00b6\u00b6 35-37, therefore, was to clarify that we would not consider evidence presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>Yellowstone II of additional parol promises or representations or mutual understandings allegedly made by the parties prior to and at the time the documents were executed. Thus, our statement that \u201c[determining whether a term in a contract is ambiguous ... is not a question involving parol evidence,\u201d <em>Yellowstone II, </em>\u00b6 35, stands for the unremarkable proposition that subjective evidence of prior or contemporaneous oral promises may not be considered for the purpose of determining whether the contract contains an ambiguity. Nevertheless, to the extent that this statement might be understood to conflict with our clarifications above concerning the applicability of \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b662 Lastly, <em>Tester </em>concerned a boundary dispute in Bridger Canyon, just north of Bozeman, Montana (hereinafter, \u201cSection 17\u201d). Two roads of public record ran through Section 17 in a north-south direction: the 1891 County Road and the 1948 State Highway. <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6 3. Throughout the plaintiffs\u2019 chain of title, there were many inconsistencies, including the unclear use of the terms \u201cpublic road\u201d and \u201ccountry road\u201d in reference to the boundary between plaintiffs\u2019 and defendants\u2019 respective properties in Section 17. <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6 16. The key point of confusion, however, regarded language in a 1951 deed by which James Funk conveyed all that part of Section 17 \u201c \u2018lying East of the old County Road as existing over and across said Section prior to the year 1950.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 16, 17. The plaintiffs claimed that the terms \u201cpublic road\u201d and \u201ccountry road\u201d in the deeds in their chain of title were references to the \u201ctraveled way,\u201d which became the State Highway, and that Funk, therefore, had intended the State Highway, and not the Country Road, to be the boundary. The defendants, however, contended that if Funk had intended to transfer all land east of the State Highway, he would have used the words \u201c \u2018all land lying East of the State Highway.\u2019 \u201d <em>Tester, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13, 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">\u00b663 Applying \u00a7 1-4-102, we concluded that the defendants were correct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\">The plain language of the Funk deed is unambiguous. An unambiguous deed must be interpreted according to its language as written, without resort to extrinsic evidence of the grantor\u2019s intent. For proper construction of an instrument \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, allows us to examine the \u201ccircumstances under which it was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument and of the parties to it.\u201d The record indicates that the County Road was the only official road in the Section from 1891 to 1948 and was recorded as being in its original location until the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>Highway was constructed in 1948.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-4\">If Funk intended to convey east of the State Highway which was constructed only three years earlier, he certainly could have done so. Instead, he explicitly conveyed east of the old County Road. To conclude that Funk\u2019s language is ambiguous and that he really meant to convey east of the State Highway would be to read an intent into his language which is simply not justified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b92-5\">We conclude that based on the unambiguous language of the deed, and the circumstances under which it was made, including the plats of Section 17, and the State Highway records, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the State Highway is the legal boundary between the properties was incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b92-6\"><em>Tester, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-28 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">\u00b664 This application of \u00a7 1-4-102 illustrates the use of extrinsic evidence for the purpose of determining, as a preliminary matter, whether the language in question is ambiguous. The crucial question was whether \u201cthe old County Road as existing over and across said Section prior to the year 1950\u201d was susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. We considered the objective surrounding circumstances-namely, the plats of Section 17, the State Highway records, and the fact that at the time Funk executed the deed (in 1951), the County Road had existed since 1891 and the State Highway had existed since 1948-and we decided that the language was unambiguous.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">\u00b665 Our analysis in <em>Tester </em>also illustrates the important distinction between <em>Donnell </em>and <em>Taylor, supra. </em>\u201cInstruments are to be interpreted according to their subject-matter, and parol evidence may be resorted to in order to ascertain the nature and qualities of the subject to which the instrument refers.\u201d <em>Donnell, </em>1 Mont. at 526. Thus, it was appropriate in <em>Tester </em>to consider parol evidence in order to ascertain the subject to which \u201cthe old County Road as existing over and across said Section prior to the year 1950\u201d referred. But while circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>and surroundings may aid the language, they may not destroy it. \u201cThey can apply the deed to its proper subject, and when thus applied, the language must describe such subject, and be entirely consistent with it.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>1 Mont. at 699. The plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of Funk\u2019s intent to convey \u201cthe State Highway\u201d was entirely inconsistent with the language \u201cold County Road\u201d in the deed. Thus, such evidence should not have been considered by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">\u00b666 We conclude, therefore, that <em>Tester </em>also comports with our clarifications of \u00a7 1-4-102 herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">C. Application of \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, to the Right-of-Way Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u00b667 Turning now to the right-of-way agreements, the District Court reasoned that \u00a7 1-4-102 did not apply in this case \u201c[b]ecause the Easements are unambiguous.\u201d To the extent the District Court understood \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, as precluding it from considering objective evidence of the circumstances under which the right-of-way agreements were made for the purpose of determining, as a preliminary matter, whether the agreements contained an ambiguity, the court erred for the reasons set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">\u00b668  Nevertheless, the Landowners\u2019 leading argument (in both the District Court and this Court) is that the granting language is unambiguous, and Cenex agrees with the Landowners on this point. Accordingly, in this situation, where the parties concede that the language in question is unambiguous, \u00a7 1-4-102 does not apply. <em>See </em>\u00b6 47, <em>supra. </em>On this basis, therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in refusing to consider the circumstances under which the right-of-way agreements were made.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">\u00b669 <em>Issue 4. Did the District Court err in determining that the granting language is unambiguous?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">\u00b670 As a backup position, the Landowners argue (as they did in the District Court) that the granting language is ambiguous. The Landowners first point out that they and Cenex have offered \u201ctwo distinct readings of the Easement granting language,\u201d which in their view \u201cestablishes the ambiguity of the granting language.\u201d We reject this argument outright. As stated above, \u201ca conclusion of ambiguity is not compelled by the fact that the parties to a document, or their attorneys, have or suggest opposing interpretations of a contract, or even disagree as to whether the contract is reasonably open to just one interpretation.\u201d Richard A. Lord, <em>Williston on Contracts </em>vol. 11, \u00a7 30:4, at 51-54 (4th ed., West 1999) (footnotes omitted); <em>accord Holmstrom v. Mutual Benefit Health &amp; Accident Ass\u2019n, </em>139 Mont. 426, 428, 364 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>1065, 1066 (1961) (\u201cAmbiguity does not exist just because a claimant says so.\u201d); <em>Heggem v. Capitol Indem. </em>Corp., 2007 MT 74, \u00b6 30, 336 Mont. 429, \u00b6 30, 154 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 30 (\u201c[A] mere disagreement over the meaning of an insurance provision does not render the provision ambiguous.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">\u00b671 The Landowners next argue that \u201c '[t]ogether with\u2019 and \u2018in connection with\u2019 easily can be considered synonymous by reasonable people. Thus, reasonable people could interpret the Easement granting language differently.\u201d We have already rejected this argument. The term \u201ctogether with,\u201d as used in the granting language, is not reasonably susceptible to the meaning \u201cin connection with.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 27, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">\u00b672 The Landowners also present three \u201ccircumstances\u201d under which the easements were granted. We will examine these circumstances to determine, as a preliminary matter, whether they demonstrate the existence of an ambiguity in the granting language.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">\u00b673 First, the Landowners contend that they were told by Cenex\u2019s agents that the fiber optic cable would be used only to operate and monitor the pipeline. Second, and in a similar vein (but framed as a separate \u201ccircumstance\u201d), the Landowners state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-7\">The Landowners never contemplated that a transcontinental communications network would be running across their land. They certainly had no idea that tens, if not hundreds, of third-party companies would use the Easements to transmit General Telecommunications. The Landowners also had no idea that repair trucks from tens, if not hundreds, of different companies could come onto their land to regenerate the light and maintain, repair, and splice the [Indefeasible Rights of Use].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">These two circumstances, however, do not demonstrate the existence of an ambiguity in the granting language. As explained above, testimony of the parties as to what they believe the language in question means-i.e., subjective evidence of ambiguity-\u201cis invariably self-serving, inherently difficult to verify and thus, inadmissible.\u201d <em>Home Ins. Co., </em>56 F.3d at 768. Thus, these two circumstances may not be considered here. But even if this subjective evidence could be considered, the granting language is not susceptible to the meaning the Landowners advocate here based on what Cenex\u2019s agents allegedly told them and how the Landowners \u201ccontemplated\u201d the fiber optic cable would be used. To conclude that the granting language provides that \u201cthe fiber optic cable may be used only to operate and monitor the pipeline\u201d would be to insert language into the right-of-way <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>agreements-something we may not do. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-4-101, MCA; <em>see also Corn Exchange, </em>175 A. at 58 (\u201cSo far as the [proffered] evidence tends to show, not the meaning of the writing, but an intention wholly unexpressed in the writing, it is irrelevant.\u201d). These two circumstances, therefore, do not establish that the granting language is ambiguous.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">\u00b674 Third, the Landowners assert that Cenex \u201cthreatened\u201d condemnation in order to secure the right-of-way agreements. The Landowners maintain that the granting language, therefore, \u201cwas intended to convey only that which would be authorized by statute if Cenex exercised its power of eminent domain. The language Cenex chose [in drafting the right-of-way agreements] only can be interpreted to conform to, and be in compliance with, \u00a7 69-13-103(1), MCA.\u201d Section 69-13-103(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-5\">The right to lay, maintain, and operate pipelines, together with telegraph and telephone lines <em>incidental to and designed for use only in connection with the operation of such lines, </em>or along, across, or under any public stream or highway in this state is hereby conferred upon all persons, firms, limited partnerships, joint-stock associations, or corporations coming within any of the definitions of common carrier pipelines as hereinbefore made. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">However, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Cenex used \u201cthe threat of condemnation\u201d to secure the easements, this circumstance does not render the granting language susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. Rather, it seems that the Landowners would have us simply insert the words \u201cincidental to and designed for use only in connection with the operation of such lines\u201d into the granting language immediately following \u201ca buried fiber optic communications cable.\u201d Again, this we may not do. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-4-101, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>\u00b675  In sum, the Landowners have not shown that an ambiguity exists in the right-of-way agreements. The three circumstances proffered by the Landowners, even when they are considered collectively, do not demonstrate that the granting language is susceptible to at least two reasonable but conflicting meanings. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that the granting language is unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">\u00b676 <em>Issue 5. Did the District Court err in determining that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">\u00b677 The Landowners\u2019 final \u201calternative\u201d argument is that there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment for either side. The Landowners cite <em>Proctor v. Werk, </em>220 Mont. 246, 250, 714 P.2d 171, 173 (1986), in which this Court stated that \u201c[s]ummary judgment is usually inappropriate where the intent of the contracting parties is an important consideration\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted). Cenex agrees that if we determine that extrinsic evidence is necessary to determine the parties\u2019 intent in entering into the right-of-way agreements, then summary judgment is not appropriate. However, they maintain that the disputed language of the right-of-way agreements is unambiguous and, thus, that there are no genuine issues of material fact. We agree with Cenex.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">\u00b678 The Landowners\u2019 argument that there are genuine issues of material fact precluding summary judgment is premised on the theory that the language of the right-of-way agreements is ambiguous; however, we concluded under Issue 4 that the disputed language is not ambiguous, and we perceive no other genuine issues of material fact. \u201cWhen a contract is reduced to writing, the intention of the parties is to be ascertained from the writing alone if possible.\u201d Section 28-3-303, MCA. \u201cThe language of a contract is to govern its interpretation if the language is clear and explicit and does not involve an absurdity.\u201d Section 28-3-401, MCA. Here, the disputed language of the right-of-way agreements is clear and explicit and is not alleged to involve an absurdity. Furthermore, it is possible to ascertain the intention of the parties from that language alone. The language provides that the Landowners grant Cenex \u201cthe right to construct, maintain, inspect, operate, protect, repair, replace, change the size of or remove a pipeline or pipelines or other appurtenances, for the transportation of oil, liquids and/or gases and the products thereof, together with a buried fiber optic communications cable.\u201d Cenex\u2019s use of the fiber optic cable is not restricted by these words to operating and monitoring the pipeline. To the extent that the Landowners intended such a meaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>or understood the language as providing for such a meaning, that intent simply is not expressed in the right-of-way agreements, the validity of which the Landowners have not challenged (see \u00b6 73 n.8, <em>supra).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">\u00b679  Given that the granting language is unambiguous, the District Court\u2019s duty was to apply that language as written. <em>Ophus, </em>\u00b6 23; <em>Carelli, </em>279 Mont. at 209, 926 P.2d at 761. The court did so and determined that the right-of-way agreements (1) grant Cenex an easement to bury a fiber optic cable on the Landowners\u2019 properties, (2) does not limit the use of the fiber optic cable to operating and monitoring the pipeline, and (3) gives Cenex the right to assign any of its rights, in whole or in part, to any third party. Accordingly, the court concluded that Cenex was not in breach of the right-of-way agreements and that Cenex was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. We agree with this conclusion and, thus, affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment granting Cenex\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the Landowners\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Further, given this conclusion, we agree with the District Court\u2019s decision to deny as moot the Landowners\u2019 motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b680  Pursuant to \u00a7 1-4-102, MCA, objective evidence of \u201cthe circumstances under which [an instrument] was made, including the situation of the subject of the instrument and of the parties to it,\u201d may be shown and considered for the purpose of aiding the court in determining, as a preliminary matter, whether the instrument contains an ambiguity. The District Court erred to the extent it understood \u00a7 1-4-102 as precluding consideration of such evidence. However, the surrounding circumstances proffered by the Landowners in this case do not demonstrate that the granting language is ambiguous. Thus, the District Court ultimately reached the correct conclusion that the granting language of the right-of-way agreements is unambiguous. \u2018We affirm district court decisions which are correct regardless of the court\u2019s reasoning in reaching the decision.\u201d <em>Clark v. Eagle Systems, Inc., </em>279 Mont. 279, 286, 927 P.2d 995, 999 (1996); <em>accord In re Marriage of Rolf, </em>2003 MT 194, \u00b6 41, 316 Mont. 517, \u00b6 41, 75 P.3d 770, \u00b6 41 (\u201c[W]e will affirm a district court\u2019s decision when it reaches the correct result for the wrong reasons.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">\u00b681  Because the granting language is unambiguous, the District Court was not required to interpret that language in the light most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>favorable to the Landowners. Likewise, the court properly refused at this point to consider surrounding circumstances for the purpose of applying the granting language. Lastly, the court correctly determined that the term \u201ctogether with,\u201d as used in the granting language, does not unambiguously limit Cenex\u2019s use of the fiber optic cable to operating and monitoring the pipeline. In light of this determination, the District Court did not err in granting Cenex\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denying the Landowners\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment and motion for class certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">\u00b682 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b98-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER, RICE and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-17\"> Front Range Pipeline, L.L.C., is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cenex Harvest States Cooperatives, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b73-5\"> Sections 28-2-904 and -905(1), MCA, are Montana\u2019s articulation of the parol evidence rule. <em>See Savik v.
