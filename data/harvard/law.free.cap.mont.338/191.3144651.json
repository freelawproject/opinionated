We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">\u00b62 We restate and address the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in not granting Ibarra-Salas\u2019 motion to continue the trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">\u00b64 2. Was Ibarra-Salas\u2019 trial counsel ineffective because he did not question prospective jurors concerning ethnic bias or prejudice?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">\u00b65 The State filed an Information charging Ibarra-Salas with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, a felony, in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA. The State alleged that on November 12, 2003, IbarraSalas and a co-defendant, Dustin White (White), sold methamphetamine to White\u2019s sister, who was a confidential informant.</p>\n<p id=\"ASg\">\u00b66 The day before trial, trial counsel for Ibarra-Salas filed a motion for sanctions-either in the form of dismissal of the charge or a continuance of the trial. He claimed that despite numerous requests, the State failed to make two witnesses available for interviews.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-13\">\u00b67 The District Court held an immediate hearing on the motion. After hearing from counsel and other witnesses concerning the conduct of discovery, the District Court determined the witness interviews did not occur because of scheduling conflicts and miscommunication. The District Court found that the prosecution did not attempt to cause delay by avoiding meetings or hindering the disclosure of information and therefore denied Ibarra-Salas\u2019 motion to dismiss the charge as a sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-14\">\u00b68 Ibarra-Salas\u2019 motion for continuance was based on his counsel\u2019s alleged need to interview the two previously unavailable witnesses and to prepare for trial. After making sime the witnesses were available to be interviewed that day, the District Court denied Ibarra-Salas\u2019 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">\u00b69 In ruling on the motion, the District Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">In regard to the continuance, I am also going to deny the continuance. This case has been set for trial for some time. And while I appreciate that you (defense counsel) have been very diligent in pursuing your discovery efforts, because we have had the numbers of hearings and the discovery requests, I am going a bit on faith that the information that you will receive from the two witnesses that you will presumably have available to you by this afternoon, will be cumulative or at least consistent with the information that you\u2019ve previously been provided. If that does not turn out to be the case, then I would expect that you can document that, either by motion or through cross-examination testimony, through the trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">The trial is currently scheduled for two days. I will be as flexible as we need to be to allow you extra time to prepare for the examination of either of those witnesses should you need extra time. And we will accommodate whatever other arrangements the Court can make to allow you to proceed with the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b610 On the first day of trial, counsel for Ibarra-Salas renewed his request for a continuance based on insufficient time to prepare to conduct jury <em>voir dire. </em>The District Court stated it would stand by the rationale of its previous ruling and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b611 Ibarra-Salas is of Hispanic descent. He had the assistance of a Spanish-English interpreter during the trial. During <em>voir dire, </em>counsel for both Ibarra-Salas and the State questioned the jury panel concerning its ability to be fair and impartial jurors in a drug trial. Neither party questioned prospective jurors about ethnic or racial bias during <em>voir dire. </em>Counsel for Ibarra-Salas was successful in challenging two prospective jurors for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b612 The jury found Ibarra-Salas guilty of Criminal Distribution of Dangerous Drugs in violation of \u00a7 45-9-101, MCA. Ibarra-Salas filed a motion for a new trial, which the District Court denied as untimely. After the entry of judgment, Ibarra-Salas appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">\u00b613 The decision to grant or deny a motion for a continuance is within the discretion of the district court. <em>State v. DeMary, </em>2003 MT 307, \u00b6 24, 318 Mont. 200, \u00b6 24, 79 P.3d 817, \u00b6 24; \u00a7 46-13-202(3), MCA. This Court will not overturn a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for continuance unless the district court abused its discretion and the ruling prejudices the defendant. <em>DeMary, </em>\u00b6 24. Ibarra-Salas argues the District Court abused its discretion when it denied his motions for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b614 Ibarra-Salas cites to nothing in the record to support his contention that his counsel was not prepared to conduct jury <em>voir dire, </em>or that he was unable to present any evidence or was unable to effectively cross-examine a witness because he was unprepared. Also, even though the District Court said that it would be inclined to grant a motion for a delay during the trial if Ibarra-Salas\u2019 counsel needed more time, Ibarra-Salas did not move the District Court for additional time. We will not reverse an order of the District Court denying a motion for a continuance when a party fails to cite a portion of the record which indicates an abuse of discretion. M. R. App. P. 12(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"ANQ\">\u00b615 Ibarra-Salas also claims that the District Court erred because it did not recess the trial and conduct a separate hearing to determine if his lawyer was unprepared. He attempts to analogize his counsel\u2019s request for a continuance to a situation in which a defendant claims ineffective assistance of counsel and requests new counsel. It is true that when a defendant presents a \u201cseemingly substantial complaint\u201d about counsel and requests a different lawyer, the Court should hold a hearing on the request for substitution of counsel. <em>City of Billings v. Smith, </em>281 Mont. 133, 136, 932 P.2d 1058, 1060 (1997). However, Ibarra-Salas made no request for substitution of his trial counsel and thus no hearing was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b616 Ibarra-Salas then argues that because he is a Hispanic person, and thus a member of a minority group, his counsel\u2019s failure to question prospective jurors about ethnic or racial bias denied him both his constitutional right to an impartial jury and to the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">\u00b617 A criminal defendant in a state court is guaranteed an impartial jury by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment. A defendant is also guaranteed an impartial jury by Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, \u00b6 35, 298 Mont. 358, \u00b6 35, 2 P.3d 204, \u00b6 35; <em>Ristaino v. Ross, </em>424 U.S. 589, 595 n. 6, 96 S. Ct. 1017, 1021 n. 6 (1976) (citations omitted). <em>Voir dire </em>in a criminal proceeding requires adequate questioning to assure counsel\u2019s ability to challenge a prospective juror for cause. <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2005 MT 118, \u00b6 15, 327 Mont. 115, \u00b6 15, 112 P.3d 1005, \u00b6 15; <em>State v. Herrman, </em>2003 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 198, \u00b6 23, 70 P.3d 738, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"ARm\">\u00b618 In the federal courts, there is no constitutional presumption of juror bias for or against members of any particular racial or ethnic group. <em>See Rosales-Lopez v. United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 191, 101 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1629, 1636 (1981). Nor has this Court ever established such a presumption. We agree with the United States Supreme Court that in the heterogeneous society of this country, policy and constitutional considerations militate against a <em>per se </em>rule that justice \u201cin a court of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin, the accident of birth, or the choice of religion.\u201d <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 596 n. 8, 96 S. Ct. at 1021 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b619 In the federal court system, unlike Montana, judges rather than attorneys generally conduct <em>voir dire </em>examination. Fed. R. Civ. P. 47(a); Fed. R. Crim. P. 24(a); \u00a7 46-16-114, MCA. Federal trial courts must accede to a criminal defendant\u2019s request that prospective jurors be questioned about racial or ethnic bias only when (1) racial issues are inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial and (2) there are substantial indications of the likelihood of racial or ethnic prejudice affecting the jurors in the particular case. <em>Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 596-97, 96 S. Ct. at 1021-22 <em>(citing Ham v. South Carolina, </em>409 U.S. 524, 93 S. Ct. 848 (1973)). The \u201ccritical factor\u201d is whether racial issues are inextricably bound up with the conduct of the trial. <em>Rosales-Lopez, </em>451 U.S. at 189, 101 S. Ct. at 1635 (1981); <em>See Ham, </em>409 U.S. at 526, 93 S. Ct. at 850. These considerations comport with Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution, are understandable and we shall utilize them in making the determination whether Ibarra-Salas was denied a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b620  In the present case, there is no indication that any ethnic or racial issues were intertwined with the charged drug offense, that the alleged offense was racially motivated, or that an ethnic issue was in any way connected with the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b621 Also, Ibarra-Salas\u2019 defense did not introduce any ethnic or racial issue into the trial. Ibarra-Salas\u2019 counsel argued that his client was merely present in White\u2019s apartment during the methamphetamine sale, that he had no involvement with the sale and that the drug deal was between White and White\u2019s sister. The defense did not relate to any ethnic or racial issue, and was thus not likely to intensify any bias or prejudice that individual members of the jury might harbor. <em>See Ristaino, </em>424 U.S. at 596-97, 96 S. Ct. at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b622  There is no indication in the record of ethnic or racial bias on the part of a witness, an attorney, the trial judge, a member of the Court staff or any member of the venire panel. Ibarra-Salas was not denied his right to an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b623  As there is no record of any ethnic or racial issue in the case, we conclude that defense counsel\u2019s performance did not fall below the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>range of competence required of attorneys in criminal cases simply because he did not question prospective jurors about possible ethnic bias or prejudice. Thus, Ibarra-Salas was not denied the effective assistance of counsel. <em>See LaMere, </em>\u00b6 8; <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b218-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, MORRIS and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
