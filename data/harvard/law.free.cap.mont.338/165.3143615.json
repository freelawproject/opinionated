Stokes, Skyline Broadcaster, Inc., and Z-600, Inc. (collectively Stokes) appeal from the order of the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, granting the State of Montana\u2019s (State) cross-motion for summary judgment on Stokes\u2019s claim for tortious interference with his easement. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\u00b62 We review whether the District Court correctly granted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on its determination that Stokes had failed to present a <em>prima facie </em>case of tortious interference with his easement?</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">\u00b63 Stokes owns and operates a small radio station just off U.S. Highway 93, south of Kalispell. Stokes holds an easement across a part of Douglas Anderson\u2019s (Anderson) adjoining property. A portion of Stokes\u2019s radio facility sits on Anderson\u2019s land. Anderson\u2019s predecessor in interest granted the easement for the radio facility to the Stokes\u2019s predecessor in interest in 1949. Neither Stokes nor any of his predecessors in interest have expanded the radio facility beyond its original location on Anderson\u2019s land. The present dispute relates to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>separate dispute between Stokes and Anderson regarding the scope of Stokes\u2019s easement. Its resolution in Anderson\u2019s favor was the subject of our decision in <em>Anderson v. Stokes, </em>2007 MT 166, 338 Mont. 118, 163 P.3d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b64 The State determined that it needed to obtain a right-of-way over a portion of Anderson\u2019s property near U.S. Highway 93 as part of a highway improvement project. Susan J. Rebeck (Rebeck), acting on behalf of the State, contacted Anderson to inform him that some ambiguity existed regarding whether Stokes\u2019s easement encumbered the property sought by the State. This ambiguity gave rise to two separate appraisals of the State\u2019s proposed right-of-way over Anderson\u2019s property. Rebeck explained that the State would pay Anderson $2,056.00 for the right-of-way if Stokes\u2019s easement encumbered it based on its value for agricultural purposes. On the other hand, Rebeck explained that the State would pay Anderson $78,800.00 if Stokes\u2019s easement did not encumber it based on its value for potential commercial development. Rebeck advised Anderson to consult a lawyer in order to determine whether Stokes\u2019s easement encumbered the State\u2019s proposed right-of-way.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b65 Anderson retained a lawyer and filed an action on January 12, 2001, in the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, asking the court either to extinguish Stokes\u2019s easement or, alternatively, to declare that the scope of the easement always had been limited to its historic location. Anderson and the State entered an agreement on January 23, 2001, where the State stipulated that it would pay Anderson $2,056.00 for the right-of-way, but would pay Anderson an additional sum of $76,744.00 if he could show that Stokes\u2019s easement did not encumber the right-of-way. The court in the Flathead County action entered an order on October 29, 2002, declaring that the scope of Stokes\u2019s easement always had been limited to its historic location. We affirmed. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b66 Stokes filed a complaint in the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County, on April, 22 2004, claiming that Rebeck tortiously had interfered with his easement rights. Stokes alleged that Rebeck unlawfully had induced Anderson to file a complaint that had resulted in a court order limiting the scope of Stokes\u2019s easement and causing him damages. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The District Court denied Stokes\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granted the State\u2019s motion for cross-summary judgment as to Stokes\u2019s claim for tortious interference with his easement rights. Stokes appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>using the same criteria applied by the district court under M. R. Civ. P. 56. <em>GRB Farm v. Christman Ranch, Inc., </em>2005 MT 59, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 236, \u00b6 7, 108 P.3d 507, \u00b6 7. Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d M. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Watkins Trust v. Lacosta, </em>2004 MT 144, \u00b6 16, 321 Mont. 432, \u00b6 16, 92 P.3d 620, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court correctly grant the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on its determination that Stokes had failed to present a prima facie case of tortious interference with his easement?</em></p>\n<p id=\"Aky\">\u00b69 Stokes alleges that Rebeck interfered with his easement when Rebeck induced Anderson to file a lawsuit seeking either to extinguish Stokes\u2019s easement or, alternatively, to limit Stokes\u2019s easement to its historic location. Stokes claims first that the court\u2019s order limiting his easement to its historic location destroyed his \u201cplans for future expansion.\u201d Stokes admits that Rebeck has not interfered with Stokes\u2019s historic use of his easement. He argues, however, that his easement would have permitted him to expand his radio facility beyond its historic location to anywhere on Anderson\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b610 Stokes must establish that Rebeck\u2019s alleged acts actually caused some interference with his existing easement rights. <em>Grenfell v. Anderson, </em>2002 MT 225, <em>\u00b6 </em>75, 311 Mont. 385, <em>\u00b6 </em>75, 56 P.3d 326, <em>\u00b6 </em>75; <em>Lachenmaier v. First Bank Systems, Inc., </em>246 Mont. 26, 34-35, 803 P.2d 619 (1990); Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 766 (1979). In <em>Grenfell, </em>for example, we rejected the plaintiffs claim that Grenfell tortiously had interfered with the plaintiffs sublease in light of the fact that the plaintiffs sublease had been terminated by the time that Grenfell allegedly interfered with the sublease. <em>Grenfell, \u00b6 </em>66. Grenfell could not tortiously have interfered with a property right that did not exist. <em>Grenfell, \u00b6 </em>75; <em>see also Germann v. Stephens, </em>2006 MT 130, <em>\u00b6 </em>26, 332 Mont. 303, <em>\u00b6 </em>26, 137 P.3d 545, <em>\u00b6 </em>26 (holding that a party must establish that it possesses a protected liberty or property interest to establish a viable \u00a7 1983 claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">\u00b611 Stokes similarly alleges that Rebeck tortiously interfered with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>property right that did not exist. This Court determined that Stokes had no easement rights-and never had any easement rights-beyond the historic location of his radio facility. <em>Anderson, </em>\u00b6 60. Stokes offers no evidence to the contrary. Stokes thus presents an illusory claim of tortious interference with his right to expand his radio facility as Stokes\u2019s easement never permitted such an expansion in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b612 Stokes claims alternatively that Rebeck induced Anderson\u2019s failed attempt to extinguish Stokes\u2019s easement. He claims damages from emotional distress and attorneys fees in defending the extinguishment suit. The State responds that Stokes has failed to offer any facts suggesting that Rebeck\u2019s acts were \u201cimproper\u201d as required by our decision in <em>Bolz v. Myers, </em>200 Mont. 286, 651 P.2d 606 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b613  We held in <em>Bolz </em>that a plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s acts were \u201cimproper\u201d in order to establish a claim for tortious interference with contractual relations. <em>Bolz, </em>200 Mont. at 294-95, 651 P.2d at 610. We consider the following factors when determining whether a party\u2019s acts were improper: (a) the nature of the actors conduct; (b) the actor\u2019s motive; (c) the interests of the other with which the actor\u2019s conduct interferes; (d) the interests sought to be advanced by the actor; (e) the social interests in protecting the freedom of action of the actor and the contractual interests of the other; (f) the proximity or remoteness of the actor\u2019s conduct to the interference; and (g) the relations between the parties. <em>Bolz, </em>200 Mont. at 294-95, 651 P.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b614 The record shows that the State, acting through Rebeck, agreed to pay Anderson more money for the right of way if he could show that Stokes\u2019s easement did not encumber the State\u2019s proposed right-of-way. Stokes points to nothing that the State had to gain from paying more to Anderson for the right-of-way. Rebeck advised Anderson to consult an attorney regarding whether Stokes\u2019s easement encumbered the State\u2019s proposed right-of-way. Rebeck\u2019s suggestion to Anderson that he should consult a lawyer, however, relates only remotely to Anderson\u2019s ultimate decision to file an action to extinguish the easement. The record does not indicate that Rebeck encouraged Anderson to file a lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b615 We agree with the District Court that it \u201ccertainly would not be improper, let alone unlawful, for an attorney in Rebeck\u2019s position to tell a landowner whose property is subject to being acquired by condemnation that he should consult with an attorney ....\u201d Rebeck\u2019s actions comported with a lawyer\u2019s ethical duty to advise a third party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>to \u201csecure counsel, if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know that the interests of such a person are or have a reasonable possibility of being in conflict with the interests of the client.\u201d Montana Rule of Professional Conduct 4.3. Likewise, Rebeck did not act improperly when she offered, on behalf of the State, to pay Anderson more money for a right-of-way that he could show was free and clear of any easements. Stokes has failed to allege any facts establishing that Rebeck acted improperly, thus, we need not address the remaining elements of his claim for tortious interference with his easement. <em>Bolz, </em>200 Mont. at 294-95, 651 P.2d at 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b616  We conclude that the State is entitled to summary judgment as no genuine issue of material fact exists with regard to whether the State tortiously interfered with Stokes\u2019s easement. <em>GRB </em>Farm, \u00b6 7. The District Court correctly determined as a matter of law that Stokes has failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of tortious interference with his easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b617 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b192-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
