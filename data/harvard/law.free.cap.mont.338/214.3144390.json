Hughes, Jr., M.D. (\u201cHughes\u201d) from the order and judgment of the District Court for the Second Judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>District, Silver Bow County, granting summary judgment in favor of Laura Lynch (\u201cLynch\u201d). We affirm. The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in determining that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to Hughes\u2019s malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and tortious interference claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b62 On February 2, 1998, Lynch filed a complaint with the Montana Human Rights Commission (\u201cHRC\u201d) alleging unlawful gender discrimination by St. James Community Hospital (\u201cSt. James\u201d) and Hughes. Lynch subsequently amended her complaint to add an allegation that Hughes\u2019s actions had created an extremely hostile workplace. The HRC investigated the complaint. The final report issued by the HRC investigator stated that \u201cthe evidence supports that Hughes is an employer within the meaning of the Human Rights Act.\u201d The investigator recommended a finding of cause to believe that unlawful sexual harassment and retaliation had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b63 Based on the investigative report, the case proceeded to a contested case hearing in May 2000. In his final agency decision, the Hearing Examiner stated that Hughes was neither an \u201cemployer\u201d nor an \u201cagent\u201d of an employer under the Montana Human Rights Act, and, therefore, that Hughes did not bear an employer\u2019s liability for sexual harassment. However, according to the examiner, Hughes\u2019s behavior after Lynch filed her complaint constituted illegal retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b64 Hughes appealed the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision. On June 1, 2001, the Chairman of the HRC issued his order sustaining Hughes\u2019s appeal and reversing in part the Hearing Examiner\u2019s decision. Although the Chairman agreed that Hughes was not an employer, he determined that Lynch had not properly alleged retaliation in her complaint to the HRC. Lynch did not appeal from the order of the Chairman of the HRC.</p>\n<p id=\"AqB\">\u00b65 On September 26, 2001, Hughes filed a complaint in the District Court against Lynch. He alleged as follows: first, that Lynch did not have probable cause for commencing and/or continuing the prosecution of her case before the HRC and that she was actuated by malice (the malicious prosecution claim); second, that in filing her complaint with the HRC and obtaining an initial finding of cause, Lynch used the administrative process to accomplish a purpose for which that process was not designed (the abuse of process claim); and third, that Lynch improperly interfered in the contractual and business relationships between Hughes and St. James, the medical staff of St. James, and Hughes\u2019s current and prospective patients (the tortious interference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>claim).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b66 On July 15, 2004, Lynch filed a motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The District Court granted Lynch\u2019s motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on July 21,2005. On July 28, the court entered judgment, stating that Hughes shall recover nothing from Lynch and, further, that Lynch shall recover costs from Hughes. Hughes appeals from the District Court\u2019s order and final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b67 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary judgment de novo, applying the same criteria of M. R. Civ. P. 56 as did the district court. <em>Redies v. Attorneys Liability Protect. </em>Soc., 2007 MT 9, \u00b6 26, 335 Mont. 233, \u00b6 26, 150 P.3d 930, \u00b6 26; <em>Montana-Dak. Util. Co. v. City of Billings, </em>2003 MT 332, \u00b6 6, 318 Mont. 407, \u00b6 6, 80 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 6. Rule 56(c) provides that a motion for summary judgment \u201cshall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d In evaluating a motion for summary judgment, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Redies, </em>\u00b6 26. Summary judgment is an extreme remedy that should never be a substitute for a trial on the merits if a controversy exists over a material fact. <em>Montana Metal Buildings, Inc. v. Shapiro, </em>283 Mont. 471, 474, 942 P.2d 694, 696 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">\u00b68 The party moving for summary judgment has the initial burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>establishing the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hi-Tech Motors v. Bombardier Motor Corp., </em>2005 MT 187, \u00b6 32, 328 Mont. 66, \u00b6 32, 117 P.3d 159, \u00b6 32 (citing <em>Arthur v. Pierre </em>Ltd., 2004 MT 303, \u00b6 14, 323 Mont. 453, \u00b6 14, 100 P.3d 987, \u00b6 14). If this burden is met, then the burden shifts to the nonmoving party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact does exist. <em>Hi-Tech Motors, </em>\u00b6 32. If the district court determines that no genuine issue of material fact exists, the court then determines whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Hi-Tech Motors, </em>\u00b6 32. This determination is a conclusion of law which we review for correctness. <em>Hi-Tech Motors, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in determining that there were no genuine issues of material fact with respect to Hughes\u2019s malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and tortious interference claims?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b610 In opposition to Lynch\u2019s motion to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment (hereinafter, \u201csummary judgment motion\u201d), Hughes submitted the affidavit of Faye Ronco (\u201cRonco\u201d), Lynch\u2019s co-worker, in which Ronco states that Lynch approached Ronco and said that \u201ca lot of money could be made from this\u201d-an apparent reference to Lynch\u2019s complaint filed with the HRC. Hughes asserted that this statement in the Ronco affidavit demonstrated that a genuine issue of material fact existed with regards to each of Hughes\u2019s three claims against Lynch. Thus, he maintained that he had \u201cclearly met his burden of coming forward with evidence of a material issue of fact as to whether Laura Lynch was motivated to proceed in response to sexual harassment or in recognition that \u2018a lot of money could be made from this.\u2019 \u201d Accordingly, Hughes argued that Lynch\u2019s motion should be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b611 On appeal, Hughes sets forth essentially the same arguments that he advanced in the District Court. He argues that he met his burden as the nonmoving party to establish that a genuine issue of material fact exists because the Ronco affidavit demonstrates a factual dispute with respect to each of Hughes\u2019s three claims against Lynch, and therefore, that the District Court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Lynch. We will evaluate each claim in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">The Malicious Prosecution Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b612  Malicious prosecution of a civil suit begins in malice, without probable cause to believe that the action can succeed, and finally ends in failure. <em>See McGuire v. Armitage, </em>184 Mont. 407, 410, 603 P.2d 253, 255 (1979). In a civil action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiffs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>burden at trial is to introduce proof sufficient to allow reasonable jurors to find each of the six following elements: (1) a judicial proceeding was commenced and prosecuted against the plaintiff; (2) the defendant was responsible for instigating, prosecuting or continuing such proceeding; (3) there was a lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts; (4) the defendant was actuated by malice; (5) the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff; and (6) the plaintiff suffered damage. <em>Plouffe v. DPHHS, </em>2002 MT 64, \u00b6 16, 309 Mont. 184, \u00b6 16, 45 P.3d 10, \u00b6 16 (citing <em>Vehrs v. Piquette, </em>210 Mont. 386, 390, 684 P.2d 476, 478 (1984)). \u201cIf one of these elements is not proven by <em>prima facie </em>evidence, judgment as a matter of law may be entered for the defendant.\u201d <em>Plouffe, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b613 In her summary judgment motion, Lynch maintained that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to element (3). In this regard, she argued that she had probable cause to believe that Hughes was her employer because she perceived, based on past events in her workplace, that he had the ability and power to supervise and control employees. She also pointed out that the HRC\u2019s investigator had determined that Hughes was, in fact, her employer, given his ability to control employee\u2019s schedules and influence St. James\u2019s management policies. Although the HRC ultimately determined that Hughes did not have such authority, Lynch contended that her genuine belief to the contrary provided sufficient probable cause for her to file her complaint. Further, Lynch noted that the first investigative report filed by the HRC stated that there was probable cause to believe that Hughes had committed sexual harassment and retaliated against her. Finally, Lynch contended that, contrary to Hughes\u2019s assertion in his complaint that she continued to prosecute her case after she had reason to believe Hughes was not her employer, her actions before the HRC cannot constitute malicious prosecution because she had probable cause to institute the original proceeding. Therefore, according to Lynch, Hughes could not satisfy element (3), \u201ca lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">\u00b614 Lynch also maintained that there was no factual dispute with respect to element (5)-whether the judicial proceeding terminated in Hughes\u2019s favor. According to Lynch, the HRC merely determined that Hughes was not an employer and that she had not properly alleged retaliation in her complaint. Lynch contended that both of these determinations were technical in nature and did not address the underlying merits of the case-\u201ci.e., whether Hughes harassed and retaliated against [Lynch].\u201d Therefore, Lynch argued that Hughes could not prove all of the requisite elements of a malicious prosecution claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>and that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">\u00b615 In its order granting summary judgment in favor of Lynch, the District Court stated that it had determined \u201cthat there was probable cause for Lynch to believe Hughes was her employer and to pursue the HRC action against him.\u201d Therefore, according to the court, Hughes could not prove that there was a lack of probable cause for Lynch\u2019s acts (element (3)). Further, the court stated that Hughes \u201ccannot prove that the judicial proceeding terminated favorably for the plaintiff. This element requires a determination on the merits of the case, and an HRC hearing cannot do that\u201d (element (5)).</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b616 We agree with the District Court that Lynch demonstrated that she had probable cause to file and pursue her complaint against Hughes with the HRC. Probable cause, in the context of the tort of malicious prosecution of a civil suit, has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-6\">One who takes an active part in the initiation, continuation or procurement of civil proceedings against another has probable cause for doing so if he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which the claim is based, and either</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-7\">(a) correctly or reasonably believes that under those facts the claim may be valid under the applicable law, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-8\">(b) believes to this effect in reliance upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after full disclosure of all relevant facts within his knowledge and information.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-9\"><em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>\u00a7 675 (1977). We have not yet articulated the probable cause standard for the tort of malicious prosecution of a civil suit; however, we are persuaded that the standard articulated in \u00a7 675 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts is the correct standard for ascertaining whether there was a lack of probable cause for the defendant\u2019s acts (element (3)). We therefore adopt this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">\u00b617 In the case at hand, Lynch demonstrated that she reasonably believed, under the facts upon which her claim was based, that her claim was valid under Title 49, Chapter 2, MCA. In this regard, Lynch relied on the fact that the HRC\u2019s initial investigator had recommended a finding of cause to believe that Hughes was Lynch\u2019s employer and that unlawful sexual harassment and retaliation had occurred. Although the HRC ultimately determined that Hughes was not Lynch\u2019s employer and that Lynch had not properly pleaded a claim of retaliation, we observe that this determination does not mean that Lynch did not have probable cause for filing her complaint in the first place. \u201cIt is generally agreed that the termination of the proceeding in favor of the person against whom it is brought is no evidence that probable cause was lacking, since in a civil action there is no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>preliminary determination of the sufficiency of the evidence to justify the suit.\u201d Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 120, at 855 (4th ed., West 1971). Additionally, Lynch pointed out that Hughes had not yet come forward with any evidence to suggest that she lacked probable cause in filing and pursuing the HRC complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">\u00b618 Because Lynch established the absence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to element (3) and her entitlement to judgment as a matter of law on this claim, the burden shifted to Hughes to establish the contrary. In this regard, Hughes directs our attention to Lynch\u2019s alleged statement set forth in the Ronco affidavit that \u201ca lot of money could be made from this\u201d; however, this statement has no bearing on whether Lynch acted without probable cause throughout the course of the HRC proceedings. Hughes also claims that there was a lack of probable cause for Lynch\u2019s acts \u201cbecause it never has been determined before the HRC or any court that any act of sexual discrimination or harassment took place.\u201d However, we note that the question of probable cause does not depend on whether Lynch\u2019s claims against Hughes ultimately have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b619 Beyond this, Hughes makes entirely unsupported assertions that the elements of malicious prosecution are met here. This approach, however, is insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>M. R. Civ. P. 56(e) (\u2018When a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of the adverse party\u2019s pleading, but the adverse party\u2019s response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. If the adverse party does not so respond, summary judgment, if appropriate, shall be entered against the adverse party.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"Ay3\">\u00b620  Accordingly, we conclude that there were no genuine issues of material fact regarding the alleged lack of probable cause for Lynch\u2019s acts and, further, that Lynch was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on this claim. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Lynch on Hughes\u2019s malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Abuse of Process Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b621 We have stated the elements of an abuse of process claim as follows: \u201cEssential to proof of abuse of process is (1) an ulterior purpose and (2) a willful act in the use of the process not proper in the regular conduct of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Brault v. Smith, </em>209 Mont. 21, 28, 679 P.2d 236, 240 (1984) (citing Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 121, at 857 (4th ed., West 1971)); <em>Seltzer v. Morton, </em>2007 MT 62, \u00b6 57, 336 Mont. 225, \u00b6 57, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>154 P.3d 561, \u00b6 57. Prosser further explains these elements as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azj\">Some definite act or threat not authorized by the process, or aimed at an object not legitimate in the use of the process, is required; and there is no liability where the defendant has done nothing more than carry out the process to its authorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions. The improper purpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not properly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the payment of money, but the use of the process as a threat or a club. There is, in other words, a form of extortion, and it is what is done in the course of negotiation, rather than the issuance or any formal use of the process itself, which constitutes the tort.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASL\">Prosser, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 121, at 857 (footnote omitted). Thus, we explained in <em>Brault </em>that \u201c[flor a defendant to claim abuse of process, there must be an attempt by the plaintiff to use process to coerce the defendant to do some collateral thing which he could not be legally and regularly compelled to do.\u201d <em>Brault, </em>209 Mont. at 29, 679 P.2d at 240.</p>\n<p id=\"All\">\u00b622 In his complaint, Hughes alleged that Lynch used her HRC complaint for the purpose of disrupting Hughes\u2019s business relationships and causing irreparable harm to his reputation. In her summary judgment motion, Lynch contended that Hughes\u2019s claim was \u201cludicrous and supported by nothing but speculation on Hughes\u2019s part.\u201d Lynch pointed out that there was no evidence which suggested that her purpose was \u201csomething other than achieving the legal redress to which she was entitled.\u201d Therefore, Lynch argued that because Hughes did nothing more than speculate about Lynch\u2019s purpose in filing her complaint with the HRC, she was entitled to summary judgment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b623 Hughes claims that Ronco\u2019s affidavit, in which Ronco states that Lynch told her that \u201ca lot of money could be made from this,\u201d establishes that Lynch \u201chad a profit motive in bringing her claim\u201d and that she was actuated by malice. Hughes, however, misapprehends the meaning of \u201cprocess.\u201d In the context of the abuse of process tort, process mayrefer to summons, subpoenas, attachments, garnishments, replevin or claim and delivery writs, arrest under a warrant, injunctive orders, and other orders directly affecting obligations of persons or rights in property. <em>See </em>Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 438, at 1235-36 (West 2001). Some courts also take process to include all the procedures in the litigation process. <em>See </em>Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 438, at 1236. However, \u201cmerely filing a complaint in court does not institute any process.\u201d <em>See </em>Dobbs, <em>The Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 438, at 1235.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b624  Moreover, even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Lynch had a profit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>motive and was actuated by malice, Ronco\u2019s affidavit does not bear on the question of whether Lynch actually used process to coerce Hughes to do some collateral thing which he could not be legally and regularly compelled to do. Simply stated, nothing in the record creates a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Lynch committed the tort of abuse of process. We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Lynch on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">The Tortious Interference Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b625  In order to assert a prima facie claim of tortious interference, the plaintiff must show that the defendant\u2019s acts were (1) intentional and willful, (2) calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff in his business, (3) done with the unlawful purpose of causing damage or loss, without right or justifiable cause on the part of the actor, and (4) that actual damages and loss resulted. <em>See Com\u2019n on Unauthorized Practice v. O\u2019Neil, </em>2006 MT 284, \u00b6 47, 334 Mont. 311, \u00b6 47, 147 P.3d 200, \u00b6 47; <em>Pospisil v. First Nat. Bank of Lewistown, </em>2001 MT 286, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 392, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 704, \u00b6 13; <em>Farrington v. Buttrey Food &amp; Drug Stores, </em>272 Mont. 140, 143, 900 P.2d 277, 279 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b626 In his complaint, Hughes claimed that Lynch tortiously interfered with his contractual and business relationships with St. James, the medical staff of St. James, and current and future patients. In her summary judgment motion, Lynch contended that, based on her arguments concerning the malicious prosecution and the abuse of process claims, Hughes could not prove the first and third elements of tortious interference. With respect to element (2), she maintained that she had filed her complaint with the HRC \u201cto remedy an employment situation which had become intolerable and to be compensated for the related damage done to her.\u201d According to Lynch, she did not file her complaint for \u201cthe purpose of damaging Hughes\u2019s business relationships.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b627 With respect to element (4), Lynch argued that Hughes could not demonstrate that he had been damaged by her actions. She noted that in 1997, one of Hughes\u2019s cancer patients filed a complaint against him with the Montana Board of Medical Examiners. Hughes had drawn a \u201csmiley face\u201d on the patient\u2019s breast, which he later explained was an attempt to improve the patient\u2019s morale. Hughes ultimately entered into an agreement with the Montana Professional Assistance Program and underwent evaluation for medical, psychiatric, and/or chemical dependency. However, Hughes later sued the Montana Professional Assistance Program for false imprisonment, conspiracy, and a variety of other claims. His suit was eventually dismissed on summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>judgment. Hughes also received a written reprimand and was placed on probation by the hospital. (These events are described in greater detail in our decisions in <em>Hughes v. Pullman, </em>2001 MT 216, 306 Mont. 420, 36 P.3d 339 <em>(\u201cHughes F), </em>and <em>Hughes v. Montana Bd. of Medical Examiners, </em>2003 MT 305, 318 Mont. 181, 80 P.3d 415 <em>(\u201cHughes II\").) </em>Given these facts, Lynch essentially argued that any damage suffered by Hughes was the result of his own actions. Therefore, Lynch maintained that she was entitled to summary judgment on Hughes\u2019s claim of tortious interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b628 According to the District Court, no facts in the record supported Hughes\u2019s contention that Lynch acted intentionally and willfully to cause damage to Hughes. The court also noted that prior to the time that Lynch filed her complaint with the HRC, a complaint had already been filed against Hughes concerning the smiley-face incident. Further, Hughes was already on probation at St. James and he had already agreed to undergo evaluation and treatment for medical, psychiatric, and/or chemical dependency. Therefore, the court opined that \u201c[a]ny damage done to Hughes [sic] reputation, business relationships or business was done by himself prior to Lynch\u2019s complaint. Lynch\u2019s complaint was simply more evidence of the same type of conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b629  We agree with the District Court that there is no evidence in the record to suggest that Lynch\u2019s acts were calculated to cause damage to Hughes. In this regard, Hughes again directs our attention to the Ronco affidavit; however, whether or not Lynch believed that \u201ca lot of money could be made from this,\u201d she still was entitled to seek both redress of and damages for the alleged discrimination. <em>See </em>\u00a7 49-2-506(b), MCA (stating that the HRC may \u201crequire any reasonable measure to correct the discriminatory practice and to rectify any harm, pecuniary or otherwise, to the person discriminated against\u201d). Furthermore, Lynch demonstrated in her summary judgment motion that her filing a complaint against Hughes with the HRC was not done without right or justifiable cause on her part. Lastly, Hughes has failed to counter Lynch\u2019s evidence that any damage suffered by Hughes was the result of his own action of drawing a smiley face on the breast of a cancer patient and everything which ensued from that event, as described in <em>Hughes I </em>and <em>Hughes II. </em>We therefore affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Lynch on Hughes\u2019s malicious prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Hughes\u2019s Ability to Exonerate Himself</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b630 Hughes asserts that the record is \u201cabsent of any finding by any agency or court that sexual harassment was a proven fact in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>relationship between Lynch and Hughes.\u201d He maintains that, without a trial, \u201cLynch will never be able to prove her sexual harassment allegations; nor will Hughes be able to exonerate himself.\u201d It is unclear whether Hughes intends this as an alternative basis for resisting Lynch\u2019s motion for summary judgment. Regardless, the merits of Lynch\u2019s sexual harassment claim are not at issue in this case. Hughes\u2019s claims are based on malicious prosecution, abuse of process, and tortious interference. There is no need, in the context of these claims, for Lynch to prove that Hughes is liable to her for sexual harassment or for Hughes to attempt to exonerate himself from a finding of sexual harassment. It appears, therefore, that Hughes simply has misapprehended the nature of his suit against Lynch or would like to use a trial in this case to litigate issues that are outside the purview of his complaint. Either way, this is not a valid basis for withstanding Lynch\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b631 The appellant bears the burden of establishing that the district court erred. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 7, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 7 <em>(citing Matter of M.J.W., </em>1998 MT 142, \u00b6 18, 289 Mont. 232, \u00b6 18, 961 P.2d 105, \u00b6 18). Hughes has not met this burden in this case. Lynch, as the party moving for summary judgment, demonstrated the absence of genuine issues of material fact and her entitlement to judgment as a matter of law with respect to all three of Hughes\u2019s claims. Hughes failed to meet his burden as the nonmoving party to establish the contrary. The Ronco affidavit simply does not demonstrate that a genuine issue of material fact exists with respect to any of the three claims against Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b632  We therefore conclude that the District Court correctly determined that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that Lynch was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Accordingly, we affirm the District Court\u2019s July 21, 2005 order granting Lynch\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the court\u2019s July 28, 2005 judgment in favor of Lynch.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b633 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-8\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b239-8\"> Hughes also named the State of Montana (\u201cState\u201d) as a defendant. He alleged that the HRC had breached a duty of care owed to Hughes through its investigation of Lynch\u2019s complaint. On June 30,2003, the District Court ppranted the State\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground that the State was entitled to absolute quasi-judicial immunity for its investigation of the complaint against Hughes and the compilation of its report. Hughes does not appeal this ruling. Lynch, however, argues that this case should be dismissed because the State is a necessary and indispensable party under M. R. Civ. P. 19. Yet, Lynch did not file a cross-appeal and, thus, this issue is not properly before this Court. <em>See Joseph Eve &amp; Co. v. Allen, </em>284 Mont. 511, 514, 945 P.2d 897, 899 (1997) (stating that a cross-appeal is necessary where the respondent seeks review of matters separate and distinct from those sought to be reviewed by the appellant (citing <em>Johnson v. Tindall, </em>195 Mont. 165, 170, 635 P.2d 266, 268 (1981))); <em>see also Motta v. Philipsburg School Bd. Trustees, </em>2004 MT 256, \u00b6 15, 323 Mont. 72, \u00b6 15, 98 P.3d 673, \u00b6 15. Moreover, because we are affirming the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Lynch, we would not need to reach the Rule 19 issue had Lynch properly appealed it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
