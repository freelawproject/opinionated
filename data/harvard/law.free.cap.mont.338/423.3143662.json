We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">\u00b62 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting the M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion filed by Moose\u2019s Saloon (\u201cMoose\u2019s\u201d) and Clark Vogt (\u201cVogt\u201d). We therefore do not address the other two issues raised by Essex, which pertain to rulings by the District Court after it granted the Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">\u00b63 On June 17, 1994, an altercation occurred between Mark Yarde (\u2018Yarde\u201d), Vogt, and Dana Severy (\u201cSevery\u201d) at Moose\u2019s. According to Yarde\u2019s version of the events, Vogt (an employee of Moose\u2019s) was removing him from the bar on the night in question. On their way out, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Vogt grabbed Yarde around the neck, shoved Yarde against the wall, and then both men fell onto the ground. Vogt stood up and then proceeded to break Yarde\u2019s leg by stomping on it. According to Vogt, however, as he escorted Yarde out of the bar, Yarde got into a fight with Severy (a bar patron of Moose\u2019s), who was standing nearby. When Vogt separated the two, Yarde grabbed for Vogt\u2019s throat, at which point Vogt pushed Yarde down onto the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">\u00b64 On April 11, 1995, Yarde filed a personal injury lawsuit against Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy. In his complaint, Yarde alleged that Severy and Vogt, while in the scope and course of his employment with Moose\u2019s, \u201cnegligently injured\u201d Yarde in the bar fight. He also alleged that Moose\u2019s was negligent in its hiring and supervision of Vogt. Pursuant to Moose\u2019s insurance policy, Essex agreed to investigate and provide Moose\u2019s and Vogt with a defense in Yarde\u2019s suit; however, Essex reserved its right to deny coverage if any exclusions in the policy applied. During the course of its investigation, Essex learned that Yarde had given a witness statement to the Kalispell Police Department stating that Vogt had committed assault and battery on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">\u00b65 On May 21, 1996, Essex filed a complaint for a declaratory judgment in the District Court, naming Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and John Doe (who was later identified as Severy) as defendants. Essex sought a declaration that, pursuant to the insurance policy, Essex had neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify Moose\u2019s and Vogt with regard to the claims asserted by Yarde in the personal injury lawsuit. The basis for Essex\u2019s complaint was that the insurance policy contained a number of applicable exclusions. First, according to Essex, the incident involving Yarde, Vogt, and Severy was not an \u201caccident\u201d or \u201coccurrence\u201d as those terms were defined in the policy. Second, the policy contained an express exclusion of coverage for damages resulting from an assault and battery or for any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of an assault and battery, whether instigated or caused by Moose\u2019s, an employee of Moose\u2019s, or a patron. Lastly, the policy contained an express exclusion for coverage of any claims arising out of charges or allegations of negligent hiring, placement, training, or supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\u00b66 Essex moved for summary judgment on September 10, 1996, on the grounds that \u201cthere is no coverage, no duty to defend and no indemnity obligation because of the occurrence language of the policy, because of the assault and battery exclusion of the policy and because of the hiring/supervision exclusion of the policy.\u201d Although Yarde had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>alleged negligence in the personal injury lawsuit, Essex maintained that Yarde was \u201cfactually claiming assault and battery.\u201d Additionally, Essex maintained that, for the purposes of its motion for summary judgment, it did not matter whose version of the incident (Yarde\u2019s or Vogt\u2019s) was true. According to Essex, \u201c[i]n either version of the facts, there was an assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">\u00b67 Moose\u2019s argued in response that the depositions of Y arde and Vogt created material issues of fact regarding the altercation between the two of them. Moose\u2019s maintained that it was unclear whether there was an \u201cintentional act\u201d by Vogt or simply an accidental fall during the course of the altercation between Yarde and Severy. Therefore, according to Moose\u2019s, summary judgment was not appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u00b68 The District Court disagreed and, on April 23, 1997, granted Essex\u2019s motion. The court determined that there were no issues of material fact as to the acts in question, noting that \u201ceither Vogt assaulted Yarde, Yarde assaulted Vogt, or Severy and Yarde assaulted each other and Vogt tried to suppress it, or some combination of all three events occurred.\u201d The court further determined that the assault and battery exclusion \u201cexcludes the types of acts at issue in the underlying matter of <em>Yarde v. Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., et al.\u201d </em>Finally, the court concluded that the \u201caccident\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d exclusion and the negligent hiring and supervision exclusion also applied. Thus, the court declared that \u201cEssex Insurance Company has neither a duty to defend nor a duty to indemnify Moose\u2019s Saloon, Inc., or any of its employees, including Vogt, or any unnamed John Doe, with regard to any of the claims asserted by Mark Yarde.\u201d Significantly, Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy did not appeal from the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Essex.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">\u00b69 Yarde\u2019s personal injury lawsuit ultimately went to trial and, on February 12,1999, the jury returned a verdict against Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy. On the special verdict form, the jury determined that Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy were all negligent and that they were each a cause of Yarde\u2019s injury. The jury also determined that Vogt had assaulted or battered Yarde and that Vogt had acted with malice. The District Court thereafter entered judgment in favor of Yarde in the sum of $159,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">\u00b610 On January 12, 2000-nine months after the District Court had entered judgment in favor of Yarde in the personal injury lawsuit and approaching three years after the District Court had granted Essex\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action-Moose\u2019s and Vogt filed a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>60(b)(6) for relief from the District Court\u2019s judgment in the declaratory judgment action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They noted that in that action, the District Court had \u201cheld that Vogt\u2019s acts were intentional and that the facts surrounding his altercation with Yarde did not support a theory of negligence\u201d; yet, in the personal injury lawsuit, the District Court had \u201centered judgment on the verdict finding [Moose\u2019s and Vogt] negligent.\u201d According to Moose\u2019s and Vogt, this created \u201can inconsistency or irregularity in the proceedings\u201d which \u201cprevented an accurate determination on the merits thereby prejudicing [them].\u201d Specifically, they explained that \u201cdespite having been found \u2018negligent\u2019 by a 12-person jury, [Moose\u2019s and Vogt] are not entitled to indemnification by Essex for Vogt\u2019s negligent acts because those same acts were deemed \u2018intentional\u2019 in the declaratory judgment action.\u201d Therefore, they asked the District Court to reopen the declaratory judgment action and \u201cre-determine the issue of insurance policy coverage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">\u00b611 In response, Essex argued, among other things, that Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s motion must fail on the merits because Moose\u2019s and Vogt had failed to establish that the circumstances of the case were so extraordinary as to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6). In this regard, Essex noted that Moose\u2019s and Vogt had not appealed the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in the declaratory judgment action and that Rule 60(b)(6) is not to be used as a substitute for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">\u00b612 The District Court, however, disagreed and, on February 18,2000, granted the Rule 60(b)(6) motion. The court opined that \u201cthe grounds for appealing the declaratory judgment action did not arise until judgment was rendered in the personal injury action. Thus, it cannot be said that [Moose\u2019s and Vogt] had an opportunity to appeal the declaratory judgment action but voluntarily chose to forego an appeal.\u201d The District Court also stated that Moose\u2019s and Vogt had \u201cdemonstrated that an inconsistency or irregularity in the proceedings prevented an accurate determination on the merits thereby prejudicing them.\u201d Therefore, the court concluded that it was \u201conly fair and equitable to allow [Moose\u2019s and Vogt] to reopen the declaratory judgment action and seek a redetermination of insurance coverage.\u201d Essex filed a motion for reconsideration, which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u00b613 The parties thereafter filed cross-motions for summary judgment. Moose\u2019s and Vogt argued that none of the policy exclusions applied and that Essex, therefore, had a duty to defend and indemnify them \u201cfor damages paid and expenses incurred in connection with the personal injury action brought by Yarde.\u201d They requested that the District Court order Essex to do so. For its part, Essex argued that \u201cunder every conceivable theory upon which the jury could hold Moose\u2019s Saloon liable in the underlying action, no coverage exists under the Essex policy.\u201d They noted that although the jury had found Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy negligent, the jury had also found that Vogt assaulted and battered Yarde.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">\u00b614 On March 17,2004, the District Court granted Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Essex\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The court determined that the events which gave rise to Yarde\u2019s lawsuit against Moose\u2019s and Vogt \u201cmeet the definition of \u2018occurrence\u2019 for purposes of insurance coverage\u201d and that \u201cthe results [of Vogt\u2019s actions toward Yarde] were not expected nor planned.\u201d Thus, the court concluded that the \u201caccident\u201d and \u201coccurrence\u201d exclusion did not apply. The District Court also addressed the assault and battery exclusion, concluding that the exclusion was \u201cambiguous\u201d in light of the jury\u2019s findings that Vogt had been negligent on the one hand and had committed an assault and battery on the other hand. The court concluded that it must therefore \u201creverse its prior ruling and hold that the policy must be interpreted to provide insurance coverage.\u201d The court accordingly held that \u201cEssex is required to indemnify its insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">\u00b615 The District Court entered final judgment on October 20, 2004, awarding Moose\u2019s reimbursement for the judgment it had paid out to Yarde, as well as attorney\u2019s fees and costs incurred in defending itself in Yarde\u2019s personal injury lawsuit and in the redetermination of insurance coverage. Essex now appeals from the Order and Rationale on Motion for Relief from Judgment, the Order and Rationale on Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, and the final Judgment and Rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">\u00b616 Our standard of review of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) depends on the nature of the final judgment, order, or proceeding from which relief is sought and the specific basis of the Rule 60(b) motion. <em>See In re Marriage of Barnes, </em>251 Mont. 334, 336, 825 P.2d 201, 203 (1992) (\u201cThe scope of our review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>of a decision to grant or deny a Rule 60(b) motion depends on the issues involved.\u201d). As a general rule, the district court\u2019s ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>See Heller v. Gremaux, </em>2002 MT 199, \u00b6 7, 311 Mont. 178, \u00b6 7, 53 P.3d 1259, \u00b6 7; <em>Hall v. Heckerman, </em>2000 MT 300, \u00b6 12, 302 Mont. 345, \u00b6 12, 15 P.3d 869, \u00b6 12; <em>see also Export Group v. Reef Industries, Inc., </em>54 F.3d 1466, 1469 (9th Cir. 1995) (\u201cOrdinarily, motions for relief from judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b) are addressed to the sound discretion of the district court and will not be reversed absent some abuse of discretion.\u201d). But where, for instance, the movant sought relief under subsection (2) of Rule 60(b) based on newly discovered evidence, we have stated that we will review the district court\u2019s ruling for manifest abuse of discretion. <em>See Fjelstad v. State, Through Dept. of Highways, </em>267 Mont. 211, 220, 883 P.2d 106, 111 (1994). By contrast, where the movant sought relief under subsection (4) of Rule 60(b) on the ground that the judgment is void, the standard of review is de novo, since the determination that a judgment is or is not void is a conclusion of law. <em>Export Group, </em>54 F.3d at 1469 (\u201cWe review de novo ... a district court\u2019s ruling upon a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to set aside a judgment as void, because the question of the validity of a judgment is a legal one.\u201d); <em>see also Hicklin v. CSC Logic, Inc., </em>283 Mont. 298, 301, 940 P.2d 447, 449 (1997).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AML\">\u00b617 Another exception to the general rule applies in cases where the movant sought relief from a default judgment. In <em>Lords v. Newman, </em>212 Mont. 359, 688 P.2d 290 (1984), we set forth two standards of review with respect to such motions. We noted that while \u201ccourts are vested with a certain amount of discretion when they are considering a motion to set aside a default,\u201d \u201cevery litigated case should be tried on the merits\u201d and, thus, \u201cjudgments by default are not favored.\u201d <em>Lords, </em>212 Mont. at 363, 688 P.2d at 293. Accordingly, we held that when a trial court has granted a motion to set aside the default and opened up the action for a trial on the merits, the court\u2019s ruling \u201cwill only be set aside upon a showing of manifest abuse\u201d; but when the trial court has denied a motion to set aside the default, \u201cno great abuse of discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>need be shown to warrant reversal\u201d (i.e., \u201conly \u2018slight abuse\u2019 is sufficient to reverse an order refusing to set aside a default\u201d). <em>Lords, </em>212 Mont. at 363-64, 688 P.2d at 293; <em>accord Matthews v. Don K Chevrolet, </em>2005 MT 164, \u00b6 9, 327 Mont. 456, \u00b6 9, 115 P.3d 201, \u00b6 9; <em>Empire Lath &amp; Plaster v. American Cas., </em>256 Mont. 413, 416, 847 P.2d 276, 278 (1993); <em>Blume v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>242 Mont. 465, 467, 791 P.2d 784, 785 (1990); <em>cf. Skogen v. Murray, </em>2007 MT 104, \u00b6 11, 337 Mont. 139, \u00b6 11, 157 P.3d 1143, \u00b6 11; <em>Karlen v. Evans, </em>276 Mont. 181, 185, 915 P.2d 232, 235 (1996).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">\u00b618 In the case at hand, Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion was directed at the District Court\u2019s order in the declaratory judgment action granting summary judgment in favor of Essex, from which Moose\u2019s and Vogt did not appeal. They did not contend that the order is void; thus, de novo review is not implicated here. Furthermore, the decision to reopen or not to reopen an unchallenged final order granting a motion for summary judgment does not implicate the policy considerations identified in <em>Lords </em>with respect to default judgments. Accordingly, we will review the District Comb\u2019s ruling on Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u00b619 A district court abuses its discretion ifit \u201cact[s] arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Elec. Co-op., Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 118, \u00b6 13, 970 P.2d 84, \u00b6 13 (citing <em>C. Haydon Ltd. v. MT Min. Properties, Inc., </em>286 Mont. 138, 146, 951 P.2d 46, 51 (1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\u00b620 Did <em>the District Court abuse its discretion in granting Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) motion?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">\u00b621 M. R. Civ. P. 60(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-9\">On motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>relieve a party or a party\u2019s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b); (3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic), misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party; (4) the judgment is void; (5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application; or (6) any other reason justifying relief from the operation of the judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s motion was based on subsection (6) of Rule 60(b). Relief under this provision is appropriate only in extraordinary circumstances which go beyond those covered by the first five subsections of the rule. <em>See e.g. Skogen v. Murray, </em>2007 MT 104, \u00b6 13, 337 Mont. 139, \u00b6 13, 157 P.3d 1143, \u00b6 13; <em>Falcon v. Faulkner, </em>273 Mont. 327, 333, 903 P.2d 197, 201 (1995). \u201cThus, before a party will be allowed to modify a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), he must first show that none of the other five reasons in Rule 60(b) apply.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Waters, </em>223 Mont. 183, 187, 724 P.2d 726, 729 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"Azk\">\u00b622  Additionally, \u201c[i]t is not the intent of Rule 60(b)(6) to be a substitute for appeal.\u201d <em>Lussy v. Dye, </em>215 Mont. 91, 93, 695 P.2d 465, 466 (1985). Furthermore, a motion for relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(6) must contain \u201cmore than a request for rehearing or a request that the District Court change its mind.\u201d <em>Lussy, </em>215 Mont. at 93, 695 P.2d at 466. \u201cIt must be shown that something prevented a full presentation of the cause or an accurate determination on the merits and that for reasons of fairness and equity redress is justified.\u201d <em>Lussy, </em>215 Mont. at 93, 695 P.2d at 466; <em>accord In re Marriage of Markegard, </em>2006 MT 111, \u00b6 16, 332 Mont. 187, \u00b6 16, 136 P.3d 532, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">\u00b623  Given these requirements, we conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s motion to reopen the declaratory judgment action. As stated in <em>Waters, </em>\u201cbefore a party will be allowed to modify a final judgment under Rule 60(b)(6), <em>he must first show that none of the other five reasons in Rule 60(b) apply.\u201d Waters, </em>223 Mont. at 187, 724 P.2d at 729 (emphasis added). Moose\u2019s and Vogt, however, have never argued at any point during the course of this case that none of the first five subsections of Rule 60(b) apply. For this reason alone, their Rule 60(b)(6) motion should have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\u00b624 Inexplicably, however, neither Essex nor the District Court addressed Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s oversight. Rather, in responding to Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s motion, Essex proceeded directly with an analysis of the merits of the motion, and the District Court followed suit. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that Moose\u2019s and Vogt were required by well-established caselaw to show, first, that that none of the other five reasons in Rule 60(b) apply, <em>Waters, </em>223 Mont. at 187, 724 P.2d at 729, we will address the merits of their motion under subsection (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u00b625 A successful Rule 60(b)(6) motion requires that the movant demonstrate each of the following elements: (1) extraordinary circumstances; (2) the movant acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable period of time; and (3) the movant was blameless. <em>In re Paternity of C.T.E.-H., </em>2004 MT 307, \u00b6 45, 323 Mont. 498, \u00b6 45, 101 P.3d 254, \u00b6 45 (citing <em>Bahm v. Southworth, </em>2000 MT 244, \u00b6 14, 301 Mont. 434, \u00b6 14, 10 P.3d 99, \u00b6 14).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">\u00b626 With respect to element (1), Essex argues that Moose\u2019s and Vogt failed to establish that the circumstances of this case were so extraordinary as to warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6). According to Essex, Moose\u2019s and Vogt \u201chad the opportunity, and were clearly entitled, to appeal the summary judgment determination which the district court rendered to Essex\u201d; however, they did not do so. Thus, Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s \u201c \u2018voluntary, deliberate, free, [and] untrammeled choice\u2019 \u201d not to appeal the District Court\u2019s summary judgment determination establishes that the requisite extraordinary circumstances do not exist in this case (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Ackermann v. United States, </em>340 U.S. 193, 200, 71 S. Ct. 209, 212 (1950)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u00b627 In response, Moose\u2019s and Vogt reiterate that the District Court held in the declaratory judgment action that Essex had no duty to defend or indemnify them because Yarde\u2019s injury occurred as the result of a non-accidental assault and battery, but the jury found in Yarde\u2019s lawsuit that Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy were negligent. Moose\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and Vogt argue that these are \u201cinconsistent judgments\u201d that establish extraordinary circumstances for purposes of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Moose\u2019s and Vogt also maintain that the \u201cactual controversy\u2019 between them and Essex in the declaratory judgment action was whether the exclusions in the policy precluded coverage for assault and battery, whereas the controversy after the jury verdict in the Yarde lawsuit \u201cwas whether there was coverage for negligence.\u201d They argue that this distinction, in addition, \u201cpresented the requisite extraordinary circumstances to the trial court to reopen the declaratory judgment action under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">\u00b628 We disagree. The circumstances of this case are not so extraordinary as to warrant relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(6). The thrust of Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s argument is that the District Court made an erroneous factual determination in the original declaratory judgment action-namely, that the altercation between Yarde, Vogt, and Severy involved an assault (\u201ceither Vogt assaulted Yarde, Yarde assaulted Vogt, or Severy and Yarde assaulted each other and Vogt tried to suppress it, or some combination of all three events occurred\u201d). Moose\u2019s and Vogt seek to challenge that factual determination by way of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion; in other words, it appears that they have invoked Rule 60(b)(6) either as a substitute for an appeal they wish they had taken from the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Essex in the original declaratory judgment action or as a request to the District Court that it simply make a different factual determination. These are improper uses of a Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">\u00b629 \u201cGenerally, failure to appeal for almost any reason is fatal to a motion to reopen judgment under R\u00edale 60(b). If allowed, it would in essence make a Rule 60(b) motion a substitute for appeal, which is an improper use of the motion.\u201d <em>Koch v. Billings School Dist. No. 2, </em>253 Mont. 261, 271, 833 P.2d 181, 187 (1992) (citing <em>Donovan v. Graff, </em>248 Mont. 21, 25, 808 P.2d 491, 494 (1991)). In addition, as stated above, a Rule 60(b)(6) motion must contain \u201cmore than a request for rehearing or a request that the District Court change its mind. It must be shown that something prevented a full presentation of the cause or an accurate determination on the merits and that for reasons of fairness and equity redress is justified.\u201d <em>Lussy, </em>215 Mont. at 93, 695 P.2d at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\u00b630 Moose\u2019s and Vogt have not made such a showing. To the contrary, the record establishes that they had the opportunity to argue, and did argue, during the original declaratory judgment action that there were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>issues of fact as to whether the altercation between Yarde, Vogt, and Severy involved an assault and battery. Moose\u2019s and Vogt have not shown that something prevented them from making a full presentation on this issue. Next, the District Court rejected Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s argument. The court determined that there was, in fact, an assault, and, based on its interpretation of the insurance policy, the court determined that the assault and battery exclusion applied. Moose\u2019s and Vogt have not shown that something prevented the court from making these determinations accurately. Moose\u2019s and Vogt then had the opportunity to appeal the District Court\u2019s determinations; they did not do so, and their suggestion that this opportunity did not arise <em>until </em>the jury found negligence on the part of Moose\u2019s, Vogt, and Severy is without merit. Simply stated, they did not appeal the District Court\u2019s determinations, and they may not use Rule 60(b)(6) to remedy a decision which they now, apparently, regret.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">\u00b631 As for Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s contention that, following the jury\u2019s verdict in Yarde\u2019s lawsuit, the controversy \u201cwas whether there was coverage for negligence,\u201d we note that they were fully aware that negligence was one of Yarde\u2019s theories of recovery. Indeed, in their brief in opposition to Essex\u2019s motion for summary judgment in the original declaratory judgment action, Moose\u2019s and Vogt acknowledged that \u201c[t]he factual situation resulting in the claim against Moose\u2019s could in the final analysis of all factual matters involve either negligence and/or some other intentional act falling short of an assault and battery.\u201d Thus, their claim that the controversy between them and Essex changed following the jury\u2019s verdict is also without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">\u00b632  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Moose\u2019s and Vogt have failed to satisfy the extraordinary circumstances requirement (element (1)) for a successful Rule 60(b)(6) motion. And the same is true of elements (2) and (3). Pursuant to element (2), the movant must demonstrate that he or she \u201cacted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable period of time.\u201d <em>In re Paternity of C.T.E.</em>-H., \u00b6 45. \u201cWhat is a reasonable time will depend on the particular facts of the individual case.\u201d <em>In re Marriage of Waters, </em>223 Mont. at 189, 724 P.2d at 730. Pursuant to element (3), the movant must demonstrate that it was blameless. <em>In re Paternity of C.T.E.-H., </em>\u00b6 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">\u00b633 Moose\u2019s and Vogt have not explicitly addressed either of these elements at any point during the course of this case. Likewise, the District Court did not set forth an analysis of their motion with respect to elements (2) and (3). Rather, the court decided that Moose\u2019s and Vogt had demonstrated that extraordinary circumstances exist in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>case and, therefore, that \u201cit is only fair and equitable to allow [them] to reopen the declaratory judgment action and seek a redetermination of insurance coverage.\u201d This analysis, which omitted the requisite determinations that Moose\u2019s and Vogt had acted to set aside the judgment within a reasonable period of time and were blameless, is insufficient. A party seeking relief from judgment pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6) must demonstrate that its motion satisfies each of the three required elements; in other words, the elements are conjunctive, not disjunctive. Thus, a strong showing of extraordinary circumstances cannot supplant an analysis of timeliness and blamelessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">\u00b634  In sum, Moose\u2019s and Vogt have failed to satisfy any of the three elements of a successful Rule 60(b)(6) motion. Their Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the District Court\u2019s judgment in the original declaratory judgment action, therefore, fails on the merits and the District Court, accordingly, abused its discretion in granting that motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">\u00b635 Moose\u2019s and Vogt have not established that they are entitled to relief under M. R. Civ. P. 60(b)(6). Not only have they failed to address the first five subsections of the rule, as required by our caselaw, but their motion also fails on the merits, since they have failed to establish the existence of extraordinary circumstances, that their motion was timely, and that they were blameless. Accordingly, we hold that the District Court abused its discretion in granting Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion for relief from the court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of Essex in the original declaratory judgment action. We therefore vacate all orders entered by the District Court after it granted said motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">\u00b636 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b457-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER and COTTER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b449-6\"> Severy did not join in Moose\u2019s and Vogt\u2019s Rule 60(b)(6) motion and is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-4\"> In <em>In re Marriage of Zacher, </em>2004 MT 249, 323 Mont. 54, 98 P.3d 309, the appellant had filed a motion under Ride 60(b)(4), which was deemed denied by operation of law. <em>Zacher, </em>\u00b6 5. We stated that our standard of review under these circumstances was abuse of discretion. <em>See Zacher, </em>\u00b6 <em>7; see also Bragg v.

For the reasons discussed above, however, our review of a district court\u2019s decision to set aside a void judgment is de novo.

Assoc. Financial Services Co., </em>2004 MT 397, \u00b6 31, 325 Mont. 290, \u00b6 31, 104 P.3d 1080, \u00b6 31; <em>In re Marriage of Zacher, </em>2004 MT 249, \u00b6 7, 323 Mont. 54, \u00b6 7, 98 P.3d 309, \u00b6 7; <em>Calcaterra v.

The <em>Lords </em>standards, however, are based on the policy considerations identified in that case with respect to default judgments and should not be applied universally. <em>See Lords, </em>212 Mont. at 365-66, 688 P.2d at 294 (noting that there is no one set standard of review to be applied in all cases). We therefore overrule <em>Wombold, </em>\u00b6 31, <em>Zacher, </em>\u00b6 7, <em>Calcaterra, </em>\u00b6 7, and <em>Wright Oil &amp; Tire, </em>284 Mont. at 10, 942 P.2d at 130, to the extent they state or suggest that the <em>Lords </em>standards apply to all Rule 60(b) motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b454-8\"> In <em>Peak Development, LLP v. Juntunen, </em>2005 MT 82, 326 Mont. 409, 110 P.3d 13, we stated that Rule 60(b)(6) was \u201cinapplicable\u201d because \u201cgross neglect or actual misconduct by Juntuneris attorney are not issues here, as required under Rule 60(b)(6).\u201d <em>Peak Development, </em>\u00b6 17. Rule 60(b)(6), however, does not require gross neglect or actual misconduct on the part of the movant\u2019s attorney in all cases. Rather, this requirement applies only in cases where the basis of the Rule 60(b)(6) motion is an alleged error by the movant\u2019s attorney. <em>See e.g. Skogen, </em>\u00b6 13; Bahm, \u00b6 14. Thus, for clarification, we overrule \u00b6 17 of <em>Peak Development </em>to the extent it suggests otherwise.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b457-11\"> Given our holding here, it is unnecessary to address Essex\u2019s alternative argument that the doctrine of res judicata bars Moose\u2019s and Vogt from bringing their Rule 60(b)(6) motion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b457-9\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AR5\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">\u00b637 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision for the reasons stated therein, and also because of the manner in which the personal injury case was actually presented to the jury. While Moose\u2019s and Vogt now argue that this was a case of negligence, the fact is that the case was presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>the jury by Yarde and his counsel as one of assault and battery. Yarde testified at trial that he was deliberately shoved and grabbed by Vogt and that his leg was intentionally broken. Yarde\u2019s counsel portrayed the incident as one of jealous rage, telling the jury that the bartender stomped on Yarde\u2019s leg and broke it on purpose because of an affair that had occurred between him and Yarde\u2019s ex-wife. Moreover, the jury specifically found that Vogt had assaulted and battered Yarde and had acted with malice, justifying an award of punitive damages. A punitive damages phase of the trial was then conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">\u00b638 It is true that the jury also found Moose\u2019s negligent. However, notably, the sole line on the verdict form providing for an award of compensatory damages was under a negligence caption. Had Essex been involved in the trial of the case as Moose\u2019s insurer, as it may have been had Moose\u2019s and Vogt appealed the adverse coverage decision, it would have been in a position to object to the manner in which the verdict form was presented to the jury. However, Essex was not in the case, having been long since relieved of the obligation to appear and defend, and the time for appeal having expired. Thus, the parties were free to fashion the verdict form as they saw fit, and then free to later allege that the finding of negligence had changed everything. Essex, on the other hand, stood to be bound to its detriment by a jury decision in which it took no part.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">\u00b639 As the Court notes, extraordinary circumstances must be demonstrated to justify the reopening of a matter under Rule 60(b)(6). It must be shown that something prevented the applicants from fully presenting their case, and that notions of fairness and equity call for redress. \u00b6 29. Here, no extraordinary circumstances exist. This case was always about an assault and battery, and it was presented to the jury by Yarde and his counsel as such. Fairness does not now require the reopening of a coverage decision that was premised upon facts that were actually later proved at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">\u00b640 I therefore concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
