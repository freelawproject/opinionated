A witness to the incident notified the authorities. The Hamilton City Police dispatched Officer Nic Painter (Officer Painter) to the scene. Officer Painter observed that Reavely\u2019s eyes were red and that he smelled like alcohol. Officer Painter asked Reavely for his consent to perform a PAST and Reavely agreed. Reavely\u2019s PAST result indicated that he had a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.136. Officer Painter placed Reavely under arrest for DUI and transported him to the Ravalli County detention center. Officers performed a second breathalyzer test on Reavely at the detention center approximately 21 minutes after Officer Painter had performed the PAST procedure. The results of the second breath test using an Intoxilyzer 5000 indicated that Reavely had a BAC of 0.187.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-14\">\u00b64 The State charged Reavely with felony DUI based on the fact that he had been convicted of DUI on three previous occasions. Reavely entered a plea of not guilty, and the case proceeded to trial on July 26, 2005. Reavely\u2019s counsel argued in his opening statement that he would present evidence that the police had administered two breath tests on Reavely. The State requested a meeting with the court out of the presence of the jury to discuss Reavely\u2019s opening statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>\u00b65 The State raised the concern that it suspected that Reavely intended to compare his PAST result with his Intoxilyzer 5000 result in order to show that his BAC might have been below 0.08 at the time of the accident. The State argued that the court should exclude Reavely\u2019s PAST result from evidence as PAST results had been held inadmissible in <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, 324 Mont. 173, 103 P.3d 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">\u00b66 Reavely\u2019s counsel admitted that <em>Snell </em>precluded the State from using the PAST result as evidence of intoxication. Reavely\u2019s counsel distinguished Reavely\u2019s facts, however, from the facts in <em>Snell. </em>He argued that Reavely did not seek to use the PAST result to prove evidence of intoxication. Reavely\u2019s counsel wanted to compare the PAST result with the Intoxilyzer 5000 result in order to establish that Reavely\u2019s BAC had been rising at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b67 The court determined that Reavely\u2019s argument assumed the accuracy of the PAST result. The court ruled that it would exclude the PAST result unless Reavely first established a foundation on which to admit the PAST result. Reavely objected for the record. Reavely made no attempt during trial to establish a foundation for admitting the PAST result. The jury found Reavely guilty of DUI and the court sentenced Reavely on October 20, 2005. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling for an abuse of discretion. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it decided to exclude the result from Reavely\u2019s preliminary alcohol screening test?</em></p>\n<p id=\"ApW\">\u00b610 Reavely argues that the court should have admitted his PAST result for the sole purpose of establishing that his BAC was rising at the time of the accident. He points out that the Intoxilyzer 5000 indicated that his BAC was 0.187 approximately 21 minutes after his PAST result had indicated that his BAC was 0.136. Reavely argues that the jury could have inferred from these results that his BAC was rising after the accident and, thus, that his BAC might have been below 0.08 at the time he was driving.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">\u00b611  We have held that a party must establish that a defendant\u2019s PAST result is accurate and reliable before the PAST may be admitted as evidence of a defendant\u2019s BAC. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 25, 328 Mont. 276, \u00b6 25, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 25. The party seeking to admit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>the PAST must establish this foundation of accuracy and reliability with expert testimony as governed by M. R. Evid. 702. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 25. \u00b612 Reavely concedes that the State must establish a foundation of accuracy and reliability before it can admit a PAST result as evidence of a defendant\u2019s BAC. He \u201cwholeheartedly agrees,\u201d in fact, that a PAST result represents an unreliable and inaccurate method of measuring a defendant\u2019s BAC. Reavely insists, however, that the accuracy of his PAST result is \u201cnot the core issue\u201d because he does not seek to prove that his BAC is accurate \u201cto a degree that it can be relied upon to establish the BAC level of a Montana citizen for purposes of proof of intoxication ....\u201d Reavely points out that he wants only to \u201cestablish reasonable doubt that Reavely had a BAC greater than 0.08 at the time he was driving.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">\u00b613 The reliability and accuracy of the PAST test is critical, however, to Reavely\u2019s theory. Reavely\u2019s BAC, in reality, may have been much less than or much greater than his PAST result indicated. Reavely\u2019s actual BAC at the time when Officer Painter administered the PAST might have shown, for example, that his BAC was rising if it had been less than 0.187, holding steady if it had been close to 0.187, or falling if it had been greater than 0.187.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">\u00b614 The PAST result is thus irrelevant to the fact that Reavely seeks to prove-that his BAC had been trending upward-as his admittedly \u201cunreliable\u201d PAST result does not tend to establish that any one of these trends was more probable than the other. M. R. Evid. 401. Reavely needed to provide a foundation that his PAST had been a sufficiently accurate representation of his BAC so that it was relevant to his theory. Reavely has not done so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">\u00b615 Reavely argues next that he sought to offer his PAST result only to raise a reasonable doubt that his BAC had been greater than 0.08 at the time that he had been driving. He contends that it is unfair to require him to demonstrate the accuracy of his PAST result to establish reasonable doubt when courts permit the State to use a PAST result \u201cwithout relating the actual numbers to show probable cause to arrest....\u201d Reavely\u2019s analogy to probable cause hearings lacks merit. The rules of evidence do not govern probable cause determinations by a judge or the police. <em>See e.g., Hart v. Parks, </em>450 F.3d 1059, 1066 (9th Cir. 2006); <em>State v. Beaupre, </em>2004 MT 300, \u00b6 48, 323 Mont. 413, \u00b6 48, 102 P.3d 504, \u00b6 48 (holding that hearsay may be used to establish probable cause). Moreover, by his own admission, Reavely does intend to relate the \u201cactual numbers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">\u00b616 Reavely also mischaracterizes the purpose for which he sought to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>admit the PAST result. Reavely did not merely propose to admit the number that Officer Painter observed on the PAST screen to help establish reasonable doubt. Reavely also would have asked the jury to assume that the number Officer Painter observed actually represented Reavely\u2019s BAC within some degree of accuracy. Officer Painter had no personal knowledge, however, of Reavely\u2019s BAC. Officer Painter only knew what he saw on the PAST screen. Reavely needed to offer expert testimony in order to establish that the number that Officer Painter saw on the screen actually represented Reavely\u2019s BAC within some degree of accuracy and reliability. M. R. Evid. 602, 701, 703; <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 25. Reavely did not present any experts at trial and does not argue on appeal that he would have presented an expert at trial if he had been given the opportunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b617  Reavely sought to use his PAST result to prove that his BAC was within a certain range of values, yet he made no attempt to establish a foundation at trial showing that his PAST result had been an accurate representation of his BAC within any degree of accuracy. We have never held that a court or jury may assume, as a matter of law, that a PAST result is a reliable representation of a defendant\u2019s BAC within any particular degree of accuracy. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25-29. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in excluding Reavely\u2019s PAST result under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b177-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b177-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AEF\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">\u00b619 I agree with Reavely\u2019s more general assertion that he should be able to use the PAST result to establish reasonable doubt. Our holding here would have left Reavely free to do so. He could have used his PAST result for impeachment or to call into question any number of facts that might have helped him establish reasonable doubt. Our holding would not have prevented Reavely, for example, from asking Officer Painter to testify to the PAST result that he observed on the PAST screen. The PAST result on the screen was within Officer Painter\u2019s personal knowledge and he was free to tell the jury what he saw, absent some evidentiary objection. M. R. Evid. 602. Reavely would have been free to incorporate Officer Painter\u2019s testimony into his closing argument to help establish reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">\u00b620 As the Opinion notes, however, Reavely was not merely seeking to argue to the jury that Officer Painter observed 0.136 on the PAST screen. Rather, he sought to affirmatively argue that the number 0.136 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>actually represented Reavely\u2019s BAC. This proposition requires testimony from an expert witness.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b178-4\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"Atk\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">\u00b621 I concur with the opinion of the Court. I must respectfully disagree with the concurrence of Justice Leaphart. While what was shown on the PSAT screen was within the officer\u2019s personal knowledge, and thus satisfies the requirement of M. R. Evid. 602 that a witness may testify to those things within his personal knowledge, Rule 602 is expressly made subject to the requirements of M. R. Evid. 703, concerning the basis of an expert\u2019s knowledge and opinion. Thus, in order for the officer to testify as to the actual number shown on the PSAT screen, a proper foundation would be required.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">\u00b622 Without a proper foundation, the number is inadmissible to prove its veracity. The number has no relevance other than its veracity, as it tends to prove nothing other than blood alcohol content. M. R. Evid. 401. It follows that, unless the proper foundation is laid and the PSAT is admitted into evidence, there is no legitimate argument that can be made using the number shown on the screen.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b178-7\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"Ajb\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">\u00b623 I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to impose upon Reavely the burden of demonstrating that the State\u2019s PAST evidence was reliable. In my view, Reavely was entitled to present the PAST evidence in support of his reasonable-doubt argument without first having to present the same proof of reliability that we require when the State seeks to use PAST evidence to carry its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">\u00b624 After leaving the Eagle\u2019s Club on the evening in question, Reavely attempted to back his pickup truck out of a diagonal parking space on Pinckney Street. In the process, his truck scraped a vehicle in an adjacent parking space. Reavely remained at the scene and Officer Painter arrived several minutes later. Approximately sixty minutes after this accident, Officer Painter administered a PAST, also known as a preliminary breath test (\u201cPBT\u201d), which indicated that Reavely\u2019s BAC was approximately 0.136. Then, roughly twenty-one minutes later, and after he had arrested Reavely, Officer Painter administered the Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test which measured Reavely\u2019s BAC at 0.187.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">\u00b625 At trial, the State introduced the results of the Intoxilyzer 5000 breath test as evidence that Reavely\u2019s BAC was above 0.08 when he attempted to drive away from the Eagle\u2019s Club. Reavely did not dispute that his BAC was substantially above the legal limit when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>two breath tests were administered. Nor did he dispute the accuracy of either of the breath test results. Rather, he attempted to demonstrate that the jury could find a reasonable doubt as to whether his BAC had reached 0.08 at the time when he attempted to back his truck out of the parking space, over an hour before the Intoxilyzer 5000 test result was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b626 To that end, Reavely\u2019s counsel solicited testimony from Ben Vetter (\u2018Vetter\u201d), an employee of the Breath Analysis Section of the Montana State Crime Lab. Vetter is a certified technician of the portable and non-portable breath analysis instruments used by Montana law enforcement agencies. Additionally, he conducts training at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy regarding, inter aha: (1) the proper operation of portable and non-portable breath analysis instruments approved for use in Montana; and (2) pharmacology and toxicology, including scientific explanation regarding the process by which alcohol is absorbed into the blood and the resulting impairment of one\u2019s faculties.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b627 Vetter testified that a person\u2019s BAC does not reach a peak immediately after alcohol consumption; rather, BAC rises over a period of time based on a number of factors unique to the individual. Vetter also acknowledged that in certain circumstances it is possible for a person to drink three or four alcoholic beverages in a short period of time and then drive a vehicle for up to five minutes without suffering from the impairing effects of the alcohol. Additionally, Reavely testified that it takes only four minutes to drive from the Eagle\u2019s Club to his home, and that he did not believe he was impaired when he entered his truck on the night in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">\u00b628 Reavely\u2019s counsel argued that the State\u2019s evidence did not dispel reasonable doubt that Reavely\u2019s BAC had been below the legal limit at the time of the accident and then had gradually risen to the level detected by the Intoxilyzer 5000. In support of this argument, and in conjunction with the aforementioned evidence, Reavely\u2019s counsel sought to introduce the result of the PBT administered by Officer Painter. However, as counsel explained to the District Court, he did not seek to present the PBT result as an accurate indicator of Reavely\u2019s BAC. Rather, contrary to the assertion of Justice Leaphart in his concurrence, Reavely merely sought to present the PBT result as a broad estimate which the jury could contrast with the significantly higher result rendered approximately twenty-one minutes later by the Intoxilyzer 5000 test. Based on this comparative analysis, counsel argued, he would ask the jury to consider the possibility that Reavely\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>post-accident BAC was rising in a manner that could indicate his BAC may have been below 0.08 when the accident actually occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u00b629 The State argued that PBT results are inadmissible per se under this Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, 324 Mont. 173, 103 P.3d 503. Specifically, the State argued: \u201cPBTs have been held to not be admissible.... [I]t\u2019s, per se, not admissible. And that\u2019s what the Supreme Court found in <em>Snell\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b630 In fact, we did not create any such \u201cper se\u201d rule in <em>Snell. </em>Rather, we simply held that the PBT result in that case was inadmissible because the State offered it for the purpose of proving the defendant\u2019s BAC, and the State failed to demonstrate that the PBT result was reliable. <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 37-38, 43. Yet, the District Court apparently agreed that <em>Snell </em>creates a \u201cper se\u201d rule of inadmissibility, concluding that admission of the PBT result would create \u201ca test case to overturn the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Snell.\u201d </em>Thus, the District Court ruled that the PBT result was not admissible for any purpose.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u00b631 We have consistently held that a PBT result is not admissible as evidence of guilt in a DUI prosecution unless it is first shown to be rehable. <em>State v. Weldele, </em>2003 MT 117, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 315 Mont. 452, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58, 69 P.3d 1162, \u00b6\u00b6 57-58; <em>State v. Crawford, </em>2003 MT 118, \u00b6 20, 315 Mont. 480, \u00b6 20, 68 P.3d 848, \u00b6 20; <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 35-38 (\u201c[T]he State has the burden of offering scientific and expert testimony to firmly establish the [PBT\u2019s] reliability and accuracy.\u201d). It is entirely appropriate that this burden of proof is triggered by the State\u2019s use of PBT results because a DUI prosecution directly implicates a fundamental constitutional right of the citizen being charged-i.e., the right to due process. Due process requires that a defendant must be presumed innocent at every stage of the trial, and that the State must prove each element of the charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt in order to overcome the presumption of innocence. Section 46-16-204, MCA; <em>State v. Newman, </em>2005 MT 348, \u00b6 26, 330 Mont. 160, \u00b6 26, 127 P.3d 374, \u00b6 26; <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 24, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 24, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 24; <em>State v. Gilbert, </em>125 Mont. 104, 109, 232 P.2d 338, 341 (1951) (\u201cThe presumption of innocence surrounds the defendant at every step in the trial and to its benefits he is entitled in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>the determination of every fact by the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b632 The due process guarantee simply does not allow a DUI prosecution to proceed upon evidence that is not demonstrably reliable. Thus, because the defendant is presumptively innocent, and because the State bears the burden of presenting proof that dispels all reasonable doubt, the State must present affirmative proof of reliability before utilizing a PBT result as evidence of intoxication. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 57-58; <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 20; <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 35. Without such proof of reliability, there is a risk that the trial could be fundamentally unfair-i.e., a risk that the defendant could be found guilty based on an inaccurate PBT result. <em>Crawford, </em>\u00b6 18; <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 55, 57 (because jurors tend to accord great weight to evidence that is scientific in nature, PBT results could be the determining factor in a finding of guilt).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b633 This brings us to one of the most basic tenets of evidence law-the principle that admissibility of a particular piece of evidence must be determined in light of the purpose for which that evidence is offered. <em>See State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 34, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 34, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 34; <em>McDermott v. Carie, LLC, </em>2005 MT 293, \u00b6 20, 329 Mont. 295, \u00b6 20, 124 P.3d 168, \u00b6 20; M. R. Evid. 105. Indeed, \u201c[n]o issue concerning the admissibility of evidence can be resolved without answering[:] What is the purpose of the evidence being offered?\u201d David P. Leonard, <em>The New Wigmore: Selected Rules of Limited Admissibility </em>\u00a7 1.1 (rev. ed., Aspen Publishers 2002). It is well established, in the Montana Rules of Evidence and our precedents, that a piece of evidence may be categorically inadmissible when offered for one purpose, and yet be admissible in the same proceeding when offered for a different purpose. For example, evidence of other crimes committed by a defendant is not admissible for the purpose of proving character in order to show action in conformity therewith; however, that evidence is admissible for other limited purposes such as proving motive. M. R. Evid. 404(b). Similarly, a defendant\u2019s statements made in connection with a guilty plea that was later withdrawn are generally inadmissible as evidence against that defendant; however, they are admissible when offered for the limited purpose of impeachment. M. R. Evid. 410.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>\u00b634 While we have consistently held that PBT results are inadmissible without affirmative proof of reliability, we have applied that rule only in cases in which the PBT evidence is offered <em>by the State </em>for the purpose of proving guilt. However, the very reasons for the existence of this admissibility rule demonstrate that it should not apply where the PBT evidence is offered <em>by the defendant </em>and for a different, more limited purpose. Reavely\u2019s proposed use of the PBT evidence did not implicate any constitutional protections applicable in criminal trials; it was not offered in satisfaction of any burden of proof; and it was not offered for the purpose of overcoming any constitutionally mandated presumptions. Moreover, Reavely\u2019s proposed use of the PBT result could not possibly have caused any prejudice to the State because, as we have held, when an Intoxilyzer test result indicating an illegally high BAC has been admitted at trial, the admission of a PBT result also showing an illegally high BAC is merely redundant and therefore non-prejudicial. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">\u00b635 Thus, because each of the reasons for the existence of this admissibility rule is inapposite here, where the PBT result was offered for a limited purpose not contemplated by any of our precedents, the burden to prove reliability should not apply to Reavely\u2019s proposed use of the PBT evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b636 As noted above, Reavely sought to introduce the PBT result as nothing more than an estimate of his BAC roughly twenty-one minutes before the Intoxilyzer 5000 test was conducted. He expressly did not seek to establish any particular BAC level with this evidence, nor did he even seek to affirmatively \u201cprove\u201d that his BAC level was rising. Indeed, he was presumed innocent and therefore had no burden to \u201cprove\u201d anything at all.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rather, he simply sought to use the PBT evidence as an estimate in support of his reasonable-doubt argument-i.e., the argument that even though his BAC was in fact illegally high after the accident, the State\u2019s evidence did not dispel reasonable doubt that his BAC may have been below the legal limit at the time the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">\u00b637 Montana\u2019s statutes, Administrative Rules, and this Court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>decisions recognize that a PBT result is in fact an estimate of BAC. <em>See </em>\u00a7 61-8-409(1), MCA (the purpose of a PBT is \u201cestimating the person\u2019s alcohol concentration\u201d); Admin. R. M. 23.4.201(8)(b), (26) (PBT instruments \u201cprovide an estimated value of alcohol concentration\u201d); <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 6, 50. Accordingly, Reavely\u2019s counsel expressly indicated to the District Court that he would not introduce the PBT result as an indicator of any specific BAC level, but merely as an estimate or a broad range within which Reavely\u2019s BAC fell. Further, counsel expressly recognized that PBT results are not \u201caccurate\u201d and indicated that he would communicate that fact to the jury. In short, Reavely sought to present the PBT evidence as precisely what the law recognizes it to be-an <em>estimate </em>of his BAC.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b638 Our precedent acknowledges that the estimate rendered by a PBT is reliable enough for certain purposes. As we have recognized, in determining whether probable cause exists to justify a warrantless arrest, law enforcement officers may rely on PBT results along with other factors such as the officer\u2019s own observations and the suspect\u2019s performance in field sobriety tests. <em>State v. Ditton, </em>2006 MT 235, \u00b6 54, 333 Mont. 483, \u00b6 54, 144 P.3d 783, \u00b6 54. In fact, PBT results may be a critical factor in determining whether probable cause exists for a warrantless arrest. <em>See State v. Feldbrugge, </em>2002 MT 154, \u00b6\u00b6 5-11, 310 Mont. 368, \u00b6\u00b6 5-11, 50 P.3d 1067, \u00b6\u00b6 5-11 (where the defendant was stopped for exceeding the speed limit and was not asked to perform any field sobriety tests, the PBT result of 0.197 was the deciding factor in the officer\u2019s determination that probable cause existed after the defendant \u201cadmitted having had a couple of drinks\u201d and the officer observed, among other things, that the defendant smelled of alcohol, his speech was slurred, and his eyes appeared bloodshot and glassy). \u00b639 Here, Officer Painter relied in part on the PBT result in determining that probable cause existed to justify a warrantless arrest of Reavely. Additionally, the State further relied on the PBT result by citing it as evidence in support of its motion for leave to file the DUI charge against Reavely. Yet, despite this reliance, and despite the fact that the State is required by law to take extensive measures to ensure PBT reliability,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the State nonetheless insists that the burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>demonstrating reliability-which we have traditionally imposed only where the State uses PBT evidence for the purpose of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt-must somehow shift to Reavely in this case. However, we have never held-before today-that a party must establish PBT reliability when the test result is offered for some purpose other than proving guilt. Moreover, as Reavely clearly indicated at trial, he would not have asked the jury to rely on the PBT result to any greater extent than the State itself had already relied on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b640 Given that the State is legally required to ensure PBT reliability by adhering to the stringent Administrative Rules, and given that the State relied on the PBT result to arrest Reavely without a warrant, thereby implicating his constitutional liberty interest (the right to be free from unreasonable seizure, Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 11), I conclude that it is fundamentally unfair to require that Reavely demonstrate the PBT\u2019s reliability when he sought to introduce the test result solely as an estimate of BAC for the limited purpose of making a comparison supporting his reasonable-doubt argument. After all, the PBT result is the State\u2019s own evidence-the State certified Officer Painter and the PBT instrument, the State conducted the PBT through Officer Painter, and the State relied on the test result to justify a warrantless arrest of Reavely. Thus, in my view, this evidence should not be withheld from the jury simply because Reavely did not prove its reliability in the same way the State must do so to carry its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b641 As this Court indicated in <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 27, 328 Mont. 276, \u00b6 27, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 27, one of the factors establishing the reliability of a particular PBT result is the State\u2019s conformance with the administrative rule requiring proper calibration of the PBT instrument on a regular basis-i.e., monthly calibration to within a 10% margin of error. Admin. R. M. 23.4.213(2)(b). This Court has held that \u201ca defendant charged with driving under the influence of alcohol is entitled to the procedural safeguards contained within the administrative rules.\u201d <em>State v. Woods, </em>285 Mont. 124, 127, 947 P.2d 62, 63 (1997) (internal citations omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In my view, if we are to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>faithfully adhere to the principle that a defendant is \u201centitled to the procedural safeguards contained within the administrative rules,\u201d we must not saddle the defendant with the burden of affirmatively establishing that the State conformed to those rules, particularly where the State has already relied on the PBT result to establish probable cause for a warrantless arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b642 Finally, in addition to disagreeing with the Court\u2019s decision today, I also take issue with the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Damon </em>because our decision in that case is internally inconsistent. In <em>Damon, </em>this Court addressed the State\u2019s use of PBT evidence to prove guilt, and in doing so, repeatedly emphasized the rule that \u201cit is better to admit relevant scientific evidence in the same manner as other expert testimony and allow its weight to be attacked by cross-examination and refutation.\u201d <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 19, 28 (citations omitted). Based on this rule, the Court held that questions regarding whether a particular PBT result is reliable go to the weight of the evidence and <em>not </em>to its admissibility. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 24. However, the Court then proceeded to hold that a PBT result must be shown to be reliable <em>before it is admissible </em>in evidence. <em>Damon, </em>\u00b6 25. Of course, if this is so, then questions regarding the PBT\u2019s reliability do in fact go directly to the issue of admissibility, contrary to the Court\u2019s holding in \u00b6 24 of <em>Damon.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b643 I dissented in <em>Damon, </em>and will not reiterate my disagreement with the outcome of that case here. However, I urge the Court to address this internal inconsistency in <em>Damon, </em>as currently, the decision can be legitimately cited for diametrically opposed rules regarding PBT evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b644 Returning to the present case, I conclude in summary that Reavely was entitled to present the PBT evidence as an estimate of his BAC-which is in fact how it is recognized under our law-in support of his reasonable-doubt argument, without first having to present the same proof of reliability that we require when the State seeks to use PBT evidence to carry its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, Reavely\u2019s proposed use of the PBT evidence for a limited purpose-i.e., not to affirmatively \u201cprove\u201d anything, but to merely support his reasonable-doubt argument-did not implicate any of the concerns that prompted us to initially require the State to prove PBT reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b645 Moreover, given that the State is required by law to take extensive measures to ensure PBT reliability, and given that the State relied on the PBT result in this case to arrest Reavely without a warrant, Reavely should not now be required to prove that the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>complied with its legal obligations to ensure PBT reliability. Indeed, we have repeatedly held that a defendant charged with DUI is entitled to the benefit of the Administrative Rules that require the State to ensure PBT reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b646 Finally, I note again what is perhaps the clearest guidance from our precedents indicating the proper outcome of this decision: the State could not have been prejudiced by Reavely\u2019s use of the PBT result because that evidence was merely redundant of the Intoxilyzer 5000 test result. <em>Weldele, </em>\u00b6 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b647 For these reasons, I conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in precluding Reavely from utilizing the PBT result in support of his reasonable-doubt argument. Further, I conclude that the court\u2019s decision constitutes reversible error because it deprived Reavely of \u201ca meaningful opportunity to present a complete defense.\u201d <em>See California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485, 104 S. Ct. 2528, 2532 (1984). Reavely was wrongly denied the opportunity to solicit, by way of cross-examination, Officer Painter\u2019s testimony as to the PBT result. Denying a defendant the opportunity to conduct effective cross-examination amounts to \u201cconstitutional error of the first magnitude and no amount of showing of want of prejudice w[ill] cure it.\u201d <em>See Davis v. Alaska, </em>415 U.S. 308, 318, 94 S. Ct. 1105, 1111 (1974) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b648 Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b186-7\">JUSTICE NELSON joins in the dissent of JUSTICE COTTER.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-7\"> The District Court expressly prohibited any reference whatsoever to the PBT result, stating: \u201cthe PBT test results [are] inadmissible and they shouldn\u2019t be referred to as far as numbers or otherwise.\u201d Because this Court affirms the District Court\u2019s ruling, I disagree with the assertion in Justice Leaphart\u2019s concurrence that our decision \u201cwould not have prevented Reavely, for example, from asking Officer Painter to testify to the PAST result that he observed on the PAST screen.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b181-6\"> There are numerous other examples of evidence that is inadmissible for certain purposes but admissible for other purposes, including: evidence of subsequent remedial measures, M.
