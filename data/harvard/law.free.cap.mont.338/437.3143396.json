We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u00b62 Tuttle served as a Training and Research Section Supervisor for MHP from August 2001 through his suspension in January 2006. He supervised the training of highway patrol cadets at the Montana Law Enforcement Academy. Captain Butch Huseby (Captain Huseby) supervised Tuttle during the events at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">\u00b63 Tuttle traveled from Helena to Missoula in December of 2005 to conduct testing for MHP applicants. Trooper Tamara Winchell assisted Tuttle with the training in Missoula. She was stationed in Hamilton at the time. Tuttle submitted a request to Captain Huseby for reimbursement for his round trip from Helena to Missoula. The request indicated, to Captain Huseby\u2019s surprise, that Tuttle had stayed overnight at a hotel in Hamilton. Captain Huseby approved the request, but asked Tuttle why he would travel 86 miles out of his way to stay in Hamilton instead of driving back to Helena or staying overnight in Missoula. Tuttle responded that he had decided not to return to Helena after the testing in light of the icy roads and his own fatigue. Tuttle claimed that he stayed in Hamilton rather than Missoula to save money on lodging. Tuttle also mentioned that he had dinner with Trooper Winchell while in Hamilton. Captain Huseby investigated Tuttle\u2019s explanations and found that hotel rooms in Missoula cost roughly eight dollars per night more than rooms in Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">\u00b64 Captain Huseby believed that Tuttle\u2019s explanation regarding his trip to Hamilton lacked credibility. He decided to conduct a further investigation of Tuttle. Captain Huseby inquired specifically into another hotel room that Tuttle had charged to MHP on behalf of Trooper Kristine Welker (Trooper Welker).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">\u00b65 Captain Huseby discovered that MHP had ordered Trooper Welker to travel to Helena for training in February of 2005. MHP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>directed Trooper Welker to stay at the Law Enforcement Academy. Tuttle intervened, however, and reserved a hotel room for Trooper Welker at the Hampton Inn. Tuttle claimed, for various reasons, that he could not grant Trooper Welker access to a room at the Law Enforcement Academy. Tuttle later admitted that he had a master key that would have allowed him to assist Trooper Welker in gaining access to a room at the Law Enforcement Academy.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">\u00b66 Captain Huseby\u2019s investigation revealed that Tuttle had spent the evening with Trooper Welker after picking her up from the Hampton Inn. Tuttle learned over the course of the evening that Trooper Welker needed money for rent so she could move out of her husband\u2019s house. Tuttle offered to loan her the money. Tuttle returned to Trooper Welker\u2019s hotel room later that night with some of the promised money. Trooper Welker told Captain Huseby that Tuttle had tried to kiss her before he left her room.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">\u00b67 Trooper Welker informed Captain Huseby that Tuttle later had threatened to end her career with MHP if she did not end her relationship with another trooper. Trooper Welker explained that Tuttle had warned her, when she was a cadet, that he had power over her initial placements and subsequent career.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\u00b68 Captain Huseby further learned that Tuttle had made similar representations to other cadets. Tuttle asked personal questions regarding the cadets\u2019 families, finances, and marriages. He indicated that he would use their answers to make his determination on their placement. Tuttle had no power to make decisions or recommendations regarding any cadet\u2019s placement. Tuttle also had represented falsely to female cadets that MHP had a policy of prohibiting placement of women in single station assignments or on Indian reservations.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">\u00b69 Tuttle issued orders in July of2005 for Trooper Welker and Tuttle to attend a \u201cwomen in law enforcement\u201d conference in Colorado. He sought to extend their stay past the end of the conference for \u201csightseeing.\u201d Tuttle represented to MHP, however, that he needed to extend the trip so that he could attend a banquet to be held on the evening of the last day of the conference. MHP discovered that the conference featured no such banquet after Trooper Welker showed her superiors a pamphlet explaining the conference dates. MHP denied Tuttle\u2019s request for an extra day in Colorado. Tuttle canceled his trip with Trooper Welker. Tuttle had by this time begun referring to Trooper Welker as \u201cfat ass\u201d while the two were on duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\u00b610 MHP charged Tuttle with multiple instances of misconduct in the course of his employment. MHP held a hearing on April 11-12, 2006. MHP determined that Tuttle had violated several of MHP\u2019s General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Regulations on Obedience and Conduct. MHP found, specifically, that Tuttle had misappropriated state resources, committed sexual harassment, lied to investigators, and generally lacked the integrity and honesty necessary to serve in the MHP. MHP concluded that the \u201cforegoing conduct constitutes cause for discharge of Sgt. Tuttle from the Highway Patrol under Montana Code Annotated \u00a7 44-1-612.\u201d Section 44-1-612, MCA, lists various causes for suspension, demotion, or discharge of a highway patrol officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">\u00b611 Tuttle appealed to the District Court. He argued that the record failed to support MHP\u2019s order and that MHP had made errors of law. The District Court concluded that substantial evidence supported MHP\u2019s findings of fact and that its decision to terminate Tuttle was correct. Tuttle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">\u00b612 We review MHP\u2019s administrative decision to determine whether it correctly interpreted the law and whether its findings are clearly erroneous. <em>City of Billings Police Dept. v. Owen, </em>2006 MT 16, \u00b6 12, 331 Mont. 10, \u00b6 12, 127 P.3d 1044, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">\u00b613 Tuttle challenges only MHP\u2019s conclusions of law. Tuttle does not challenge the findings of MHP on appeal. He points out that the Montana Operations Manual on Progressive Discipline as found at Admin R. M. 2.21.65 (2005), governs MHP\u2019s disciplinary decisions. He argues that, pursuant to these governing regulations, he should have been subjected to progressive discipline, instead of immediate termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">\u00b614 Admin. R. M. 2.21.6509(2) (2005), provides that \u201c[m]anagement shall, when appropriate, use progressive discipline.\u201d The regulation continues to state that \u201cthe appropriateness of using progressive discipline in each case lies within the discretion of management.\u201d The regulation states, however, that \u201c[discharge should not be an initial disciplinary action except in severe cases or unsatisfactory performance or behavior that disrupts agency operations.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u00b615 Tuttle argues that Admin. R. M. 2.21.6509(2) (2005), requires a single incident of egregious behavior. He argues that MHP lumped together a number of minor incidents to support its conclusion to discharge him rather than subjecting him to some lesser form of discipline.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u00b616 We disagree with Tuttle\u2019s characterization of his transgressions as minor. MHP found that Tuttle had misappropriated state funds, lied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>to investigators and cadets, and sexually harassed at least one female trooper. Any one of these offenses could have constituted grounds for dismissal. We need not reach this question, however, as we fail to find any support for Tuttle\u2019s proposition that Admin. R. M. 2.21.6509(2) (2005), requires a single incident of severe behavior before MHP may initiate discharge proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">\u00b617 We interpret administrative regulations first according to their plain language. <em>State v. Frickey, </em>2006 MT 122, \u00b6 19, 332 Mont. 255, \u00b6 19, 136 P.3d 558, \u00b6 19. The plain language of the regulation-i.e., \u201csevere cases or unsatisfactory performance or behavior\u201d-could encompass a single incident or the pattern of misbehavior that MHP uncovered in this case. Tuttle cites no authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">\u00b618  We also find no support in this regulation\u2019s language for Tuttle\u2019s argument that he should receive some lesser discipline in light of the fact that MHP failed to document \u201cTuttle\u2019s minor misbehaviors as they occurred.\u201d We will not require MHP to turn a blind eye to the combined severity of Tuttle\u2019s transgressions merely because MHP discovered Tuttle\u2019s various misbehaviors through the course of a single investigation. We conclude that MHP correctly determined that Tuttle\u2019s combined behavior provided sufficient grounds for his termination. <em>City of Billings Police Dept., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">\u00b619  Tuttle next challenges the MHP\u2019s legal conclusion that Tuttle sexually harassed Trooper Welker. MHP\u2019s General Regulations forbid unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when such conduct has the purpose of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. MHP found that Tuttle misrepresented to Trooper Welker that he had power over her career. He threatened to end her career if she did not end her relationship with another trooper. He referred to Trooper Welker as \u201cfat ass\u201d multiple times while on duty. He made sexual advances towards Trooper Welker while she was in Helena for official training. These findings sufficiently support MHP\u2019s conclusion that Tuttle committed verbal conduct of a sexual nature for the purpose of unreasonably interfering with an individual\u2019s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. <em>City of Billings Police Dept., </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b463-8\">JUSTICES NELSON, WARNER, COTTER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
