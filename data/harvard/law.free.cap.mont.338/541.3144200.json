R. Kendall Corporation (collectively \u201cCanyon\u201d), for allegedly contaminating the Shammels\u2019 property and diminishing water flows thereto. In addition to other various tort claims, the Shammels asserted a distinct right to recover money damages for a constitutional tort, based on Canyon\u2019s alleged violation of their constitutional right to a \u201cclean and healthful environment,\u201d Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 1. The District Court held that these provisions do not \u201cauthorize[] a cause of action in tort as between two private parties.\u201d The District Court certified its order denying the availability of such a constitutional tort as a final order, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The Shammels now appeal. We affirm and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue presented is whether the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 1, provides for the recovery of money damages in a constitutional tort action between private parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">\u00b63 Between the late 1980\u2019s and the mid-1990\u2019s, C. R. Kendall Corporation operated a cyanide heap-leach mine in the North Moccasin Mountain Range. The Shammels own various properties downgradient of and downstream from the site of the former mine. The Shammels allege that the piles of tailings produced by C. R. Kendall\u2019s operation of the mine (and left on the site following C. R. Kendall\u2019s cessation of active mining) have infused the drainage\u2019s waters with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>toxic leachate. According to the Shammels, storm water and spring run-off that seeped through the tailing piles would flow onto the Shammels\u2019 property via surface streams and an aquifer, allegedly contaminating the property with arsenic, cyanide, thallium, selenium, nitrate, sulfate and lead. Consequently, in 1996, at the behest of the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ), Canyon installed a \u201cpump-back\u201d system to redirect water that had become contaminated through contact with the tailing piles back onto Canyon\u2019s property, so that it would not enter the aquifer or surface streams, and would no longer reach the Shammels\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">\u00b64 In 1998, the Shammels apparently noticed a reduction in stream flow levels and the level of the water table in the aquifer, which they attributed to Canyon\u2019s physically altering the topography -within the drainage, as well as its implementation of the pump-back system. In response to the Shammels\u2019 voicing these concerns, and again at the behest of DEQ, Canyon began augmenting stream flows below the mine site with diverted, purportedly uncontaminated water taken from above the mine site and from deep wells on the mine site. Despite these efforts, the Shammels claim that surface stream flows on their properties have not returned to normal \u201chistoric\u201d levels. The Shammels attribute this diminution to Canyon\u2019s activities, which, they allege, have drawn down the aquifer and thereby damaged the Shammels\u2019 real property. Moreover, the Shammels maintain that elevated levels of toxic contaminants persist in the surface streams, and that a plume of toxic pollution is presently migrating through the aquifer. The Shammels also vaguely assert some aesthetic injury as a result of Canyon\u2019s invasive mining of the adjacent mountains.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u00b65 The Shammels filed suit alleging trespass-based on the waterborne pollutants that reached their lands-negligence, and nuisance-based on reduced stream flows, depletion of the aquifer and, presumably, aesthetic effects. More than three years after filing their complaint, and during the final pre-trial conference, the Shammels first indicated their desire to recover for a constitutional tort-based on Canyon\u2019s alleged interference with the Shammels\u2019 right to a clean and healthful environment, pursuant to Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 3, and Article IX, Section 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u00b66 The District Court and the parties subsequently agreed to postpone trial, submit briefs addressing the issue of whether Montana law authorizes such a constitutional tort, and designate the District Court\u2019s ruling on the issue as a final order, subject to immediate appeal, pursuant to M. R. Civ. P. 54(b). The District Court held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>proven violation of the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment does not authorize a distinct, constitutionally based cause of action in tort between two private parties for money damages. The Shammels promptly appealed the District Court\u2019s ruling. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">\u00b67 When resolution of an issue involves a question of constitutional law, this Court exercises plenary review of a district court\u2019s interpretation of the law. <em>Seven Up Pete Venture v. State, </em>2005 MT 146, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. 306, \u00b6 18, 114 P.3d 1009, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b566-7\">\u00b68 In <em>Sunburst v. Texaco, </em>2007 MT 183, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079, this Court concluded that, where adequate alternative remedies exist under the common law or statute, the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment, shared by all Montanans, Montana Constitution, Article II, Section 3 and Article IX, Section 1, does not support a cause of action for money damages between two private parties. We reached this conclusion because restoration damages are now available to plaintiffs whose land suffers from environmental pollution, and such damages provide an adequate alternate remedy that will \u201crestore a private party back to the position that it occupied before the tort.\u201d <em>Sunburst, </em>\u00b6 64.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-8\">\u00b69 On the record before us, the Shammels have provided no indication that traditional tort remedies, amplified by restoration damages, will not afford them complete redress for the environmental damage allegedly perpetrated by Canyon. Full restoration of the Shammels\u2019 property may necessitate completion of remediation activities on property not owned by the Shammels. While this fact potentially distinguishes this case from <em>Sunburst, </em>at this juncture we find this distinction to be without significance. In their complaint, the Shammels requested money damages and \u201call further relief as may be appropriate and just under the circumstances.\u201d Assuming the Shammels establish tort liability, this prayer for relief would enable the court, pursuant to its equitable powers, to order Canyon to remediate the former mine site sufficiently to restore the Shammels\u2019 property to its pre-tort condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">\u00b610  Where adequate alternative remedies exist under the common law or statute, the constitutional right to a clean and healthful environment does not authorize a distinct cause of action in tort for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>money damages between two private parties. We affirm and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b567-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, RICE, NELSON, WARNER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
