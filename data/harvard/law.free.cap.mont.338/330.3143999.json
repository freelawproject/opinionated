We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err by ruling that Cech\u2019s conviction of possession of stolen property in Washington did not bar a subsequent prosecution for theft of the property in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b353-13\">\u00b64 On October 15,2004, Cech test-drove a silver 2001 Honda Accord, reportedly valued at $25,000, belonging to SFE Auto Sales (SFE) of Corvallis, Montana. Cech failed to return the vehicle, and SFE reported the theft. On October 17, 2004, the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office learned from the Grant County Sheriffs Office in Ephrata, Washington, that the stolen vehicle had been recovered and that Cech, who was driving the vehicle, had been arrested and charged under Washington law.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-14\">\u00b65 On January 18, 2005, Cech was convicted in Washington of assault in the third degree, attempting to elude pursuing police vehicle, and, with regard to the stolen Honda, possessing stolen property in the first degree. Cech was sentenced to sixteen months in jail in Grant County, Washington. On June 28, 2005, Cech was charged by information in the Twenty-First Judicial District Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Ravalli County, with felony theft in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA. The information alleged Cech \u201cpurposely or knowingly obtained or exerted unauthorized control over a vehicle belonging to SFE Auto Sales ....\u201d At his initial appearance on July 20, 2005, Cech entered a plea of not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b66 On August 29,2005, Cech filed a motion to dismiss on grounds of double jeopardy, which the District Court denied. Thereafter, Cech changed his plea to guilty pursuant to a plea bargain agreement which did not reserve, under \u00a7 46-12-204(3), MCA, Cech\u2019s right to appeal the double jeopardy issue. Cech was sentenced to serve ten years in the Montana State Prison. He appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s denial of a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss a charge on the basis of double jeopardy presents a question of law that this Court reviews for correctness. <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 21, 296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 21, 987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">\u00b68 Did the District Court err by ruling that Cech\u2019s conviction of possession of stolen property in Washington did not bar a subsequent prosecution for theft of the property in Montana?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">\u00b69 As a preliminary matter, Cech offers that his appeal is properly before this Court even though he did not reserve this issue for appeal when he entered his guilty plea because, while a voluntary guilty plea usually constitutes a waiver of non-jurisdictional defects and defenses that occurred prior to the plea, the issue he raises is a jurisdictional one which cannot be waived, citing <em>Hagan v. State, </em>265 Mont. 31, 873 P.2d 1385 (1994). In <em>Hagan, </em>we stated that \u201c[i]t is well established that a plea of guilty which is voluntary and understandingly made constitutes a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses, including claims of constitutional violations which occurred prior to the plea.\u201d <em>Hagan, </em>265 Mont. at 35, 873 P.2d at 1387. We further explained that the jurisdictional grounds exception applies to \u201cthose cases in which the district court could determine that the government lacked the power to bring the indictment <em>at the time of accepting the guilty plea from the face of the indictment or from the record.\u201d Hagan, </em>265 Mont. at 36, 873 P.2d at 1388 (quoting <em>U.S. v. Cortez, </em>973 F.2d 764, 767 (9th Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">\u00b610  Applying this standard to a double jeopardy issue in <em>Stilson v. State, </em>278 Mont. 20, 924 P.2d 238 (1996), which had not been raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>prior to Stilson\u2019s guilty plea, we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">[W]e conclude that at the time the Eighth Judicial District Court accepted Stilson\u2019s guilty plea the record before it contained his two prior convictions and was sufficient for the court to determine whether the government lacked the power to bring the charges at issue due to the constitutional prohibitions against placing a person twice in jeopardy. We conclude that Stilson has not waived his double jeopardy claim and therefore proceed to address the merits of his claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\"><em>Stilson, </em>278 Mont. at 22-23, 924 P.2d at 239. The State offers no substantive argument on this issue, and we note that, when Cech pled guilty, the District Court had before it a copy of the pre-sentence investigation report prepared for Cech\u2019s previous sentencing in Washington State. As in <em>Stilson, </em>the record before the District Court at the time it accepted Cech\u2019s guilty plea was sufficient for the court to determine whether the government lacked the power to bring the charges at issue due to the constitutional prohibitions against double jeopardy. We therefore conclude that Cech has not waived his double jeopardy claim and that it is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">\u00b611 Cech argues that the District Court\u2019s order should be reversed because Cech\u2019s prosecution for theft in Montana was barred on double jeopardy grounds as a result of his conviction for possession of stolen property in Washington. Cech contends that his prosecution was barred under (1) Montana\u2019s double jeopardy statute, \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA; (2) the double jeopardy clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, because the theft offense has the same elements as the Washington possession of stolen property offense, thus satisfying the elements test set out in <em>Blockburger v. U.S., </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180 (1932); and (3) Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">\u00b612 The State responds that its prosecution of theft of the vehicle was not precluded by Washington\u2019s previous prosecution under any of Cech\u2019s three theories because (1) Cech cannot establish elements one and three of the Montana statute\u2019s double jeopardy test as set forth in <em>State v. Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. 261, 264, 922 P.2d 463, 465 (1996); (2) under the dual sovereignty doctrine as defined by the United States Supreme Court, Cech committed two distinct offenses when he stole a vehicle in Montana and then possessed that vehicle in Washington; and (3) Cech was not subjected to the multiple prosecutions for the same offense which is prohibited under the Montana Constitution. Because we conclude that Cech\u2019s first argument, under Montana <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>statute, is meritorious, we do not reach the second and third arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b613 Section 46-11-504(1), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">Former prosecution in another jurisdiction. When conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if: (1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">We have noted that this statute provides criminal defendants with greater protection against double jeopardy than under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s application of the federal constitutional prohibition in <em>Blockburger, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S. Ct. 180. <em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 268, 922 P.2d at 467; <em>State v. Sword, </em>229 Mont. 370, 747 P.2d 206 (1987). In <em>Tadewaldt, </em>this Court deduced a three-part test from the statute to determine whether a subsequent prosecution is barred, setting forth the factors as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">(1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">(2) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or a conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">(3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction [as that term is defined in \u00a7 46-1-202(23), MCA].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\"><em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 264, 922 P.2d at 465. \u201cDue to the conjunctive nature of the statute, all three factors must be met in order to bar subsequent prosecution.\u201d <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 12, 318 Mont. 516, \u00b6 12, 82 P.3d 20, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">\u00b614 Washington charged Cech, with regard to the Honda, with possession of stolen property in the first degree in violation of R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.150. That statute provides that \u201c[a] person is guilty of possessing stolen property in the first degree if he or she possesses stolen property ... which exceeds one thousand five hundred dollars in value.\u201d R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.150.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201cPossessing stolen property\u201d means knowingly to receive, retain, possess, conceal, or dispose of stolen property knowing that it has been stolen and to withhold or appropriate the same to the use of any person other than the true owner or person entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.140. \u201c \u2018Stolen\u2019 means obtained by theft, robbery, or extortion[.]\u201d R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.010(14). In turn, \u201ctheft\u201d means \u201c[t]o wrongfully obtain or exert unauthorized control over the property or services of another ... with intent to deprive him or her of such property or services....\u201d R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.020(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b615 Montana subsequently charged Cech with theft, in violation of \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">Theft. (1) A person commits the offense of theft when the person purposely or knowingly obtains or exerts unauthorized control over property of the owner and:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">(a) has the purpose of depriving the owner of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">(b) purposely or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">(c) uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing that the use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">\u201cObtains or exerts control\u201d includes \u201cthe taking, the carrying away, or the sale, conveyance, or transfer of title to, interest in, or possession of property.\u201d Section 45-2-101(46), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-10\">\u00b616 Applying the three-factor <em>Tadewaldt </em>test, the District Court determined that Cech\u2019s claim failed under the first factor because there was not concurrent jurisdiction over Cech\u2019s conduct:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">Clearly, the offenses are not the same, nor is possession of property an element of Theft under Mont. Code Ann. \u00a7 45-2-301(1). The State of Washington did not have the authority to prosecute Cech for the same offense he was charged with in Montana because no taking, carrying away, or sale, conveyance, or transfer of property is alleged to have occurred in the State of Washington. Therefore, concurrent jurisdiction fails because Montana and Washington courts lacked authority to prosecute equivalent offenses based on the same underlying conduct. [Citation omitted.] Cech, therefore, fails to satisfy the first factor of the three-part test which must be met in order to bar prosecution on the basis of double jeopardy. Because all three factors have to be met in order to bar the subsequent prosecution, the Court need not consider the remaining factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-12\">\u00b617 We must disagree with the District Court\u2019s conclusion under the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor. We have previously held this factor is satisfied when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373, 747 P.2d at 208. We have further explained that in order to demonstrate that jurisdiction existed in both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>courts, the defendant must establish that the same conduct subjected him to the \u201cequivalent offense\u201d in each jurisdiction. <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b618 Cech was not charged with the identical offense in both states, but it was not necessary, for purposes of the first factor, that he was actually charged with identical or equivalent offenses, only that his conduct at issue constituted an equivalent offense in both jurisdictions. The Washington charge was founded upon his unlawful possession of the same vehicle he was charged with stealing in Montana, following his driving of that vehicle to Washington, which charge alleged, pursuant to the elements and definitions set forth above, that Cech had \u201cexerted unauthorized control over property of another . . . with intent to deprive\u201d the owner of such property in Washington. In addition to that charge, Washington also had the authority under its statutes to charge Cech with the offense of \u201cTheft in the first degree\u201d for \u201cwrongfully obtaining] or exert[ing] unauthorized control over the property or services of another ... with intent to deprive him or her of such property or services....\u201d R.C.W. \u00a7\u00a7 9A.56.030 and 9A.56.020(l)(a). Similarly, Montana had the authority to charge, and did charge, Cech with theft of the vehicle under \u00a7 45-6-301, MCA, alleging he had \u201cknowingly obtain[ed] or exert[ed] unauthorized control over property of the owner\u201d with \u201cthe purpose of depriving the owner of the property.\u201d While, as the District Court pointed out, the elements of the charges actually brought in Washington and Montana may not have been identical, nonetheless it is our conclusion that Cech\u2019s conduct had subjected him to \u201cequivalent offenses\u201d in both jurisdictions and thus satisfied the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The second factor is satisfied as well, since Cech was convicted of possession of stolen property in the State of Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">\u00b619 The third factor requires the subsequent prosecution of an offense arising out of the \u201csame transaction\u201d as the first prosecution. \u201cSame transaction\u201d is defined as \u201cconduct consisting of a series of acts or omissions that are motivated by: (a) a purpose to accomplish a criminal objective and that are necessary or incidental to the accomplishment of that objective ....\u201d Section 46-1-202(23), MCA. Offenses arise from the same transaction when \u201ca defendant\u2019s underlying conduct of each prosecution is motivated by a purpose to accomplish the same criminal objective.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 20 (citing <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 374, 747 P.2d at 208-09).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>\u00b620 In <em>Sword, </em>the United States charged the defendant with violating the Endangered Species Act of 1973 when he killed a bear in an area where bear hunting was not permitted. The defendant later pled guilty. Subsequently, the State of Montana charged him for making false statements on his application for a trophy license to transport the bear. After considering Sword\u2019s conduct that served as the basis of his federal charge-\u201cpossessing, carrying, and transporting of a bear taken unlawfully\u201d-we concluded that his state charge arose out of the same transaction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-4\">The trophy license authorized him to possess and transport the trophy. Thus, his false statements as well as his other acts were motivated and necessary or at least incidental to the accomplishment of the criminal objective of possessing, carrying, and transporting of a grizzly bear taken unlawfully. Clearly the Montana prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-5\"><em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 374, 747 P.2d at 209. Therefore, Sword\u2019s conduct fell within the definition of \u201csame transaction,\u201d and double jeopardy barred the State from prosecuting Sword subsequent to the federal conviction. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 374, 747 P.2d at 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b621 Cech also relies on <em>State v. Hernandez, </em>213 Mont. 221, 689 P.2d 1261 (1984). In <em>Hernandez, </em>the defendant was convicted of burglary and theft of coins from a residence. While on probation, the defendant sold some of these same coins. He was then charged with violation of \u00a7 45-6-30l(3)(b), MCA, for receiving stolen property. This Court held that the two convictions-the initial theft and the later sale of stolen property-\u201cclearly arose from the same transaction\u201d because the convictions stemmed from the same initial taking of the coins and, consequently, the second prosecution was barred by the prior conviction. <em>Hernandez, </em>213 Mont. at 223, 689 P.2d at 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b622  We reach the same conclusion here. Cech\u2019s underlying conduct which served as a basis for both prosecutions sought to accomplish the same criminal objective-control of the stolen vehicle-leading to the filing of analogous charges directed at such conduct in both states. Cech could not have been charged with possession of the stolen vehicle in Washington had he not first stolen the Honda in Montana and taken it to Washington. Cech\u2019s asserted motivation, that of \u201cknowingly ... withhold[ing] or appropriate[ing]\u201d the Honda \u201cto the use of any person other than the true owner or person entitled thereto,\u201d R.C.W. \u00a7 9A.56.140, or of \u201cdepriving the owner of the property\u2019 under \u00a7 45-6-301(l)(a), MCA, was the same. Thus, these charges arose out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b623  We conclude that all three <em>Tadewaldt </em>factors are met, and that \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, therefore bars the subsequent prosecution for theft in Montana. The decision of the District Court is reversed and this matter is remanded for dismissal of the charge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-6\"> We acknowledge the alternative analysis under the first factor offered by the concurrence, but decline to adopt it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b360-6\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"AB6\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u00b624 I concur in the result of our Opinion, but not with all that is said.</p>\n<p id=\"Asb\">\u00b625 In <em>State v. </em>Tadewaldt, 277 Mont. 261, 922 P.2d 463 (1996), we analyzed the 1993 version of \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA. (Tadewaldt\u2019s offense was committed in August 1994.) The statute then provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the concurrent jurisdiction of this state and of the United States or another state or of two courts of separate, overlapping, or concurrent jurisdiction in this state, a prosecution in any other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state under the same circumstances barring further prosecution in this state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">(1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">Section 46-11-504, MCA(1993). Based on this language, we enunciated the following three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">[A] subsequent prosecution is barred under this statute, by its terms, if the following three factors are met: (1) a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of the court where the first prosecution occurred and within the jurisdiction of the court where the subsequent prosecution is pursued; (2) the first prosecution results in an acquittal or a conviction; and (3) the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-12\"><em>Tadewaldt, </em>277 Mont. at 264, 922 P.2d at 465.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-13\">\u00b626 In 1997, the Legislature amended \u00a7 46-11-504, <em>see </em>Laws of Montana, 1997, Ch. 162, \u00a7 1, and the statute has remained unchanged since then. It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-15\">(1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>arising out of the same transaction;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">Section 46-11-504, MCA. Accordingly, a subsequent prosecution was barred in the case at hand if (1) Cech\u2019s conduct constituted an offense within the jurisdiction of the Washington court; (2) the Washington prosecution resulted in an acquittal or a conviction; and (3) the subsequent Montana prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b627 The District Court determined that Cech could not satisfy factor (1). Citing <em>State v. Gazda, </em>2003 MT 350, \u00b6 15, 318 Mont. 516, \u00b6 15, 82 P.3d 20, \u00b6 15, the court opined that \u201cjurisdiction exists in both courts when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense.\u201d The court then proceeded to analyze the offenses of possessing stolen property in the first degree, RCW 9A.56.150(1), and theft, \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA, and concluded that \u201c[cjlearly, the offenses are not the same.\u201d Thus, the court decided that \u201cconcurrent jurisdiction fails because Montana and Washington courts lacked authority to prosecute equivalent offenses based on the same underlying conduct\u201d and Cech, therefore, \u201cfails to satisfy the first factor of the three-part test.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b628 In this respect, the District Court unquestionably erred. Nothing in \u00a7 46-11-504 states that the offense prosecuted in the first jurisdiction must be \u201cthe same\u201d as or \u201cequivalent\u201d to the offense charged in Montana. Again, the statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">When conduct constitutes <em>an offense </em>within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">(1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on <em>an offense </em>arising out of the same transaction;....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">Section 46-11-504, MCA (emphases added). The statute does not state in the preliminary language that \u201ca prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state <em>for the same or an equivalent </em>offense.\u201d Rather, it unambiguously states that \u201ca prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state\u201d-nothing more. Moreover, the statute does not state in subsection (1): \u201cbased on <em>the same or an equivalent </em>offense arising out of the same transaction.\u201d Rather, it states: \u201cbased on <em>an </em>offense arising out of the same transaction.\u201d Accordingly, there was no requirement that Cech demonstrate, as the District Court required, that \u201cboth jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense,\u201d and I concur in our disagreement with the District Court on this point. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Opinion, \u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b629 That said, the District Court\u2019s analysis was not without support. In <em>Gazda, </em>the State argued that the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor was not satisfied in that case because the federal and Montana courts lacked authority to prosecute \u201cequivalent offenses\u201d based on the same underlying conduct. <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 14. We stated that we \u201cagree[d]\u201d with this contention, <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 14, noting that \u201c[t]his Court has explicitly held that jurisdiction exists in both courts when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense,\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 15 (citing <em>State v. Sword, </em>229 Mont. 370, 373, 747 P.2d 206, 208 (1987)). We then reasoned that Gazda had not satisfied the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor because \u201c[tjhere is no suggestion that the United States could have charged Gazda with deliberate homicide, nor that the State could have charged Gazda with felon in possession, a federal statute with no comparable state statute.\u201d <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b630 This reasoning and the State\u2019s contentions set forth in \u00b6 14 of <em>Gazda </em>are plainly unsupportable. As explained above, nothing in \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, required that Gazda be charged by the United States and the State of Montana with \u201cthe same\u201d or an \u201cequivalent\u201d offense in order for the statute to apply. In holding to the contrary, we grafted onto \u00a7 46-11-504 and the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor a requirement that simply does not exist in the language of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b631 As support for this rendering of the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor, we cited <em>Sword (see Gazda, </em>\u00b6 15); however, <em>Sword </em>does not stand for a requirement that the first court and the Montana court have authority to prosecute \u201cthe same\u201d or \u201cequivalent\u201d offenses based on the same underlying conduct. After killing a grizzly bear in the Great Bear Wilderness, which at that time was closed to grizzly bear hunting, Sword reported on his trophy license that he had killed the bear in the Bob Marshall Wilderness, which at the time was open to grizzly bear hunting. Sword eventually pleaded guilty in federal court to knowingly possessing, carrying, and transporting a grizzly bear taken unlawfully. He then was charged in state court with subscribing to a materially false statement on an application for a grizzly bear trophy license. <em>See Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 371-72, 747 P.2d at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b632 In considering whether \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA (1985) barred the Montana prosecution, we first observed that \u00a7 46-11-504(1) required answers to two questions: \u201c1) Did Montana and the United States have concurrent jurisdiction? 2) Is the Montana prosecution based on an offense arising out of the same transaction?\u201d <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>747 P.2d at 208.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> With respect to the first question, we noted that \u201c[i]f the conduct gives rise to an offense chargeable in both jurisdictions, concurrent jurisdiction lies regardless of the particular offense ultimately charged in each jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373, 747 P.2d at 208 (citing <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>175 Mont. 179, 187, 573 P.2d 174, 179 (1977)). Thus, because when Sword killed the bear, transported it from the mountain, made false statements on the trophy application, and stored the hide, his conduct violated both 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1538(a)(1)(G) and \u00a7 87-l-102(2)(a), MCA, we concluded that the United States and the State of Montana had concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373-74, 747 P.2d at 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b633 This was not to say, however, that the first factor is <em>only </em>satisfied when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for \u201cthe same\u201d or \u201cequivalent\u201d offenses. But even if <em>Sword </em>could be so interpreted to require that the offenses be the same or equivalent in order for concurrent jurisdiction to he, the Legislature deleted the reference to \u201cconcurrent\u201d jurisdiction in the 1997 amendment to \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 46-11-504, MCA (1997) <em>with </em>\u00a7 46-11-504, MCA (1985). Thus, <em>Sword </em>did not support our reasoning in \u00b6 15 of <em>Gazda </em>with respect to the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b634 Again, the version of \u00a7 46-11-504 at issue in Gazda provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUv\">\u2018When conduct constitutes an offense within the jurisdiction of any state or federal court, a prosecution in any jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state if: (1) the first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b363-6\"><em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 12 (ellipsis in original) (quoting \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA). Nothing in this language requires that the offense prosecuted in the first jurisdiction and the offense charged in Montana be the same or equivalent; the language simply requires that the two offenses-whatever they are-\u201caris[e] out of the same transaction.\u201d Therefore, the portion of <em>Gazda </em>explaining and applying the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number><em>Tadewaldt </em>factor, <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-17, is incorrect and should be overruled.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b635 Unfortunately, in the case at hand, the Court perpetuates our error in <em>Gazda. </em>After disagreeing with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor is not satisfied in this case, the Court explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\">We have previously held this factor is satisfied when both jurisdictions have authority to prosecute for the same offense. <em>Sword, </em>229 Mont. at 373, 747 P.2d at 208. We have further explained that in order to demonstrate that jurisdiction existed in both courts, the defendant must establish that the same conduct subjected him to the \u201cequivalent offense\u201d in each jurisdiction. <em>Gazda, </em>\u00b6 14.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Opinion, \u00b6 17. The Court goes on to state that \u201cit was not necessary for purposes of the first factor, that [Cech] was actually charged with identical or equivalent offenses, only that his conduct at issue constituted an equivalent offense in both jurisdictions.\u201d Opinion, \u00b6 18; <em>see also </em>Opinion, \u00b6 22 (referring to \u201canalogous\u201d charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b636 Where does it state in \u00a7 46-11-504 that \u201cthe same conduct [must have] subjected [the defendant] to the \u2018equivalent offense\u2019 in each jurisdiction\u201d or that \u201c[the defendant\u2019s] conduct at issue [must have] constituted an equivalent offense in both jurisdictions\u201d? Nowhere. The statute states that the conduct must have subjected the defendant to \u201can offense\u201d in the state or federal jurisdiction and \u201can offense\u201d in Montana \u201carising out of the same transaction.\u201d Section 46-11-504(1), MCA. While the transaction must be \u201cthe same,\u201d the prosecuted and now-charged offenses need not be \u201cthe same,\u201d or even \u201cequivalent\u201d or \u201canalogous.\u201d Pursuant to the unambiguous language of the statute, they must simply arise out of the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b637 Accordingly, I believe the Court errs in stating that a defendant must establish that the same conduct subjected him to the \u201cequivalent offense\u201d in each jurisdiction and that the defendant\u2019s conduct at issue must have constituted an \u201cequivalent offense\u201d in both jurisdictions. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 17, 18. The plain language of the statute contains no requirement that the two offenses be \u201cequivalent,\u201d much less \u201cthe same,\u201d and courts ought not to add such terms to the language selected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>by the Legislature. Section 1-2-101, MCA (\u201cIn the construction of a statute, the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">\u00b638 For this reason, I also cannot agree with the Court\u2019s reasoning in \u00b6 18. The first factor is satisfied here not because \u201cCech\u2019s conduct ... subjected him to \u2018equivalent offenses\u2019 in both [Washington and Montana].\u201d Rather, this factor is satisfied because Cech\u2019s conduct of controlling a stolen vehicle constituted an offense in Washington (possessing stolen property in the first degree, RCW 9A.56.150(1)) and an offense in Montana (theft, \u00a7 45-6-301(1), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">\u00b639 In sum, I believe that our explanation and application of the first <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor in \u00b6\u00b6 13-17 of <em>Gazda </em>is erroneous and should be overruled. Thus, I cannot agree with the Court\u2019s analysis of that factor in \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 of today\u2019s Opinion, which relies on and continues our error in <em>Gazda. </em>With that exception, I otherwise concur in the Court\u2019s analysis. Furthermore, I concur in the Court\u2019s ultimate conclusions that all three <em>Tadewaldt </em>factors are met here and that \u00a7 46-11-504, MCA, bars the State of Montana from prosecuting Cech for theft.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b363-7\"> Section 46-11-504(1), MCA (1985) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">When conduct constitutes an offense within the concurrent jurisdiction of this state and of the United States or another state or of two courts of separate, overlapping, or concurrent jurisdiction in this state, a prosecution in any such other jurisdiction is a bar to a subsequent prosecution in this state under the following circumstances:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">(1) The first prosecution resulted in an acquittal or in a conviction as defined in 46-11-503 and the subsequent prosecution is based on an offense arising out of the same transaction.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b364-9\"> We went on in <em>Gazda </em>to hold that the third <em>Tadewaldt </em>factor had not been met because the conduct underlying Gazda\u2019s federal conviction was distinct from the conduct underlying the charged offense in the Montana court-i.e., the offenses did not arise out of the same transaction. <em>See Gazda, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-24.
