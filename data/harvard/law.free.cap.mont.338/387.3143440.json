McCormick (Joan) and Clark A. Brevig (Clark) concerning their respective interests in the family partnership, Brevig Land, Live and Lumber (the Partnership). Due to our opinion in <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2007 MT 195, Sup. Ct. No. 05-697, handed down this day, along with subsequent proceedings in the District Court, this appeal is dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b62 For the factual and procedural background of this case, see <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>1999 MT 86, 294 Mont. 144, 980 P.2d 603 <em>(McCormick I), McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2004 MT 179, 322 Mont. 112, 96 P.3d 697 <em>(McCormick II), </em>and <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>2007 MT 195, 338 Mont. 370, 169 P.3d 352 <em>(McCormick III).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">\u00b63 While <em>McCormick III </em>was pending, the District Court proceeded with the sale of the Partnership assets, in accordance with our ruling in <em>McCormick II. </em>The sale was held October 31, 2006. This fourth appeal concerns orders of the District Court that directed how the sale was to be conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">\u00b64 The District Court issued its original Order for Sale of the Partnership assets on September 20,2005. This order, which has now been affirmed by our decision in <em>McCormick III, </em>provided that the \u201cnet sale proceeds\u201d of the sale received by the sheriff be deposited with the clerk of the District Court pending any appeal. Joan and Clark, however, disputed the definition of \u201cnet sale proceeds.\u201d Clark sought a stay of execution on this order, both in the District Court and this Court. However, no stay was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">\u00b65 Joan presented the District Court\u2019s order to the Fergus County sheriff and demanded a sale of the Partnership assets. The sheriff refused. Joan then sought a writ of mandamus from this Court ordering the sheriff to conduct the sale. The writ was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">\u00b66 Following our denial of Joan\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus, the District Court considered the sheriffs concerns. On June 20,2006, the District Court issued its \u201cOrder Regarding the Court\u2019s Order for Sale of Partnership Assets and Payment of Special Master\u2019s Fee,\u201d which stated, \u201cThis Order is entered to clarify and amplify the Court\u2019s Order for Sale ... entered on September 20, 2005.\u201d This second order allowed Joan and Clark to submit credit bids at the sale. That is, because each of them already owned part of the property being sold, the amount of their bids would be credited with their respective interests in the Partnership. Because the District Court had previously found Joan had not paid for her full 50% ownership in the Partnership, Clark\u2019s bid would be credited with 50% of its amount, <em>plus </em>$1,322,761. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Conversely, Joan\u2019s bid would be credited with 50% of its amount, <em>minus </em>$1,322,761.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b67 The District Court\u2019s clarifying order also allowed bidders to submit letters of credit as proof of ability to pay the amount bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b68 Joan appeals and Clark cross-appeals the District Court\u2019s June 20, 2006, order.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">\u00b69 Joan appeals that portion of the District Court\u2019s clarifying order allowing Clark to submit a credit bid. She argues the credit bid could result in insufficient cash to pay her what she is owed. However, the record reveals that the sale has been completed, and Clark purchased the remaining Partnership assets for enough money to pay Joan what she is owed.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">\u00b610 Clark appeals that portion of the District Court\u2019s clarifying order allowing letters of credit to be submitted by bidders. However, he purchased the remaining Partnership assets at the sale and, thus, now has no complaint about payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">\u00b611  Because of the results of the sale which has taken place, the issues raised in this appeal have been decided between these parties. Where a court\u2019s judgment will not effectively operate to grant relief, the matter is moot. <em>Walker v. State, </em>2003 MT 134, \u00b6 40, 316 Mont. 103, \u00b6 40, 68 P.3d 872, \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">\u00b612 As a decision of this Court would not effectively operate to grant relief to Joan or Clark on the issues raised, this appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"AH5\">JUSTICES NELSON, MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
