We reverse and remand to Judge William Neis Swandal, the original sentencing judge in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">\u00b62 Jordan pled guilty to two counts of sexual assault on a minor in violation of \u00a7 45-5-502, MCA. Judge E. Wayne Phillips originally presided over Jordan\u2019s case, but had been substituted early in the proceedings. Judge William Neis Swandal assumed jurisdiction. Judge Swandal accepted Jordan\u2019s guilty plea and sentenced Jordan to serve two consecutive 12-year terms at the Montana State Prison, with Jordan becoming eligible for parole only after he completed phases 1 and 2 of the sexual offender treatment program. The Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana amended Jordan\u2019s sentence to 20 years with eight years suspended on each count with the two counts running consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">\u00b63 Jordan filed <em>pro se </em>a petition for post conviction relief on April 14, 2005, in the Tenth Judicial District. Judge Phillips appointed counsel to represent Jordan in the post conviction proceedings and simultaneously ordered the Respondent State of Montana (State) to file a response. The State urged the court to review the record and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>determine that Jordan is not entitled to relief. Judge Phillips dismissed Jordan\u2019s petition two days after the State filed its response based on the court\u2019s determination that the petition did not comply with \u00a7 46-21-104(2), MCA. This statute requires the petitioner to attach to the petition \u201ca supporting memorandum, including appropriate arguments and citations and discussion of authorities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Agv\">\u00b64 Jordan\u2019s appointed counsel finally filed a brief in support of Jordan\u2019s petition for post conviction relief on March 9, 2006. Jordan\u2019s counsel amended the petition on March 30, 2006. Judge Phillips dismissed Jordan\u2019s post conviction claim. The court determined that it already had dismissed Jordan\u2019s first petition for post conviction relief, and, therefore, could not treat Jordan\u2019s subsequent claim as an amended petition. The court instead viewed Jordan\u2019s claim as a separate, second petition. The court reasoned that \u00a7 46-21-105, MCA, prohibits the filing of a second petition for post conviction relief. Jordan appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\u00b65 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for post conviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>Hardin v. State, </em>2006 MT 272, \u00b6 11, 334 Mont. 204, \u00b6 11, 146 P.3d 746, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b66 Jordan argues that Judge Phillips lacked jurisdiction to deny his petition for post conviction relief. Jordan claims that Judge Phillips did not impose his sentence, and, thus, cannot rule on his petition for post conviction relief. Section 46-21-101(1), MCA, provides that a petition for post conviction relief must be filed in \u201cthe court that imposed the sentence.\u201d Jordan requests that we remand this case to Judge Swandal, who sentenced Jordan in the underlying criminal matter.</p>\n<p id=\"AIF\">\u00b67 The State responds that \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, simply requires the party to petition \u201cthe court\u201d that imposed the sentence rather than the particular judge that presided over the petitioner\u2019s sentencing. The State argues that Jordan\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, would preclude post conviction relief in cases where the sentencing judge had died or retired before the petitioner filed for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b68 We construe statutory language by its plain meaning. If the words are clear and unambiguous then no further interpretation is required. <em>Small v. Board of Trustees, </em>2001 MT 181, \u00b6 21, 306 Mont. 199, \u00b6 21, 31 P.3d 358, \u00b6 21. If the plain words of the statute are ambiguous, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>interpret the statute according to the intent of the legislature. <em>Small, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b69 Section 46-21-101(1), MCA, directs a petitioner to file a petition for post conviction relief in \u201cthe court that imposed the sentence.\u201d The statute\u2019s plain language provides no guidance, however, as to which judge may preside over the post conviction proceeding once the petition is filed in the proper court. We must look to other sources of statutory construction to determine the legislative intent. <em>Small, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b610 We discussed in <em>Coleman v. State, </em>194 Mont. 428, 633 P.2d 624 (1981), the history and purpose of \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, in the context of whether a sentencing judge may recuse himself from a subsequent post conviction proceeding. We determined that the statute\u2019s requirement that a post conviction petition be filed in the court that imposed the sentence serves to: 1) alleviate the burden of the district court at the place of confinement; 2) reduce the cost of the proceeding as most of the witnesses to the post conviction proceeding likely reside in the place where trial and sentencing occurred, and; 3) allow the judge with the most familiarity of the facts and circumstances surrounding the case to review the post conviction claim so as to promote efficiency in the administration of justice. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont. at 434, 633 P.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">\u00b611  The sentencing judge constitutes the judge with the most familiarity of the testimony, briefs, motions, and trial court records involving the underlying criminal action that remains under collateral attack in the subsequent post conviction proceeding. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont. at 435, 633 P.2d at 628. The sentencing judge should preside over the subsequent post conviction action to avoid the great delay and burden that would be imposed on the courts if a judge other than the sentencing judge had to become familiar with the record for the purposes of conducting a post conviction evidentiary hearing. Such a delay can be justified only \u201cby the strongest showing of materiality and unavailability of evidence sought to be adduced from the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont. at 435, 633 P.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">\u00b612 Jordan complied with the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-101(1), MCA, by filing his petition for post conviction relief in the court that imposed his sentence. The assignment of Jordan\u2019s post conviction case to the proper judge fell to the court once Jordan filed the petition in the proper court. <em>Coleman </em>requires the court to assign Jordan\u2019s post conviction matter to Judge Swandal. Judge Swandal sentenced Jordan in the underlying criminal action. As a result, Judge Swandal possessed the most familiarity of the testimony, briefs, motions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>trial court records involving Jordan\u2019s underlying criminal action. Nothing in the record indicates that Judge Swandal would have been unavailable to preside over Jordan\u2019s post conviction proceeding and Jordan presented no showing that would have permitted Judge Swandal\u2019s recusal. <em>Coleman, </em>194 Mont. at 435, 633 P.2d at 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b613  Moreover, the substitution of Judge Phillips in Jordan\u2019s underlying criminal action would carry over to Jordan\u2019s post conviction proceeding. Section 3-1-804, MCA, precludes a substituted district judge from acting \u201con the merits of the cause\u201d or deciding any \u201clegal issues therein.\u201d A substitution of a trial court judge does not evaporate suddenly in a subsequent post conviction proceeding that involves the same parties, the same witnesses, and the same factual background as the underlying case from which the judge already had been removed. Judge Phillips\u2019s substitution in Jordan\u2019s criminal action also prevents him from presiding over Jordan\u2019s post conviction proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">\u00b614 We reverse Judge Phillips\u2019s orders of June 8, 2005, and June 20, 2006, dismissing Jordan\u2019s petition for post conviction relief. We remand Jordan\u2019s post conviction claim for consideration by Judge Swandal. We need not reach, therefore, Jordan\u2019s substantive claims regarding Judge Phillip\u2019s denial of his petition for post conviction relief.</p>\n<judges id=\"b139-6\">JUSTICES LEAPHART, NELSON, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
