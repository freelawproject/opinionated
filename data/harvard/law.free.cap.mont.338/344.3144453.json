We reverse and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">\u00b62 The State charged Jackson with seven counts of felony sexual intercourse without consent in violation of \u00a7 45-5-503, MCA. Jackson entered into a plea agreement with the State under which Jackson pled guilty to one count of sexual intercourse without consent and the State dismissed the remaining charges. The court accepted the plea agreement and sentenced Jackson to a six-year commitment to the Department of Corrections (DOC). The court also designated Jackson a Level I sex offender and required him to complete phases I and II of the sex offender treatment program at the Montana State Prison before becoming eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">\u00b63 Jackson filed a motion for re-sentencing more than two years after the court issued judgment in his case. Jackson alleged that his six-year commitment to the DOC violated \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA. This statute requires \u201call but the first 5 years of the commitment to the department of corrections must be suspended.\u201d The court initially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>dismissed Jackson\u2019s motion without prejudice based on the fact that \u00a7 46-21-102(1), MCA, and M. R. App. P. 5(b) imposed a time bar on Jackson\u2019s efforts to pursue post conviction relief or direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">\u00b64 Jackson resurrected his argument in a petition for writ of habeas corpus. The State conceded that Jackson had received an illegal sentence in regard to his six-year DOC commitment, but argued that re-sentencing Jackson rather than striking the illegal portion of Jackson\u2019s sentence constituted the proper remedy. The court vacated Jackson\u2019s illegal sentence and re-sentenced Jackson to six years at Montana State Prison (MSP) with credit for time served. The court imposed the condition that Jackson complete phases I and II of the sex offender treatment program before becoming eligible for parole. The court concluded that changing Jackson\u2019s sentence from a six-year DOC commitment to a six-year MSP sentence did not constitute a more onerous sentence. Jackson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b65  We review a criminal sentence for legality only. We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court violated the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to due process at sentencing. <em>State v. Heath, </em>2005 MT 280, \u00b6 5, 329 Mont. 226, \u00b6 5, 123 P.3d 228, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b66 <em>Whether the District Court violated Jackson\u2019s right to due process by changing his sentence from a six-year DOC commitment to six years incarceration in MSP.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b67 Jackson argues that the court violated his constitutional due process rights under <em>North Carolina v. Pearce, </em>395 U.S. 711, 89 S. Ct. 2072 (1969), <em>overruled in part by Alabama v. Smith, </em>490 U.S. 794, 109 S. Ct. 2201 (1989), by imposing a more burdensome sentence than his original commitment to DOC. Jackson asserts that <em>Pearce </em>precludes the court from imposing a heavier sentence on him as punishment for setting aside his original sentence. Jackson cites <em>State v. Tracy, </em>2005 MT 128, 327 Mont. 220, 113 P.3d 297, in support of his contention that a term of imprisonment constitutes a more onerous sentence than an equal term of commitment to the DOC. Jackson argues that the illegal portion of his original sentence should be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-10\">\u00b68 Before we address the merits of Jackson\u2019s claim, we first must resolve two procedural issues raised by the State. The State first argues that the District Court improperly considered Jackson\u2019s challenge to his illegal sentence as a petition for writ for habeas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>corpus. The State asserts that Jackson cannot use habeas corpus proceedings to \u201ccollaterally attack\u201d his sentence. The State argues that Jackson\u2019s only remedy lies with a direct appeal or a post conviction relief petition, both options that Jackson remains time-barred from pursuing. The State contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Jackson\u2019s appeal based on Jackson\u2019s allegedly improper petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">\u00b69 Article II, Section 19 of the Montana Constitution guarantees that the \u201cprivilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall never be suspended.\u201d Any person imprisoned in Montana may \u201cprosecute a writ of habeas corpus to inquire into the cause of imprisonment or restraint and, if illegal, to be delivered from the imprisonment or restraint.\u201d Section 46-22-101(1), MCA. The writ of habeas corpus may not be used, however, to \u201cattack the validity of the conviction or sentence of a person who has been adjudged guilty of an offense in a court of record and has exhausted the remedy of appeal.\u201d Section 46-22-101(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">\u00b610 The restriction on habeas corpus contained in \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA, stands in tension with the constitutional provision in Article II, Section 19 of the Montana Constitution, that \u201cthe writ of habeas corpus shall never be suspended.\u201d We determined in <em>Lott v. State, </em>2006 MT 279, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 270, \u00b6 22, 150 P.3d 337, \u00b6 22, that the procedural bar created by \u00a7 46-22-101(2), MCA, unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus. We further concluded that the incarceration of a person under a facially invalid sentence-including a sentence that exceeded the statutory maximum for the crime charged-presented a \u201cgrievous wrong\u201d that the court could address through a petition for writ of habeas corpus. <em>Lott, </em>\u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">\u00b611  Jackson alleged, and the State readily conceded, that Jackson\u2019s six-year commitment to DOC exceeded the statutory parameters of \u00a7 46-18-201(3)(d)(i), MCA. The State argued that re-sentencing J ackson represented the proper remedy. The writ of habeas corpus constitutes the proper remedy for addressing Jackson\u2019s \u201cgrievous wrong.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>\u00b6 22. The court re-sentenced Jackson on January 12,2006, to a six-year term of imprisonment in MSP. Jackson filed a timely appeal of his second sentence under M. R. App. P. 5(b). We conclude that Jackson\u2019s appeal is properly before the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">\u00b612 The State next argues that Jackson waived his right to challenge his original sentence under <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, \u00b6 10, 314 Mont. 291, \u00b6 10, 65 P.3d 559, \u00b6 10, wherein we determined that a defendant waived his right to appeal a condition of his sentence when the defendant invited and actively acquiesced to the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>condition. The State contends that Jackson actively acquiesced to his illegal sentence by agreeing to the sentence in a plea agreement with the State and, therefore, waived his right to challenge the sentence. The State argues that the court improperly allowed Jackson to pursue his challenge of the illegal sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">\u00b613 The State misplaces its reliance on <em>Micklon </em>in light of the fact that the State did not object to Jackson\u2019s challenge at the time that he filed his petition for writ of habeas corpus in the sentencing court. The State admitted to the sentencing court that Jackson had received an illegal sentence and that the proper \u201cremedy is to re-sentence the defendant.\u201d Judicial estoppel binds the State to its judicial admissions and prevents the State from taking a position \u201cinconsistent with previously made declarations in a subsequent action or proceeding.\u201d <em>Kauffman-Harmon v. Kauffman, </em>2001 MT 238, \u00b6 15, 307 Mont. 45, \u00b6 15, 36 P.3d 408, \u00b6 15. The State cannot argue now that the District Court improperly ordered Jackson to be re-sentenced when it sought re-sentencing as the initial remedy to Jackson\u2019s illegal sentence. <em>Kauffman-Harmon, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">\u00b614  We turn then to the merits of Jackson\u2019s appeal: whether the District Court violated Jackson\u2019s right to due process by changing his sentence from a six-year DOC commitment to six years incarceration in MSP. Due process requires a court to base a more burdensome re-sentence on \u201cobjective information concerning identifiable conduct of the defendant after the original sentencing and the reasons for the longer sentence must affirmatively appear on the record.\u201d <em>State v. Redfern, </em>2004 MT 277, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 225, \u00b6 12, 99 P.3d 223, \u00b6 12. A court denies a defendant\u2019s due process rights by imposing a heavier sentence on the defendant as punishment for setting aside his original sentence. <em>Redfern, </em>\u00b6 12 (citing <em>Pearce, </em>395 U.S. at 722-24, 89 S. Ct. at 2079-80).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">\u00b615 A sentence to MSP constitutes a more burdensome sentence than a commitment of the same term to the DOC as a sentence to MSP necessarily requires incarceration in a detention facility. <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-20. A change in sentence from a DOC commitment to a term of imprisonment at MSP, however, does not always constitute a more onerous sentence. We determined in <em>Heath </em>that a shift in sentence from a DOC commitment to a term of imprisonment at MSP is not more burdensome where the change reduced the overall amount of time served under the sentence by twelve years. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\u00b616  Jackson\u2019s re-sentence from a six-year DOC commitment to a six-year term of imprisonment at MSP constitutes a more burdensome <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>sentence under <em>Tracy and Heath. </em>The sentence to MSP affords Jackson less flexibility than his original commitment to the DOC. <em>Tracy, </em>\u00b6 18. The change in Jackson\u2019s sentence from the DOC commitment to a term of imprisonment also did not reduce the overall amount of time of Jackson\u2019s sentence. <em>Heath, </em>\u00b6 11. The court could have imposed this heavier sentence on Jackson if it had complied with the <em>Pearce </em>requirements as stated in <em>Redfern, </em>\u00b6 12. Nothing in the record indicates, however, that the court based Jackson\u2019s more burdensome sentence on \u201cobjective information concerning identifiable conduct of the defendant after the original sentencing.\u201d <em>Redfern, </em>\u00b6 12. Moreover, the record is devoid of the court\u2019s reasons for imposing the weightier sentence. <em>Redfern, </em>\u00b6 12. We conclude that the court violated Jackson\u2019s due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b617 We reverse Jackson\u2019s sentence and remand to the District Court for re-sentencing in compliance with \u00a7 46-18-20l(3)(d)(i), MCA, requiring that \u201call but the first 5 years of the commitment to the department of corrections must be suspended.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b371-5\">JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b371-6\">JUSTICE RICE dissents.</judges>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">\u00b618 As the Court explains in \u00b6 15, a change in sentence from a DOC commitment to a term of imprisonment at MSP does not automatically constitute a more onerous sentence. Rather, as we did in <em>Heath, </em>the Court reviews the challenged new sentence in light of the circumstances of its imposition to determine whether it is more onerous. <em>See Heath, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u00b619 Here, Jackson was originally \u201ccommitted to the Department of Corrections for six (6) years,\u201d and, in light of his offense, was ordered to be ineligible for parole until he had \u201csuccessfully complete[d] the Sexual Offender Program phases I and II at the Montana State Prison (or regional prison).\u201d The sentence imposed additional parole conditions as well. Pursuant to this original sentence, Jackson was committed to prison by the DOC. He was serving that prison sentence, had completed Phase I and was in the process of completing Phase II of the Sexual Offender Program when he initiated this litigation to challenge his sentence, leading to his resentencing. The District Court then sentenced Jackson to six years in MSP, with credit for time served, and imposed the same conditions as the original sentence, including that he complete Phases I and II of the Sexual Offender Program before he would become eligible for parole, and would be subject to the same list of other parole conditions as ordered under the original sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>\u00b620 Under these circumstances, Jackson\u2019s new sentence was not more onerous. His original sentence, though a DOC commitment, contained provisions making it as onerous as his second sentence. Though not a direct commitment to MSP, his original sentence required imprisonment by virtue of its conditions, making Jackson ineligible for parole until he had completed Phases I and II of the Sexual Offender Program within prison. Upon resentencing, the District Court simply re-imposed the sentencing outcome of Jackson\u2019s first sentence, placing him at MSP with credit for time already served there, and again requiring that he complete the offender program before becoming eligible for release. As a practical matter, the new sentence was not less flexible than the original.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b621 Thus, given these circumstances, I would affirm the District Court\u2019s resentencing order.</p>\n<judges id=\"b372-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE LEAPHART join the dissenting opinion of JUSTICE RICE.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
