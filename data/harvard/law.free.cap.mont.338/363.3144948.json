(Hare\u2019s Ear), under the trade name of Jackrabbit Red\u2019s Casino located in the Flying J Travel Plaza (Flying J), in Great Falls, Cascade County, Montana. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b62 The issues on appeal are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">1. Whether the Department is a proper party on appeal; and</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">2. Whether the District Court erred in affirming the Department\u2019s approval of Hare\u2019s Ear\u2019s application for transfer of ownership and location of the liquor license.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\u00b63 Hare\u2019s Ear, a Montana close corporation, filed an application with the Department for the transfer of ownership and location of All-Alcoholic Beverages License No. 02-401-1287-001. Hare\u2019s Ear planned to obtain the license, formerly in public use at the Plum Crazy Casino in Great Falls, Montana, and use it at a Jackrabbit Red\u2019s Casino to be located on the premises of the Flying J in Great Falls, situated next to Interstate 15 at the 31st Street Southwest interchange. The lease for the bar and casino space between Hare\u2019s Ear and Flying J was contingent on Hare\u2019s Ear obtaining the liquor license, and, subsequently, gambling machine permits.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">\u00b64 The Department published a notice that Hare\u2019s Ear had applied for transfer of ownership and location of the license to J ackrabbit Red\u2019s Casino at the Flying J location. The Department received eighty-three letters of protest to the issuance of the license. Many of them were residents of the Gore Hill area in Great Falls, a subdivision located approximately a half mile south of the Flying J. The Department held a hearing where both sides presented witness testimony and exhibits. Because the intended use of the property was as a casino, and a liquor license is a prerequisite to obtaining gambling permits, much of the testimony from the protestors consisted of objections to gambling and its implications on the health and welfare of society. At the hearing, the Protestors argued that gambling would bring undesirable people into the community, and create a gambling addiction in the Gore Hill neighborhood. Several residents of the Gore Hill area voiced their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>concern about heavy traffic, impaired drivers, the safety of children bicycling or walking to the truck stop, negatively impacted real estate values, the area being off regular police beats, zoning restrictions, and little or no evidence of demand. Some Protestors were opposed to gambling in general because of the toll they had seen compulsive gambling take on themselves or others they knew. A psychotherapist and a clinical psychologist testified about the negative impact gambling presents to the health and welfare of society. A medical doctor with familiarity of gambling addiction testified that, while not opposed to gambling, she supported creating zoning districts to confine gambling to specified areas so that gambling addicts could be counseled to avoid those areas. The Department issued its decision, which included findings of fact, conclusions of law, order, and opinion, approving the application for the transfer of ownership and location of the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\">\u00b65 The Protestors appealed to the District Court pursuant to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (MAPA). The Department appeared in the appeal to the District Court and participated in briefing. A hearing was held where for the first time, the Protestors objected to the Department being included as a party. The court allowed the Department to argue at the hearing in support of its decision to issue the license. The District Court affirmed the Department\u2019s decision. The Protestors appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b66 The standard of review of an administrative decision under MAPA applies to both the District Court\u2019s review of the administrative decision and this Court\u2019s subsequent review of the District Court\u2019s decision. <em>Hofer v. Montana DPHHS, </em>2005 MT 302, \u00b6 14, 329 Mont. 368, \u00b6 14, 124 P.3d 1098, \u00b6 14. The applicable standard of review is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-6\">The court may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court may affirm the decision of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. The court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-7\">(a) the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-8\">(v) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>substantial evidence on the whole record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-4\">(vi) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMf\">Section 2-4-704(2), MCA. A finding is clearly erroneous if a review of the record shows the findings are not supported by substantial evidence, the trier of fact misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves the Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Munn v. Montana Bd. of Medical Examiners, </em>2005 MT 303, \u00b6 15, 329 Mont. 401, \u00b6 15, 124 P.3d 1123, \u00b6 15 (citations omitted). We review a District Court\u2019s conclusions of law by determining whether the District Court correctly interpreted the law. <em>Munn, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b67 ISSUE 1: Was the Department a proper party on appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">\u00b68 The Protestors filed a petition for review of the Department\u2019s order allowing the transfer of the license to Hare\u2019s Ear. The Department appeared in the action by filing a motion to set a briefing schedule and a brief in opposition to the petition, defending its decision to issue a license. The Protestors filed a reply, but did not object to the Department\u2019s presence as a party until the hearing before the District Court. After listening to the objection, the District Court allowed the Department to present its argument on the merits. The Protestors again argue on appeal to this Court that the Department was not a proper party to the action in District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">\u00b69 The District Court\u2019s review of the Department\u2019s decision was confined to the record, as required by \u00a7 2-4-704(1), MCA. Hare\u2019s Ear and the Department made similar arguments opposing the petition for review to the District Court and on appeal to this Court. Even assuming arguendo that the Department was not a proper party to this action, since the District Court could have come to the same conclusion based solely on Hare\u2019s Ear\u2019s arguments and on its thorough review of the record, any reliance by the District Court on the Department\u2019s arguments constitutes harmless error. M. R. Civ. P. 61; <em>see Ekalaka Un. Bd. of Trus. v. Ekalaka Teach., </em>2006 MT 337, \u00b6 22, 335 Mont. 149, \u00b6 22, 149 P.3d 902, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">\u00b610 ISSUE 2: Did the District Court err in affirming the Department\u2019s approval of Hare\u2019s Ear\u2019s application for transfer of ownership and location of the liquor license?</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">\u00b611 An applicant seeking a liquor license must apply to the Department, and following an investigation carried out by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Montana Department of Justice, the Department of Revenue must determine whether the applicant is qualified to receive a license, the premises are suitable for the business, and that all laws and regulations are complied with. Section 16-4-402(1) and (2)(a), MCA. Before issuing the license, the Department must publish a notice of the license application in a newspaper of general circulation. Section 16-4-207, MCA. If the Department receives a certain number of written protests, the Department must hold a public hearing to determine whether the applicant is qualified and whether the application satisfies the requirements for public convenience and necessity. Section 16-4-207(3) and (4)(b), MCA. Section 16-4-405, MCA, provides that the Department has grounds to deny an application for a liquor license if any of the following criteria are met: (1) if the premises proposed for licensing are off regular police beats and cannot be properly policed by local authorities; (2) city or county zoning ordinances prohibit a license from being issued at the proposed premises; (3) the welfare of the people residing in the vicinity of the premises will be adversely and seriously affected; (4) there is not a public convenience and necessity justification; (5) a possible reason for denial listed in a conditional approval letter has been verified; or (6) the purposes of the licensing code would not be carried out if a license were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\">\u00b612 In this case, the Department published a notice that Hare\u2019s Ear had applied for transfer of ownership and location of the liquor license. The Department received eighty-three letters of protest to the proposed transfer, a sufficient number to necessitate a hearing for the determination of public convenience and necessity. The Department therefore held a hearing in Great Falls, as required by \u00a7 16-4-207, MCA. The Department considered each component of public convenience and necessity and found that Hare\u2019s Ear met the criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"A7i\">\u00b613 The Department also looked at the other disqualifying factors under \u00a7 16-4-405, MCA. Based on the evidence offered at the hearing, it found that the proposed premises was not off regular police beats, was not situated in a zoned area where the sale of alcoholic beverages is prohibited by ordinance, residents or other retail licensees located in the vicinity would not be adversely and seriously affected, the applicant and premises complied -with eligibility or suitability criteria provided by code, and that the purposes of the licensing code would be carried out if a license was issued. The Department considered these factors, weighed the evidence, and then made a determination that the liquor license should be issued because all laws were complied with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and there was no reason to deny the license. The Department noted that there was nothing unique about the specific location that presented a dangerous, inappropriate, or otherwise unsuitable situation. Further, it noted that the policy arguments that the Protesters made with regard to gambling would be more appropriately brought up in the legislature and with the city or zoning commission.</p>\n<p id=\"Azn\">\u00b614 The Protestors are appealing the Department\u2019s conclusion that transferring the liquor license to Hare\u2019s Ear would not adversely or seriously affect the welfare of residents in the vicinity. They contend that the transfer of the liquor license, which would then lead to the issuance of gambling machine permits, would indeed adversely and seriously affect the welfare of Gore Hill residents. They argue that the Department misapprehended the effect of the evidence provided by the residents, a clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, and medical doctor that gambling is bad for a community. The Protestors urge this Court that the transfer of the liquor license should not have been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">\u00b615 The Protestors\u2019 arguments in opposition to the liquor license and gambling raise very broad policy-type concerns. They argue that gambling can be addictive and lead to criminal behavior for some individuals, gambling should not be legal, or gambling should be restricted to certain areas of Great Falls. As the Department indicated, these arguments are better left to the legislature, which has chosen to legalize gambling. The most specific objection to the Jackrabbit Red\u2019s Casino was that, given its very busy, visible location, it would draw people in and the residents of Gore Hill, when driving by, would encounter dazed gamblers. Nonetheless, the Protestors failed to provide substantial evidence that demonstrated how Jackrabbit Red\u2019s Casino, located at least a half mile from the nearest home, would adversely affect the residents in the vicinity.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b616  A review of the record shows that there is substantial evidence to support the Department\u2019s findings and that it did not misapprehend the effect of the evidence. Further, we are not left with a definite or firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. Hare\u2019s Ear and the Department have demonstrated compliance with all laws with regard to the transfer of the liquor license, and there is no substantial evidence that would require that the Department deny the license.</p>\n<p id=\"Asu\">\u00b617 We affirm the judgment of the District Court affirming the Department\u2019s approval of Hare\u2019s Ear\u2019s application for transfer of ownership and location of Montana All-Alcoholic Beverages License No. 02-401-1287-001.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-6\">JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER, WARNER and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b391-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>JUSTICE RICE</author>\n<p id=\"A1f\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-3\">\u00b618 I concur with the Court\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">\u00b619 The District Court concluded that although the Protestors\u2019 generalized anti-gaming arguments \u201ccertainly are something to consider, they do not rise to the level of proof that\u2019s required under [\u00a7 16-4-405(3)(a), MCA].\u201d I agree with the District Court\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"A8d\">\u00b620 In choosing to legalize and regulate gaming, the Legislature was aware of the potential adverse consequences of the activity, and enacted legislation requiring Department review and approval prior to the opening of gaming establishments. Evidence of generalized gaming concerns is relevant in these proceedings and, depending on the proposed site of a gaming establishment, could be sufficient to prove a serious adverse impact upon \u201cthe welfare of the people residing ... in the vicinity.\u201d Section 16-4-405(3)(a), MCA. An example may be an attempt to locate an establishment directly adjacent to a school, hospital or church, the impacts upon which may be fairly self-evident. However, in the more typical case, as here, such generalized proof will be insufficient without evidence of adverse impacts specific to the vicinity of the proposed location. Here, such evidence was insufficient, the evidence in support of the application was substantial, and the Department\u2019s determination was appropriately entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b621 Lastly, a significant portion of the Protestors\u2019 briefing is dedicated to discussing the anti-gaming remarks made during the 1972 Constitutional Convention for the purpose of demonstrating that generalized gaming concerns are sufficient, in and of themselves, to prevail herein. However, despite the individual remarks made at the Convention, the delegates ultimately granted the Legislature, in Article III, Section 9, clear authority to legalize forms of gambling. The Legislature has done so by way of the statutory provisions at issue herein, and the Court has correctly applied them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
