The Estate consists, in large part, of a residence located on five acres of land in Stillwater County (the Fishtail property). Her daughters, Donielle and Lorielle, have been litigating for almost eight years over their respective rights to the Fishtail property. Their disagreement focuses on the following provision in Kathleen\u2019s will (the Fishtail provision):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-14\">Fishtail Property Acreage and Buildings-in dual name of Kathleen Lynch Ayers and Donielle Ayers Slanina, at this time, shall remain in her name. She has promised to share title and all duties with Lorielle Ayers Waisanen.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b35-15\">\u00b66 Kathleen and Donielle each owned a 50% undivided interest in the Fishtail property, as tenants in common, at the time of Kathleen\u2019s death. Donielle contends that the first sentence in the Fishtail provision indicates Kathleen\u2019s intent to devise her 50% share of the property to Donielle.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\u00b67 Donielle, acting as the Estate\u2019s personal representative, requested that the court construe the Fishtail provision. The District Court determined on March 20, 2003, that the will made no valid devise of the Fishtail property. The court ruled instead that the property should pass according to the laws of intestate succession as specified in \u00a7 72-2-111, MCA. The court ordered, pursuant to \u00a7 72-2-111, MCA, that Donielle and Lorielle each would receive half of the Estate\u2019s 50% interest in the Fishtail Property. Accordingly, Donielle would end up with a total of 75% interest in the property and Lorielle would end up with a total of 25% interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-4\">\u00b68 Donielle filed a \u201cFinal Report and Account; and Petition for Order of Complete Settlement of Estate\u201d (Final Report) with the court on June 23, 2004. The Final Report suggested, contrary to the court\u2019s interpretation of the will, that the court should distribute the Estate\u2019s entire 50% interest in the Fishtail property to Donielle. The Final Report stipulated that the Estate would pay Lorielle \u201cany difference that may result from the distribution to Donielle of the Fishtail Residence property that exceeds Donielle\u2019s equal share of the residue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApG\">\u00b69 Donielle notified Lorielle that the court would hold a hearing on August 26, 2004, regarding Donielle\u2019s Final Report. Lorielle objected to the notice of hearing in light of the fact that she had not received sufficient discovery to draft her objections to the Final Report. Lorielle pointed out that the court had ordered Donielle to comply with Lorielle\u2019s outstanding discovery requests within five days of June 30, 2004. The parties thereafter litigated for another two years over the discovery motion, discovery sanctions, various pieces of personal property in the Estate, and four \u201caddendums\u201d to Donielle\u2019s Final Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b610 Lorielle moved the court on May 24, 2006, to distribute the Fishtail property according to the court\u2019s March 20, 2003, order. The court held a hearing on August 3, 2006, to consider Lorielle\u2019s motion. Donielle filed a \u201cmemorandum\u201d that same day indicating that the proposed distribution of the Fishtail property would leave the Estate $4,506 in debt to Donielle. Donielle contended at the hearing that she would breach her fiduciary duty to the Estate if she were to distribute the property under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b611 The court questioned how its distribution order could cause Donielle to violate her fiduciary duties. The court pointed out that Donielle had included approximately $28,000 in attorney fees in her deficit calculation. The court stated that \u201cfrankly [those fees represent] a large... fee for an estate that is valued at a little over $100,000.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>court also expressed its desire to resolve this probate before the Estate is \u201call paid out in attorney fees and other costs.\u201d The court noted that \u201cwhether we\u2019re $4,500 short or not is certainly subject to conjecture at this point. But what is not subject to conjecture is that we\u2019re making no progress.\u201d The court granted Lorielle\u2019s motion for a deed of distribution, leaving Donielle with a 75% undivided interest in the property and Lorielle with a 25% undivided interest in the property. Donielle appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b37-5\">\u00b612 The judicial interpretation and construction of a will presents a question of law. <em>In re Estate of Snyder, </em>2000 MT 113, \u00b6 8, 299 Mont. 421, \u00b6 8, 2 P.3d 238, \u00b6 8. We review a district court's conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>In re Estate of Harms, </em>2006 MT 320, \u00b6 12, 335 Mont. 66, \u00b6 12, 149 P.3d 557, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s order regarding the partial distribution of estate assets for clear error or abuse of discretion. <em>Estate of Barber, </em>216 Mont. 26, 27-28, 699 P.2d 90, 91 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b37-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b37-7\">\u00b613 <em>Did the District Court correctly determine that the Fishtail property should pass to Donielle and Lorielle pursuant to the intestate succession statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 72-2-101-124, MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b37-8\">\u00b614 Donielle challenges the District Court\u2019s determination that Kathleen\u2019s will failed to devise the Fishtail property. We look to the testator\u2019s intent when construing a will. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. We interpret the words used in a will pursuant to their ordinary and grammatical sense unless a clear intention to use them in another sense can be ascertained. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>Matter of Estate of Bollinger, </em>284 Mont. 114, 121, 943 P.2d 981, 985 (1997)). Where the language is unclear, we ascertain the testator\u2019s intent from a consideration of the will as a whole, and a comparison of its various parts in the light of the circumstances surrounding the drafting of the will. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-9\">\u00b615 Donielle contends that the following phrase in the Fishtail provision represents Kathleen\u2019s intent to devise her 50% interest in the property to Donielle: \u201cFishtail Property Acreage and Buildings-in dual name of Kathleen Lynch Ayers and Donielle Ayers Slanina, at this time, shall remain in her name.\u201d The will\u2019s plain language indicates, however, that Kathleen misunderstood the nature of Donielle\u2019s interest in the Fishtail property. <em>Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. The will states that the Fishtail property, \u201cin dual name of Kathleen ... and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Donielle ..., at this time, shall remain in her name.\u201d Kathleen and Donielle each owned a 50% interest in the Fishtail property as tenants in common. Tenants in common own several and distinct titles to their property. <em>Matter of Estate of Garland, </em>279 Mont. 269, 276, 928 P.2d 928, 932 (1996); 20 Am. Jur. 2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership \u00a7 35 (Joseph J. Bassano et. al. eds., Thompson/West 2005). Donielle would have retained at least a 50% interest in the property regardless of Kathleen\u2019s wishes. Thus, the will indicates that Kathleen mistakenly assumed that she had authority over Donielle\u2019s ownership interest in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u00b616 The will\u2019s language also indicates that Kathleen mistakenly assumed that if she made no change to the Fishtail property\u2019s title, then 100% of the interest in the Fishtail property would revert to Donielle when Kathleen died. Kathleen appears to assume that she and Donielle were joint tenants with rights of survivorship. Joint tenants with rights of survivorship automatically gain their co-tenant\u2019s interest in the estate upon the co-tenant\u2019s death. <em>Garland, </em>279 Mont. at 272, 928 P.2d at 930; 20 Am. Jur. 2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership \u00a7 4 (Joseph J. Bassano et. al. eds., Thompson/West 2005). Kathleen reminds Donielle that \u201c[sjhe has promised to share title and all duties with Lorielle Ayers Waisanen.\u201d Kathleen\u2019s reminder to Donielle would be superfluous unless she assumed that Donielle held the sole right to survivorship in the Fishtail property.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">\u00b617 We previously have stated the general rule that \u201ca recital in a will of a conveyance of land which was not in fact made, or which proved to be ineffectual, will not operate as a devise ....\u201d <em>In re Watts\u2019 Estate, </em>117 Mont. 505, 519, 160 P.2d 492, 499 (1945). One treatise explains that \u201c[wjhere the testator in his will recites erroneously that he has conveyed certain of his real estate by deed to a certain named person, it does not show an intention to dispose of the property by will, but merely the testator\u2019s opinion as to the legal effect of some pre-existing instrument.\u201d William J. Bowe &amp; Douglas H. Parker, <em>Page on the Law of Wills, </em>vol. 4, \u00a7 30.18, 156 (3d ed., Matthew Bender &amp; Co., Inc., 2004); 96 Corpus Juris Secundum, Wills \u00a7 839 (Kevin J. Schroder ed., West Group 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-6\">\u00b618  The Fishtail provision represents Kathleen\u2019s false assumption as to the legal status of the Fishtail property\u2019s title. Kathleen mistakenly assumed that Donielle would take sole ownership to the Fishtail property by operation of law as the surviving joint tenant. In fact, Kathleen and Donielle held title as tenants in common, without any right of survivorship. <em>See Garland, </em>279 Mont. at 276, 928 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>932; 20 Am. Jur. 2d Cotenancy and Joint Ownership \u00a7 35 (Joseph J. Bassano et. al. eds., Thompson/West 2005). Kathleen\u2019s misstatement of Donielle\u2019s ownership interest in the Fishtail property cannot act as evidence of her intent to devise that property. <em>In re Watts\u2019 Estate, </em>117 Mont. at 519, 160 P.2d at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-4\">\u00b619 Donielle argues that the phrase \u201cshall remain in her name\u201d represents Kathleen\u2019s intent that the \u201cFishtail property was to remain solely in [Donielle\u2019s] name after the death of [Kathleen].\u201d She contends that we should construe this provision as devising Kathleen\u2019s 50% interest in the property to Donielle, leaving Donielle with sole title to the property. Donielle contends that her construction would explain why Kathleen reminded Donielle of her promise to share her title and duties with Lorielle.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">\u00b620 Donielle\u2019s interpretation of the Fishtail provision, however, would create an awkward and ambiguous bequest, uncharacteristic of other provisions in the will. <em>See Snyder, </em>\u00b6 10. The will repeatedly displays Kathleen\u2019s ability to devise property with clear language. The will provides, for example, that the \u201cLaurel Property and Buildings-shall be transferred to Donielle ... and Lorielle ... for dual ownership ...;\u201d \u201cHorse Trailer to Donielle ...;\u201d and \u201c[a]ll rifles, Shotguns, Handguns to go to John....\u201d The will indicates that Kathleen was capable of devising her Fishtail property interest in clear and simple terms had she intended to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"AY\">\u00b621  The District Court correctly determined that the will \u201cmakes no valid devise\u201d of the Estate\u2019s 50% interest in the Fishtail property. <em>Estate of Harms, </em>\u00b6 12. The court correctly concluded that the Estate\u2019s share of the Fishtail property should pass subject to the laws of intestate succession as specified in \u00a7 72-2-111, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-7\">\u00b622 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it ordered the Fishtail property to be distributed?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b39-8\">\u00b623 Donielle also challenges the District Court\u2019s order to distribute the Fishtail property on the basis that it places the Estate in a \u201cdeficit cash situation,\u201d and thereby causes Donielle to breach her fiduciary duty to preserve the Estate\u2019s assets. She bases her prediction that the court\u2019s order will bankrupt the Estate on calculations, however, that the court found speculative. She also fails to cite any authority for her novel proposition that the court\u2019s distribution order somehow could cause her to breach her fiduciary duties to the Estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">\u00b624  The court had reason to believe at the August 3,2006, hearing that the parties would be unable to conclude their dispute over the Fishtail property absent its order to distribute the property. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>had determined over three years earlier that Donielle and Lorielle should receive 75% and 25% of the Fishtail property respectively. Donielle and Lorielle nevertheless continued to fight over the property, including filing a pending motion for discovery sanctions and four addendums to the Estate\u2019s Final Account. The court noted that Donielle and Lorielle had made no progress in over seven years of probate and already had dissipated at least one-third of the Estate\u2019s value in attorney fees and expenses. We cannot say under these circumstances that the court abused its discretion or committed clear error when it determined that this probate \u201cneeds to come to a halt\u201d and that distributing the Fishtail property will \u201cbe helpful in moving [the probate] along.\u201d <em>Estate of Barber, </em>216 Mont. at 27-28, 699 P.2d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b40-4\">\u00b625 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b40-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES LEAPHART, WARNER, RICE, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
