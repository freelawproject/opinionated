We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-12\">\u00b62 Walker raises the following issues for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b552-13\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court properly ordered Walker to pay restitution to a bail bondsman as part of his sentence for bail jumping.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court properly considered uncharged conduct at Walker\u2019s sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">\u00b65 Law enforcement officers arrested Walker for burglary and partner family member assault in February 2005. The Justice Court set Walker\u2019s bond for $100,000. Barry Bail Bonds posted the $100,000 bond for Walker\u2019s release from jail on February 26, 2005. Walker charged four credit cards to pay for the $10,000 fee that Barry Bail Bonds charged for this service. Walker also charged a fifth credit card for a $200 cash advance from Barry Bail Bonds. Walker\u2019s credit cards initially cleared but later \u201cunraveled\u201d about a month after his release from jail. Barry Bail Bonds never received payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">\u00b66 Walker failed to appear for his arraignment in District Court on March 24,2005. The court issued a warrant for Walker\u2019s arrest. Barry Bail Bonds launched its own search for Walker, tracking him first to a house in Utah and then to Florida. Authorities eventually arrested Walker in Florida and extradited him to Butte.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\u00b67 The State charged Walker with felony bail jumping in violation of \u00a7 45-7-308(1), MCA, based on Walker\u2019s failure to appear for his March 24, 2005, arraignment. Walker pled guilty to the bail jumping charge. The District Court accepted Walker\u2019s plea and ordered a pre-sentence investigation report (PSI).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">\u00b68 Walker objected to portions of his criminal history recited in the PSI, including alleged, uncharged criminal conduct contained in a section of the PSI entitled \u201cOther Pertinent Information.\u201d The PSI noted that Walker allegedly had been the subject of two or more pending criminal investigations. The first investigation concerned the \u201cstolen or fraudulent\u201d credit cards that Walker had used to pay Barry Bail Bonds. The second investigation surrounded allegations by Walker\u2019s estranged wife that Walker had sexually abused her two daughters. Walker argued that the court could not consider the information concerning the pending investigations for the purposes of sentencing because such conduct had not been charged and remained unsubstantiated.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">\u00b69 The court allowed the information in the PSI concerning Walker\u2019s uncharged conduct and considered only the weight of the information. The court sentenced Walker to an eight-year commitment to the Montana Department of Corrections, with three of the eight years suspended. The court also ordered Walker to pay restitution in the amount of $11,150 to Barry Bail Bonds. Walker appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">\u00b610  We review a criminal sentencing for legality only, determining whether the sentence falls within the statutory parameters. <em>State v. Kuykendall, </em>2006 MT 110, \u00b6 8, 332 Mont. 180, \u00b6 8, 136 P.3d 983, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">\u00b611 <em>Whether the District Court properly ordered Walker to pay restitution to a bail bondsman as part of his sentence for bail jumping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8U\">\u00b612 Walker challenges for the first time on appeal the court\u2019s order requiring him to pay restitution to Barry Bail Bonds. Walker argues that the restitution does not correlate with the underlying crime, and, therefore, is invalid under <em>State v. Ommundson, </em>1999 MT 16, 293 Mont. 133, 974 P.2d 620. Walker also contends that the restitution order is invalid because Barry Bail Bonds does not qualify as a victim under \u00a7 46-18-241, MCA. Walker cites to <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 602 P.2d 997 (1979), for the proposition that he may raise these issues for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">\u00b613 We generally refuse to review on appeal an issue to which a party failed to object at the trial court. <em>State v. Kotwicki, </em>2007 MT 17, \u00b6 8, 335 Mont. 344, \u00b6 8, 151 P.3d 892, \u00b6 8. Our decision in <em>Lenihan </em>carved out an exception to the general rule by allowing appellate review of an allegedly illegal sentence even when the defendant raised no objection to the sentence at trial. We recognized that a defendant \u201coften times must remain silent even in the face of invalid conditions\u201d or risk the chance that a judge may impose a stiffer sentence upon raising an objection. <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000. We deemed it the \u201cbetter rule to allow an appellate court to review any sentence imposed in a criminal case, if it is alleged that such sentence is illegal or exceeds statutory mandates, even if no objection is made at the time of sentencing.\u201d <em>Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. at 343, 602 P.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">\u00b614 The <em>Lenihan </em>rule does not apply, however, in cases where a defendant did not remain silent at sentencing, but, instead, actively acquiesced or participated in the imposition of a condition of sentence. <em>State v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559. We held in <em>Micklon </em>that a defendant who had requested installment payments for restitution could not later rely on the <em>Lenihan </em>rule to challenge the court\u2019s imposition of interest on such installment payments. We concluded that the <em>Lenihan </em>rule did not apply in light of the fact that Micklon had \u201caffirmatively agreed to the inclusion of the interest condition in his sentence\u201d by telling the court that he would accept the interest payments. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u00b615 We narrowed the definition of \u201cactive acquiescence\u201d for the purposes of invoking the <em>Lenihan </em>rule in <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, 323 Mont. 287, 99 P.3d 661. We determined that Eaton\u2019s expression of remorse and willingness to make restitution payments did not rise to the level of active acquiescence or participation in his sentencing condition for the purposes of forestalling appellate review under <em>Lenihan. </em>We allowed appellate review of Eaton\u2019s sentence under the <em>Lenihan </em>rule based on the fact that Eaton\u2019s statements of remorse lacked any request to the trial court for specific sentencing conditions. <em>Eaton, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 13-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">\u00b616 We decline to apply the <em>Lenihan </em>rule here based on our decisions in <em>Micklon </em>and <em>Eaton. </em>Walker did not merely remain silent at sentencing. His statements to the court also do not reflect general expressions of remorse. Walker instead pronounced his willingness to pay restitution. Walker then used his assertion to bargain for a lighter sentence. Walker first expressed his desire to pay restitution to Parole and Probation Officer Brian Callarman (Callarman), who authored Walker\u2019s PSI report. Callarman testified at Walker\u2019s sentencing that Walker told him that he wanted to pay restitution to Barry Bail Bonds. Walker\u2019s lawyer then asked Callarman on cross examination whether \u201cMr. Walker would be an appropriate candidate to be placed in a prerelease so he could begin to pay any restitution if the court ordered.\u201d Callarman responded that a pre-release setting would be appropriate for Walker under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">\u00b617 Walker then testified at sentencing that he wanted to pay restitution. Walker testified that he \u201cwould like to pay [Barry Bail Bonds] back as quickly as possible.\u201d Walker\u2019s lawyer then argued for Walker\u2019s placement \u201cin a prerelease center\u201d or for a suspended sentence \u201cso that he can be out [of custody] and make the money to pay [Barry Bail Bonds] back.\u201d Walker\u2019s lawyer further explained to the court that a \u201cshort-term sentence\u201d would benefit both Walker and the victim, Barry Bail Bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">\u00b618  Walker\u2019s admission to the court that he intended to pay restitution to Barry Bail Bonds would not, by itself, constitute active acquiescence or participation in a sentencing condition. <em>Eaton, </em>\u00b6 13. The statement, when taken in context with the entire sentencing transcript, however, shows that Walker requested a lighter, less-restrictive sentence based on his stated desire to pay restitution. Walker\u2019s request constitutes active acquiescence and participation in the court\u2019s imposition of restitution as a sentencing condition. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10; <em>Eaton, </em>\u00b6 13. As a result, we conclude that Walker waived his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>right to raise the restitution issue for the first time on appeal. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">\n<em>\u00b619 Whether the District Court properly considered uncharged conduct at Walker\u2019s sentencing.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">\u00b620 Walker argues that the court improperly denied his request to exclude portions of the PSI report that alleged uncharged criminal conduct against Walker. Walker objected to the portion of the PSI report reciting statements made by Walker\u2019s estranged wife and David Wayne Barry of Barry Bail Bonds. The court allowed the statements to remain in the PSI. The court considered the weight of the statements at Walker\u2019s sentencing and assured Walker that his sentence would not be based on those factors. Walker contends on appeal that the statements constitute hearsay upon hearsay and should have been excluded from the PSI report. Walker acknowledges that the rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing hearings. Walker nevertheless argues that due process prohibits the court from \u201crelying on materially false information when sentencing a defendant.\u201d <em>Bishop v. State, </em>254 Mont. 100, 110, 835 P.2d 732, 738 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u00b621  The rules of evidence do not apply to sentencing hearings. <em>State v. Ferguson, </em>2005 MT 343, \u00b6 109, 330 Mont. 103, \u00b6 109, 126 P.3d 463, \u00b6 109. A sentencing court may \u201cconsider any relevant information relating to the nature and circumstances of the crime, the character of the defendant, the defendant\u2019s background and history, the defendant\u2019s mental and physical condition, and any other information that the sentencing court\u201d deems to have probative force. <em>State v. Harper, </em>2006 MT 259, \u00b6 22, 334 Mont. 138, \u00b6 22, 144 P.3d 826, \u00b6 22. We have held that the sentencing court may consider \u201cother acts, even those resulting in acquittal or which are dismissed pursuant to a plea bargain agreement.\u201d <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, \u00b6 23, 319 Mont. 117, \u00b6 23, 82 P.3d 903, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">\u00b622  The due process clauses of Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 17 of the Montana Constitution protect a defendant from being sentenced based on misinformation. Due process requires that the defendant be given an opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut any information that may lead to the deprivation of life, liberty, or property, including any information contained in a PSI. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 21. A defendant seeking to overturn a sentence by contesting information in a PSI maintains an affirmative duty to present information establishing inaccuracies. A party\u2019s mere claims of inaccuracies or misinformation within the PSI are insufficient to overturn a sentence. <em>Harper, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>\u00b623  Walker fails to support his due process claim with any \u201cexhibits or testimony which would explain or rebut\u201d the information in the PSI. <em>Harper, </em>\u00b6 21. Walker called no witnesses at his sentencing to explain or rebut the contested information in the PSI. Walker bypassed the opportunity to cross examine Barry and Callarman, the State\u2019s only witnesses, about any alleged misinformation contained in the PSI. Moreover, Walker never challenged the accuracy of the PSI during his own testimony before the sentencing court. Walker had ample opportunity to explain, argue, or rebut the information in the PSI. Walker points to no evidence or information, and we can find none in the record, that would establish inaccuracies in the PSI. Walker is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds where there is no information to correct or rebut. <em>Mason, </em>\u00b6 22. We conclude that the court properly allowed the uncharged conduct to remain in Walker\u2019s PSI report.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">\u00b624 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b557-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY and JUSTICE RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b557-6\">JUSTICE COTTER</author>\n<p id=\"AP1O\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">\u00b625 As to Issue 1, I agree with Justice Nelson\u2019s assertions in his Dissent to the effect that this Court should not allow a facially illegal sentence to stand, even if it was imposed at the acquiescence or invitation of the defendant. Nonetheless, I concur in the Court\u2019s decision to affirm the order of restitution because, in my judgment, it was a facially <em>legal </em>sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">\u00b626 Section 46-18-243(2)(a), MCA, defines a \u201cvictim,\u201d for restitution purposes, as \u201ca person who suffers loss of property ... as a result of the commission of an offense ....\u201d Such a victim is entitled to recover from the offender those damages he could \u201crecover against the offender in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the offender\u2019s criminal activities.\u201d Section 46-18-243(l)(a), MCA. The restitution sentence was imposed on the bail-jumping charge. There can be no question that Barry Bail Bonds, by virtue of posting the $100,000.00 bond on behalf of Walker, suffered a loss of property when Walker fled the jurisdiction without paying the cost of the bond. Nor can it be disputed that Bonds would have been entitled to recover his losses from Walker in a civil action. Therefore, I would conclude that the sentence was a legal one under the restitution statutes, and would affirm on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">\u00b627 As to Issue 2,1 join Justice Leaphart\u2019s Concurring Opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b557-10\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"Ay8\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-11\">\u00b628 I concur with the resolution of issue one.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>\u00b629 In <em>State v. Mason, </em>2003 MT 371, 319 Mont. 117, 82 P.3d 903, I dissented to the proposition that the State may introduce evidence of uncharged criminal conduct occurring at other times and places or against other victims. While I continue to adhere to that position, I recognize that our precedent in <em>Mason </em>now allows the introduction of such \u201cother conduct\u201d so long as it does not constitute misinformation. Under <em>State v. Harper, </em>2006 MT 259, 334 Mont. 138, 144 P.3d 826, the defendant has an affirmative duty to present information establishing inaccuracies. Here, while Walker argued that certain information in the PSI constituted uncharged criminal conduct, he failed to assert or come forward with any evidence that the information in the PSI was inaccurate. Accordingly, being bound by our precedent, I specially concur with the result in issue two.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b558-4\">JUSTICE NELSON,</author>\n<p id=\"ANJ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"Ax5\">\u00b630 I concur in the Court\u2019s decision with respect to Issue 2. Specifically, I agree that Walker failed to meet his burden of demonstrating that the contested information in the presentence investigation report was materially false or inaccurate. See Opinion, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">\u00b631 However, I strenuously dissent from the Court\u2019s decision with respect to Issue 1. Walker claims that his sentence is illegal \u2014 i.e., one that the District Comb did not have power to impose. See <em>State v. Hicks, </em>2006 MT 71, \u00b6 41, 331 Mont. 471, \u00b6 41, 133 P.3d 206, \u00b6 41 (\u201cA district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant is defined and constrained by statute, and the court has no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority.\u201d). The Court chooses not to reach the merits of Walker\u2019s claim on the ground that Walker \u201cbargain[ed] for,\u201d \u201cdesire[d],\u201d \u201cwanted,\u201d \u201crequested,\u201d and was \u201cwillingD\u201d to serve the allegedly unlawful sentence he received. Opinion, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 17, 18. This reasoning is wholly untenable. I cannot accept that a sentence, which may not be statutorily authorized and, thus, may not be one that the sentencing court had power to impose, is nevertheless beyond appellate review because the defendant \u201cbargain[ed] for,\u201d \u201cdesire[d],\u201d \u201cwanted,\u201d \u201crequested,\u201d or was \u201cwillingD\u201d to serve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">\u00b632 What if Walker (who apparently was interested in moving to Canada) had persuaded the prosecutor and the District Court that rather than impose the cost of incarceration on Montana taxpayers, banishment to Canada was the prudent and economical sentence to impose? Would we decline to address the State\u2019s challenge to the legality of that sentence on the ground that the prosecutor had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>\u201cbargain[ed] for\u201d and \u201cacquiesce[d]\u201d in the sentence? According to \u00b6\u00b6 16-18 of todays Opinion, we would.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">\u00b633 Yet, we recently suggested that an illegal sentence imposed pursuant to a plea agreement could be reviewed by this Court on direct appeal-notwithstanding the fact that the prosecutor and the defendant had \u201cbargain[ed] for\u201d that sentence. <em>See Hardin v. State, </em>2006 MT 272, \u00b6 19, 334 Mont. 204, \u00b6 19, 146 P.3d 746, \u00b6 19 (\u201cIf, for example, an offense carries a mandatory minimum of five years and counsel negotiates a plea for three years, which is accepted by the court, the sentence may be subject to direct challenge as being illegal.\u201d). Surely an illegal sentence negotiated, as here, with the sentencing judge and the probation and parole officer who prepared the presentence investigation report is no less reviewable than an illegal sentence negotiated with the prosecutor and memorialized in a plea agreement. The Court provides no basis for distinguishing between these two scenarios.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u00b634 Indeed, the Court\u2019s whole approach in this case lacks any basis in law, which is apparent when one analyzes the lone precedent relied on by the Court-State <em>v. Micklon, </em>2003 MT 45, 314 Mont. 291, 65 P.3d 559. (The Court also cites <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, 323 Mont. 287, 99 P.3d 661; however, <em>Eaton </em>merely recognizes and then distinguishes our holding in <em>Micklon. See Eaton, </em>\u00b6 13.) In <em>Micklon, </em>this Court held that Micklon\u2019s sentence was beyond our review because Micklon had \u201caffirmatively agreed\u201d to the inclusion of the allegedly illegal condition on his sentence. <em>Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10. As in the case at hand, however, the Court cited no authority to support the proposition that a potentially unlawful sentence is exempt from appellate review because the defendant \u201caffirmatively agreed\u201d to it. As a matter of fact, the sole basis of our holding was the principle that a defendant may not raise, for the first time on appeal, alleged <em>trial </em>errors in which he or she acquiesced or actively participated. <em>See Micklon, </em>\u00b6 10 (quoting <em>State v. Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 32, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 32). Significantly, neither <em>Harris </em>nor the cases cited therein applied the \u201cacquiescence\u201d rule to an allegedly <em>illegal sentence. </em>Thus, our decision in <em>Micklon </em>is as lacking in foundation as is the Court\u2019s decision herein; and the Court\u2019s reliance on <em>Micklon, </em>therefore, amounts to nothing more than appellate bootstrapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">\u00b635 If a district court\u2019s authority in sentencing a criminal defendant truly \u201cis defined and constrained by statute,\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>\u00b6 41, if a district court truly \u201chas no power to impose a sentence in the absence of specific statutory authority,\u201d <em>Hicks, </em>\u00b6 41, and if the sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>authority of a court truly \u201cexists solely by virtue of a statutory grant of power and therefore cannot be exercised in any manner not specifically authorized,\u201d <em>State v. Lenihan, </em>184 Mont. 338, 342, 602 P.2d 997, 1000 (1979) (internal quotation marks omitted), then any sentence imposed without specific statutory authority is plainly null and void. In my view, there is no plausible reason why this Court should refuse to determine whether a sentence is null and void; I certainly cannot accept the syllogism that a defendant\u2019s success in \u201cbargaining] for\u201d what he believes is a lighter sentence can sustain what in actuality may be a null and void sentence. Such reasoning is akin to stating that subject-matter jurisdiction can be conferred by the parties-a proposition that also lacks foundation. <em>See In re Marriage of Miller, </em>259 Mont. 424, 427, 856 P.2d 1378, 1380 (1993) (\u201cIt is ... a settled rule that subject matter jurisdiction cannot be waived nor conferred by consent of a party where there is no basis for jurisdiction under the law.\u201d); <em>accord Stanley v. Lemire, </em>2006 MT 304, \u00b6 31, 334 Mont. 489, \u00b6 31, 148 P.3d 643, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">\u00b636 In point of fact, we have already rejected the approach taken by the Court in the case at hand. In <em>State v. Evert, </em>2004 MT 178, 322 Mont. 105, 93 P.3d 1254, Evert (through counsel), the prosecutor, and the district court all agreed to resentence Evert approximately five years after his original, final, and legal sentence was pronounced. In determining that the district court lacked authority to do so, we observed that \u201c[although both the County and Evert agreed to the resentencing, jurisdiction [to review and modify Evert\u2019s original sentence] cannot be conferred by consent.\u201d <em>Evert, </em>\u00b6 17 (citing <em>Vannatta v. Boulds, </em>2003 MT 343, \u00b6 16, 318 Mont. 472, \u00b6 16, 81 P.3d 480, \u00b6 16). We thus held that the judgment entered pursuant to the resentencing was invalid. <em>Evert, </em>\u00b6 17. We did so notwithstanding the fact that all persons involved-Evert, his counsel, the prosecutor, and the sentencing judge-had negotiated their way around the sentencing statutes. It is entirely inconsistent, therefore, for the Court today to decline to consider whether the District Court had power to impose Walker\u2019s sentence because Walker \u201cbargained] for\u201d that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"Amh\">\u00b637 The Court\u2019s ultimate conclusion under Issue 1 is that Walker \u201cwaived his right\u201d to challenge the allegedly illegal portion of his sentence on appeal. Opinion, \u00b6 18. Such an approach with respect to our review of sentences ignores the fundamental principle that \u201cthe waiver concept was never intended as a means of allowing a criminal defendant to choose his own sentence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. McKenna, </em>383 A.2d 174, 181 (Pa. 1978). It is not only legally indefensible, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>also ill-advised to hold, as the Court does today, that a defendant may negotiate whatever sentence he or she pleases, irrespective of the will of the Legislature and subject only to the predilections of the prosecutor and the sentencing judge at the time of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b638 Indeed, having sat on hundreds of appeals involving sentencing errors, I am convinced that far too many sentences are imposed in either complete ignorance or total disregard on the parts of defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the sentencing court of the sentencing statutes enacted by the Legislature. <em>Evert </em>provides a glaring example. In deliberately going forward with a patently illegal sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor candidly stated on the record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">[B]y statute and by numerous rulings by the Supreme Court,... a district court judgment, once it has been passed, is basically set in stone. However, it\u2019s always been my practice-and also been the practice of this [district court]-that if a Defendant who has previously been sentenced appears before either myself or you and shows good cause as to why his sentence should be amended, generally mitigated, we don\u2019t object to that. <em>We don\u2019t hold firm to the technicalities of the statute or the Supreme Court rulings.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqR_\"><em>Evert, </em>\u00b6 6 (emphasis added, paragraph break and internal quotation marks omitted). Rightly, the <em>Evert </em>Court was appalled. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">The laws of the State of Montana are written to ensure that justice is served and the well-being of society and individuals is safe-guarded. Contrary to the County Attorney's pronouncement to the District Court that \u201cwe don\u2019t hold firm to the technicalities of the statute or the Supreme Court rulings,\u201d adherence to the legislative enactments and the decisions of this Court is not a matter of convenience or prosecutorial preference. <em>No court or officer of the court has the prerogative of circumventing or modifying the procedures established by law.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-7\"><em>Evert, </em>\u00b6 19 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\u00b639 Today\u2019s Opinion and <em>Micklon </em>fly in the face of <em>Everts </em>strong admonishment to sentencing courts and counsel. We should be requiring that the laws of the State of Montana be followed and that trial courts sentence within the parameters of, and pursuant to the procedures specified in, the applicable sentencing statutes. Simply stated, we should be mandating that the bench and bar adhere to the enactments of the Legislature. Instead, with this decision, the Court chooses to turn a blind eye to a potentially illegal sentence and thus empower defense counsel, prosecutors, and sentencing courts to flout the sentencing statutes. \u201cIf this Court will not hold district courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>county attorneys to the requirements so clearly spelled out by the Montana Legislature, who will?\u201d <em>In re A.S., </em>2006 MT 281, \u00b6 64, 334 Mont. 280, \u00b6 64, 146 P.3d 778, \u00b6 64 (Gray, C.J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b640 For these reasons, I respectfully, but strenuously, dissent from the Court\u2019s decision under Issue 1 not to review the legality of Walker\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b562-5\">JUSTICE WARNER joins the dissent:</judges>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">While the language is more strident than I would choose, I am of the opinion that Justice Nelson\u2019s dissent is correct, and I join it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
