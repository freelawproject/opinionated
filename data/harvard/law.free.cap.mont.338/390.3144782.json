Brown (Brown) appeals from the order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Ninth Judicial District Court, Toole County, affirming the dismissal of his complaint in the Small Claims Division of the Toole County Justice Court (Small Claims Court). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in affirming the Small Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies?</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">\u00b64 Brown is an inmate at Crossroads Correctional Center (Crossroads), a private prison located in Shelby, Montana, which operates under a contract with the Department of Corrections (DOC). Brown filed a complaint in the Small Claims Court, which alleged that he had \u201chired a paralegal office (Constitutional Alternatives) to do legal research and typing of brief for court\u201d and that Crossroads Warden James MacDonald \u201cdenied access to law office.\u201d The complaint asserted that the Defendant was indebted to Brown in the amount of $2,250 for \u201cservices lost.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">\u00b65 At the hearing in the Small Claims Court, Judge Jack Stokes placed Brown and MacDonald under oath. Warden MacDonald offered an oral motion to dismiss the case for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, offering that exhaustion was required by this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nordholm v. MacDonald, </em>2006 MT 280N, 335 Mont. 397, 149 P.3d 913 (table), that Crossroads followed \u201cPolicy 3.3.3 of the Montana Department of Corrections,\u201d that he had received a letter from Brown but that there was \u201ca series of things\u201d to be done under the grievance process, and that Brown had failed to follow the remedies available to him prior to filing suit. Brown indicated that he had received a response from MacDonald indicating \u201cthat I had met the procedures of the grievance issue.\u201d Based upon this sworn testimony and argument, the judge concluded that Brown had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and dismissed the complaint. Neither the grievance policy nor the regulations on which it was based were offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">\u00b66 Brown appealed to the District Court, which concluded that MacDonald had asserted a defense of failure to exhaust remedies at his first opportunity in the small claims process, that the policies of Crossroads \u201cprovide a means to address all forms of complaints arising within the facility,\u201d and that the Small Claims Court \u201cdid not commit a mistake of law when it dismissed the complaint of Plaintiff for failure to exhaust remedies.\u201d Brown appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">\u00b67 A district court\u2019s inquiry on appeal from a small claims court is limited to determining whether the small claims court correctly resolved questions of law. Section 25-35-803(2), MCA. \u201cAlthough the district court review is limited to questions of law, the question of whether the small claims court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous is such a question of law.\u201d <em>Spence v. Ortloff, </em>271 Mont. 533, 535, 898 P.2d 1232, <em>1233 </em>(1995). This Court applies the same standard as the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">\u00b68 A three-step test is used to determine whether the findings are clearly erroneous. First, a court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if not supported by substantial credible evidence. Second, a court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if the court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence. Finally, a court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if a review of the record leaves the reviewing court with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Spence, 271 </em>Mont. at 535, 898 P.2d at 1233.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court err in affirming the Small Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust administrative </em>remedies?</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">\u00b610 Brown argues, as he did to the District Court, that he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing a complaint in the Small Claims Court. Brown argues that neither the Montana Rules of Justice and City Court Civil Rules, the Montana Uniform Rules of Justice and City Courts, nor the statutory provisions relating to procedures in the Montana Justice and City Courts require a plaintiff to exhaust administrative remedies in order to file an action in small claims court, and thus, this Court should remand this case to that court for a trial on the merits of his complaint. Brown also maintains that, even if there was an exhaustion requirement, Warden MacDonald never advised Brown that he needed to exhaust Crossroads\u2019 grievance process before seeking judicial relief at the time Brown sent him the demand letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">\u00b611 Warden MacDonald responds that the grievance policy requires inmates to exhaust administrative remedies in all cases before seeking judicial relief, and Brown\u2019s failure to do so requires that we affirm the District Court. MacDonald also argues that, because the Small Claims Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, it lacked jurisdiction to entertain Brown\u2019s complaint, which he argues was, on its face, a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, because Brown claimed he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>denied access to legal services. Lastly, Warden MacDonald insists that even if that court had jurisdiction, Brown cannot recover damages for denial of access to Constitutional Alternatives because Brown, as an inmate, had no right to receive assistance from non-lawyers outside the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">\u00b612  First addressing MacDonald\u2019s contention that this is a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, we note that \u201c[sjeetion 1983 \u2018is not itself a source of substantive rights, but merely provides a method for vindicating federal rights elsewhere conferred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Jones v. Montana University System, </em>2007 MT 82, \u00b6 32, 337 Mont. 1, \u00b6 32, 155 P.3d 1247, \u00b6 32 (quoting <em>Albright v. Oliver, </em>510 U.S. 266, 271, 114 S. Ct. 807, 811 (1994); <em>Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 393-94, 109 S. Ct. 1865, 1870 (1989)). To make out a cause of action under \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant is acting under the color of state law and has deprived plaintiff of his rights as secured by the federal constitution and federal statutes. <em>WMX Technologies, Inc. v. Miller, </em>80 F.3d 1315, 1318 (9th Cir. 1996) (citing <em>Gibson v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 1334, 1338 (9th Cir. 1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1054, 107 S. Ct. 928 (1987)). Therefore, the first step in evaluating whether a \u00a7 1983 claim exists is to identify the specific federal constitutional or statutory right allegedly infringed. <em>Graham, </em>490 U.S. at 394, 109 S. Ct. at 1870.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">\u00b613 Brown\u2019s complaint did not assert that a federal constitutional or statutory right had been infringed, stating only:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-6\">Comes now, Anthel LaVan Brown the Plaintiff, being first duly sworn, upon oath, and complains and alleges that Defendant is indebted to Plaintiff in the sum of $2,250.00 for Services Lost. Hired a paralegal office (Constitutional Alternatives) to do legal research and typing of Brief for court. MacDonald has denied access to law office ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">The complaint merely sought reimbursement for services lost from Constitutional Alternatives when MacDonald allegedly denied access to that office. A \u00a7 1983 claim that would have exceeded the jurisdiction of the Small Claims Court is not made out by the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b614 MacDonald\u2019s related argument-that because Constitutional Alternatives is not operated by or does not provide services by a lawyer, Brown\u2019s constitutional right to access to the courts and counsel was not denied-is not supported by the record. The complaint itself is contradictory on this point, describing Constitutional Alternatives as both a \u201cparalegal office\u201d and a \u201claw office.\u201d The Small Claims Court took no evidence regarding Constitutional Alternatives, its principals, or the services it provides. Nor did MacDonald introduce evidence of correctional policies which would restrict an inmate\u2019s communication <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>to those outside the prison, whether legal advisors or lay persons. While such policies may provide a defense to MacDonald, the policies were not raised as a defense in the Small Claims Court and evidence was not introduced to establish the policies. Thus, without a factual foundation, the issue was not preserved and we cannot resolve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b615 Lastly, the District Court affirmed the Small Claims Court by concluding that \u201c[t]he policies of the Crossroads Correctional Center provide a means to address all forms of complaints arising within the facility. Plaintiff did not follow this procedure.\u201d The testimony from MacDonald was that this Court required exhaustion of administrative remedies in <em>Nordholm, </em>that Crossroads had adopted a policy requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies pursuant to Policy 3.3.3 of the Montana Department of Corrections, and that Brown had failed to follow that process, which MacDonald referenced as a \u201cmulti-step\u201d policy. Brown disputed that evidence, indicating that he had submitted a letter and had received a response from MacDonald advising him that he had followed the procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">\u00b616 However, MacDonald did not offer the grievance policy for introduction into evidence, nor the DOC policy upon which it was allegedly based. We would note that MacDonald\u2019s citation <em>to Nordholm </em>was unavailing, as that decision was an \u201cunpublished\u201d memorandum decision which, pursuant to Section I, Paragraph 3(d)(v), Montana Supreme Court 1996 Internal Operating Rules (2003), may not be cited as precedent. Likewise, the letter from MacDonald which Brown referenced was not introduced. Without evidence of the applicable policies, we are unable to determine the nature and requirements of the grievance procedure and whether it was complied with. The record which remains is the parties\u2019 conflicting statements under oath regarding whether the procedure was satisfied. On this record, we cannot conclude that there was substantial evidence to support the Small Claims Court\u2019s implicit factual determination that Brown failed to satisfy the procedure and that, in turn, such failure warranted dismissal as a matter of law. As a practical matter and in hindsight, it may have been more productive to have conducted the hearing so that a better record with regard to these issues was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b617  We conclude that the District Court erred in affirming the Small Claims Court\u2019s dismissal of Brown\u2019s complaint for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. We reverse and remand to the Small Claims Court for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<judges id=\"b416-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
