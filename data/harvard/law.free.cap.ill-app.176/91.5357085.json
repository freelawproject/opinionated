The agent without authority from the lessor delivered an unsigned draft of a lease to the husband for a longer term.

Braithwaite moved out of the house in October, 1909, and employed Dean to rent it. John M. Casmire, his wife and daughter May moved into the house soon after it was vacated. May 3,1910, defendants in error \"brought an action of forcible detainer against Mrs. John F. Gasmire, the plaintiff in error, in the municipal court, had judgment for the possession of the premises, and she sued out this writ of error. On the trial of the cause May Gasmire testified that she applied to Dean to rent a house in October, 1909; that Dean said he had a house belonging to Horn which could be rented; that witness told Dean that she wanted a lease for two or three years; that Dean said he thought it could be arranged and would communicate with Horn, and showed her the house; that later on she and her father and mother moved in; that she then asked Dean about the lease and Dean said it would be all right and handed her a writing to have her father sign, which was introduced in evidence by defendant and is a draft of an unsigned lease from Horn to J. F. Gasmire of the house for one year from May 1, 1910; that she paid with her father\u2019s money the rent for November and December to Dean and for January, February, March and April to Braithwaite; that at the time of the trial her father was living with her mother and herself in the house.</p><attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-4\" pgmap=\"122\">Caswell &amp; Healy, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys><attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-5\" pgmap=\"122\">Garret V.

There is in the record no evidence tending to show that Dean had any authority from Horn to rent the house, or that Horn in any way ratified anything that Dean did in respect to leasing the house; nor is there any evidence that either Horn or the defendants in error made an agreement with any one to extend Braithwaite\u2019s term, or grant a new term after the expiration of his term.</p> <p id=\"b123-4\" pgmap=\"123\">Where the term expires no notice to quit is necessary, and the lessee or any person claiming under him is by the express provision of the act liable to this action.</p> <p id=\"b123-5\" pgmap=\"123\">Plaintiff in error further contends that she was not a proper party. There is no evidence that any one of the Gasmires took possession of the house under an agreement with any one. May Gasmire testified to a conversation with Dean, but not to any agreement with him or consent that her father might take possession of the house, and that, \u201clater on she and her father and mother moved in.\u201d Mrs. Gasmire did not on the trial contend that she was not in possession of the house, but contended that plaintiff could not maintain the action because Dean had given to her daughter the draft of a lease from Horn to her husband for one year from May 1, 1910, which draft was not signed either by the proposed lessor or lessee. We think that from the evidence the court might properly find that she was a proper party defendant. Whether her husband should also have been made a defendant is a question not presented by the record. The evidence clearly shows that plaintiffs were entitled to the possession of the house when the action was brought, and the judgment is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"Ak\" pgmap=\"123\">Affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
