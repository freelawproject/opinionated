The lower court erred in refusing to allow plaintiffs to prove at trial that the factual assumptions underlying the statute are erroneous and that the statute is unconstitutional. <em>(Borden\u2019s Co. v Baldwin, </em>293 US 194; <em>Society of Plastics Ind. v City of New York, </em>68 Misc 2d 366; <em>Wolff Co. v Industrial Ct., </em>262 US 522; <em>Chastleton Corp. </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>264 US 543; <em>Williams v Rhodes, </em>393 US 23; <em>Kramer v Union School Dist., </em>395 US 621; <em>Salyer Land Co. v Tulare Water Dist., </em>410 US 719; <em>Matter of Dart v Howell, </em>45 AD2d 47; <em>Sonmax, Inc. v City of New York, </em>89 Misc 2d 945; <em>Darweger v Staats, </em>267 NY 290.)

III. The court below was correct to grant defendants leave to amend the answer to assert that the third and fourth causes of action are untimely pursuant to subdivision 7 of section 202 of the State Administrative Procedure Act and CPLR 217, which was alleged in the third affirmative defense of the intervenor-defendant. <em>(Matter of Hans v Burns, </em>48 AD2d 947; <em>Matter of Temple Israel of Lawrence v Plaut, </em>10 Misc 2d 1084; <em>Matter of Winter v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>63 Misc 2d 451.) IV. The court below was correct to deny appellants\u2019 application to proceed with depositions of Federal Food and Drug Administration officials in Maryland, because a favorable decision would interpret the complaint in such a manner as to sustain the second cause of action (equal protection).

(L 1977, ch 776.) In our view, the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d is a reasonable exercise of the State\u2019s police power and is rationally related to the legitimate purpose of safely reducing health care costs. We hold that the challenged law is constitutional and, therefore, affirm the order of the Appellate Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Disturbed by the ever increasing cost of prescription drugs, this State adopted the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d (the Law) in 1977 (L 1977, ch 776).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>enactment of the Law, pharmacists were prohibited from \u201csubstituting] or dispensing] a different article for or in lieu of any article prescribed, ordered or demanded\u201d. (Education Law, former \u00a7 6816, subd 1.) Besides creating an exception to this antisubstitution provision for generic drugs, the new law added section 206 (subd 1, par [o]) to the Public Health Law and sections 6810 (subd 6) and 6816-a to the Education Law. Under section 206 (subd 1, par [o]) of the Public Health Law, the New York State Commissioner of Health is required to promulgate a list of drug products which have been certified or approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as being safe and effective for their indicated uses and for which there is no question of satisfying bioequivalency requirements. Following extensive consultation with the FDA, the Department of Health published its list of therapeutically equivalent drug products in March, 1978. (See 10 NYCRR Subpart 60-2.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Subdivision 6 of section 6810 of the Education Law provides that every prescription form used in this State shall contain two signature lines, one stating \u201csubstitution permissible\u201d and the other stating \u201cdispense as written\u201d. If the physician signs the \u201csubstitution permissible\u201d line, then he must \u201cinform the patient that the pharmacist will substitute a drug product\u201d which appears on the Department of Health\u2019s list of generic substitutes. This section also provides that on each prescription form the following words must be conspicuously imprinted: \u201cThis prescription will be filled generically unless physician signs on line stating \u2018dispense as written\u2019.\u201d (Education Law, \u00a7 6810, subd 6, par [a].)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Under section 6816-a of the Education Law, a pharmacist is required to \u201csubstitute a less expensive drug product containing the same active ingredients, dosage form and strength as the drug product prescribed\u201d if the physician signs the \u201csubstitution permissible\u201d line and the substituted drug product appears on the Department of Health\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>list. Finally, the pharmacist is required, in the event of substitution, to indicate on the label affixed to the immediate container in which the generic drug is dispensed the name and strength of the drug product and its manufacturer.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In their complaint, plaintiffs set forth seven causes of action. The first cause of action alleges that the Law promotes unfair competition and the infringement of drug patents and trade-marks held by plaintiffs. The second cause of action alleges that the Law unlawfully discriminates against brand name drug products by creating defenses to claims for unfair competition and patent and trade-mark infringement. The third and fourth causes of action allege that defendants, in implementing the new law, failed to comply with the State Administrative Procedure Act and exceeded their statutory authority by including certain drugs on the Department of Health\u2019s substitution list which do not qualify. The fifth cause of action alleges that the Law imposes an unnecessary burden on interstate commerce. The sixth cause of action alleges that, by interfering with medical relationships between pharmacists and patients and by restricting the patients\u2019 right to make health-related decisions respecting the choice of drug products, the Law abridges the so-called \u201cright to privacy between pharmacist and patient.\u201d Finally, in their seventh cause of action, plaintiffs allege that the Law deprives them of liberty and property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">Special Term, <em>inter alia, </em>granted defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment to the extent of declaring the Law constitutional and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 first, second, fifth, sixth and seventh causes of action. The third and fourth causes of action were expressly severed and continued as article 78 proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> According to Special Term, \u201c[pjlaintiffs have failed to meet the heavy burden imposed on a party who seeks to overcome the strong presumption of constitutionality inherent in every statute enacted by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>the Legislature.\u201d The Appellate Division unanimously affirmed, without opinion, and plaintiffs brought this appeal as of right on constitutional grounds. (CPLR 5601, subd [b], par 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In this court, plaintiffs assert that the courts below erred in granting summary judgment upholding the constitutionality of the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d. Although plaintiffs concede that this State has a legitimate interest in providing safe and effective drugs to its citizens at the lowest possible price, they assert that the Law is not rationally related to the attainment of this objective. Specifically, plaintiffs contend that the factual assumption underlying the Law \u2014 that generic drug products approved by the FDA are therapeutically equivalent to and may be safely substituted for their brand name counterparts \u2014 is not based on competent pharmacological and medical data and, therefore, that the Law is an unreasonable exercise of the police power. According to plaintiffs, the Legislature failed to make any independent findings concerning the therapeutic equivalence, safety and efficacy of generic drugs and, instead, unreasonably adopted the FDA\u2019s findings as to drug product substitution. Relying on various affidavits, scientific studies, documentary evidence and the opinion of their own pharmacological expert, plaintiffs assert that questions of fact exist as to the therapeutic equivalence and safety of drug products on the Department of Health\u2019s substitution list which must be developed at trial. We find all of plaintiffs\u2019 contentions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The principles of law applicable to the facts of this case are by now well established. Where a police power enactment is challenged on due process grounds, the test is whether there is \u201c \u2018some fair, just and reasonable connection\u2019 between it and the promotion of the health, comfort, safety and welfare of society.\u201d <em>(Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41, 54.) Moreover, every legislative enactment enjoys a strong presumption of constitutionality which, although rebuttable, requires the challenging party to demonstrate that the enactment is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., <em>Robert E. Kurzius, Inc. v Incorporated Vil. of Upper Brookville, </em>51 NY2d 338, 344; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><em>Town of Huntington v Park Shore County Day Camp of Dix Hills, </em>47 NY2d 61, 65; <em>Montgomery v Daniels, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The parties agree that the standard of review applicable to this case is the familiar \u201crational basis\u201d test, and, as noted earlier, plaintiffs concede that safely providing prescription drugs at a reduced price is a legitimate State objective. The only question that remains is whether the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d is rationally related to the achievement of that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Contrary to plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the Legislature did not act in a frivolous manner in enacting the Law. In the months preceding its adoption, numerous hearings were held at which the question of therapeutic equivalence was extensively debated. Detailed evidence for and against the Law, including some of the exact proof relied on by plaintiffs in this case, was submitted to the Legislature. In the end, the Legislature obviously determined that \u201c[ajllegations that generic drugs are not as safe and effective as brand name drugs have been disproved by an accumulation of evidence.\u201d (NY Legis Ann, 1977, p 259.) To now allow plaintiffs to relitigate, in the guise of a constitutional challenge, the very same factual determination made by the Legislature as to the therapeutic equivalence of generic drugs would be most inappropriate. Indeed, \u201cit would be a demonstration of judicial arrogation and highly inept and inapt to express any opinion as to the factual predicate for this legislation\u201d. <em>(Montgomery v Daniels, </em>38 NY2d 41, 53, <em>supra.) </em>The bare existence of conflicting empirical proof on the issue whether generic drugs may or may not be safely substituted for their brand name counterparts is insufficient to raise any real question as to the Law\u2019s constitutionality; nor may plaintiffs \u201cprocure invalidation of the legislation merely by tendering evidence in court that the legislature was mistaken.\u201d <em>(Minnesota v Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 US 456, 464; cf. <em>Town of North Hempstead v Exxon Corp., </em>53 NY2d 747.)</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Similarly, we cannot say that the Legislature acted unreasonably in directing the Department of Health to rely on, although not to defer to, the FDA\u2019s specific findings of therapeutically equivalent drug products in compil<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>ing New York\u2019s list of permissible generic substitutes. The FDA is given the responsibility of assuring the supply of safe and effective drugs on a national level. (See US Code, tit 21, \u00a7 355.) This Federal agency has both superior expertise and extensive resources at its disposal, and the test it employs in certifying drugs as safe and effective is truly \u201ca rigorous one\u201d. <em>(Weinberger v Hynson, Wescott &amp; Dunning, </em>412 US 609, 630.) Plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the Legislature must conduct <em>de novo </em>an independent investigation into the therapeutic equivalence of each drug placed on the Department of Health\u2019s list of substitutes is supported neither by sound principles of constitutional law nor common sense. If plaintiffs entertain definite fears as to the safety of particular drugs found on the list of substitutes, then they should provide the Department of Health with this information. Instead, they have launched this broadsided attack on the constitutional validity of the Law.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contentions require only a brief discussion. The \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d does not promote unfair competition or the infringement of drug patents and trade-marks; nor does the Law create any defenses to such claims. In order to comply with the Law, a pharmacist is not required to stock or sell an infringing generic substitute, and, as noted by Special Term, plaintiffs\u2019 rights and remedies under the patent and trade-mark laws are the same now as they were prior to the passage of the Law. In this regard, it is also worth noting that an official from the Department of Health testified that the list of substitutes would be revised to reflect the judicial resolution of any patent or trade-mark dispute involving drug products.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Nor are we persuaded by plaintiffs\u2019 commerce clause claim. The Law does not discriminate between in-State and out-of-State manufacturers and, as discussed earlier, it serves a legitimate State interest by providing New York patients with the benefits of low-priced medication. Plaintiffs have come forth with no showing that \u201cthe burden imposed on [interstate] commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.\u201d <em>(Pike v Bruce Church, </em>397 US 137,142.) Absent something more definite than plaintiffs\u2019 bare allegation that the Law imposes an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>unnecessary burden on interstate commerce, the constitutionality of the Law should be sustained. (Accord <em>Pharmaceutical Soc. of State of N. Y. v Lefkowitz, </em>586 F2d 953, 957-958; compare <em>Monroe-Livingston Sanitary Landfill v Town of Caledonia, </em>51 NY2d 679, <em>with. Dutchess Sanitation Serv. v Town of Plattekill, </em>51 NY2d 670.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Finally, the Law suffers no constitutional infirmity by reason of abridging some ephemeral \u201cright to privacy between pharmacist and patient.\u201d In the first place, it is doubtful whether any such right exists, and plaintiffs have cited no authority to support the proposition that it does. True, the Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional \u201cinterest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions\u201d <em>(Whalen v Roe, </em>429 US 589, 599-600), including a patient\u2019s \u201cright to decide independently, with the advice of his physician, to acquire and use needed medication\u201d <em>(Whalen v Roe, supra, </em>at p 603). Even though the \u201c \u2018outer limits\u2019 of the decision-making aspect of the right to privacy \u2018have not been marked by the Court\u2019\u201d <em>(People v Onofre, </em>51 NY2d 476, 486, quoting <em>Carey v Population Servs. Int., </em>431 US 678, 684-685), the right to privacy typically has been held to encompass only \u201cmatters relating to marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education.\u201d <em>(Paul v Davis, </em>424 US 693, 713.)</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In any event, assuming the existence of such a right to privacy, it is not violated by the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d. As licensed health professionals, pharmacists are subject to the State\u2019s \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the administration of drugs.\u201d <em>(Whalen v Roe, supra, </em>at p 603, n 30 [and cases cited therein].) As to the patient\u2019s right to privacy, aside from the obvious difficulty with plaintiffs\u2019 standing to assert this right, we are in agreement with the views expressed by the Second Circuit, which addressed a similar claim: \u201cThe decision to use a brand name or generic drug, and which brand name to use, remains as before with the doctor and the patient; the provisions of the Generic Drug Act only come into play <em>after </em>their initial choice (usually that of the doctor) has been made between \u2018dispense as written\u2019 and \u2018substitution permissible\u2019. Here, as under prior law, there is no depriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>tion of the right of the patient, with the advice of his or her doctor, to decide on the proper medication.\u201d <em>(Pharmaceutical Soc. of State of N. Y. v Lefkowitz, </em>586 F2d 953, 958, <em>supra </em>[emphasis in original].) Indeed, as defendants note, by providing the patient with information concerning less expensive drug substitutes, the Law has the beneficial effect of broadening the patient\u2019s choice in terms of needed medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">In sum, the \u201cGeneric Drug Substitution Law\u201d does not promote unfair competition or patent or trade-mark infringement; nor is the Law violative of due process, the commerce clause, or the so-called patient-pharmacist \u201cright to privacy\u201d. The Law merely facilitates the exercise of the physician\u2019s responsibility to determine whether and under what circumstances generic drugs are to be prescribed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">For all these reasons, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">. In Governor Carey\u2019s memorandum approving the Law, the following observations were made: \u201cEvery year American consumers spend roughly $8 billion on drugs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Prescription drugs are not a luxury; for many people, particularly the elderly, they are a life-sustaining necessity. Yet, consumers are forced to purchase the more expensive brand name drugs because most physicians choose to prescribe by brand name; and pharmacists are prohibited by law from substituting equivalent but less expensive generic drugs.\u201d (NY Legis Ann, 1977, p 259.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. By a subsequent judgment, Special Term also dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 third and fourth causes of action as being barred by the four-month Statute of Limitations applicable to article 78 proceedings. (See CPLR 217.) As a result of Special Term\u2019s severance of these claims from the remaining causes of action, the propriety of this subsequent dismissal on Statute of Limitations grounds is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
