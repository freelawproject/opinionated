The 1979 amendment to subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law unconstitutionally violates the doctrine of separation of powers by barring petitioner from submitting evidence which the appellate courts of this State have held to be \u201ccompetent and material\u201d and by interfering with a court\u2019s inherent power to consider any relevant and material evidence, absent a sound public policy consideration justifying such exclusion. <em>(Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440; <em>Bethlehem Steel Corp. v Board of Educ., </em>44 NY2d 831; <em>City of Buffalo v Clement Co., </em>28 NY2d 241; <em>Matter of Roosevelt Raceway v Monaghan, </em>9 NY2d 293; <em>City of New York v Village of Lawrence, </em>250 NY 429; <em>Sackler v Sackler, </em>15 NY2d 40; <em>Matter of Dorn \u201cHH\u201d v Lawrence \u201cII, </em>31 NY2d 154; <em>Davis v Supreme Lodge, Knights of Honor, </em>165 NY 159; <em>McGowan v Metropolitan Life Ins.

A taxpayer in an inequality proceeding is entitled to an \u201ceffective\u201d remedy; judicial notice may be taken of the prohibitive cost of the actual sales method of proving ratio. <em>(Gibbes v Zimmerman, </em>290 US 326; <em>Insurance Co. v Glidden Co., </em>284 US 151; <em>Iowa Cent.

No further constitutional attack on subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law, as amended, should be permitted. The cost of proof of ratio under the remaining available methods of proof is not a basis for further challenge to the statute on due process grounds; even if it is, due process demands a plenary form of action for such challenge. <em>(Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440; <em>Worthen Co. v Kavanaugh, </em>295 US 56; <em>Home Bldg. &amp; Loan Assn. v Blaisdell, </em>290 US 398; <em>Matter of Dudley v Kerwick, </em>52 NY2d 542; <em>Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of Islip, </em>37 NY2d 1; <em>Harriss v Tams, </em>258 NY 229; <em>Valladares v Valladares, </em>80 AD2d 244; <em>Matter of Andresen v Rice, </em>277 NY 271.) II. Subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law, as amended, should be retroactively applicable to all pending inequality proceedings. <em>(Sheilcrawt v Moffett, </em>294 NY 180; <em>Board of Comrs. of Excise of City of Auburn v Merchant, </em>103 NY 143; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v Melton, </em>218 US 36; <em>Mobile, J. &amp; K.C.R.R. v Turnipseed, </em>219 US 34; <em>Farrington v Pinckney, </em>1 NY2d 74; <em>Matter of Boardwalk &amp; Seashore Corp. v Murdock, </em>286 NY 494; <em>Bradford v County of Suffolk, </em>257 App Div 777; <em>860 Executive Towers v Board of Assessors of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number><em>County of Nassau, </em>53 AD2d 463, affd <em>sub nom.

III. Subdivisions 3,4 and 5 of section 307 of the Real Property Tax Law are procedural in nature and are a constitutional exercise of legislative power. <em>(Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of lslip, </em>37 NY2d 1; <em>New York Steam Corp. v City of New York, </em>268 NY 137; <em>Sonmax, Inc. v City of New York, </em>89 Misc 2d 945, 43 NY2d 253; <em>People v Cook, </em>34 NY2d 100; <em>San Antonio School Dist. v Rodriguez, </em>411 US 1; <em>Salsburg v Maryland, </em>346 US 545; <em>Albie State Bank v Bryan, </em>282 US 765; <em>Farrington v Pinckney, </em>1 NY2d 74; <em>Ravensdale Holding Co. v Village of Hastings on Hudson, </em>156 Misc 777; <em>Preston Co. v Funkhauser, </em>261 NY 140, affd <em>sub nom.

II. Subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law (as amd by L <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>1979, ch 216) is unconstitutional. <em>(People ex rel.

Since those statutes have expired during the pendency of this appeal, we do not address the question of their constitutionality. As so modified, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed, and the question certified answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">As to the status of this action, we agree with the Appellate Division that petitioners have secured an interlocutory judgment. That judgment, having determined that the State equalization rates are appropriate proof of the rate of fractional assessment in Nassau County for the years in question, allows petitioners to proceed to prove that their property has been assessed in excess of that rate by establishing the property\u2019s fair market value, against which the predetermined fractional assessment rate will be applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Prior to this court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Heller stein v Assessor of Town of lslip </em>(37 NY2d 1), fractional assessment was a common practice. In that case, we held that section 306 of the Real Property Tax Law required all property be assessed at full value. In the wake of that decision, the Legislature passed several provisions allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>ing local taxing authorities to continue fractionalized assessments while they conducted the physical revaluation of real property that would be necessary to implement full value assessment. Since our decision in <em>Hellerstein </em>was specifically prospective in its application and because the Legislature subsequently suspended the requirements of full valuation for those taxing districts undergoing revaluation, assessments for the years in question could continue to be challenged, as in the past, on the ground that the assessments were unequal. Special Term, pursuant to the provisions of section 307 of the Real Property Tax Law, then in effect, found that Nassau County was not required to comply with the requirements of full valuation for the years in question, 1965-1966 through 1977-1978. It further determined that the applicable ratio between assessed and full value, for the purposes of this proceeding, was the State equalization rate. Since section 307 has expired during the pendency of this appeal, we only pass on whether the State equalization rates could be used in this proceeding as proof of the ratio between assessed value and full value.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">In addition to the legislative provisions deferring application of our decision in <em>Hellerstein, </em>the Legislature, in related action, also enacted an amendment of subdivision 3 of section 720<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a new section 721<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Real Property Tax Law which substantially limited the use of State equalization rates to establish assessment ratios in inequality review proceedings which had been approved in <em>Guth Realty u Gingold </em>(34 NY2d 440). The hearing and decision at Special Term in this case preceded these legislative enactments. The enactments had become effective, however, and were considered on the cross appeals to the Appellate Division. Now, again, in consequence of their expiration these enactments have no application to the case as it stands before us on the present appeal. Accordingly, we review the determination at the Appellate Divi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>sion on the basis of the statutory and case law now in effect, and hold that under the applicable common law, the determination that the State equalization rate was the appropriate ratio between assessed value and full value was correct. <em>(Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440, <em>supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Such a tax review proceeding is necessarily bifurcated, the first part establishing the applicable ratio of assessment and the second determining the fair market value of the property in question against which the ratio is applied to determine whether the assessment is unequal. In this proceeding, the grant of partial summary judgment fixing the appropriate percentage of full value at the level set by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment has adjudicated the issue of ratio. It is, therefore, in the nature of an interlocutory judgment. <em>(860 Executive Towers v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>53 AD2d 463, 475, affd <em>sub nom. Matter of Pierre Pallaton Apts. v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>43 NY2d 769.) When the remaining question of the fair market value of the property is determined, a simple mathematical application of the ratio to that fair market value will indicate whether or not the assessment is equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Furthermore, our affirmance of the Appellate Division in <em>860 Executive Towers </em>(43 NY2d 769, <em>supra) </em>means that once the validity of the State equalization rate has been adjudicated, the county is collaterally estopped in other proceedings from further challenges of that rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">It remains to address the contention advanced by the County of Nassau that, notwithstanding the expiration on October 30,1981 of former subdivision 3 of section 720, the new subdivision 3 of that section, which became effective on December 3, 1981 when the Legislature enacted S-7000A over the Governor\u2019s veto (L1981, ch 1057) and which again limits the use of State equalization rates in inequality review proceedings, should be held applicable to the present proceeding. We note that while the former amendment of subdivision 3 was expressly made applicable to proceedings commenced on or after January 1, 1970 and not finally determined (L 1979, ch 126, \u00a7 4; L 1979, ch 127, \u00a73) no such provision for retroactivity is contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>S-7000A, section 17 of which provides only that: \u201cThis act shall take effect immediately.\u201d In this circumstance we perceive no indication of legislative intent that the new enactment is to have retrospective application. Whatever may be the current and prospective applicability of new subdivision 3 to other pending proceedings, we hold that in the present proceeding in which the hearing with respect to assessment ratios has been concluded and an interlocutory judgment has been entered determining the rate of fractional assessment in Nassau County for the years in question, new subdivision 3 has no application. The procedural stage to which the new subdivision might otherwise have applied has long since been concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Chief Judge Cooke and Judges Jasen, Gabrielli, Jones, Wachtler, Fuchsberg and Meyer concur in <em>Per Curiam </em>opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">Order modified, without costs, in accordance with the opinion herein and, as so modified, affirmed.
