Public interest demands that the city be compelled to adhere to the statutory standard of assessment, i.e., full or actual market value. <em>(Fernandez v Wiener, </em>326 US 340; <em>Carmichael v Southern Coal Co., </em>301 US 495; <em>Maxwell v Bugbee, </em>250 US 525; <em>Hagar v Reclamation Dist.

III. Section 166-1.0 of the Administrative Code does not authorize a fractional, classified, section-wide assessment system. <em>(Mercantile Nat. Bank of City of N. Y. v Mayor of City of N.

Section 166-1.0 of the Administrative Code is not constitutional if read as creating a classified property tax system. <em>(Matter of Mollenhauer, </em>257 App Div 286; <em>People ex rel.

Corp. v Finance Administrator of City of N. Y., </em>102 Misc 2d 641.) VI. Subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law is invalid as applied to New York City because it effectively deprives a taxpayer of any remedy for inequality of assessment. <em>(Gibbes v Zimmerman, </em>290 US 326; <em>Board of Comrs. of Excise of City of Auburn v Merchant, </em>103 NY 143; <em>Matter of Johnson v Town of Haverstraw, </em>102 Misc 2d 923; <em>Matter of Pepsi-Cola Co. v Tax Comm. of City of N.Y., </em>19 AD2d 56; <em>Matter of Property Portfolio 182 Corp. v Tax Comm. of City of N.

The State Board of Equalization and Assessment rate which measures the aggregate ratio of assessed values to full market values of real property on a whole-roll, city-wide basis is an appropriate evidentiary basis for determining inequality of assessment in a New York City real estate tax review proceeding. <em>(Matter of Rego Props.

The State Board of Equalization and Assessment rate is admissible and probative evidence of inequality of assessment in a real estate tax review proceeding. <em>(Matter of O\u2019Brien v Assessor of Town of Mamaroneck, </em>20 NY2d 587; <em>Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440; <em>860 Executive Towers v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>53 AD2d 463.) III. The 1979 amendment to subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law insofar as it purports to preclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>utilization of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment rate as evidence of inequality is unconstitutional as a denial of due process and equal protection of the law. <em>(Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440; <em>860 Executive Towers v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>53 AD2d 463, affd <em>sub nom.

Cognizant that to preserve the diverse economy of the Nation\u2019s largest city its tax system must reflect the capacity of income-producing and non-income-producing property to defray the cost of government. The Legislature has provided that proof of discrimination in distributing that cost be essentially confined to property of like character. <em>(Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of lslip, </em>37 NY2d 1; <em>Sonmax, Inc. v City of New York, </em>89 Misc 2d 945, 43 NY2d 253; <em>Matter of Board of Water Supply of City of N.Y., </em>277 NY 452; <em>People ex rel.

Even if section 166-1.0 were held to require proof of discrimination in relation to all properties in the city, requiring that it be proved in relation to \u201cproperty of the same major type\u201d (Real Property Tax Law, \u00a7 307) and eliminating the State Board of Equalization and Assessment\u2019s rate as evidence (\u00a7 720, subd 3) represent a rational legislative response to threatened fiscal bankruptcy of localities pending transition to full value assessments. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Petitioner has acquired no vested right to continued availability of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment\u2019s rate in proof of discrimination. It is fatuous to believe, given the unsettled history of the equalization rate, that any property owner would have ordered his affairs or placed any reliance on the possibility of obtaining a refund on that basis. <em>(Defiance Milk Prods.

III. Special Term properly rejected petitioner\u2019s attack on section 1146-15.0 of the Administrative Code and correctly denied petitioner\u2019s motion to discover confidential sales information from tax returns. <em>(Matter of New York State Dept, of Taxation &amp; Fin. v New York State Dept, of Law, </em>44 NY2d 575; <em>Matter of Manufacturers Trust Co. v Browne, </em>269 App Div 108, 296 NY 549; <em>Matter of Bakers Mut.

The provisions of the Administrative Code (\u00a7 166-1.0, subd b, par 3) and subdivisions 3, 4 and 5 of section 307 of the Real Property Tax Law, as procedural statutes, create no constitutional infirmity. Moreover, the inequality petitioner in the City of New York has ratified fractional assessment practices whether \u201cgeneric\u201d or by \u201cclass\u201d. <em>(Matter of Finnegan v Cohen, </em>275 NY 432; <em>Schielcrawt v Moffett, </em>294 NY 180; <em>Matter of Slewett &amp; Farber v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>80 AD2d 186; <em>Matter of Hellerstein v Assessor of Town of lslip, </em>37 NY2d 1; <em>Pollitz v Wabash R.R.

II. Even if considered taxing statutes neither section 166-1.0 (subd b, par 3) of the Administrative Code nor subdivisions 3, 4 and 5 of section 307 of the Real Property Tax Law violates constitutional principles. <em>(Matter of Slewett &amp; Farber v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>80 AD2d 186; <em>New York Steam Corp. v City of New York, </em>268 NY 137; <em>People ex rel.

The 1979 amendment to subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law, if applicable in the instant proceeding, should be applied in accordance with the legislative intent to bar use of the State rate as evidence of ratio. <em>(Matter of Slewett &amp; Farber v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, </em>80 AD2d 186; <em>Sheilcrawt v Moffett, </em>294 NY 180; <em>Board of Comrs. of Excise of City of Auburn v Merchant, </em>103 NY 143; <em>Louisville &amp; Nashville R.R. v Melton, </em>218 US 36; <em>Mobile, J. &amp; K.C.R.R. v Turnipseed, </em>219 US 34; <em>Farrington v Pinckney, </em>1 NY2d 74; <em>Matter of Boardwalk &amp; Seashore Corp. v Murdock, </em>286 NY 494; <em>Bradford v County of Suffolk, </em>257 App Div 777; <em>United States v Heinszen &amp; Co., </em>206 US 370; <em>Germania Sav.

Y., the order of the Appellate Division should be modified by deleting therefrom all declarations as to the constitutionality or applicability of former section 307 and subdivision 3 of section 720 of the Real Property Tax Law and by reversing so much of the order as denied petitioner\u2019s motion for discovery of \u201cspecial sales data listings\u201d and remitting that motion to Supreme Court for further consideration and disposition in light of our decision in this case. As so modified, the order of the Appellate Division should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>be affirmed and the consolidated proceedings remitted to Supreme Court. The question certified is answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">In Matter of Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of U. S. v Finance Administrator of City of N. Y., the order of the Appellate Division should be modified to the extent of granting petitioner\u2019s motion to dismiss those defenses which rely on the New York City Administrative Code\u2019s purported authorization of a classified system of assessment. As so modified, the order of the Appellate Division should be affirmed. The question certified should be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Section 166-1.0 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York governs the procedure for review of tax assessments in the City of New York. By its terms, taxpayers may challenge the assessed valuation of their property on the grounds that it is illegal, that it overvalues the property, or that \u201cthe assessment is erroneous by reason of inequality.\u201d That section further provides that inequality may be proven by showing that the assessment was \u201cmade at a higher proportionate valuation than the assessment of other real property of like character in the same ward or section, or other real property on the assessment rolls of the city for the same year\u201d. To hold, as the courts below have, that this procedural provision is legislative authorization for a classified system of assessments in the City of New York improperly expands the scope of the section. In these proceedings to challenge tax assessments on the ground of inequality, we have no occasion to reach and, therefore, do not address the contentions of the parties with respect to the methods or systems of assessments in New York City. Our attention is focused on assertions of inequality of actual assessments whatever the means or basis on which they were made. Thus, we hold that this section authorizes taxpayers who challenge the assessments of their real property to present proof of inequality based on either or both of two theories \u2014 that the particular assessment \u201chas been made at a higher proportionate valuation than the assessment of other real property of like character in the same ward or section\u201d, or that the assessment \u201chas been made at a higher proportionate valuation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>than the assessment of *** other real property on the assessment rolls of the city for the same year.\u201d Thus, proof may be introduced to establish inequality with respect to property of similar character in the same ward or section or with respect to the city-wide assessment rolls. In continuing this proceeding, petitioner should be allowed to introduce either or both types of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">There remains the question whether, if it is sought to establish inequality with respect to city-wide assessment rolls, State equalization rates may be introduced. (Cf. <em>Matter of Rokowsky v Finance Administrator of City of N. Y., </em>41 NY2d 574; <em>Guth Realty v Gingold, </em>34 NY2d 440.) Legislative action taken over the past few years to restrict the use of such proof and considered by the courts below<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> expired on October 30, 1981 and accordingly now has no application to this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">On December 3, 1981, however, the Legislature passed S-7000A over the Governor\u2019s veto (L1981, ch 1057). Section 7 of that bill contains a new subdivision 3 of section 720.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>This new legislation contains no express provision for retroactive application as did the former law (L 1979, ch 126, \u00a7 4; L 1979, ch 127; \u00a7 3); it provides only, in section 17, that \u201cthis act shall take effect immediately\u201d. Accordingly to the extent that it is otherwise appropriate, it applies to proceedings pending on December 3, 1981.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">We hold that this new subdivision 3 now applies to these proceedings. Although the proceedings were commenced prior to the enactment of S-7000A, no evidentiary hearings have yet been held or interlocutory determinations made as was the case in <em>Matter of Slewett &amp; Farber v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau </em>(54 NY2d 547 [decided herewith]). Accordingly, when such evidentiary hearings are held in these cases on remittal following this appeal, among other considerations to be taken into account in rulings with respect to the admissibility of evidence will be the provisions of new subdivision 3 of section 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">We further consider, on the basis of postargument briefs submitted to this court after the enactment by the Legislature of S-7000A, the constitutionality of the new subdivision 3 of section 720 insofar as it is applicable to the litigation now before us. As did former subdivision 3, this section governs what evidence is admissible on the issue of whether an assessment is unequal. Data on selected parcels and actual sales are admissible as evidence to show an unequal assessment in all assessing units. Use of the State equalization rate, however, is limited to \u201call assessing units other than special assessing units.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The effect of this provision is to foreclose the use of State equalization rates in-this type of proceeding in the City of New York and in Nassau County.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Petitioners claim that this is a restriction based on population and geographic area which violates their right to equal protection of the laws. They further claim that the excessive cost of proving a claim of unequal assessment associated with the remaining two methods of proof essentially bars them from seeking any redress and, therefore, constitutes a violation of their due process rights. Recognizing that subdivision 3 of section 720 is procedural in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>nature, we hold this section of the Real Property Tax Law, as enacted on December 3, 1981, to be constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">The core of petitioners\u2019 equal protection claim is that the Legislature, by allowing the use of State equalization rates as proof of the ratio between assessed and full value in all parts of the State but the City of New York and Nassau County, makes an impermissible distinction between geographic areas of the State. \u201cEqual protection does not require territorial uniformity of law within a State <em>(Salsburg </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>346 U. S. 545 [rules of evidence in prosecutions for gambling offenses]; <em>Missouri </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>101 U. S. 22 [access to appellate courts]).\u201d <em>(Matter of Rosenthal v Hartnett, </em>36 NY2d 269, 274.) It has long been the rule that the State Legislatures may make such geographic distinctions without denying any person equal protection of the laws. The Supreme Court in <em>Missouri u Lewis </em>(101 US 22, 31) stated: \u201cIf the State of New York, for example, should see fit to adopt the civil law and its method of procedure for New York City and the surrounding counties, and the common law and its method of procedure for the rest of the State, there is nothing in the Constitution of the United States to prevent its doing so. This would not, of itself, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment, be a denial to any person of the equal protection of the laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">The distinction made by this legislation, although not based on geographic factors, is neither impermissible nor unreasonable; rather, the distinction is based on size of population within municipal units.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To strike down this provision, it must be shown that the Legislature acted unreasonably \u2014 that is, that the Legislature did not have a rational basis for creating such a distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">The Legislature had a rational basis for designating the City of New York and Nassau County special assessing units and restricting the admissibility of State equalization rates in such units. This legislation which was designed to overrule this court\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Heller-stein v Assessor of Town of Islip </em>(37 NY2d 1), which required full value assessment for all property, recognized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>the unique nature of those communities with their high density of population and diversity of property.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Petitioners further contend that by restricting the use of State equalization rates as proof of the ratio between assessed and full value in special assessing units, their right to due process of the law has been violated. This argument is premised on claims that the other authorized methods of proof, selected parcels and sales, are prohibitively expensive so that petitioners, and similarly situated parties, are effectively foreclosed from challenging the rate of assessment of their property. While a \u201claw which would practically shut out the evidence of a party and thus deny him the opportunity for a trial would substantially deprive him of due process of law\u201d <em>(Board of Comrs. of Excise of City of Auburn v Merchant, </em>103 NY 143, 148), it cannot be said that this legislation has been shown, on its face, to constitute such a deprivation. The fact that these procedures are admittedly more cumbersome and expensive does not require a holding that there is a deprivation of due process. <em>(Gibbes v Zimmerman, </em>290 US 326.) The Legislature, in its wisdom, has seen fit to restrict the admissible proof to selected parcels and sales data and there are no grounds for this court, by judicial fiat, to authorize additional proof. The Legislature did no more than restore, in special assessing units, the <em>status quo ante </em>chapter 942 of the Laws of 1961 which first authorized the admission of State equalization rates.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Once the ratio between assessed value and full market value has been determined, petitioners will be required to establish the fair market value for the property against which the ratio will be applied to determine whether the assessment is proper. Because sales data of comparable property is one method of establishing a fair market value, petitioner Colt Industries\u2019 motion for discovery of that data is remitted to Supreme Court for further consideration and disposition in light of our decision in this case.
