On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred in ordering her to pay the attorney fees when the record is silent as to whether she \u201cis or may be able\u201d to pay those costs. <em>See </em>ORS 151.505(3) (\u201cThe court may not require a person to pay costs under this section unless the person is or may be able to pay the costs.\u201d); ORS 161.665(4) (\u201cThe court may not sentence a defendant to pay costs under this section unless the defendant is or may be able to pay them.\u201d). She acknowledges that she did not preserve her claim of error but urges us to review and correct the error as an \u201cerror of law apparent on the record.\u201d ORAP 5.45(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The state concedes that the trial court plainly erred in imposing the attorney fees and, further, that \u201c[t]his case is indistinguishable from cases in which this court has exercised its discretion to engage in plain-error review.\u201d We agree. The record contains no evidence of defendant\u2019s financial resources, and the evidence of her circumstances \u2014 that she suffers from severe chronic alcoholism, has serious health issues related to numerous vital organ systems, and has no means of transportation \u2014 make it entirely speculative that defendant would have the funds to pay the fees or acquire them in the future. Accordingly, we exercise our discretion to correct the error for reasons similar to those expressed in <em>State v. Ramirez-Hernandez, </em>264 Or App 346, 349, 332 P3d 338 (2014) (explaining that, \u201calthough $400 may not be a substantial amount to pay for some defendants, it is for this defendant\u201d; \u201cwhile there is some speculative evidence that defendant might find work in the future, the actual evidence is to the contrary\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">Portion of judgment requiring defendant to pay attorney fees reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
