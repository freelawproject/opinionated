J.</author>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Frank Toohey died in a crash of a private airplane along with the pilot of the plane, Jason Ketcheson. Both Toohey and Ketcheson worked for Wyndham Resort Development Corporation (Wyndham) \u2014 Ketcheson was a salesman in Wyndham\u2019s Seaside office and Toohey was his supervisor. Ketcheson and Toohey were flying to Klamath Falls for a Wyndham sales-training meeting when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff in Seaside. The estate and heirs of Toohey (plaintiff) brought this action against the estate of Ketcheson (defendant) asserting tort claims for wrongful death. After a bifurcated bench trial that addressed Toohey\u2019s and Ketcheson\u2019s employment status at the time of the crash, the trial court determined that both Toohey and Ketcheson were Wyndham workers who were acting in the course of their employment at the time of the crash and that Toohey\u2019s injury arose out of that employment. As a result, the trial court concluded that plaintiffs claims against defendant were barred under the exclusive-remedy provision in Oregon\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and entered a limited judgment dismissing those claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that the trial court did not err and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Because it informs our discussion, we begin with an overview of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law\u2019s exclusive-remedy provisions, which immunize an employer or coworker from tort claims brought by an injured employee. Generally, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Law provides the exclusive basis for liability for a complying employer for an injury of a worker that \u201caris [es] out of and in the course of employment\u201d (a compensable injury).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> ORS 656.018(l)(a). A worker with a compensable injury cannot seek a remedy against the employer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>under any other law or common law, \u201cexcept to the extent the worker is expressly given the right under [the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law] to bring suit against the employer\u201d for the injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> ORS 656.018(2). That immunity also extends to an employee of the employer <em>{viz., </em>a coworker) who may be responsible for the worker\u2019s injury, unless a statutory exception applies.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ORS 656.018(3); <em>Dehiya v. Spencer, </em>221 Or App 539, 544, 191 P3d 730 (2008) (\u201c[I]f a worker\u2019s injury is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, then that remedy is exclusive, and the worker cannot seek a tort remedy against a fellow employee instead.\u201d). One of those exceptions is \u201c[i]f the negligence of [the coworker] is a substantial factor in causing the injury * * * and the negligence occurs outside of the capacity that qualifies the person for exemption under this section,\u201d <em>viz., </em>outside of the coworker\u2019s employment for the employer. ORS 656.018(3)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Plaintiff has not challenged on appeal the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Toohey\u2019s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment, and thus we proceed on the basis that it did.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Instead, plaintiff contends that the trial court erred in determining that Ketcheson\u2019s negligence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>occurred within his employment for Wyndham, such that the exclusive-remedy provision immunized defendant from plaintiffs wrongful death claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">With that background in place, we turn to the facts and the trial court\u2019s ruling. Because the trial court acted as the factfinder below, we review the court\u2019s findings for any evidence to support them and its conclusions for legal error. <em>Allco Enterprises v. Goldstein Family Living Trust, </em>183 Or App 328, 330, 51 P3d 1275 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Ketcheson was employed by Wyndham as a sales representative in Wyndham\u2019s Seaside office. Toohey was also employed by Wyndham and was Ketcheson\u2019s supervisor. As part of his job, Toohey was required to go to other Wyndham offices in Oregon to conduct training. On at least one other occasion, Toohey had taken a sales representative with him to another office for a training session to assist and motivate the other sales representatives. On this occasion, Toohey selected Ketcheson to assist him in a training meeting in Klamath Falls, and everyone at the Seaside office was aware in advance that they were going to fly there in a private aircraft piloted by Ketcheson. They left from the Seaside airport early on the morning of the training meeting and the plane crashed shortly after takeoff, killing both Ketcheson and Toohey. Plaintiff brought this action against defendant, among others, for Toohey\u2019s wrongful death.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">After a bench trial on the issue whether Ketcheson was acting within his employment for Wyndham at the time of the crash, the trial court made an extensive ruling. That ruling included the following findings and conclusions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">\u201cI think they both decided to fly to Klamath Falls for that purpose [to attend the training session]. They left Seaside Airport the morning of August 4th, 2008, and unfortunately the plane crashed. Obviously, and I specifically find, and I think I\u2019ve already said, the plane they were flying was certainly not owned by Wyndham, and I agree that Jason Ketcheson was not a pilot hired by Wyndham, but I don\u2019t think that necessarily controls. I think they were both going to Klamath Falls in the course and scope of their employment. That was the only purpose for that trip. And it was just another normal workday, and if it hadn\u2019t have been for the plane crash, I think it would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>just another day at the office, although it was at Klamath Falls and not at Seaside.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-5\">\u201cI think Mr. Ketcheson loved to fly, and he was going to take advantage of the fact that they could fly to Klamath Falls, get there a lot quicker than driving, and they decided to go by plane. If they decided to go by motorcycle or bicycle or go to Portland \u2014 I don\u2019t know if the train goes through Klamath Falls or not, I think they could have done that as well, but they decided to fly down there. So I think it\u2019s all part of just a normal trip going on \u2014 going somewhere for business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-7\">\u201cI did * * * look at Uniform [Civil] Jury Instruction 57.05, which was what [plaintiffs counsel] had in one of his documents that he filed in relation to this hearing, and looked at the elements for scope of employment, but even then, if I looked at that standard, I think the workers\u2019 comp[ensation] rules are what govern because we\u2019re talking about immunity that attaches or the inability to sue somebody if that pertains, but was Ketcheson\u2019s act of a general kind or nature that he was employed or authorized to perform. He wasn\u2019t employed to fly, but he was certainly employed to be a sales representative and, from the evidence, to go to Klamath Falls to do that. His acts occurred substantially within the authorized limits of time and place, and I\u2019ve already talked about that, and obviously was motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve the employer, and I think that one is particularly dead-bang on. So I think those \u2014 even then those elements are covered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\"><em>\u201cSo </em>I think what it boils down to here is that they were traveling to work to Klamath Falls and took off from the Seaside Airport as part of their employment for Wyndham. They didn\u2019t deviate from their travel plans. It\u2019s not like they were headed to Klamath Falls but flew to Boise first for lunch or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-9\">\u201cIf they had decided to drive and had an injury as a result, they would be the same status as far as application of the workers\u2019 compensation laws in Oregon. They were going there for work purposes, and they were expected to travel and get there somehow, so I think that makes them traveling employees, it makes them covered under workers\u2019 comp [ensation].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201cSo the ruling, I don\u2019t see any other way to make it, is that the Ketcheson Estate cannot be sued by the Frank Toohey Estate, and that\u2019s the way the Oregon law is, and so that\u2019s the ruling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Plaintiff now appeals, asserting four assignments of error, each of which we address below.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Plaintiff first argues that, for the tort immunity in ORS 656.018 to apply to plaintiffs claims against defendant, Ketcheson must have been a \u201csubject worker\u201d under ORS 656.027. Plaintiff asserts that Ketcheson is not a \u201csubject worker\u201d because the exception in ORS 656.027(4) applies, which provides that \u201c[a] 11 workers are subject to this chapter except,\u201d among others, \u201c[a] person for whom a rule of liability for injury or death arising out of and in the course of employment is provided by the laws of the United States.\u201d Plaintiff contends that that exception applies because, while Ketcheson was flying the plane, the rules of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), that is, federal law, governed Ketcheson\u2019s conduct and that, when Ketcheson violated those rules, he was violating \u201ca rule of liability\u201d as contemplated by ORS 656.027(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">We reject plaintiffs reading of ORS 656.027(4). The exception to the definition of \u201csubject worker\u201d to which plaintiff refers is directed at certain types of workers who are eligible for benefits under a parallel federal statutory compensation scheme for work-related injuries. <em>See Mann v. SAIF, </em>91 Or App 715, 716, 756 P2d 76 (1988) (holding that, because worker\u2019s injury was covered by the federal Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, he was not a \u201csubject worker\u201d). That exception does not speak to a situation in which a coworker may be liable to an injured worker under a federal law \u2014 that is not the point of ORS 656.027. The point of the statute is to identify \u201csubject workers\u201d whose work-related injuries are covered by Oregon\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, not to identify coworkers who can be sued despite the exclusive-remedy provisions in ORS 656.018. Coworkers who are subject to suit are already identified in ORS 656.018(3)(a) to (d), which is the logical location of any exception to the immunity extended to coworkers by ORS 656.018(3). Plaintiff has not identified any federal compensation scheme that could be applicable to this case, nor has plaintiff provided a plausible explanation as to why ORS 656.027(4), even if applicable, operates to override or add to the specific exceptions to coworker immunity set forth in ORS 656.018(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">In its second assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the trial court applied the wrong legal test to determine if, when Toohey was injured, Ketcheson\u2019s conduct was within his employment. Plaintiff argues that the court should have applied the common-law vicarious-liability test for attributing employee torts to an employer, as embodied in the Uniform Civil Jury Instruction 57.05, and not the test in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law for determining whether a subject worker\u2019s injury is compensable, ORS 656.005(7)(a).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Alternatively, plaintiff contends that the trial court incorrectly applied ORS 656.005(7)(a) because the totality of the circumstances here demonstrate that there was no causal link between Ketcheson\u2019s employment and Toohey\u2019s injury because (1) Ketcheson was not working for Wyndham while flying and (2) Ketcheson\u2019s conduct in flying the plane was so unreasonable that a causal link cannot be established, relying on <em>Sumner v. Coe, </em>40 Or App 815, 596 P2d 617 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">First, we decline to reach plaintiffs argument regarding the correct law to apply because the trial court applied both the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law and the common-law test for vicarious liability to the facts of the case and found that, under each test, Ketcheson was acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>within his employment when he and Toohey crashed in the plane. As a result, any error that the trial court may have made in concluding that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law test was the correct test to apply provides no basis for us to reverse the judgment. <em>See </em>ORS 19.415(2) (\u201cNo judgment shall be reversed or modified except for error substantially affecting the rights of a party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">As to the trial court\u2019s application of the common-law test, plaintiff does not address it, and plaintiffs argument that the test was not met is based on statements that are directly contrary to the express findings made by the court, which are supported by evidence in the record. Moreover, we agree with the trial court that the fact that Ketcheson was not employed by Wyndham as a pilot was not a material consideration. The relevant inquiry was whether Ketcheson\u2019s travel to Klamath Falls was work related, which it was. <em>See Sosnoski v. SAIF, </em>184 Or App 88, 93, 55 P3d 533, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 114 (2002) (\u201cWhen travel is part of employment, \u2018the risk of [injury during activities necessitated by travel] remains an incident to the employment even though the employee may not actually be working at the time of the injury.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>PP &amp; L v. Jacobson, </em>121 Or App 260, 263, 854 P2d 999, <em>rev den, </em>317 Or 583 (1993)) (alteration in <em>Sosnoski)). </em>As a result, to the extent a proper challenge was made, we also reject plaintiffs challenge to the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Ketcheson was acting within the scope of his employment under the common-law test.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Second, we reject plaintiffs argument that the trial court erred in concluding that there was a causal link between Toohey\u2019s injuries and Ketcheson\u2019s employment, as required by ORS 656.005(7)(a). \u201cFor an injury to be compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law, it must satisfy a two-pronged test: the injury must \u2018arise out of and occur \u2018in the course of\u2019 employment.\u201d <em>Dehiya, </em>221 Or App at 545 (citing ORS 656.005(7)(a) and <em>Fred Meyer, Inc. v. Hayes, </em>325 Or 592, 596, 943 P2d 197 (1997)). The \u201carise out of\u2019 prong requires a party to show a causal link between the worker\u2019s injury and his employment. <em>Id. </em>Here, the trial court found that part of Toohey\u2019s employment was to conduct training at other offices and that he had selected Ketcheson to assist him, so that Ketcheson was \u201cworking for Wyndham, and he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>was furthering Wyndham\u2019s interests in doing so,\u201d and that they had decided to fly to Klamath Falls for that purpose, and \u201c[t]hat was the only purpose for that trip.\u201d We conclude that there is evidence in the record to support those findings, and those findings were sufficient for the trial court to conclude that Toohey\u2019s injury arose out of Toohey\u2019s and Ketcheson\u2019s employment with Wyndham.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">We disagree with plaintiff that \u201c[t]he risks created by Ketcheson are not the risk of employment assumed by Toohey\u201d thus breaking the causal link. The risk of a plane crash is precisely the type of risk created by employment when an employee conducts work-related travel by plane. Similarly, we reject plaintiffs argument based on <em>Sumner </em>that Ketcheson\u2019s conduct in flying the plane was so unreasonable that it could not have arisen out of his employment. In <em>Sumner, </em>at the end of the worker\u2019s shift a fellow employee, who had left and retrieved his car, offered to give the worker a ride on the hood of his car over to the worker\u2019s car, which was in the employer\u2019s parking lot. The worker accepted, but then fell off and sustained injuries. 40 Or App at 817. We concluded that the injured worker was not within the course of his employment because riding on the hood of a car was either an unreasonable or a prohibited means by which to travel across the employer\u2019s parking lot. <em>Id. </em>at 820. This case does not resemble <em>Sumner. </em>There is nothing inherently unreasonable in Toohey and Ketcheson deciding to fly in a private plane piloted by Ketcheson to a work meeting \u2014 as opposed to riding on the hood of a car \u2014 and the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that there was no evidence that company policy prohibited travel by private plane.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">In its third assignment of error, plaintiff contends that, even if Ketcheson\u2019s conduct did arise out of and in the course of employment, immunity does not attach because (1) the flight for Ketcheson was an excluded social or recreational activity to which no \u201cdual purpose\u201d applied, ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B) (\u201c\u2018Compensable injury\u2019 does not include *** [i]njury incurred while engaging in or performing, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>as the result of engaging in or performing, any recreational or social activities primarily for the worker\u2019s personal pleasure!.]\u201d), or (2) it was subject to the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule, which excludes from compensation injuries incurred while travelling to and from an employee\u2019s place of work, <em>Krushwitz v. McDonald\u2019s </em>Restaurants, 323 Or 520, 526, 919 P2d 465 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">With regard to plaintiffs first argument based on ORS 656.005(7)(b)(B), the trial court expressly found that Ketcheson and Toohey were making the trip to Klamath Falls solely for the purpose of conducting business for Wyndham and that there was no evidence of any recreational aspect to the trip. As we concluded above, there is evidence in the record to support the court\u2019s findings and, thus, we reject plaintiffs argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">We also reject plaintiff\u2019s argument based on the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule. Under that general rule, a worker\u2019s injury that is sustained while going to or coming from the worker\u2019s place of work \u201cis not considered to have occurred in the course of employment.\u201d <em>Dehiya, </em>221 Or App at 546. However, an exception to that rule is for traveling employees\u2014 <em>viz., </em>the travel itself is work related or employer sponsored. <em>Sosnoski, </em>184 Or App at 93. A traveling employee is continuously within the course of employment, unless the employee engages in a distinct departure on a personal errand. <em>Id. </em>Plaintiff does not contend that the \u201cdistinct departure\u201d rule applies here, and the trial court found that Ketcheson\u2019s and Toohey\u2019s travel was work related, which is supported by evidence in the record. Thus, the trial court correctly determined that the \u201cgoing and coming\u201d rule did not apply to these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Finally, in its fourth assignment of error, plaintiff contends that the trial court violated ORS 656.595(2) by admitting and considering evidence that the beneficiaries of Toohey and Ketcheson had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits. ORS 656.595(2) provides that, \u201c[i]n any third party action brought pursuant to this chapter, the fact that the injured worker or the beneficiaries of the injured worker are entitled to or have received benefits under this chapter shall not be pleaded or admissible in evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>We disagree that ORS 656.595(2) applies in this instance because the evidence of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits was not introduced in a \u201cthird party action.\u201d In an action where a defendant challenges whether the claim brought is a \u201cthird party action,\u201d that challenge is to be raised in supplemental pleadings and tried to the court. ORS 656.595(3) (\u201cA challenge of the right to bring such third party action shall be made by supplemental pleadings only and such challenge shall be determined by the court as a matter of law.\u201d). The Oregon Supreme Court has applied that statute to challenges based on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law exclusive-remedy provisions and explained that that statute provides for \u201ctrial by the court without a jury of the issues raised by the supplemental answer.\u201d <em>Cornelison v. Seabold, </em>254 Or 401, 404, 460 P2d 1009 (1969); <em>see also Bibby v. Hillstrom, </em>260 Or 367, 372, 490 P2d 161 (1971) (any claim of offset for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to plaintiff must be determined by the trial court with the use of supplement pleadings and proceedings). In <em>Cornelison, </em>the court also concluded that that procedure \u2014 requiring the trial court to determine the facts underlying the legal issue of whether the exclusive-remedy bar applied \u2014 is constitutional. In so deciding, the court emphasized that the issues raised by the supplemental challenge are distinct from the nature of the overall action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">\u201cThus, although the overall proceeding is one known to common law the particular issue raised by the supplemental answers is not one known to the common law. Analytically, it would seem that it should be the nature of the particular issue in the proceeding, rather than that of the entire proceeding, which should dictate whether this issue is to be tried with or without a jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">That same analytical approach informs the issue raised by plaintiff here. The trial court admitted evidence that the beneficiaries of Toohey and Ketcheson had received workers\u2019 compensation benefits only in the supplemental proceeding before the court of whether immunity attached to Ketcheson\u2019s actions, that is, to determine whether Ketcheson was acting within his employment. That proceeding is not a \u201cthird party action.\u201d It is a separate, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>supplemental proceeding that is, by statute, made distinct from the overall proceeding. Until the trial court resolved defendant\u2019s challenge to plaintiffs action as a \u201cthird party action,\u201d plaintiff could not proceed against defendant. <em>See </em>ORS 656.018(3)(a) - (d) (setting out exceptions for coworker immunity); ORS 656.154 (\u201cIf the injury to a worker is due to the negligence or wrong of a third person not in the same employ, the injured worker, or if death results from the injury, the spouse, children or other dependents, as the case may be, may elect to seek a remedy against such third person.\u201d); <em>SAIF v. Meredith, </em>104 Or App 570, 574, 802 P2d 95 (1990) (\u201c\u2018[The term \u2018third person\u2019] applies to any one incurring a common law liability for injury to workmen not immune to suit under the Act.\u2019\u201d (Quoting <em>Wimer v.

To the extent that plaintiff has properly raised that issue, we reject it. Because the FAA rules, and Ketcheson\u2019s compliance or noncompliance with those rules, are not relevant to determining whether Ketcheson was acting within his employment for Wyndham, the trial court did not err in excluding that evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b443-6\"> ORS 656.005(7)(a) provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">\u201cA \u2018compensable injury\u2019 is an accidental injury, or accidental injury to prosthetic appliances, <em>arising out of and in the course of employment </em>requiring medical services or resulting in disability or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">(Emphasis added.)
