J.</author>\n<p id=\"b43-4\">Defendant pleaded no contest to theft in the second degree, ORS 164.045, for stealing jeans from a retail store. On appeal, defendant contends that the trial court erred by awarding restitution based on the retail value of the stolen jeans, rather than their wholesale value. For the reasons that follow, we disagree and, accordingly, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">The circumstances material to our review are undisputed. In January 2013, defendant shoplifted 15 pairs of jeans from a Macy\u2019s department store in Multnomah County. Defendant pleaded no contest to second-degree theft and stipulated to pay restitution. At the outset of the restitution hearing, both parties agreed that, according to <em>State v. Onishchenko, </em>249 Or App 470, 476, 278 P3d 63, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 378 (2012) (which we discuss below), the court was required to use the \u201cfair market value\u201d of the stolen jeans as the measure of restitution. However, the parties disagreed on whether the proper referent \u201cmarket\u201d was the retail market or the wholesale market.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">According to defendant, who acknowledged that Macy\u2019s operated in both the wholesale and retail markets, the proper measure of \u201cfair market value\u201d was the wholesale value of the stolen property, because that is what it would cost Macy\u2019s to replace the jeans.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In that regard, defendant asserted that such an award in this case would comport with the remedial purpose of restitution, whereas awarding the retail value, in the absence of proof of lost sales, would confer a windfall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-7\">\u201cAlthough fifteen pairs of jeans were missing, Macy\u2019s still had stock, they still had merchandise available for sale. * * * [T]heir loss was the replacement value of those items. And if Macy\u2019s goes to replace jeans, they may do it at a lower rate than \u2014 I mean, obviously, they mark it up to resell it. I mean, that\u2019s how stores work. They get a profit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-8\">\u201c* * * [Defendant] should not be on the hook for the profit that Macy\u2019s would have gotten from those jeans, because they did not suffer an opportunity loss. In other words, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>flash mob did not steal all the jeans and prevent them from making any sales that day. So all Macy\u2019s is out is what it cost them to replace those fifteen pairs of jeans. ***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">\u201c* * * Clearly [awarding the retail value is] not fair. You need to make the victim whole. In this case, what makes the victim whole is the wholesale price of the items stolen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-7\">\u201c*** [T]his is not a punitive damages situation. And if the Court awards \u2014 I submit that if the Court awards Macy\u2019s the retail value that they would have charged for the jeans at the till, that profit that they would have gotten at that sale if that comes at [defendant\u2019s] expense, that is a windfall to Macy\u2019s, that that\u2019s in the nature of punitive damages.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">The state acknowledged that it had no \u201cinformation to say that [Macy\u2019s] did not have more inventory to put on their shelves\u201d after defendant\u2019s theft, and it could not \u201cspeculate * * * if [Macy\u2019s] would have sold [the jeans] \u201d if defendant had not stolen them. Nevertheless, invoking <em>Onishchenko, </em>249 Or App at 476, the state remonstrated that the proper measure of the fair market value \u201cis the price at which [the jeans] probably would have been sold in the regular course of business at the time and place where they were stolen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\">The trial court agreed with the state that the referent market was the retail market:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-10\">\u201cIn a criminal theft case, the relevant market value is the value in the market in which the goods were being traded, namely the price at which they probably would have been sold in the regular course of business at the time when and place they were stolen. They would have sold for $68 a pair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-12\">\u201c* * * Well, it will be interesting to see what the Court of Appeals does. I\u2019m going to impose the retail price, because I think that\u2019s what <em>Onishchenko </em>says.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b44-13\">Consequently, the court awarded restitution corresponding to the retail value of the stolen jeans \u2014 $1,020.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-14\">On appeal, defendant renews his contention that the court erred by imposing the retail value of the stolen property as restitution. Defendant acknowledges that his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>contention is similar to that which we rejected in <em>State v. Labar, </em>259 Or App 334, 314 P3d 328 (2013) \u2014 which was decided after the trial court awarded restitution in this case \u2014 but he argues that <em>Labar </em>is either distinguishable or wrongly decided. As explained below, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\">We begin by reviewing the relevant statutes. ORS 137.106 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-5\">\u201c(l)(a) When a person is convicted of a crime * * * that has resulted in economic damages, the district attorney shall investigate and present to the court * * * evidence of the nature and amount of the damages. * * * If the court finds from the evidence presented that a victim suffered economic damages * * * the court shall enter a judgment or supplemental judgment requiring that the defendant pay the victim restitution in a specific amount that equals the full amount of the victim\u2019s economic damages * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">Under that statute, the state has the burden of producing \u201cevidence of the nature and amount of the damages [,]\u201d and proving those damages by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State v. Yocum, </em>247 Or App 507, 512, 269 P3d 113 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 25 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">The term \u201ceconomic damages,\u201d as used in ORS 137.106, is defined by ORS 137.103(2) as <em>\u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses </em>including but not limited to *** reasonable and necessarily incurred costs due to loss of use of property.\u201d ORS 31.710(2)(a) (emphasis added). The term \u201cobjectively verifiable monetary losses\u201d means \u201closses that are \u2018capable of verification through objective facts.\u2019\u201d <em>Yocum, </em>247 Or App at 512 (quoting <em>DeVaux v. Presby, </em>136 Or App 456, 463, 902 P2d 593 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">In <em>State v. Ramos, </em>267 Or App 164, 340 P3d 703 (2014), we clarified that, for purposes of restitution in criminal actions, \u201ceconomic damages\u201d are no longer <em>limited </em>to those that a victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We explained that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b45-9\">\u201c[i]n 2005, the Legislative Assembly amended ORS 137.103 and ORS 137.106 <em>to expand the scope of restitution. </em>Under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the former version of the statutes, a victim was entitled to restitution if the victim had suffered \u2018pecuniary damages\u2019 as a result of a defendant\u2019s criminal activities. ORS 137.106 (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 564, \u00a7 2. \u2018Pecuniary damages,\u2019 in turn, was defined as \u2018all special damages, but not general damages, which a person could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the facts or events constituting the defendant\u2019s criminal activities [listing examples.]\u2019 ORS 137.103 (2003), <em>amended by </em>Or Laws 2005, ch 564, \u00a7 1. After the amendments, a victim is entitled to restitution of \u2018economic damages,\u2019 which term \u2014 as noted above \u2014 has the broad meaning set out in ORS 31.170(2)(a): \u2018objectively verifiable monetary losses [listing examples].\u2019 <em>See also </em>Tape Recording, House Committee on Judiciary, HB 2230, Jan 24, 2005, Tape 137, Side A (statement of Fred Boss, Chief Counsel of the Oregon Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Enforcement Division; introducing the bill on behalf of its sponsor, the Attorney General\u2019s Restitution Reform Task Force, and explaining that the bill was intended to replace the term \u2018pecuniary damages\u2019 \u2014 and specifically including the requirement that the damages would have been recoverable in a civil action \u2014 with the concept of\u2018economic damages\u2019).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b46-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 175-76 (brackets in <em>Ramos', </em>emphasis added). Thus, as we noted in <em>Ramos, </em>the amendments to ORS 137.103 and ORS 137.106 were intended to <em>expand </em>recovery beyond that which was previously available by eliminating the \u201crecoverable in a civil action\u201d <em>limitation </em>on restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">The practical, and legal, upshot is that, in \u201cVenn\u201d diagram terms, any recovery permitted under our precedents applying the \u201crecoverable in a civil action\u201d formulation is necessarily a subset within the broader \u201ceconomic damages\u201d universe. Among those precedents \u2014 which we cited favorably in <em>Onishchenko, </em>the case on which the trial court here relied \u2014 is <em>State v Wise, </em>150 Or App 449, 946 P2d 363 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">In <em>Wise, </em>we determined that the appropriate measure of restitution in a theft case was the damages that the victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action for conversion. 150 Or App at 455. There, the trial court had ordered the defendant, who was convicted of two counts of first-degree theft, to pay the appreciated value of the stolen firearms, $1,090. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant argued that the court erred in awarding that amount because there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>evidence that the victim had purchased the guns for only $750. <em>Id. </em>We rejected that contention, holding that (1) \u201cconversion is the civil action that would impose liability on [the] defendant\u201d and (2) \u201c[t]he measure of damages for conversion of personal property is <em>the reasonable market value at the time it was taken! Id. </em>(emphasis added). We concluded, consistently with that standard, that $1,090 appeared to be a \u201csuitable estimate of the guns\u2019 market value at the time of conversion.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">In <em>Onishchenko, </em>on which the trial court here relied, we invoked <em>Wise </em>in affirming the imposition of a compensatory fine under ORS 137.101(1) (not restitution). There, the defendant was convicted of aggravated first-degree theft, ORS 164.057, for stealing a large number of new shoes from the victim, whose retail shoe store had recently gone out of business. 249 Or App at 471. At the hearing pertaining to a compensatory fine, the state presented evidence of the purchase price that the victim had paid for each pair of shoes in addition to the retail price that the victim was going to charge for the shoes before his store went out of business. <em>Id. </em>at 472. The defendant argued that the court should not use the purchase price of the shoes, because the victim had testified that shoes lose value over time, and there was evidence that the victim would not be able to sell them for the same amount that he purchased them for. <em>Id. </em>The state responded that the best indicator of the value of the shoes was what the victim had paid for them \u2014 and, thus, to make the victim whole again, the court should award the purchase price. <em>Id. </em>The trial court agreed with the state and imposed a compensatory fine for the amount that the victim had paid for the shoes, because that \u201creflected the value of the shoes at the time they were stolen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">On appeal, we first noted that a requisite for imposition of a compensatory fine is that the criminal conduct results in an injury for which the victim \u201chas a remedy by civil action,\u201d ORS 137.101(1), and then stated that the victim \u201cwould have a civil action for conversion against [the] defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475-76. We continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-6\">\u2018\u201cThe measure of damages for conversion of personal property is the reasonable market value [of the property] at the time it was taken.\u2019 <em>State v. Wise, </em>150 Or App 449, 455, 946 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>P2d 363 (1997); <em>see also State v. Callaghan, </em>33 Or App 49, 58, 576 P2d 14, <em>rev den, </em>284 Or 1 (1978) (in a criminal theft case, the relevant \u2018market value\u2019 is \u2018the value in the market in which the goods were being traded, namely, the price at which they probably would have been sold in the regular course of business at the time when and place where they were stolen\u2019).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 477. We concluded that there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to determine that the victim had suffered loss in the amount of the purchase price of the shoes. <em>Id. </em>at 479.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">In sum, <em>Onishchenko </em>(albeit addressing the imposition of a compensatory fine) and <em>Wise </em>established and ratified three principles under the (now-subsumed) \u201crecoverable in a civil action\u201d construct. First, the analogous \u201ccivil action\u201d for theft is conversion. Second, the measure of conversion damages \u2014 and, hence, for restitution for theft \u2014 is \u201cmarket value.\u201d And, third, the relevant \u201cmarket\u201d is determined by reference to the time and place of the theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-7\">Most recently, in <em>Labar, </em>259 Or App at 335, we applied those principles in a closely similar case. In <em>Labar, </em>the defendant was convicted of a number of crimes arising from robberies of Oxycontin from a pharmacy. <em>Id. </em>The trial court ordered the defendant to pay restitution to the pharmacy in the amount of $36,911.89, which was based on the pharmacist\u2019s testimony of the retail value of the stolen Oxycontin tablets. <em>Id. </em>at 336. On appeal, the defendant\u2014 like defendant in this case \u2014 contended that the court erred in awarding the retail cost of the stolen product, because, while the pharmacy would have been \u201cmade economically whole if it were paid the cost to replenish [the stolen property], *** plus any lost profits that it suffered,\u201d \u201c[t]he state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>did not present evidence by which to make those calculations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We affirmed. In so holding, we reiterated that the amount of restitution for theft was determined by the economic damages that the victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action for conversion. <em>Id. </em>at 336-37 (citing <em>Onishchenko, </em>249 Or App at 476).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We further noted that the proper \u201cmeasure of damages for the conversion of personal property is the reasonable market value of the goods converted at the time and place of conversion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 337 (internal quotation marks omitted). We concluded that, \u201c[i]n light of the record, the trial court did not err in finding the market value of the Oxycontin tablets to be their retail value nor in awarding restitution to [the pharmacy] on that basis.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We return to this case and \u201creview [the] award of restitution to determine whether it was imposed consistently with statutory requirements.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>150 Or App at 455. In doing so, we sustain the trial court\u2019s predicate findings if there is any evidence in the record to support them. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>249 Or App 93, 96, 274 P3d 289, <em>rev den, </em>353 Or 103 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Here, the trial court \u2014 consistently with <em>Wise, Onishchenko, </em>and <em>Labar </em>\u2014 proceeded from the premise that Macy\u2019s was entitled to restitution corresponding to \u201cthe reasonable market value\u201d of the stolen property, the jeans, \u201cat the time it was taken.\u201d <em>Wise, </em>150 Or App at 455. Further, there was evidence \u2014 specifically, that the jeans were stolen from shelves in retail space, where they were available to customers for sale \u2014 to support the court\u2019s determination that \u201cthe market in which the goods were being traded\u201d was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cthe retail market.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not err in determining that the market value of the stolen goods was their retail value and, consequently, in awarding restitution for that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b43-9\"> Defendant acknowledged that the retail value of the jeans was $68 per pair, for a total of $1,020, and he presented evidence that the wholesale value of the jeans was $35.98 per pair, for a total of $539.70.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b45-10\"> In so explaining, we disavowed the suggestion in several cases, including in <em>Labar, </em>that \u201cthe \u2018recoverable in a civil action\u2019 requirement still applies to restitution.\u201d <em>Ramos, </em>267 Or App at 176 n 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b48-8\"> In <em>Callaghan, </em>the discussion of \u201cmarket value\u201d pertained not to restitution but, instead, to the (arguably qualitatively) different matter of the proper measure of the value of stolen property for a classification of the offense for charging <em>purposes </em>\u2014 e.g., a person commits the crime of first-degree theft if the total value of the property is $1,000 or more, ORS 164.055. <em>See </em>33 Or App at 58.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b48-9\"> Given our conclusion in that regard, we did not reach and address the state\u2019s alternative contention that, for purposes of imposition of a compensatory fine, so long as the victim had suffered <em>some </em>economic damages, \u201cthe court could have imposed a compensatory fine in any amount up to the statutory maximum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b49-6\"> Defendant contends that <em>Labar </em>was wrongly decided because of that reference to the \u201crecoverable in a civil action\u201d construct. However, as noted above, 269 Or App at 25-26, any recovery under that construct would necessarily be encompassed within the expanded \u201ceconomic damages\u201d construct. <em>See Ramos, </em>267 Or App at 176 n 7 (disavowing that aspect of, <em>inter alia, Labar, </em>but not overruling the holdings of those cases).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b49-7\"> In so holding, we rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that the state\u2019s failure to present proof pertaining to lost profits precluded reference to the retail value measure of recovery and restitution. <em>See Labar, </em>259 Or App at 337 n 2 (noting that authority that the defendant invoked \u201cconcerns the recovery of lost profits as damages for breach of contract and is inapposite\u201d to the award of restitution, given that the referent civil action would be in tort, for conversion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b50-5\"> Defendant argues that this case is distinguishable from <em>Labor </em>because, unlike in that case, where there was no evidence of the wholesale value of the stolen Oxycontin, there was such evidence with respect to the jeans here. That distinction is, however, immaterial, because, to the extent that Macy\u2019s could be deemed to be operating in both the retail and wholesale markets, there was evidence to support the trial court\u2019s determination that, with respect to these particular goods, given the time and place of their loss, the relevant market was the retail market.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
