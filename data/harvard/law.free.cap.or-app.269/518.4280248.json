To qualify for a permitted template dwelling, petitioners had to show, among other things, that within a 160-acre square centered on their property, five dwellings existed as of 1993 and continue to exist. The dispute in this case is whether the structure that petitioners rely on for the fifth dwelling \u2014 a dilapidated house built in 1906 that has been vacant for some time \u2014 qualifies as a \u201cdwelling\u201d under the county\u2019s code provision. Both the county and LUBA concluded that it did not. We review LUBA\u2019s order to determine if it is \u201cunlawful in substance,\u201d ORS 197.850(9)(a), and, because we agree that the 1906 structure is not a dwelling that continues to exist, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Petitioners\u2019 property is located in the West Hills Rural Plan Area of Multnomah County, is zoned Commercial Forest Use 2 (CFU-2), and is capable of producing more than 85 cubic feet per acre of wood fiber annually. As a result, petitioners\u2019 property is property on which a \u201ctemplate dwelling\u201d may be permitted, provided it meets the \u201ctemplate test\u201d in the Multnomah County Code (MCC or code) section 33.2240(A)(3)(c). <em>See </em>MCC \u00a7 33.2225(B) (listing types of dwellings that may be permitted in a CFU-2 zone). For petitioners\u2019 property, the template test requires that, within a 160-acre square centered on the property, at least 11 other lawfully created lots existed as of January 1, 1993, and at least five dwellings lawfully existed as of January 1,1993, and continue to exist or have been replaced by lawful replacement dwellings.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCC \u00a7 33.2240(A)(3)(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Petitioners undisputedly showed that there were 11 qualifying lots and four qualifying dwellings surrounding their property. However, the county hearings officer found that the fifth structure on which petitioners relied did not qualify as a \u201cdwelling\u201d that \u201ccontinu\u00e9is] to exist\u201d under the code. LUBA\u2019s order described that structure (the 1906 structure) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-4\">\u201cThere is no dispute that the 1906 structure is in a \u2018state of significant disrepair.\u2019 The hearings officer\u2019s description of the 1906 structure is set out below:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u2018\u201c*** This 1906 structure is not presently occupied\u2014 it has been boarded up. Moreover, the building is not structurally intact \u2014 one half of the structure has split from the other, a portion of the roof is covered in plastic and another roof area is severely degraded with missing shingles, the windows are without glass and the siding has holes in it. In addition, other than Portland Maps data offered by the applicant that lists this building as a dwelling with a bathroom, the record contains no other evidence that the building has indoor plumbing, cooking facilities, or sanitation or that it is or has been recently inhabited. Lastly, County Assessment and Taxation records indicate the current value of the 1906 building is less than $2,500 and shows a range of values from $1,000 to $2,410 between the years of 1996 to 2013. These values indicate that the structure was in a similar, deteriorated and vacant condition for an extended period of time. * * *\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201cOur review of photographs in the record of the 1906 structure confirm the hearings officer\u2019s conclusion that the 1906 structure is a severely dilapidated, abandoned and boarded-up structure. Those photographs support the hearings officer\u2019s finding that the 1906 dwelling has not been occupied as a residence for a number of years. The tax records support a conclusion that the structure has been in a dilapidated condition since 1996, or the last 18 years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">(Record citations omitted; omissions in LUBA\u2019s order.) Petitioners did not dispute the hearings officer\u2019s description of the 1906 structure. Rather, they argued that it qualifies as a dwelling in that condition under the applicable definitions in the code. LUBA disagreed and affirmed both of the hearings officer\u2019s alternative reasons why the 1906 structure was not a dwelling that continues to exist: (1) the code definition of \u201cdwelling unit\u201d requires a dwelling to provide, in the present tense, complete living facilities, which the 1906 structure does not and (2) at best, the 1906 structure was a nonconforming dwelling use that has been abandoned and cannot be resumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">On review, petitioners assign error to both lines of reasoning affirmed by LUBA. We address only the first one \u2014 that the 1906 structure is not a dwelling that continues to exist \u2014 because we find it dispositive. Before turning to the parties\u2019 arguments, we first set out several definitions contained in the code that inform those arguments and our analysis. The code does not provide a definition for the stand-alone word \u201cdwelling.\u201d It does, however, define \u201cDwelling (Duplex or Two-Unit),\u201d \u201cDwelling (Single Family Detached),\u201d and \u201cDwelling (Multi-Plex Structure).\u201d Those definitions provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-6\">\u201cDwelling (Duplex or Two-Unit) \u2014 A detached building designed for two dwelling units, whether in separate or single ownership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cDwelling (Single Family Detached) \u2014 A detached building designed for one dwelling unit including Mobile Homes under the provisions as specified within the district.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cDwelling (Multi-Plex Structure) \u2014 See Multi-Plex Dwelling Structure.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u201cMulti-Plex Dwelling Structure \u2014 A row house or town house apartment structure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">MCC \u00a7 33.0005.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-5\">\u201cApartment- \u2014 -Any building or portion thereof used for or containing three or more dwelling units.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-6\"><em>Id. </em>Thus, under the code, a dwelling is a \u201cbuilding\u201d that is designed for, or for a multi-plex containing, the specified number of \u201cdwelling units\u201d for the applicable definition. Those terms are, in turn, defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">\u201cBuilding \u2014 Any structure used or intended for supporting or sheltering any use or occupancy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-9\">\u201cDwelling <em>Unit </em>\u2014 A single unit providing complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-10\"><em>Id. </em>Because the definition of building includes the term \u201cstructure,\u201d we also set out that definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-11\">\u201cStructure \u2014 That which is built or constructed. An edifice or building of any kind, or any piece of work artificially built up or composed of parts joined together in some definite manner.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-12\"><em>Id. </em>The parties agree that the 1906 structure is a \u201cstructure\u201d under the code, but disagree whether it is also a \u201cbuilding\u201d and a \u201cdwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-13\">Petitioners contend that the 1906 structure is both a \u201cstructure\u201d and a \u201cbuilding\u201d under the code. From there, petitioners argue that a \u201cDwelling (Single Family Detached)\u201d is only required to be a building that is <em>designed </em>for one-dwelling unit. Thus, petitioners conclude, the 1906 structure must be a dwelling because it was planned, or intended, to be constructed as a single-family dwelling when it was built in 1906. Petitioners argue that LUBA erred in affirming the county\u2019s requirement of habitability for the 1906 structure because the code definition for single-family dwelling requires that it only be <em>designed </em>for a single-dwelling unit, not that it <em>currently </em>provide all the attributes of a dwelling unit. In making that argument, petitioners point out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>that \u201cdwelling\u201d is necessarily a broad term that describes a building that may not have features of habitability because the code also defines the narrower subsets of \u201chabitable dwellings\u201d and \u201creplacement dwellings.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Petitioners assert that the \u201ccontinue to exist\u201d provision in the template test only means that the structure must physically continue to exist in some manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The county responds that the 1906 structure is neither a building nor a dwelling. The county argues that the definition of building uses the present tense \u2014 used, as in currently used, or intended, as in currently intended, for dwelling use \u2014 as opposed to the definition for structure, which is anything artificially constructed. It is the current capability of use, asserts the county, that qualifies a structure as a building. The county thus concludes that the 1906 structure is not a building (and thus also not a dwelling) because it is not currently being used as a dwelling and, given its state of significant disrepair, cannot be currently intended for such use. The county similarly argues that the definition of \u201cdwelling unit\u201d uses the present tense\u2014 <em>providing </em>complete living facilities \u2014 which means that, to be a dwelling, a building must currently contain those attributes. The county further responds that the use of the word \u201cdesigned\u201d only qualifies the number of dwelling units in those definitions as a means to distinguish types of dwellings for regulation; it does not qualify the term \u201cdwelling unit\u201d itself and thus, to be a dwelling, the building must currently provide the attributes of a dwelling unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">We agree with the county that the 1906 structure is not a dwelling that continues to exist under the template <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>test. The code defines dwelling by distinguishing among three types of dwellings \u2014 single-family detached, two-unit, and multi-plex \u2014 and which type applies depends on the number of dwelling units the building contains or is designed for. <em>See </em>MCC \u00a7 33.0005 (definitions). The overarching word \u201cdwelling\u201d is thus just a reference to any dwelling regardless of the number of dwelling units it is designed for; it is not a term that has a different meaning than those three types of defined dwellings. Here, the 1906 structure, if a dwelling at all, could only be a single-family detached dwelling, so we focus on that definition, as did the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">After inserting the definition of dwelling unit, a single-family detached dwelling is defined under the code as a \u201cdetached building designed for one\u201d \u201csingle unit providing complete, independent living facilities for one or more persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation.\u201d MCC \u00a7 33.0005 (definitions of \u201cDwelling (Single Family Detached)\u201d and \u201cDwelling Unit\u201d). Petitioners focus on the word \u201cdesigned\u201d and argue that a building need only to have been designed \u2014 at some point \u2014 for one dwelling unit and, thus, the 1906 structure is a dwelling. The difficulty that we have with petitioners\u2019 argument is that it ignores the template test requirement that the dwelling \u201ccontinue to exist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Again, the template test requires, among other things, that \u201c[a]t least five dwellings lawfully existed on January 1,1993 within the 160-acre square and those dwellings either continue to exist or have been replaced by lawful replacement dwellings.\u201d MCC \u00a7 33.2240(A)(3)(c). Contrary to petitioners\u2019 argument \u201ccontinue to exist\u201d does not simply mean that a building that used to be a dwelling need only have some sort of presence, however dilapidated or unrecognizable, in the physical world. The template test requires that a lawful dwelling \u201ccontinue to exist\u201d in the present tense, such that the dwelling, <em>as a dwelling, </em>must continue to exist as of date the template test is applied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> That requires us to look at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>the 1906 structure as it is designed as of petitioners\u2019 application date \u2014 not how it may have been designed in 1906 or some other point in the past. Thus, even taking petitioners\u2019 focus on the word \u201cdesigned,\u201d we cannot agree that the 1906 structure continues to exist as a dwelling. The 1906 structure is not designed for a dwelling unit \u2014 at a minimum, it lacks a functional roof, intact exterior walls and windows, and an accessible entrance, all of which indisputably are design requirements for a dwelling unit.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Whether an owner of the 1906 structure lawfully could (which is disputed by the parties) restore the structure such that in the future it could be designed for a single dwelling unit is of no moment. The template test requires the dwelling to continue to exist as a dwelling at the time of petitioners\u2019 application for a new template dwelling. The 1906 structure does not meet that test. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b539-6\"> MCC section 33.2240 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">\u201c(A) A template dwelling may be sited on a tract, subject to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">\u201c(3) The tract shall meet the following standards:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">\u201c(c) If the tract is predominantly composed of soils which are capable of producing above 85 cf/ac/yr of Douglas Fir timber; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-12\">\u201c1. The lot upon which the dwelling is proposed to be sited and at least all or part of 11 other lawfully created lots existed on January 1, 1993 within a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>160-acre square when centered on the center of the subject tract parallel and perpendicular to section lines; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">\u201c2. At least five dwellings lawfully existed on January 1, 1993 within the 160-acre square and those dwellings either continue to exist or have been replaced by lawful replacement dwellings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">In 1993, the legislature authorized forest template dwellings in forest zones in western Oregon. Under that statute, the template test for property like petitioners\u2019 is 11 lots and three dwellings within the 160-acre square that existed as of January 1, 1993. ORS 215.750(l)(c). The Land Conservation and Development Commission (LCDC) promulgated an administrative rule that sets out the same template test, but also requires that the dwellings \u201ccontinue to exist.\u201d OAR 660-006-0027(3)(c). Neither the statute nor the LCDC rule provides a definition of \u201cdwelling.\u201d The county\u2019s code is more restrictive than both the statute and the LCDC rule because it requires five dwellings that \u201ccontinue to exist.\u201d We have previously concluded that the county\u2019s more restrictive code provision is valid. <em>Miller v. Multnomah County, </em>153 Or App 30, 40, 956 P2d 209 (1998). In this case, we are called on to interpret the meaning of \u201cdwelling\u201d only as that term is used in MCC section 33.2240(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b543-6\"> \u201cHabitable Dwelling\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFT\">\u201cAn existing dwelling that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">\u201c(a) Has intact exterior walls and roof structure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-8\">\u201c(b) Has indoor plumbing consisting of a kitchen sink, toilet and bathing facilities connected to a sanitary waste disposal system;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-9\">\u201c(c) Has interior wiring for interior lights;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-10\">\u201c(d) Has a heating system; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmI\">\u201c(e) Was lawfully established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">MCC \u00a7 33.0005.
