J.</author>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In this consolidated appeal, father appeals judgments changing the permanency plans for his three children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Following a permanency hearing in which father\u2019s counsel did not appear, the juvenile court changed the plan for father\u2019s oldest child from reunification to \u201canother planned permanent living arrangement\u201d (APPLA) and changed the plans for father\u2019s two younger children from reunification to guardianship. The substance of father\u2019s challenge on appeal is that his counsel\u2019s failure to appear at the permanency hearing constituted inadequate assistance of counsel under <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>310 Or 176, 796 P2d 1193 (1990), requiring reversal of the judgments\u2014 an argument that father makes for the first time on appeal. The Department of Human Services (DHS) responds that we should decline to consider that challenge \u201cbecause father had the option of raising that complaint to the trial court and that court is the more appropriate forum to resolve such challenges.\u201d We agree with DHS. ORS 419B.923 provides a trial-level mechanism to set aside judgments in dependency cases, and, because that remedy is available to challenge the adequacy of dependency counsel, <em>Geist </em>is inapplicable. Because father did not preserve his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel in this case, we do not consider it. For that reason, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">In March 2013, the juvenile court took jurisdiction over mother and father\u2019s three children \u2014 then ages 8, 12, and 14 \u2014 based, as to father, on father\u2019s stipulation that his use of alcohol and controlled substances interferes with his ability to provide safe, appropriate, and consistent care for the children.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Father was ordered to participate in services. Neither parent appeared at the first review hearing on June 5, 2013, though their attorneys were present. The court scheduled a permanency hearing for August 29 to determine whether the permanency plans for the children should be changed from reunification to other plans. Father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>and mother failed to appear at the start of that hearing, and father\u2019s attorney also failed to appear. Attorneys for DHS, the children, and mother were present. The court tried, unsuccessfully, to contact father\u2019s attorney and waited 12 minutes before beginning the hearing, noting that it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d for father\u2019s attorney not to be present. The court then proceeded with the hearing and, after taking evidence and hearing argument (including from children\u2019s appointed counsel, who advocated in favor of changing the plans), decided to change the permanency plan for the oldest child, R, to APPLA and to change the plans for the younger children, M and T, to guardianship.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">At that point, father and mother arrived, and the court informed them of its decision to change the permanency plans. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cThis is a legal juncture of significance, but by no means is it the end. As I said the last time, if there was not progress by today, this would be a short hearing. There hasn\u2019t been. I don\u2019t want anybody to feel bad. I\u2019m not up here to kick people around. Ours is not a punishment-oriented system. It is about getting kids back to their parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-6\">\u201cBut if they are unable to distance themselves from things that are risky to kids, like drug use and the like, then the kids are entitled to a safe, permanent home. They are entitled to that sooner, not later. Now, every kid is entitled to that. That\u2019s the assumption that the law makes. These decisions are designed to accomplish that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-7\">\u201cThe point here for the parents, [mother and father], you can change the circumstance now. I just decided that we were going to keep this hearing on for October. That\u2019s because the plan could change back at that next hearing, if you can embrace recovery and put yourself in the position to be a safe parent. You don\u2019t have to have it all accomplished by October. But if you could get yourselves into treatment and embrace recovery, then there is the potential that the plan could change back in October.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The discussion that followed was, in large part, devoted to the court\u2019s concern about R, who had run away from foster <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>care and was, apparently, living on the streets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> During the course of that conversation, father told the court \u2014 in an unsworn statement \u2014 that he \u201cwas under the impression that [he] was doing what DHS was requesting of [him].\u201d He stated that he \u201cwent through Tigard Detox,\u201d was \u201cenrolled in Clackamas County Behavioral Health Program,\u201d and had had clean urinalyses. He also indicated that he had, the day before the hearing, dropped off a release to DHS. Father did not say anything about the absence of his attorney at the hearing; nor did he indicate to the court that he was opposed to the change in permanency plans for the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The court subsequently entered permanency judgments consistent with its decision at the hearing. Father did not move to set aside the judgments. <em>See </em>ORS 419B.923 (set out below at 269 Or App at 460-61).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">On appeal, father seeks to have those judgments reversed. He purports to assert nine separate assignments of error; however, he presents a single combined argument in which he contends that, because his counsel failed to appear at the permanency hearing, he received inadequate assistance of counsel, was consequently denied a fundamentally fair hearing, and, under <em>Geist, </em>is entitled to reversal of the permanency judgments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Father acknowledges that he failed to preserve that argument, but contends, quoting <em>Geist, </em>310 Or at 184 n 9, that he is \u201cnot required to have preserved his claim because \u2018the general rule that appellate courts will only consider error that has been preserved at trial need not be strictly applied to the issue of appointed counsel\u2019s adequacy in a parental rights termination proceeding.\u2019\u201d We disagree. A close reading of <em>Geist, </em>in light of the enactment of ORS 419B.923 and our cases construing that statute, leads to the conclusion that, as the state contends, father\u2019s claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>as to the inadequacy of his appointed trial counsel must be made in the first instance in the juvenile court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">We begin with <em>Geist. Geist </em>involved the review-ability on direct appeal of a judgment terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights. The Supreme Court held that the statutory right to counsel for indigent parents in termination cases included the right to adequate counsel, and that, <em>\u201c[ajbsent an express legislative procedure for vindicating the statutory right to adequate </em>counsel, this court may fashion an appropriate procedure.\u201d 310 Or at 185 (emphasis added). Emphasizing the importance of finality in termination cases, the court noted that \u201ca procedure that allows a terminated parent to make a claim of inadequate counsel only after all direct statutory appeals have been exhausted would only further delay the finality of the termination decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187. Because of that concern and in the absence of statutes prohibiting it, the court concluded that challenges to the adequacy of appointed trial counsel in termination proceedings were reviewable on direct appeal, notwithstanding the lack of preservation. <em>Id. </em>at 184 n 9 (noting that, \u201c [b]ecause of the important timeliness considerations,\u201d the general rule that appellate courts will not consider error that has not been preserved at trial \u201cneed not be strictly applied to the issue of appointed trial counsel\u2019s adequacy in a parental rights termination proceeding\u201d). The court also determined that the standard of adequacy required was one that ensured \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d and that the parent making the challenge has the burden of proving that that standard has not been satisfied. <em>Id. </em>at 191.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>The following year, we extended the reasoning in <em>Geist </em>to allow direct review of appointed counsel\u2019s performance in the context of other dependency proceedings. <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Charles /Austin, </em>106 Or App 628, 810 P2d 389, <em>rev den, </em>312 Or 150 (1991) (allowing inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim in appeal of jurisdictional judgment). Those cases provide the foundation for father\u2019s argument that we can properly consider unpreserved claims of inadequate assistance of counsel on direct review of juvenile dependency judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The problem with father\u2019s reasoning, however, is that the legal landscape has changed significantly \u2014 and dispositively \u2014 in the almost 25 years since <em>Geist </em>was decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">As just discussed, a primary rationale for the court\u2019s decision in <em>Geist </em>was the absence of a \u201clegislative procedure for vindicating the statutory right to adequate counsel.\u201d 310 Or at 185; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201cThe statutory right to adequate trial counsel may prove illusory if there is no procedure for review of claims of inadequate counsel.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)). However, in 2001, the legislature enacted ORS 419B.923, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201c(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, on motion and such notice and hearing as the court may direct, <em>the court may modify or set aside any order or judgment made by it. Reasons for modifying or setting aside an order or judgment include, but are not limited to:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-7\">\u201c(a) Clerical mistakes in judgments, order or other parts of the record and errors in the order or judgment arising from oversight or omission. These mistakes and errors may be corrected by the court at any time on its own motion or on the motion of a party and after notice as the court orders to all parties who have appeared. During the pendency of an appeal, an order or judgment may be corrected as provided in subsection (7) of this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-8\">\u201c(b) Excusable neglect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">\u201c(c) Newly discovered evidence that by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to present it at the hearing from which the order or judgment is issued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>\u201c(3) A motion to modify or set aside an order or judgment must be made within a reasonable time except no order or judgment pursuant to ORS 419B.527 [authorizing post-TPR order placing ward in legal custody of agency authorized to consent to adoption and other dispositions] may be set aside or modified during the pendency of a proceeding for the adoption of the ward, nor after a petition for adoption has been granted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">\u201c(7) <em>A motion under subsection (1) of this section may be filed with and decided by the trial court during the time an appeal from a judgment is pending before an appellate court. </em>* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201c(8) This section does not limit the inherent power of a court to modify an order or judgment within a reasonable time or the power of a court to set aside an order or judgment for fraud upon the court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">(Emphasis added.) Thus, ORS 419B.923 now provides the statutory procedure for a parent to challenge the adequacy of counsel that was missing in <em>Geist. </em>And it does so \u2014 appropriately\u2014in the trial court, the forum that both we and the Supreme Court have recognized provides the more efficient means to resolve such claims, which are inherently fact dependent. <em>See Geist, </em>310 Or at 192 n 16; <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Kopp, </em>180 Or App 566, 578, 43 P3d 1197 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">Father (and the dissent) nonetheless contend that father was not <em>required </em>to pursue the remedy under ORS 419B.923 to challenge the adequacy of his trial counsel because there was a similar set-aside statute in effect at the time that <em>Geist </em>was decided and because ORS 419B.923 does not offer an <em>express </em>legislative procedure to vindicate the statutory right to counsel, as contemplated by <em>Geist. </em>Those arguments do not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">Although father is correct that ORS 419B.923 derives from a similar statute that was in effect when <em>Geist </em>was <em>decided </em>\u2014 viz., <em>former </em>ORS 419.529(1) (1989), <em>repealed by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>Or Laws 1993, ch 33, \u00a7 373\u00ae \u2014 the court may very well have not considered that statute to be an available remedy because it was part of a scheme that, potentially, made it ineffective in the context of a challenge to a termination of parental rights (TPR) judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In any event, the <em>Geist </em>court did not mention it. And <em>post-Geist </em>developments have made it clear that the set-aside mechanism, now codified at ORS 419B.923, <em>is </em>expressly available as a remedy to challenge the adequacy of appointed counsel in juvenile dependency matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-4\">First, in <em>Kopp, </em>we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the mother, whose parental rights had been terminated by default, was precluded from moving to set aside the default judgment under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 (the predecessor to ORS 419B.923(1), <em>see </em>269 Or App at 462 n 6) because ORS 419B.524 denied her standing to do that.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>180 Or App at 579. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>We concluded that \u201ca construction of ORS 419B.524 that deprives a terminated parent of standing to seek, under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420, an order modifying or setting aside the termination judgment would have [the] effect\u201d of impairing the parent\u2019s right under the Due Process Clause to a \u201cfundamentally fair\u201d hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 576-77. Thus, we held, ORS 419B.524 must be interpreted to allow such a process.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Next, in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. D. G., </em>260 Or App 525, 317 P3d 950 (2014), we considered the scope of the juvenile court\u2019s authority under ORS 419B.923 to set aside a judgment \u2014 specifically, in that case, a default judgment terminating the mother\u2019s parental rights. Construing ORS 419B.923(1), we observed that the text <em>itself </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cthe court may modify or set aside <em>any </em>order or judgment made by it\u201d (emphasis added) \u2014 described the court\u2019s authority broadly and did not limit that authority to the nonexclusive list of reasons specifically enumerated in the <em>statute </em>\u2014 viz., clerical mistakes, excusable neglect, and newly discovered evidence. A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App at 536.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">Our extensive review of the statute\u2019s enactment history confirmed that understanding. <em>Id. </em>For example, we quoted testimony from one of the workgroup members who had drafted the legislation that the statute <em>expands </em>the grounds\u2019 upon which a parent may move to set aside a juvenile court\u2019s order <em>\u2018beyond </em>those authorized by ORCP 71, which are limited.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539 (quoting Tape Recording, Senate Judiciary Committee, HB 2611, Apr 30, 2011, Tape 115, Side B (statement of Michael Livingston)) (emphasis in A. <em>D. G.). </em>Consequently, we concluded that, because the mother had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">\u201craise [d] a serious question regarding the juvenile court\u2019s authority to enter the default judgment [that] she [sought to have] set aside and a colorable claim of a violation of her due process rights by virtue of the juvenile court\u2019s interpretation of its authority to enter judgment without allowing her the opportunity to defend against the allegations in the TPR petition at the hearing she attended,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>there were sufficient grounds for the juvenile court to consider exercising its authority under ORS 419B.923(1) to set aside the default judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 539-40. Our holding in <em>A. D. G. </em>leaves little doubt that a claim of inadequate assistance of trial counsel- \u2014 -a claim also based on due-process concerns, <em>Geist, </em>310 Or at 189-90 \u2014 would similarly fall within the court\u2019s broad discretionary authority to address under ORS 419B.9230).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">Thus, since the enactment of ORS 419B.923(1), as construed in A. <em>D. G., </em>a crucial predicate of the court\u2019s reasoning in <em>Geist </em>\u2014 that direct appellate review of this type of claim was necessary due to the lack of any other mechanism to vindicate the right to adequate counsel \u2014 no longer exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Similar reasoning, in fact, led us to reject in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. M. U., </em>229 Or App 35, 210 P3d 254 (2009), a mother\u2019s argument that we should create a remedy on direct appeal for her claim that her counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely appeal of a juvenile court judgment constituted inadequate assistance of counsel. The mother relied on <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Hammons, </em>169 Or App 589, 593-94, 10 P3d 310 (2000), in which we had concluded, under the reasoning of <em>Geist, </em>that it was permissible for us to fashion a remedy on appeal for the inadequate assistance of the mother\u2019s appellate counsel for failing to file a timely appeal of a termination judgment, because, as in <em>Geist, </em>a legislative procedure to vindicate the mother\u2019s statutory right to counsel did not exist. However, by the time that we considered <em>M. U., </em>the legislature had amended ORS 419A.200 to provide such a procedure. Thus, we held, \u201cthe decisive factor upon which our authority to craft a remedy in <em>Hammons </em>was predicated\u201d \u2014 the absence of a legislative procedure to address the asserted inadequacy \u2014 was itself absent. <em>M. U., </em>229 Or App at 43. Accordingly, we concluded that the mother\u2019s remedy was governed by the procedure that the legislature had provided \u2014 ORS 419A.200(5).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>So, too, has the legislature provided a procedure for a parent to assert a challenge to the adequacy of his or her appointed trial counsel as a reason for setting aside a permanency judgment made by the juvenile court \u2014 that procedure is ORS 419B.923(1). Contrary to father\u2019s and the dissent\u2019s contention otherwise, given our construction and application of ORS 419B.923(1) in <em>A. D. G., </em>that provision now constitutes an \u201cexpress legislative procedure\u201d for ensuring that the statutory right to counsel in dependency cases is not illusory. <em>Geist, </em>310 Or at 185. Thus, we are not, as the dissent contends, disregarding the mandate of <em>Geist. </em>269 Or App at 469 (Egan, J., dissenting). Rather, as in <em>M. U., </em>the existence of that legislatively prescribed procedure negates the applicability of <em>Geist. </em>Because of the availability of a legislative procedure for vindicating the right to counsel, <em>Geist\u2019s </em>premise \u2014 that direct appeal is necessary \u2014 evaporates.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The other rationale supporting the court\u2019s decision in <em>Geist </em>\u2014 the need for \u201cexpeditious resolution\u201d of dependency cases, 310 Or at 187* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> \u2014 is also best served by requiring a parent to first seek to set aside an erroneous judgment in the trial court. First, a motion to set aside a judgment in the trial court under ORS 419B.923(1) can be filed <em>at the same time </em>that an appeal from the judgment is pending in this court. ORS 419B.923(7). Thus, even if, as father points out, trial counsel\u2019s alleged inadequacy does not surface until appellate counsel is appointed, ORS 419B.923(7) provides for that contingency by allowing a motion to set aside to be filed in the juvenile court during the pendency of an appeal. And, that motion need not unnecessarily delay appellate review. ORS 419B.923(7); ORAP 2.22(2)(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>(allowing appeal to be held in abeyance, or to go forward, pending disposition of a motion filed in the juvenile court under ORS 419B.923). Moreover, the remedy provided by ORS 419B.923 does not, as the Supreme Court was concerned in <em>Geist, </em>\u201callow a *** parent to make a claim of inadequate counsel only after all direct statutory appeals [are] exhausted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Second, allowing a challenge to the adequacy of counsel on direct appeal \u2014 as opposed to first pursuing that relief in the trial court \u2014 will likely <em>extend </em>the litigation rather than shorten it. That is because such challenges turn on factual questions, questions that the trial court is better equipped to resolve because it, unlike the appellate court, already has mechanisms in place to receive and evaluate evidence.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Supreme Court recognized as much in <em>Geist. </em>In a lengthy footnote \u2014 some of which is set out at 269 Or App at 459 n 5 \u2014 the court indicated its view that those issues generally are best resolved at the trial level. <em>See </em>310 Or at 192 n 16 (\u201c[A]ny determination that relevant evidence or argument was omitted or whether such omission would have made any difference in the outcome is best made by the trial court.\u201d). As the court discussed, the state had proposed a procedure whereby, after settlement of the transcript on appeal, appellate counsel would have a set time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>within which to move this court for a remand to the juvenile court to take further evidence on the question of adequacy of trial counsel; presumably, opposing counsel would then have time to respond; and, if we agreed that remand was necessary, we could send the case back to the trial court for fact finding. <em>Id. </em>Even if we did not adopt that procedure, we presumably would need to establish <em>some </em>method to obtain trial court fact finding in those cases. Requiring, instead, that the parent seek to resolve the asserted inadequacy of counsel in the trial court under ORS 419B.923(1) would eliminate the unnecessary step of a remand \u2014 after (if, for example, a plan similar to the one that the state proposed in <em>Geist </em>were to be adopted) the further step of additional briefing and decision making on whether a remand is needed. If the parent\u2019s ORS 419B.923(1) motion is denied by the juvenile court, the parent would then be free to appeal that denial, and the issue would be before us with a properly developed factual record.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">We made a similar observation in <em>Kopp. </em>In concluding that a parent must be permitted to seek an order setting aside a default termination judgment under the predecessor to ORS 419B.923, we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">\u201cIn particular, where a terminated parent has asserted a defect in the proceeding leading to termination, a hearing under <em>[former </em>ORS <em>419B.420] </em>\u2014 in <em>which, for example, a parent can develop a factual record relating to the asserted defect </em>\u2014 is best suited for providing the parent with the required \u2018opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 <em>See [Geist, </em>310 Or at 189-90] (stating that standard as the \u2018essence of fundamental fairness\u2019). A proceeding in juvenile court under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 is also <em>likely to be the most expeditious mechanism for resolving any asserted challenge </em>\u2014 including, if the court determines that modification or set-aside is warranted, the expeditious scheduling and hearing of whatever further proceedings are required. By comparison, an appeal\u2014 particularly one resulting in the reversal of the termination judgment and further proceedings below \u2014 may result in a much greater delay in final resolution of the matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-6\"><em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578-79 (emphasis added). There is nothing to be gained \u2014 and much to be sacrificed \u2014 by allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>claims of inadequate assistance of counsel to be made in the first instance on direct appeal when the legislature has provided, in ORS 419B.923(1), a more expeditious and efficient method to resolve them.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">This case illustrates the problem. Because we do not have a factual record concerning counsel\u2019s reason for not attending the hearing and the actions that counsel would or should have taken had he attended it, we have no basis to conclude that counsel failed to \u201cexercise professional skill and judgment\u201d on father\u2019s behalf, <em>Geist, </em>310 Or at 190, and that that failure prejudiced father\u2019s case, <em>id. </em>at 191 (parent challenging trial counsel\u2019s inadequacy must produce \u201csome credible evidence\u201d demonstrating that the proceeding was not fundamentally fair).</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">In sum, the premises upon which <em>Geist </em>is grounded have been negated by the availability of ORS 419B.923 as a mechanism for a parent in a dependency action to challenge the adequacy of his or her trial counsel in the juvenile court. In light of those developments \u2014 as well as the recognized need for expeditious resolution of these cases \u2014 we conclude that, to preserve a claim of inadequate assistance of appointed trial counsel, a parent in a dependency proceeding must first seek to resolve that issue in the juvenile court by moving, under ORS 419B.923(1), for the court to modify or set aside the judgment or order to which the claim relates.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Because father failed to preserve his claim of inadequate assistance of counsel in this case, we affirm the permanency judgments at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-6\"> Mother is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b476-7\"> This was the second time that the children had been made wards of the court.

I disagree that the direct-appeal remedy available under <em>Geist </em>is unavailable to father and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">The majority today repeats the mistakes we made in <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Geist, </em>97 Or App 10, 775 P2d 843 (1989) <em>(Geist I), aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>310 Or 176, 796 P2d 1193 (1990). I begin with a discussion of our decision in that case. In <em>Geist I, </em>the juvenile court terminated the mother\u2019s parental rights. The mother appealed to this court, asserting \u2014 for the first time on appeal \u2014 that her appointed trial counsel had been inadequate and that she had been denied due process. <em>Id. </em>at 15. At that time, the question was one of first impression. <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We concluded that we could not review the mother\u2019s claim because, although the mother was entitled to \u201ccompetent and effective counsel,\u201d the legislature had <em>\u201cnot provided a specific procedure or forum </em>for determining whether a parent has been afforded effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 17 (emphasis added). We noted that the procedure that the mother advocated \u2014 our direct review of her inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim \u2014 created some difficulties. For example, we observed that the trial record was not created for the purpose of making any determinations about the adequacy of the mother\u2019s counsel. We explained, \u201cNo facts <em>about counsel </em>were developed in the adversarial way that lies at the heart of judicial factfinding. The record does not disclose, <em>and could not be expected to disclose, </em>anything about counsel\u2019s conduct except what it shows about the issue raised in mother\u2019s defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 18 (emphasis in original). Finally, we concluded that direct appeal was <em>\u201cnot the appropriate </em>forum\u201d for the mother to assert her claim. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Indeed, we specifically noted that \u201c[t]he <em>legislature has not created a special forum, as it has in criminal law matters </em>(ORS 138.510-ORS 138.680), <em>and there is no source </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>from which we may derive the authority to create one\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Judge Rossman, in a trenchant concurrence, stated that he was \u201cat a loss\u201d with regard to the majority\u2019s rationale, because, in his view, neither due process nor a lack of a specific procedure barred our consideration of the mother\u2019s inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim. Id. at 21 (Rossman, J., concurring). Judge Rossman further noted that, despite the majority\u2019s identification of two main \u201clegitimate institutional concerns about hearing claims of ineffective counsel on direct appeal,\u201d namely lack of preservation and the potential inadequate development of the trial court record, those concerns had not arisen in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 22, 22 n 2 (Rossman, J., concurring). Judge Rossman summarized the majority\u2019s arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-5\">\u201c[A]pplying the rule that matters subject to review on direct appeal must be \u2018raised or waived\u2019 will create a host of problems. For example, trial counsel will be required to defend the termination case while simultaneously making a record regarding his adequacy, and he would invariably be required to file a notice of appeal in order to preserve any existing error. Second, [the majority] contends that reviewing adequacy of counsel on the record might be inadequate for constitutional purposes. Thus, remand would be required, causing intolerable delay in the termination process.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 22 n 2 (Rossman, J., concurring). He then rejected those arguments, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-7\">\u201c[T]he problems [the majority] points out are not totally insoluble. For one thing, raise it or waive it is not an invariable rule. Where important considerations of public policy are encountered * * *, [the court] has the duty to apply the law which is dictated by that policy. If we apply that [public policy] exception in cases involving ineffectiveness of counsel claims ***, most of the dilemmas pointed out by the majority will disappear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201cThe fact that many termination cases would require remand remains a problem. However, <em>remand would not be necessary in all cases, </em>and the state has offered a reasonably expeditious procedure for handling such cases when they arise. Given the nature of parents\u2019 right to effective counsel, and <em>until the legislature provides a better plan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>hearing such claims on direct appeal seems the only reasonable alternative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 23 n 2 (Rossman, J., concurring) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted; first emphasis added; second emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Thus, the key issues in <em>Geist </em>were the same as those presented by the majority today: preservation; expeditious resolution; concerns about the development of the record; and due process. It is also clear that, 25 years ago, we had the opportunity to rule on those issues in <em>Geist I. </em>As I explain in more detail below, the Oregon Supreme Court did not agree with our decision in <em>Geist I </em>and took an entirely different path. The Supreme Court adopted a procedure that was in harmony with Judge Rossman\u2019s approach. Because the majority\u2019s reasoning so similarly echoes our opinion in <em>Geist I, </em>which the Supreme Court later rejected, I conclude that the majority errs in its decision today.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Geist II </em>sanctioned inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal. <em>Geist II, </em>310 Or at 179. The Supreme Court began by concluding that the legislature intended a statutory right to counsel to include a right to adequate counsel, <em>id. </em>at 185, and that \u201cthe state must give [the mother] a procedure whereby she may challenge her appointed trial counsel\u2019s adequacy,\u201d <em>id. </em>The court then reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-7\">\u201c[t]he statutory right to adequate trial counsel may prove illusory if there is no procedure for review of claims of inadequate counsel. * * * Absent an express prohibition against challenges of adequacy of appointed counsel, <em>we do not interpret the legislature\u2019s omission of an express procedure as evidencing any legislative intent to preclude such challenges. Absent an express legislative procedure </em>for vindicating the statutory right to adequate counsel, this court may <em>fashion an appropriate procedure.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 185 (footnotes omitted; emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">The court also held that it was unnecessary for a parent to preserve inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims that occur at the juvenile court level, specifically recognizing that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cit is <em>unlikely that any challenge to the adequacy of appointed trial counsel will have been preserved in the circuit court. </em>It is neither realistic nor reasonable to expect that a parent\u2019s trial counsel will have objected at trial that counsel\u2019s advocacy was inadequate. Because of the important timeliness considerations discussed below, we conclude that the general rule [requiring preservation] need not be strictly applied to the issue of appointed trial counsel\u2019s adequacy in a parental rights termination proceeding.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 184 n 9 (emphasis added). The court next examined the appropriate \u201cprocedure\u201d to review such claims, requiring that inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims must be resolved \u201cas expeditiously as possible, <em>consistent with due </em>process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 186 (emphasis added). Based on those dual exigencies, the court made two important conclusions. First, the court recognized that \u201ca procedure that allows a *** parent to make a claim of inadequate counsel only after all direct statutory appeals have been exhausted would only further delay the finality of the termination decisions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 187, and thus was not an \u201cappropriate procedure,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 186. Second, the court concluded that, <em>\u201cabsent statutes providing otherwise, </em>* * <em>* </em>any challenges to the adequacy of appointed trial counsel in [termination] proceedings <em>must </em>be reviewed on direct appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 187 (emphases added). In short, the <em>Geistll </em>court concluded that an appropriate <em>procedure </em>for vindication of a parent\u2019s right to adequate counsel was expedient, comported with due process, and, therefore, must be asserted and reviewed on direct appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The court then examined the appropriate measure of adequacy for review of such claims, setting the standard of \u201cfundamental <em>fairness\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., the \u201copportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. In challenges to counsel\u2019s adequacy, the parent must prove that counsel failed to exercise professional skill and judgment, which prejudiced the parent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The court squarely addressed the potential problem of the adequacy of the record, which did not present a problem in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 192 n 16. Because the record in that case <em>was adequate for review, </em>the court determined that the mother had not sustained her burden of proving that her attorney was inadequate or that the termination proceeding was not \u201cfundamentally fair.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194. Accordingly, the court affirmed our decision, but rejected our conclusion that such a claim was not susceptible to direct appeal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">In the years since the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Geist II, </em>we have continued to apply that decision as good law, allowing parents to assert unpreserved inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal. <em>See, e.g., State ex rel SOSCF v. Thomas, </em>170 Or App 383, 394-95, 12 P3d 537 (2000); <em>State ex rel SOSCF v. Rogers, </em>162 Or App 437, 440, 986 P2d 726 (1999), <em>rev den, </em>329 Or 607 (2000); <em>State ex rel Juv.

The majority bases its decision primarily on the 2001 enactment of ORS 419B.923 and our later construction of that statute in <em>Dept. of Human Services v. A. D. G., </em>260 Or App 525, 539, 317 P3d 950 (2014), reasoning that ORS 419B.923 created an express remedy. 269 Or App at 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">However, the juvenile code has consistently contained a similar set-aside statute, and to the point at issue here, such a statute existed even before we decided <em>Geist I.

As indicated, that statute was repealed in 1993.

Reasons for modifying or setting aside an order or judgment include, but are not limited to\u201d clerical mistakes or errors, excusable neglect, or newly discovered evidence. (Emphasis added.) The only distinction between the set-aside statute that existed when <em>Geist II </em>was decided and the present statute, is that the present statute gives examples of \u201cany order\u201d that may be set aside. That is to say, the scope of a court\u2019s authority to set aside, under the present statute, is identical to the scope of authority that courts had at the time <em>Geist II </em>was decided. Thus, it is apparent, in light of the plain text of each variant of the set-aside statutes, that the juvenile court has \u2014 since before <em>Geistll </em>was decided \u2014 retained broad authority to modify or set aside any order notwithstanding the legislative changes over the years.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Nevertheless, the majority relies on <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Kopp, </em>180 Or App 566, 43 P3d 1197 (2002), and A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App 525, to determine that \u201cpost-Geisi developments have made it clear that the set-aside mechanism * * * <em>is </em>expressly available as a remedy to challenge the adequacy of appointed counsel in juvenile dependency matters,\u201d 269 Or App at 462 (emphasis in original), despite the fact that neither we nor the Oregon Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>mentioned or considered the set-aside statute in existence at the time the <em>Geist </em>cases were decided as an \u201cexpress\u201d remedy. To reach the conclusion that ORS 419B.923 is now an \u201cexpress\u201d remedy that makes the <em>Geist </em>remedy unavailable to father in this case, the majority relies on our interpretation of ORS 419B.923 as broad in <em>A. D. G. </em>269 Or App at 463. Yet, as noted, the scope of a trial court\u2019s authority has not changed since <em>Geist II </em>was decided. The court had broad authority before <em>Geist II, </em>and it retains broad authority now. However, as is implicit in the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>Geist II, </em>that authority does not constitute an \u201cexpress\u201d remedy. 310 Or at 185 (concluding that, despite the existence of a set-aside statute, no express remedy existed).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">Thus, I turn to examine A. <em>D. G. </em>In that case, we analyzed whether the juvenile court had the authority to set aside a default judgment under ORS 419B.923. 260 Or App at 534. After the Department of Human Services (DHS) petitioned to terminate the mother\u2019s parental rights, the mother missed an initial hearing on the petition, but was present at the <em>prima facie </em>hearing and attempted to participate in that hearing. <em>Id. </em>at 527-29. The mother sat in the audience portion of the courtroom while DHS presented its <em>prima facie </em>case; the mother ultimately left the courtroom. <em>Id. </em>at 530. The mother attempted to appeal that judgment, but that appeal was dismissed. <em>Id. </em>at 531. The mother then made a motion at the trial court level to set aside the \u201cdefault termination judgment\u201d under ORS 419B.923. A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App at 532. The court denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">On appeal, we examined whether the juvenile court had the authority to set aside the judgment under ORS 419B.923(1). We concluded that the plain text of that statute \u2014 specifically, the statute\u2019s use of the phrasing \u201cinclude, but are not limited to\u201d \u2014 did not limit the broad discretionary authority that the statute gave to a juvenile court to modify or set aside judgments to the three examples enumerated in the statute; that conclusion was supported by the legislative history of ORS 419B.923. A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App at 536-37. Indeed, in light of the legislative history, we concluded that, although ORS 419B.923 was \u201ca substantial reworking of both <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 (1993) *** and ORCP 71,\u201d ORS 419B.923 \u201ctracked the broad language that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>was already in <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420\u201d and did not include the \u201cclosed universe of potential grounds for relief from a judgment listed in ORCP 71 A and B.\u201d <em>A. D. G., </em>260 Or App at 538-39. Indeed, we specifically acknowledged that the text of ORS 419B.923 came from <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420. A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App at 539.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">We then analyzed whether the juvenile court had the authority to issue a default judgment under ORS 419B.819(7), when the mother was present at the hearing and attempted to participate. We concluded that the juvenile court lacked the authority to enter a default judgment and, based on that legal error, concluded that the juvenile court <em>abused its discretion </em>when it denied the mother\u2019s ORS 419B.923 motion. A. <em>D. G., </em>260 Or App at 534. Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, A. <em>D. G. </em>had no effect on the scope of ORS 419B.923. The set-aside statute was broad before <em>Geist </em>was decided and remains similarly broad today.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">In addition to A. <em>D. G., </em>the majority also relies on <em>Kopp. Kopp </em>did not involve a direct-appeal challenge to the adequacy of counsel. Instead, that case centered on whether the parent had standing to move to set aside a judgment after that parent\u2019s rights had been terminated. Thus, in <em>Kopp, </em>we examined and interpreted ORS 419B.524. We were concerned that an interpretation of ORS 419B.524 that divested the parent of standing to set aside a default termination judgment would violate the parent\u2019s due process rights. We began by examining <em>Geist II, </em>noting that, before the Supreme Court had decided the case, we had previously concluded that \u201cthe parent could not claim inadequate assistance of trial counsel on appeal, because the legislature had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>not created \u2018a special forum\u2019 for such a claim, analogous to proceedings for post-conviction relief in criminal matters.\u201d <em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 577 (discussing <em>Geist I, </em>97 Or App 10). We ultimately concluded that ORS 419B.524 must be interpreted so that it did not deprive a parent of <em>standing </em>to utilize <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 \u2014 the set-aside statute in effect at the time \u2014 to set aside or modify a default judgment terminating a parent\u2019s rights based on inadequate notice. <em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578-79. In so concluding, we noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s failure to consider <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420, in <em>Geist II, </em>was <em>attributable to the unlikelihood that an inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim would arise at the trial court </em>level:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-4\">\u201cThe <em>Geist </em>[77] court did not expressly consider the role of *** <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 in achieving an expeditious yet procedurally adequate and fair parental rights termination proceeding. In the context of the issue presented in that case, [i.e., inadequate assistance of <em>trial </em>counsel,] that is not surprising. * * * As the <em>Geist </em>[77] court itself noted, it is <em>unlikely that a challenge to the adequacy of appointed trial counsel will arise in the trial court\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">As support for our conclusion that the correct \u2014 and constitutional \u2014 interpretation of ORS 419B.524 required that that statute be interpreted to allow a parent, whose rights had been terminated, <em>standing </em>to move to modify or set aside the termination judgment under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420, we explained in that context:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-7\">\u201cNevertheless, we conclude that, consistently with the [due process] principles set out in <em>Geist [II], </em>ORS 419B.524 must be interpreted to permit a terminated parent to seek, under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420, an order modifying or setting aside the termination judgment. In particular, where a terminated parent has asserted a defect in the proceeding leading to termination, a hearing under <em>[former </em>ORS 419B.420] \u2014 in which, for example, a parent can develop a factual record relating to the asserted defect \u2014 is best suited for providing the parent with the required \u2018opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 <em>See id. </em>at 189-90 (stating that standard as the \u2018essence of fundamental fairness\u2019). A proceeding in juvenile court under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.420 is also likely to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>most expeditious mechanism for resolving any asserted challenge \u2014 including, if the court determines that modification or set-aside is warranted, the expeditious scheduling and hearing of whatever further proceedings are required. By comparison, an appeal \u2014 particularly one resulting in the reversal of the termination judgment and further proceedings below \u2014 may result in a much greater delay in final resolution of the matter. Moreover, some errors in trial court proceedings could be asserted only in a set-aside proceeding, either because they were not detected within the time limit for filing a notice of appeal or otherwise could not be raised on direct appeal from a termination judgment. It would be especially troublesome if \u2014 unlike other civil litigants \u2014 parents facing termination of their parental rights had no access to the courts for the purpose of remedying such errors [due to a lack of standing under <em>former </em>ORS 419B.524].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-6\"><em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578-79 (footnote and emphasis omitted). Although set out in the context of a case relating to standing, that language shows that we once again highlighted the dual tensions present in dependency cases that were identified in <em>Geist: </em>the need for expeditious administration of termination proceedings that also comported with the parent\u2019s due process rights. <em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578-79.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">The majority relies on that language to support the conclusion that the trial court can review inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims more expeditiously than we can on direct appeal and therefore direct appeal should no longer be available to parents. 269 Or App at 465-66. The new process created by the majority decision is more cumbersome because it requires an extra step <em>in all cases </em>before we can review a parent\u2019s inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim. That is true even if, as in this case, the record is adequate for review without further development at the trial court level. <em>See Geist II, </em>310 Or at 187 (rejecting \u201cprocedures allowing further litigation or collateral attacks\u201d as appropriate remedies because those remedies would \u201cdelay the finality of the termination order,\u201d and adopting the direct-appeal remedy at issue in this case).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">Thus, it appears that, under the majority\u2019s reasoning, the fundamental fairness determination has become <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>bound up with the preliminary determination we must make in a direct-appeal proceeding of whether the record is adequate for review. <em>See </em>269 Or App at 466 (\u201c[Allowing a challenge to the adequacy of counsel on direct appeal \u2014 as opposed to first pursuing that relief in the trial court \u2014 will likely <em>extend </em>the litigation rather than shorten it * * * because such challenges turn on factual questions [.]\u201d (Emphasis in original.)); 269 Or App at 468 (\u201cThis case illustrates the problem. Because we do not have a <em>factual record concerning counsel\u2019s reason for not attending the hearing </em>and the actions that counsel would or should have taken had he attended it, <em>we have no basis to conclude that counsel failed to \u2018exercise professional skill and judgment\u2019 on father\u2019s behalf </em>* * * and that that failure prejudiced father\u2019s case.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). The majority asserts that, in the absence of a factual record <em>specifically pertaining to trial counsel\u2019s adequacy, </em>there will never be a case in which we can review \u2014 on direct appeal \u2014 whether counsel was adequate. That assertion is wholly inaccurate. <em>See, e.g., Geistll, </em>310 Or at 176 (concluding, based on record developed at termination trial, that counsel was adequate); <em>Geist I, </em>97 Or App at 22, 23 n 2 (Rossman, J., concurring) (\u201c[T]he majority has unearthed legitimate institutional concerns about hearing claims of ineffective counsel on direct appeal. * * * However, they neither arise in mother\u2019s case nor present the parade of horrors that haunts the majority.\u201d; noting that, although the problem of adequate development of the record exists, \u201cremand would not be necessary in all cases); <em>Thomas, </em>170 Or App at 394-95 (concluding that the father\u2019s counsel was adequate after reviewing the record developed at the trial court level).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">I would come to the opposite conclusion. Here, father\u2019s attorney was inexplicably absent. We have all the facts we need to decide whether father\u2019s counsel was adequate. Moreover, given that father was present, provided information to the court that went <em>directly to the contested issues addressed at the permanency hearing, </em>and his attorney was inexplicably absent and therefore could not exercise any professional skill and judgment, the reasons behind the attorney\u2019s inexplicable absence do not have any bearing on whether father was prejudiced by his attorney\u2019s failure to appear, act, or exercise <em>any </em>judgment at the hearing. <em>See, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number><em>e.g., Geist II, </em>310 Or at 192 n 16 (concluding that a hearing to further develop the record is appropriate \u201conly when a parent raises a substantial question concerning issues other than those adjudicated at the termination proceeding\u201d (emphasis omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Experience instructs that a parent who wishes to assert an inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim against the parent\u2019s trial attorney may face practical obstacles in preserving and asserting that claim. We and the Supreme Court have acknowledged as much in <em>Geist II </em>and <em>Kopp. Geist II, </em>310 Or at 187; <em>Kopp, </em>180 Or App at 578-79. For example, when the record provides no indication of whether the parent continued to be represented by the same trial attorney (whose adequacy the parent seeks to challenge), it would be unreasonable to require that the parent assert his or her challenge at the trial level because that challenge presumably would be made <em>by the attorney whose adequacy was being challenged.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Further, the majority\u2019s decision inserts several other significant practical obstacles in a parent\u2019s path. First, the majority\u2019s decision does not address the problem of <em>who </em>will assert that claim at the trial level on the parent\u2019s behalf. <em>See, e.g., </em>269 Or App at 465-66 (\u201c[E]ven if* * * trial counsel\u2019s alleged inadequacy does not surface until appellate counsel is appointed, ORS 419B.923(7) provides for that contingency by allowing a motion to set aside <em>to be filed </em>in the juvenile court during the pendency of an appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added.)). Must the parent request that his or her attorney first be removed at trial, so that a new attorney could be appointed to assert the inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim at the trial level? What are the practical ramifications if the trial court denies the parent\u2019s motion to remove the attorney? Specifically, who will assert the inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim at the trial level on the parent\u2019s behalf? Would the parent then be required to make a <em>pro se </em>motion to the court?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Second, assuming that the parent does find a way to seek a motion to set aside the judgment based on the inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim, what is the effect of a denial of that motion? Under the majority view, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>parent\u2019s motion to set aside the judgment is denied, the parent\u2019s appeal of that denial would not be reviewed for fundamental fairness \u2014 as it would be in a direct appeal of an inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim \u2014 but instead would be reviewed under a far more deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>A. D. G., </em>260 Or App at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">A far more sensible approach would be to continue to allow inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal so that the parent has a meaningful opportunity to assert those claims. Indeed, a parent\u2019s first practical opportunity to assert an inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claim may be at the appellate level, when the parent is first appointed appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">By focusing on expediency, the majority loses sight of the need to protect the parent\u2019s due process rights. When it concludes that its newly created requirement for inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims \u201cwould eliminate the unnecessary step of a remand\u201d (if we determined that the record on appeal was inadequate for purposes of review), the majority concludes that, by requiring parents to make a preliminary ORS 419B.923 motion for all inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims in dependency cases, litigation will be shortened. 269 Or App 467. That is because we will no longer be required to determine the adequacy of the record on appeal from the parties\u2019 briefing and the record \u2014 and, if necessary, remand for a trial court hearing to develop the record in cases that we have determined that the record was inadequate. In my opinion, by its decision today, the majority \u2014 not the legislature \u2014 has entirely changed the landscape of the law, altering where the claim is initially asserted, what standards are applied to initially evaluate the claim, and the standard of review that will apply in reviewing appeals of trial court decisions of ORS 419B.923 motions based on inadequate assistance of counsel. The majority\u2019s decision to insert a new requirement\u2014 based on a faulty determination that the existence of a 2001 statute, which we interpreted as \u201cbroad\u201d some 13 years after enactment \u2014 does away with the remedy created in <em>Geistll </em>for review of inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims on direct appeal and effectively removes the carefully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>crafted standard of \u201cfundamental fairness\u201d from review of all inadequate-assistance-of-counsel claims in dependency cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Indeed, the majority states that \u201c[t]here is <em>nothing to he gained </em>\u2014 -and much to be sacrificed \u2014 by allowing claims of inadequate assistance of counsel to be made in the first instance on direct appeal when the legislature has provided, in ORS 419B.923(1), a more expeditious and efficient method to resolve them.\u201d 269 Or App at 467-68 (emphasis added). I disagree. Expediency is not the only concern; it must be balanced against the magnitude of parents\u2019 due process rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In sum, although the juvenile court\u2019s broad statutory authority to modify or set aside any order has undergone minor changes since <em>Geistll </em>was decided, there is no indication that the legislature\u2019s actions in the interim have had any effect on the <em>scope </em>of the set-aside statutes. Therefore, if, under <em>Geist II, </em>the set-aside statutes were not a barrier to the court implementing a direct-review remedy of inadequate-assistance-of-counsel challenges that did not require preservation, there is nothing about the changes in the statutes since <em>Geist II </em>was decided \u2014 including the recent construction in A. <em>D. G. </em>that ORS 419B.923 is \u201cbroad\u201d \u2014 that provides any support for the majority\u2019s conclusion that that statute precludes a parent from utilizing the remedy created in <em>Geist II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> The <em>Geist II </em>remedy was extended from claims against trial counsel in termination cases to claims against trial counsel in other dependency cases. <em>State ex rel Juv.
