J.</author>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">Husband appeals from a dissolution judgment, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s property division and its denial of his request for attorney fees. With respect to the property division, husband argues that the trial court erred by failing to give him one half of the marital asset portion of wife\u2019s retirement accounts and by assigning all of the marital debt to him. We conclude that, contrary to husband\u2019s arguments, the trial court engaged in the process contemplated by ORS 107.105(l)(f) (2008) and properly exercised its discretion in determining a just and proper division of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to the attorney fees, husband argues that the trial court erred by failing to explain its denial of his request for attorney fees. We conclude that, because husband did not request, as required by ORCP 68 (C)(4)(g), that the trial court state its findings of fact and conclusions of law on the record, the court did not err in failing to do so. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After dating intermittently for 17 years, the parties began living together in March 2006, and they married in July 2007. They separated in January 2010, and wife filed for dissolution in March 2010. At the time of the dissolution trial, the parties had been married approximately four years. Wife was 54 years old, and husband was 61. The parties have one adopted child, a son, who was age nine at the time of trial. After trial, the trial court entered a general judgment of dissolution on September 30, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">At the time of their marriage, husband was retired and receiving a monthly pension benefit from the Oregon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>Public Employee Retirement System (PERS). At the time of the dissolution trial, husband\u2019s monthly income was $6,598; he received $5,100 in PERS benefits and $1,498 in Social Security benefits based on his employment history. He also received $962 in Social Security benefits for the parties\u2019 minor son, of whom he had custody. During the marriage, husband stayed home to care for the parties\u2019 son, and wife worked as a mental-health therapist. At the time of the dissolution trial, wife\u2019s monthly income from employment was $4,301. Wife was also a member of PERS and owned three retirement accounts related to her public employment: a PERS Tier Two account, a PERS Individual Account Program (IAP), and an Oregon Savings Growth Plan (OSGP) account.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The parties\u2019 dissolution trial was conducted over two days. On the first day, the parties and the court resolved most of the disputed issues relating to the dissolution, including child custody, a division of their tangible personal property, and the value of the family home. On the second day, the parties resolved disputed issues relating to child support. The remaining issues concerned the division of the parties\u2019 remaining assets (including the family home and wife\u2019s PERS accounts) and the division of marital debt. Husband offered into evidence a proposed distribution of assets and liabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Husband requested an equal division of the marital asset portion of wife\u2019s PERS accounts. According to husband, the account balances at the time of trial were as follows: $29,386 in the Tier Two account, $27,297 in the IAP account, and $11,818 in the OSGP account, for a total of $68,501. After deducting the premarital value of the accounts and estimated future taxes, husband calculated a net marital increase in value of $23,153. Wife did not dispute those figures. Husband requested an award of half of the accounts\u2019 net marital increase: $11,576.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Husband offered evidence that the debt accumulated by the parties during the marriage \u2014 and prior to their separation \u2014 totaled $8,469. That debt, according to husband, derived from a credit card, a credit line, and a medical bill for the parties\u2019 son. Wife did not dispute either the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>or nature of the marital debt. Husband indicated that he was currently paying the debt and would continue to do so, but requested that half of the value of the debt be \u201cattributable to [wife]\u201d; that is, that wife\u2019s portion of the marital debt be \u201cadded in some manner\u201d to any award to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The trial court explained that it was not going to rely on husband\u2019s proposed division or attempt to make a mathematically equal division of the marital assets and liabilities. Rather, because of a number of considerations (including the long-term nature of the parties\u2019 relationship, husband\u2019s monthly retirement income, the award to husband of the marital residence \u2014 including its anticipated appreciation in value \u2014 free of any interest by wife, and husband\u2019s receipt of the child\u2019s Social Security benefits), the court said that an equal division of marital assets and liabilities had been \u201crebutted,\u201d and that it would attempt to make an equitable division of the assets and liabilities that permitted each of the parties to maintain a lifestyle similar to that which they had before the dissolution. Therefore, the court rejected husband\u2019s suggestion that the court equalize the property and debt division through a division of wife\u2019s retirement accounts, which the court considered to be small compared to husband\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Although husband\u2019s PERS account had been earned prior to the marriage and the court believed that it could not divide that asset or its income stream, the court nonetheless concluded that it was appropriate to consider husband\u2019s retirement income in determining an equitable distribution of the parties\u2019 assets. The court explained, \u201cI\u2019m not going to give any of [husband\u2019s retirement income] to [wife]. What I am going to do is consider it when I try to do some equitable distribution * * *.\u201d The court thus awarded 90 percent of the overall balance of wife\u2019s retirement accounts to wife and 10 percent to husband. The court did not distinguish between the premarital and marital portions of the accounts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>In addition to seeking one half of the marital portion of wife\u2019s retirement accounts, husband sought to be credited for his payment of the marital debt through some form of \u201cequalization.\u201d The trial court rejected any form of equalizing judgment, explaining that it did not want either party to owe money to the other. The judgment allocated the entirety of the parties\u2019 marital debt to husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-3\">Finally, the trial court denied both parties\u2019 requests for attorney fees without explanation. At trial, the court simply stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to award attorney\u2019s fees to either one, you can be responsible for your own fees.\u201d Likewise, in the dissolution judgment, the court ordered that \u201c[b]oth parties [be] responsible for their own attorney fees and costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">On appeal, husband raises three assignments of error. The first two assignments pertain to the trial court\u2019s division of the parties\u2019 marital property; specifically, the first assignment challenges the division of wife\u2019s retirement accounts, and the second assignment challenges the allocation of all of the marital debt to husband. With respect to the first assignment, husband cites <em>Kunze and Kunze, </em>337 Or 122, 92 P3d 100 (2004), and contends that the court erred when it (1) failed to engage in an analysis with respect to the presumption of equal contribution to the marital increase in the accounts and whether it had been rebutted, and (2) failed to order an equal division of the marital increase in the accounts in the absence of countervailing equitable considerations. With respect to the second assignment, husband argues that he was entitled to be credited in some way for half of the parties\u2019 marital debt, which he \u201cwas paying and intended to pay.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">In response to both assignments, wife contends that, in order to make an award that was just and proper, the trial court was not required first to engage in a mechanical application of the presumption of equal contribution as to each asset, followed by a consideration whether the presumption had been rebutted. This is especially so, wife contends, in light of the fact that wife never attempted to rebut the presumption of equal contribution. She further argues the trial court\u2019s division of the parties\u2019 assets and debts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>although not mathematically equal, was just and proper under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">Husband\u2019s third assignment is that the trial court erred when it denied his request for attorney fees without explanation. Specifically, he argues that this case is \u201csquarely within the purview\u201d of <em>Baker and Baker, </em>173 Or App 33, 35, 20 P3d 263 (2001), in which we held that a trial court must \u201cidentify the relevant facts and legal criteria\u201d in ruling on a request for attorney fees. Thus, husband contends that the trial court erred when it offered \u201cno explanation [for] its denial\u201d of his request. Wife responds that husband failed to preserve his appellate argument because he did not submit an ORCP 68 statement asking the court to state its findings and conclusions on the record and he did not object to the court\u2019s failure to do so. Accordingly, wife contends that husband\u2019s third assignment of error should not be reviewed by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">We first address husband\u2019s challenges to the division of the parties\u2019 assets and debts. We begin with husband\u2019s contention that the trial court erred when it awarded 90 percent of wife\u2019s retirement accounts to wife. ORS 107.105(l)(f) governs property divisions. It directs courts to make \u201cjust and proper\u201d property divisions, and it establishes a rebut-table presumption that spouses have contributed equally to property acquired during a marriage. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201c(1) Whenever the court renders a judgment of marital annulment, dissolution or separation, the court may provide in the judgment:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201c(f) For the division or other disposition between the parties of the real or personal property, or both, of either or both of the parties as may be just and proper in all the circumstances. * * * There is a rebuttable presumption that both spouses have contributed equally to the acquisition of property during the marriage, whether such property is jointly or separately held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">As noted, husband contends that the trial court\u2019s uneven division of wife\u2019s retirement accounts was not \u201cjust and proper,\u201d because (1) the court failed to determine whether wife had rebutted the presumption that he had contributed equally to the marital increase in her retirement accounts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>and (2) no equitable considerations were present that would have militated against an equal division.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">We reject husband\u2019s argument to the extent that he reads <em>Kunze </em>to require a rebuttal analysis \u2014 regardless of whether a party has challenged the presumption of equal contribution \u2014 prior to ordering an unequal division of a marital asset. We also reject husband\u2019s argument to the extent that he contends that an unequal division of a marital asset will be permitted only when one or more of the particular considerations enumerated in <em>Kunze </em>are present. As explained in the following discussion, neither rebuttal of the statutory presumption nor the presence of any particular equitable consideration is a mandatory prerequisite to an unequal property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">There are two categories of property subject to division in a dissolution action. <em>Loomis and Loomis, </em>247 Or App 127, 136, 268 P3d 700 (2011). The first category of property, known as \u201cmarital property,\u201d consists of \u201cany property that the parties possess at the time of the dissolution, regardless of when the property was first acquired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second class of property is a \u201csubset of marital property\u201d; it consists of property acquired during the marriage and is known as \u201cmarital assets.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">In <em>Kunze, </em>the Supreme Court outlined a series of inquiries that courts are to engage in when dividing property pursuant to ORS 107.105(l)(f). The first step is to determine when the parties acquired the property at issue. <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 133-34. When an asset was acquired prior to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>marriage of the parties, the court\u2019s inquiry is limited to \u201cwhat is \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances\u2019 in distributing that property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 134 (quoting ORS 107.105(l)(f)). If, however, a party establishes that an item of property was acquired during the marriage \u2014 rendering it a \u201cmarital asset\u201d \u2014 then the court applies the statutory presumption of equal contribution. <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe presumption directs the court that, unless proven otherwise, the court must find that both parties have contributed equally to the acquisition of marital assets.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When the presumption is not rebutted, the \u201cjust and proper\u201d division of marital assets, absent other considerations, is an equal division between the parties. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">A spouse seeking to rebut the presumption of equal contribution \u201chas the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the other spouse\u2019s efforts during the marriage did not contribute equally to the acquisition of the disputed marital asset.\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 134. If the presumption of equal contribution is rebutted, then \u201cthe party holding the separate asset is entitled to receive the property in the division of marital assets <em>unless other considerations make it \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances\u2019 to distribute the property </em>otherwise.\u201d <em>Loomis, </em>247 Or App at 136 (citations omitted; emphasis added).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Thus, application of the statutory presumption of equal contribution is not the final step of the analysis; a trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>court applies the presumption to \u201cformulate [] a <em>preliminary </em>division of marital assets.\u201d <em>English and English, </em>223 Or App 196, 203, 194 P3d 887 (2008) (emphasis added). After applying the presumption, the court \u201creviews the equity of the property division in view of all of the circumstances of the parties, <em>regardless of whether the statutory presumption of equal contribution has been rebutted.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). The question at that final step is \u201cwhat division of all the marital property \u2014 that is, <em>both the marital assets and any other property that the parties had brought into the marriage </em>\u2014 is \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances.\u2019\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 135 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">As the Supreme Court has explained, although the just-and-proper inquiry \u201cnecessarily includes consideration of * * * the court\u2019s determination under the presumption of equal contribution, that inquiry also takes into account the social and financial objectives of the dissolution, as well as any other considerations that bear upon the question of what division of the marital property is equitable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added); <em>see also Fay and Fay, </em>251 Or App 430, 438, 283 P3d 945 (2012) (although whether property was acquired during the marriage and the parties\u2019 relative contributions to its acquisition are \u201ctwo significant considerations in the \u2018just and proper\u2019 determination, * * * they are not the only relevant factors\u201d; \u201cother considerations may bear on what is just and proper[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The other \u201cequitable factors\u201d for consideration may include, but are not limited to, \u201cthe preservation of assets; the achievement of economic self-sufficiency for both spouses; the particular needs of the parties and their children; and *** the extent to which a party has integrated a separately acquired asset into the common financial affairs of the marital partnership through commingling.\u201d <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 136. Those factors may, under appropriate circumstances, weigh in favor of an unequal division of property, even where the presumption of equal contribution has not been rebutted. In <em>Fuernsteiner-Perin and Perin, </em>211 Or App 23, 153 P3d 151, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 33 (2007), for example, we concluded that it was just and proper to award certain real property to the wife even though the statutory presumption had not been rebutted. We reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cthat asset would probably not currently exist but for her efforts. Without the * * * property, she will have no place to live, and awarding it to her will assist her in acquiring economic self-sufficiency by allowing her to remain in Hawaii and to continue her career as an artist, her only current source of income.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><em>Fuernsteiner-Perin, </em>211 Or App at 32; <em>see also Van Horn and Van Horn, </em>185 Or App 88, 93, 57 P3d 921 (2002), <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 267 (2003) (equitable considerations may also tip the balance in the other direction; that is, they \u201cmay support an equal division of property even though the presumption of equal contribution has been overcome\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The overall statutory directive of ORS 107.105 is to \u201cfashion a \u2018just and proper\u2019 division\u201d of <em>all </em>marital property. <em>Kunze, </em>337 Or at 133. The presumption of equal contribution is a preliminary step \u2014 applied to a single item of property \u2014 that results in a preliminary division of that particular asset.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>English, </em>223 Or App at 203. When the presumption of equal contribution is not rebutted (either because no one has attempted to rebut it or an attempt has been unsuccessful), it weighs in favor of, but does not compel, an equal division of the asset.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Therefore, we reject husband\u2019s contention that, when the presumption is not rebutted, a court is precluded from making an unequal division of the marital asset in order to attain an overall division of marital property that is \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d ORS 107.105(l)(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Whether a trial court\u2019s property division is \u201cjust and proper\u201d is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Gay and Gay, </em>250 Or App 31, 36, 279 P3d 265 (2012). Thus, \u201cwe will not disturb the trial court\u2019s ruling if, given the facts found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>by the court, it chose one among a variety of legally correct outcomes.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A just and proper division of the parties\u2019 property requires consideration of all relevant equitable factors; courts are not limited to the four factors enumerated in <em>Kunze. </em>As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Kunze, </em>although the just-and-proper analysis</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-4\">\u201cnecessarily includes consideration of the statutory factors, including the court\u2019s determination under the presumption of equal contribution, that inquiry also takes into account the social and financial objectives of the dissolution, as well as any other considerations that bear upon the question of what division of the marital property is equitable. Although they will vary according to the individual circumstances of the parties, this court has identified some of the equitable considerations under ORS 107.105(l)(f) to include the preservation of assets; the achievement of economic self-sufficiency for both spouses; the particular needs of the parties and their children; and, as discussed in more detail below, the extent to which a party has integrated a separately acquired asset into the common financial affairs of the marital partnership through commingling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">337 Or at 135-36 (citations omitted; emphasis added). Thus, <em>Kunze </em>does not contain an exhaustive list of the equitable factors for consideration, and we reject husband\u2019s argument to the extent that it suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Applying the <em>Kunze </em>analytical template here, we agree with husband that wife did not rebut the presumption that he equally contributed to the marital portion of her retirement accounts; she did not attempt to rebut it. But, for the reasons explained above, the fact that wife did not rebut the presumption as to that asset did not preclude the trial court from dividing that asset unequally if that is what the trial court determined was necessary in order to make a just and proper division of the marital property. And that is exactly what the trial court did. We note that while husband is correct that his PERS account was not a marital asset\u2014 and was therefore not subject to the presumption of equal contribution \u2014 it was nonetheless \u201cmarital property\u201d subject to the dispositional power of the trial court. <em>Hanscam and Hanscam, </em>247 Or App 207, 216, 268 P3d 715 (2011) (\u201c[Assets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>acquired before marriage] are nonetheless considered marital property; as such, they are also subject to a division that is \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances.\u2019\u201d); <em>see also Loomis, </em>247 Or App at 136 (\u201c [I]f the property is not a marital asset because it was separately acquired, then the party holding the separate asset is entitled to receive the property * * * unless other considerations make it \u2018just and proper in all the circumstances\u2019 to distribute the property otherwise.\u201d (citations omitted)). Accordingly, husband\u2019s separate PERS account was an appropriate equitable consideration for the trial court in making a just and proper distribution of the marital property. <em>See Edwards and Edwards, </em>209 Or App 555, 557-58, 149 P3d 196 (2006) (assets acquired before the marriage are subject to the court\u2019s \u201cjust and proper\u201d division of marital property). Here, the court determined that it would not disturb husband\u2019s income stream from his PERS account, but it took that asset into consideration in determining that husband would be awarded only 10 percent of wife\u2019s PERS accounts. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in so concluding.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">With respect to the division of marital debts, husband contends that the trial court erred in failing to offer an explanation for why it chose to allocate all of the marital debt to husband, when wife offered no evidence to show that the debts were not reasonably incurred for family expenses. Pursuant to the trial court\u2019s authority to \u201cdetermin[e] a just and proper division of the parties\u2019 property, \u2018[it] may divide the debts that the parties incurred during their marriage.\u2019\u201d <em>Christensen and Christensen, </em>253 Or App 634, 639, 292 P3d 568 (2012) (quoting <em>Shlitter and Shlitter, </em>188 Or App 277, 283, 71 P3d 154 (2003)). Although the presumption of equal contribution applies to assets, not debts, we have held that where a debt was incurred to pay family expenses, \u201cequal division of the debt is generally appropriate.\u201d <em>Fay, </em>251 Or App at 438. Again, however, with marital debts as with marital property, \u201cthe determination of what is just and proper in all the circumstances is a matter of discretion for the trial court.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Here, the trial court determined that, because of the disparity in the parties\u2019 resources (including husband\u2019s much larger PERS pension and the fact that husband <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>had been awarded the family home free of any interest by wife), it was just and proper to assign all of the marital debt to husband. Again, as previously noted, the trial court explained that it did not intend to make a division based on an itemized list of all of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities; rather, it intended to make a property division that would disentangle the parties, that was equitable, and that allowed them to have a standard of living that approached the marital standard of living. Based on those considerations, the trial court concluded that an unequal division of the marital debts was \u201cjust and proper in all the circumstances.\u201d ORS 107.105(l)(f). We cannot conclude on this record that the trial court abused its discretion in making that division.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Finally, we consider husband\u2019s contention that the trial court erred when it refused to award him attorney fees. Wife responds that any error has not been preserved because, after the court\u2019s denial of attorney fees for both parties, husband \u201cdid not thereafter raise or revisit the issue, nor did he submit an ORCP 68 statement.\u201d We agree with wife and reject husband\u2019s third assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">On appeal, husband challenges the denial of attorney fees on the sole ground that the trial court offered no explanation for its ruling. As mentioned, at trial, the court simply stated, \u201cI\u2019m not going to award attorney\u2019s fees to either one, you can be responsible for your own fees.\u201d In the dissolution judgment, the court ordered that \u201c[b]oth parties [be] responsible for their own attorney fees and costs.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> No findings were included in the judgment. Husband argues that, under <em>McCarthy v. Oregon Freeze Dry, Inc., </em>327 Or 84, 95, 957 P2d 1200, <em>modified on recons, </em>327 Or 185, 957 P2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>1200 (1998),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and <em>Baker and </em>Baker, 173 Or App 33, 35, 20 P3d 263 (2001), the trial court abused its discretion when it failed to identify the \u201crelevant facts and legal criteria\u201d underlying its denial of fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Husband is correct that, under <em>McCarthy, </em>\u201cwhere a party challenges <em>the substance </em>of an attorney fee award, findings may be necessary for meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Reeves, </em>203 Or App 80, 91 n 4, 125 P3d 755 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 308 (2006) (emphasis added); <em>see also Baker, </em>173 Or App at 35-36 (extending the <em>McCarthy </em>rule to discretionary attorney-fee awards under ORS 107.135). Here, however, husband makes no substantive challenge to the denial of fees; rather, he argues that we should remand based solely on the absence of findings to support the ruling. As the court noted in <em>McCarthy, </em>however, \u201c[standing alone, the absence of explanatory findings to support an award or denial of attorney fees is not a ground for reversal.\u201d <em>McCarthy, </em>327 Or at 189.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On the contrary, \u201c[a] trial court is required to make findings on its attorney fee award <em>only when </em>a party makes a written request for findings in accordance with ORCP 68 C(4)(e).\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Reeves, </em>203 Or App at 91 (emphasis added). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number><em>Reeves, </em>a breach-of-contract case, we rejected the defendant\u2019s challenge to an attorney-fee award based on lack of findings where he had \u201cmade only an oral request for findings at a hearing on objections to the court\u2019s attorney fee award,\u201d and \u201cma[de] no claim that he complied with ORCP 68 C(4)(e).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Here, like the defendant in <em>Reeves, </em>husband \u201cdoes not make any argument about why the [ruling] was unreasonable; he argues only that we should reverse * * * because of the absence of findings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, husband\u2019s challenge falls outside the scope of <em>McCarthy </em>and <em>Baker, </em>and the absence of findings to support the court\u2019s denial of fees\u2014 standing alone \u2014 does not justify a reversal. Husband was obligated to make a written request for findings pursuant to ORCP 68 C(4)(g) in order to preserve this issue for our review. Because he made no such request, <em>Reeves </em>controls, and we reject husband\u2019s final assignment of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b333-7\"> The statute has been amended several times since the trial court entered the dissolution judgment in this case.

Husband asserts that the court\u2019s award of 10 percent of the value of the accounts to husband is nonetheless \u201cshort of his entitlement of $11,576 by some $6,370, after applying a 24% taxation of the court\u2019s award.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b338-7\"> Husband objected to the trial court\u2019s proposed 90/10 division of the marital-asset portion of wife\u2019s retirement account, \u201ctaking exception * * * because the presumption is of equal contribution during the marriage.\u201d The trial judge responded, \u201cI do presume there\u2019s equal contribution. It\u2019s been rebutted in my mind * * * because [of] some of the choices that [the parties] made as they went along * * When asked to elaborate on the particular factors that amounted to a rebuttal, the court cited the parties\u2019 respective incomes, their joint decision that husband would act as the primary caregiver to son, and the length of their relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">On appeal, husband argues that the trial court\u2019s rebuttal analysis was improper because it \u201chad little to do with the <em>acquisition </em>of the retirement accounts * * * as opposed to its future impact.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is clear, however, that the court did not dispute husband\u2019s equal contribution to the acquisition of the assets.

The question is not whether a 90/10 split of a marital asset \u2014 here, the marital-asset portion of wife\u2019s retirement accounts \u2014 is just and proper.
