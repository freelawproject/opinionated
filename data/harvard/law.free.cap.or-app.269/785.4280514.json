To establish a prescriptive easement, plaintiff was required to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that his use (or use by former owners of his property) of the road on defendants\u2019 property was \u201copen and notorious,\u201d \u201cadverse to the rights of defendants,\u201d and \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted\u201d for 10 years. <em>Thompson v. Scott, </em>270 Or 542, 546, 528 P2d 509 (1974); <em>accord Sander v. McKinley, </em>241 Or App 297, 306, 250 P3d 939 (2011). On appeal, defendants argue that plaintiff failed to prove that (1) use of the road was sufficiently adverse to defendants\u2019 rights to establish an easement and (2) use of the road continued for at least 10 years. We conclude that legally sufficient evidence in the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings and its determination that (1) plaintiff established adversity through direct evidence of his mistaken claim of right, which does not require that plaintiff show that his use interfered with defendants\u2019 use of their property, and (2) plaintiff established continuous and uninterrupted use for 10 years. Therefore, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because it was undisputed at trial that plaintiffs use of the road was \u201copen and notorious,\u201d the relevant facts relate to whether plaintiffs use of the road was adverse to defendants\u2019 rights and was continuous for 10 years. We initially address our standard of review of those facts. This case arises in equity, and defendants request that we take <em>de novo </em>review with respect to certain findings made by the trial court. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.40(8)(d). We decline to exercise our discretion to take <em>de novo </em>review, because the disputed findings have support in the record and this case is not an exceptional one that merits such review. Accordingly, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings of fact if supported by evidence, <em>Morton and Morton, </em>252 Or App 525, 527, 287 P3d 1227 (2012), and we state the facts accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Plaintiff is the owner of four contiguous parcels, identified as Tax Lots 3300, 3400, 3500, and 3600. He acquired <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>Tax Lot 3300 in 2006 after purchasing the other three in 1998. None of plaintiffs parcels has a house on it, although plaintiffs purchase of the first three parcels included a cabin that plaintiff improved and used. Defendants on appeal, a married couple, are the owners of a 20-acre parcel where they have lived since 1973.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">Both plaintiff and defendants get to their respective properties from Highway 62 via Busch Road and Lewis Creek Road. From Highway 62, Busch Road passes through private property, where it connects to Lewis Creek Road. Lewis Creek Road also passes through private property, reaching defendants\u2019 residence on their property, and then continues on through defendants\u2019 property, then through private property owned by Larson, then for a significant distance through federal public land, then through private property owned by Woods, then through additional federal public land, where it ends at plaintiffs parcels. Old records indicate that Lewis Creek Road has been in existence since at least 1934. The part of Lewis Creek Road that runs through defendants\u2019 property is a dirt road, approximately 18-feet wide, and passes within 60 to 80 feet of defendants\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">Lewis Creek Road provides the only vehicular access to plaintiffs parcels and was the means by which the seller showed plaintiff how to get to the three parcels that he purchased in December 1998. All the private property owners along Busch Road and Lewis Creek Road use the roads to access their properties. In addition to plaintiff, two other owners of private property beyond defendants\u2019 property\u2014 Larson and Woods \u2014 use the part of Lewis Creek Road that goes through defendants\u2019 property to get to their properties. Larson has a residence on his property, which includes a home business that requires parcel delivery companies to use the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In 2008, plaintiff sought a building permit, but the county would not issue a permit without written confirmation of plaintiffs legal access to his property. As a result, plaintiff sought to obtain written easements to confirm his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>access rights from the owners along the roads between his property and Highway 62, including defendants. In seeking an easement from defendants in June 2008, plaintiff based his request on his asserted established right to use the road. Plaintiff obtained easements from several property owners, but defendants refused his request, prompting plaintiff to seek a judicial declaration that he has a prescriptive easement over Lewis Creek Road across defendants\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">At trial, defendants did not dispute plaintiffs open and notorious use of the road. Defendants filed a trial memorandum conceding that element: \u201cDefendants concede that plaintiff has used the roadway open and notoriously. Defendants dispute that plaintiffs use has been adverse and dispute that plaintiffs use, if adverse, has been so for the requisite 10-year period.\u201d In opening statement, defendants\u2019 counsel told the trial court that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">\u201cfor Plaintiff to prevail, he has to * * * prove that he used this road open and notoriously, adverse to Defendants for a continuous period of ten years. The case is kind of lumped into those three categories. And it\u2019s presumed if he used open and notoriously then it was adverse. And so we think that he\u2019s got that presumption going in.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Plaintiff and defendant Le Roy Hippe (defendant) provided the only witness testimony. Plaintiff testified that, before seeking a written easement, he and defendants had never discussed whether he had a right to use the road. Plaintiff explained that he had always believed that he had a right to use the road based on the seller\u2019s actions, because the road was his only means of access to his property, and because two easements that came with the property mentioned Lewis Creek Road as his means of access. By the time of trial, though, plaintiff acknowledged that he had come to understand that those easements did not cover the part of the road on defendants\u2019 property. Plaintiff also noted that he had participated in maintaining Busch Road and Lewis Creek Road, along with the other property owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Defendant initially testified in plaintiffs case-in-chief. During the course of that testimony, he changed his position several times regarding what he believed concerning his and the other property owners\u2019 rights of access to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>their properties via Busch Road and Lewis Creek Road, including over the part of Lewis Creek Road that crossed defendants\u2019 property. He initially stated on direct examination that he and other landowners had a right of access to their properties over Lewis Creek Road. He stated that he had always assumed that he, and the other property owners, had a right to use the roads for access to their properties. Defendant also admitted that plaintiff was an owner of property on Lewis Creek Road and that plaintiff occupied the same position that defendants and the other property owners occupied and had the same right to use the road. On cross-examination by his counsel, defendant asserted that, if a property owner disputed his right to have access to his property over the roads, then his access was at the \u201cgoodwill and grace\u201d of the owner. However, on redirect examination, defendant acknowledged that he had learned that he does not have a written easement to use the roads that crossed the properties of other landowners and then testified that he was confused on the issue and did not know whether he had a right to use the roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">Testifying during defendants\u2019 case-in-chief, defendant confirmed that he believed that Larson had a right to use the road and did not need defendants\u2019 permission. He also testified that, in \u201cthe last few years,\u201d he had put a chain across Lewis Creek Road where it enters his property; however, he left the lock open and gave a key to plaintiff, Larson, UPS, Federal Express, and the power company.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant stated that he had never prevented plaintiff or the other landowners from crossing his property on the road and had no objections to plaintiffs use of the road. The court then sought to learn why defendant was objecting to the easement, and plaintiff established that defendants had demanded $70,000 for the easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Defendant testified on two other subjects during defendants\u2019 case-in-chief: whether plaintiffs use of the road interfered with defendants\u2019 use and whether plaintiff had sought permission from defendants to use the road. Defendant explained that plaintiffs use of the road did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>interfere with his use of his land, but his wife was always complaining that everything was dusty as a result of people driving on the unpaved road. Defendant further testified that, in 2003 or 2004, during a conversation with plaintiff by the highway, he had told plaintiff that \u201che did have my permission to go through my property. If he had any concerns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">In contrast to defendant\u2019s testimony that he gave plaintiff permission to use the road, plaintiff testified that, although he remembered generally the conversation with defendant by the highway, he did not remember defendant ever telling him that he had permission to cross defendants\u2019 land. Defendant had failed to mention that grant of permission in his deposition, and he made no claim of permission in his answer to the lawsuit. The trial court was not persuaded that the conversation about permission had actually occurred and so found. We are bound by that factual and credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">The trial court ruled that plaintiff had established a prescriptive easement in Lewis Creek Road across defendants\u2019 property as to the three parcels purchased in 1998. The court observed in its letter opinion that the parties agreed that, \u201cfor the most part,\u201d the requirements for a prescriptive easement \u2014 which it described as \u201cthe use was open or notorious, and continuous and uninterrupted and adverse to the interest of the other party for a period of at least ten years\u201d \u2014 were met. Addressing plaintiffs adverse use of the road, which the parties had disputed at trial, the court found and concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">\u201cAdverse use of a disputed roadway can be shown in two different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-7\">\u201c1) Open [use] for ten years equates to a presumption of adversity, <em>Feldman [et ux] v. Knapp [et ux], </em>196 Or 453, 250 P2d 92 (1952). This presumption can be overcome by showing the easement was over an existing way and the use did not interfere with the owner\u2019s rights, <em>McGrath v. Bradley, </em>238 Or App 269, 242 P3d 670 (2010). Such presumption can also be overcome by showing the use was \u2018permissive,\u2019 but to overcome the presumption the evidence must do more than show \u2018mere acquiescence\u2019 in the non-owner\u2019s use of the land, <em>Id. </em>&amp; <em>Feldman Supra; </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>\u201c2) Direct evidence that claimant mistakenly thought he had a right to use the property (e.g., Plaintiff always thought he had the right and so never asked for permission). <em>Kondor v. Prose, </em>50 Or App 55, 622 P2d 741 (1981).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-4\">\u201cThe Court is of the opinion that Plaintiff satisfies \u2018adversity\u2019 using both criteria. As to the three parcels acquired by Plaintiff in 1998, Tax Lot 3400, 3500 and 3600, there exists a presumption of adversity which Defendant admitted has on occasion \u2018interfered\u2019 with Defendant\u2019s right on his property. (Viewing vehicles go past his house in close proximity to the subject road.) Such interference prevents Defendant from overcoming the presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\">\u201cFurther it is clear that claimant mistakenly thought he had a right to use the subject property and therefore never asked for permission until he requested the easement herein. Since the road had been in existence for many years beyond the time Plaintiff purchased his property and because Plaintiff until the time he requested an easement, thought he had a right to use the road, adversity is satisfied here as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">The court also concluded that plaintiff had demonstrated continuous use of the road to reach the three parcels that he purchased in 1998, but that plaintiff had not proved continuous use of Lewis Creek Road to reach Tax Lot 3300 for 10 years and had no easement for that parcel.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The court entered a general judgment, declaring, in favor of plaintiff, a perpetual easement for ingress and egress to Tax Lots 3400, 3500, and 3600 over Lewis Creek Road across defendants\u2019 property. The court also entered a supplemental judgment awarding plaintiff his costs. Defendants appeal both the general and supplemental judgments, challenging the trial court\u2019s conclusion that plaintiff proved the disputed elements of a prescriptive easement in the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">A. <em>Statutory bar based on recreational use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b812-10\">Before turning to the merits of defendants\u2019 primary arguments, we first address and reject defendants\u2019 contention that a statute, ORS 105.692 (1), barred the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>of a prescriptive easement. Under ORS 105.692(1), \u201c[a]n owner of land who either directly or indirectly permits any person to use the land for recreational purposes *** does not give that person or any other person a right to continued use of the land for those purposes without the consent of the owner.\u201d Defendants assert that the statutory bar applies because plaintiff, who owned a cabin on his own land, traversed the road for recreational purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-4\">The plain text of that statute, though, as supported by its context as part of the Public Use of Lands Act, applies only when a landowner permits the general public to use the landowner\u2019s land for recreational purposes. That reading of the statute is also supported by the legislature\u2019s declared policy in enacting the Public Use of Lands Act and by the case law interpreting other provisions within the same act. <em>See </em>ORS 105.676 (\u201cThe Legislative Assembly hereby declares it is the public policy of the State of Oregon to encourage owners of land to make their land available to the public for recreational purposes * * * by limiting their liability toward persons entering thereon for such purposes and by protecting their interests in their land from the extinguishment of any such interest or the acquisition by the public of any right to use or continue the use of such land for recreational purposes ***.\u201d); <em>Liberty v. State Dept. of Transportation, </em>342 Or 11, 21-22, 148 P3d 909 (2006) (holding that the act\u2019s liability immunity does not apply to an owner who allows the public to cross its land to engage in recreational activities on another\u2019s land); <em>Conant v. Stroup, </em>183 Or App 270, 276, 51 P3d 1263 (2002), <em>rev dismissed, </em>336 Or 126 (2003) (explaining that the act was based on a model act that has uniformly been interpreted to apply \u201conly when landowners permit members of the public generally to use private property for recreational purposes\u201d). Thus, ORS 105.692(1) is inapplicable to the facts presented here \u2014 plaintiffs use of a road that runs through defendants\u2019 property so that plaintiff may get to and use his own property for recreational purposes \u2014 and does not bar the establishment of a prescriptive easement in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">B. <em>Proof of adverse use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">We turn to defendants\u2019 remaining and primary arguments, which concern whether plaintiff properly established <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the elements of a prescriptive easement. Defendants assert as their first assignment of error that the trial court \u201cerred in granting the plaintiff a prescriptive easement over the defendants\u2019 property, and in ruling that the plaintiffs use of the roadway had been adverse to the defendants, and that such adverse use had been continuous for ten years.\u201d Thus, as noted, defendants assert that plaintiff failed to establish two of the elements required for a prescriptive easement: (1) the adversity of plaintiff\u2019s use of Lewis Creek Road across their property and (2) the length of any adverse use. To establish those elements by clear and convincing evidence, plaintiff was required to show that the truth of the facts asserted was \u201chighly probable.\u201d <em>Sander, </em>241 Or App at 306.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">1. <em>Restatement (First) of Property \u00a7 458</em></p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">This case in large part concerns the appropriate method of proving adverse use for purposes of establishing a prescriptive easement. For its understanding of the adverse use element, the Oregon Supreme Court has repeatedly relied on section 458 of the <em>Restatement (First) of Property </em>(1944). For example, in <em>Thompson, </em>the court stated that \u201c[a]dverse use is defined as follows\u201d in section 458 of the Restatement, and then quoted that section with approval. 270 Or at 548 n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\"><em>Thompson </em>was not the first case in which the Supreme Court relied on the Restatement formulation of adverse use. In <em>Feldman et ex. v. Knapp et ux., </em>196 Or 453, 474, 250 P2d 92 (1952), the court relied on the Restatement in a passage addressing the use of property under a claim of right. Other Supreme Court cases relying on section 458 of the Restatement are <em>Thompson v. Schuh, </em>286 Or 201, 211, 593 P2d 1138 (1979); <em>Hamann v. Brimm, </em>272 Or 526, 529, 537 P2d 1149 (1975); <em>Arrien v. Levanger, </em>263 Or 363, 371, 502 P2d 573 (1972); and <em>Hay v. Stevens, </em>262 Or 193, 196, 497 P2d 362 (1972). The Supreme Court has never disavowed the definition of adverse use in section 458 or the idea that Oregon courts should look to section 458 for their understanding of adverse use for purposes of a prescriptive easement. Indeed, as defendants recognize, in <em>Arrien, </em>the Supreme Court acknowledged the requirement in the Restatement that a claimant seeking a prescriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>easement must show that the claimant\u2019s use is \u201cnot made in subordination to those against whom it is claimed to be adverse,\u201d 263 Or at 371 (internal quotation marks omitted); the court concluded in that case that, because there was no evidence that the claimant had used the servient owner\u2019s land in subordination to the servient owner, the trial court \u201cerred in finding that [the claimant\u2019s] use was not adverse,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 371-72. We thus disagree with the dissent\u2019s view that the Supreme Court has merely \u201cmade references\u201d to \u201cgeneral concepts\u201d in the Restatement that are of little import to the analysis in this case. 269 Or App at 830 (DeVore, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\">Accordingly, to set the context, we first discuss at length the Restatement\u2019s formulation of adverse use.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Restatement formulates the test for adverse use as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-5\">\u201cA use of land is adverse to the owner of an interest in land which is or may become possessory when it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-6\">\u201c(a) not made in subordination to him, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-7\">\u201c(b) wrongful, or may be made by him wrongful, as to him, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-8\">\u201c(c) open and notorious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b815-9\"><em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">The Restatement explains that the key concept with respect to sub-element (a) \u2014 use not in subordination\u2014 is non-recognition of the authority of the owner to prevent the plaintiffs use:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b815-11\">\u201cTo be adverse it is not essential that a use be hostile. It is not necessary that it be made either in the belief or under a claim that it is legally justified. It is, however, necessary that the one making it shall not recognize in those as against whom it is claimed to be adverse an authority either to prevent or to permit its continuance. <em>It is the non-recognition of such authority at the time a use is made </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number><em>which determines whether it is adverse. </em>* * * A use of land is adverse when made as of right even though no right exists. * * * A use which is not made in recognition of and in submission to a present authority to prevent it or to permit its continuance is adverse though made in recognition of the wrongfulness of the use and, also, of the legal authority of another to prevent it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-5\"><em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458 comment c (emphasis added). The Restatement also provides further guidance on what is meant by a \u201cclaim of right\u201d as referred to in comment c:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-6\">\u201cAs indicated in Comment c, it is not necessary in order that a use be adverse that it be made either in the belief or under a claim that it is legally justified. The essential quality is that it be not made in subordination to those against whom it is claimed to be adverse. Yet he who claims a right in himself is impliedly asserting an absence of any right in another inconsistent with the right claimed. Hence one who uses under a claim of right himself is denying a use by the permission of another. <em>Quite commonly, therefore, the absence of submission to another is evidenced by the fact that the one making the use did so under an affirmative claim of right in himself.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b816-7\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 458 comment d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">With respect to sub-element (b) of the Restatement formulation of adverse use \u2014 uses that are \u201cwrongful\u201d or \u201cmay be made [by the owner] wrongful\u201d \u2014 the key idea is whether the landowner against whom the adverse use is claimed could \u201cprotect himself by vindicating his rights through legal proceedings.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458 comment f. Thus, for example, a neighbor could build a structure on the neighbor\u2019s property that receives support from an adjoining owner\u2019s land, but the use is not wrongful and so cannot be adverse to the adjoining owner. <em>Id. </em>at 458 comment e. The parties do not discuss this sub-element, but it is apparent from the nature of the use of the road over defendants\u2019 land that this sub-element was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">Finally, with respect to sub-element (c) of the Restatement formulation \u2014 \u201copen and notorious\u201d use \u2014 the Restatement explains that the clause is to protect those owners against whom the adverse use is claimed. <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458 comment h. The requirement of open and notorious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>use \u201cenables them to protect themselves against the effect of the use by preventing its continuance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That sub-element of adversity is satisfied by the owner\u2019s actual knowledge of the use being made or, in the absence of actual knowledge, when the owner has \u201ca reasonable opportunity to learn of its existence and its nature.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458 comment i. As stated earlier, defendants do not dispute that plaintiffs use of Lewis Creek Road over their property was open and notorious.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\">2. <em>The challenged determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">It follows that the only sub-element of adverse use actually in contention in the trial court was whether plaintiffs use of Lewis Creek Road was not made in subordination to defendants. On appeal, the parties dispute the permissible methods of proving that sub-element. As we explain below, the Restatement formulation of adverse use, and particularly of the sub-element pertaining to lack of subordination, is key to an understanding of <em>Kondor v. Prose, </em>50 Or App 55, 622 P2d 741 (1981), and another of our more recent cases regarding proof of adverse use. It is also key to our conclusion in this case that the trial court\u2019s ruling was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">In light of what was actually in dispute, the trial court determined that plaintiff could establish that his use of the road was adverse to the rights of defendants in two ways: (1) through the use of a rebuttable presumption that the use was adverse, which arises through open and continuous use for the prescribed period, citing <em>Feldman, </em>196 Or at 471, or (2) through direct evidence of the nonsubordinate use, that is, that plaintiff used the road under a claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>right, citing <em>Kondor, </em>50 Or App at 60. The court then concluded that plaintiff had established adversity in both ways. Plaintiff defends that view of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">Defendants agree that the trial court correctly stated that a plaintiff may rely on a rebuttable presumption of adverse use that arises from proof of 10 years of open and continuous use of the defendant\u2019s property. <em>McGrath v. Bradley, </em>238 Or App 269, 274, 242 P3d 670 (2010). Defendants argue, however, that the trial court erred because it was bound to consider <em>only </em>that method of proof because the case concerned a jointly used road and that the evidence at trial established that they had rebutted the presumption. We reject the first premise of defendants\u2019 argument, and, because of that and because the trial court correctly determined that plaintiff had established adverse use given his evidence that his use of the servient property was not in subordination to defendants, we need not \u2014 and the dissent should not \u2014 reach defendants\u2019 argument that they rebutted the presumption that, according to defendants, applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">3. <em>Proof by direct evidence and by presumptions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">First, defendants cite no case holding that a plaintiff seeking to establish a prescriptive easement over a jointly used road can prove adverse use of the road <em>solely </em>through the rebuttable presumption of adverse use that arises upon proof of 10 years of open and continuous use. We, too, have found no case in which an Oregon court has held that a plaintiffs proof of adverse use to establish a prescriptive easement is so limited.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Instead, based on our review of the case law on prescriptive easements in Oregon, we conclude that the trial court correctly determined that a plaintiff may also establish a prescriptive easement by proving the disputed sub-element of adverse use \u2014 use not in subordination to the servient owner \u2014 through direct evidence of a claim of right, in accordance with <em>Kondor. </em>The discussion of adverse use in <em>Kondor </em>adheres closely to the description of adverse use in section 458 of the Restatement.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>Our case in <em>Kondor, </em>although not directly citing to the Restatement discussion of adverse use, adhered to the Restatement as it had been expressed in earlier Oregon Supreme Court cases. In <em>Kondor, </em>we affirmed a judgment declaring a prescriptive easement in the plaintiffs over a road that ran through the defendants\u2019 property and provided the only access to the plaintiffs\u2019 property. We explained that adverse use means \u201cthat the use is not in subordination to [the rights of the property owner]. Therefore, even if the user mistakenly believes he has the right to use the easement, that use is sufficiently adverse.\u201d 50 Or App at 60 (citing <em>Arrien, </em>263 Or at 371, and <em>City of Ashland v. Hardesty, </em>23 Or App 523, 527-28, 543 P2d 41 (1975)). We then stated that open and continuous use for 10 years creates a presumption that the plaintiff is using the road by a claim of right that is adverse to the rights of the property owner, which can be rebutted with evidence of permission. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Trewin v. Hunter, </em>271 Or 245, 246-47, 531 P2d 899 (1975), and <em>Feldman, </em>196 Or at 471-73). That discussion tracks the Restatement formulation of adverse use because it emphasizes sub-element (a) \u2014 use that is not in subordination to the servient owner \u2014 including an adverse user\u2019s mistaken \u201cclaim of right.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-4\">Defendants attempt to distinguish that discussion by reading <em>Kondor </em>narrowly. Defendants contend that the statement in <em>Kondor </em>that, \u201ceven if the user mistakenly believes he has the right to use the easement, that use is sufficiently adverse,\u201d 50 Or App at 60, simply means that \u201cmistakenly believing you have the right to use a roadway does not defeat the initial presumption of adversity created by ten years of open and notorious use.\u201d Thus, in defendants\u2019 view, the trial court misread <em>Kondor </em>when the court stated that plaintiff could demonstrate \u201cadversity\u201d \u2014 in this case, referring to the sub-element of nonsubordination \u2014 through \u201c[d]irect evidence that claimant mistakenly thought he had a right to use the property,\u201d such as by showing that plaintiff \u201calways thought he had the right and so never asked for permission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">We do not read <em>Kondor </em>as narrowly as defendants and the dissent do, for two reasons. First, defendants and the dissent overlook <em>Kondor\u2019s </em>reference to the sub-element of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>nonsubordinate use. That reference unmistakably points to the Restatement formulation of adverse use and the recognition that using a road based on a \u201cclaim of right\u201d is in effect the same as using the road not in subordination to the property owners\u2019 rights, as required by sub-element (a) in section 458 of the Restatement. The gravamen of the sub-element is use \u201cnot made in subordination to those against whom it is claimed to be adverse.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>at \u00a7 458 comment d. Either a belief in a legal right or a claimed legal right to use the servient property is inconsistent with use by permission of the servient owner, thus establishing use that is not in subordination to the servient owner. Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">Second, defendants argue that the trial court\u2019s reading of <em>Kondor </em>was incorrect because the nonsubordination sub-element of adverse use cannot be proved through direct evidence, such as plaintiffs testimony here that he used the road for 10 years believing that he had the right to do so. That is also a focus of the dissenting opinion. <em>See </em>269 Or App at 830-33. (DeVore, J., dissenting.) However, in <em>Sander, </em>we have more recently addressed and explicitly stated that the nonsubordination sub-element of adverse use is susceptible to proof through direct evidence of a claim of right, as suggested by <em>Kondor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">In <em>Sander, </em>which also involved the plaintiffs\u2019 use of a road across the defendants\u2019 land for access to their property, 241 Or App at 299, we explained that a claimant can \u201cdirectly\u201d show \u201cthat the claimant\u2019s use was not in subordination to the rights of the property owner,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 306. Such direct evidence can be based on the claimant\u2019s \u201cmistaken belief that he or she has the right to use the servient property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 306-07.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">The dissent deals with <em>Sander </em>by rejecting it in its entirety. 269 Or App at 833-39 (DeVore, J., dissenting.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>However, we rely on <em>Sander </em>for the narrow issue of permissible proof on the sub-element of nonsubordination at stake in this case. Whatever disagreements the dissent may have with other aspects of <em>Sander </em>should be raised in an appropriate case on another day. As to the narrow issue we decide, the dissent may be contending that there is necessarily mischief to be made by permitting a claimant to testify that the use was not in subordination to the servient landowner because he or she used the servient property without permission of the landowner, believing in a right to use the property. We disagree. Witnesses testify concerning their subjective beliefs and knowledge in all manner of cases; we also routinely call on factfinders to assess the credibility of such testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-4\">Defendants\u2019 argument about <em>Kondor </em>is limited, and the rest of their argument focuses on the facts that they established consonant with rebutting the presumption of adverse use. Although neither we nor the Oregon Supreme Court have held that a plaintiff must establish adverse use only by relying on the presumption of adverse use that arises from open and notorious use of the defendant\u2019s property for 10 years, defendants assume that that is so. Defendants rely on two Supreme Court cases, <em>Woods v. Hart, </em>254 Or 434, 458 P2d 945 (1969), and <em>Trewin, </em>and four of our cases: <em>Read v. Dockey, </em>92 Or App 298, 758 P2d 399 (1988); <em>Hayward v. Ellsworth, </em>140 Or App 492, 915 P2d 483 (1996); <em>R &amp; C Ranch, LLC v. Kunde, </em>177 Or App 304, 33 P3d 1011 (2001), <em>modified on recons, </em>180 Or App 314, 44 P3d 607 (2002); and <em>Webb v. Clodfelter, </em>205 Or App 20, 132 P3d 50 (2006). Citing <em>Webb </em>and <em>R &amp; C Ranch, </em>defendants note that a servient owner may rebut the presumption of adverse use by proof that the claimant\u2019s use of a preexisting road did not interfere with the servient owner\u2019s use. Defendants also contend that the facts in this case are indistinguishable from the facts in <em>Woods </em>and <em>Trewin. </em>Specifically, they argue that, as in <em>Woods </em>and <em>Trewin, </em>the following facts were sufficient to rebut the presumption of adverse use: the road was in existence before either of the parties acquired their properties, plaintiff used the road through defendants\u2019 property with defendants\u2019 knowledge, and plaintiffs use did not interfere with defendants\u2019 use. Similarly, defendants argue that the facts in <em>Read </em>and <em>Hayward </em>are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>similar to those in this case and that the claimants in those cases failed to prove adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">The dissent defends defendants\u2019 assumption, offering a rationale for why a plaintiff must establish the element of adverse use solely by relying on the presumption of adverse use that arises from open and notorious use of the defendants\u2019 property for 10 years. Yet, as noted, defendants\u2019 argument about appropriate methods of proof is limited to its argument that the trial court misread <em>Kondor, </em>an argument that we have rejected. The focus of defendants\u2019 appeal concerns whether the record reflects that they rebutted the presumption of adverse use in accordance with the means of rebuttal described in <em>Woods </em>and <em>Trewin. </em>Thus, the dissent would reverse the trial court\u2019s ruling based on an argument that defendants are not actually making. That is a departure from our typical approach to decisions. <em>See Beall Transport Equipment Co. v. Southern Pacific, </em>186 Or App 696, 700 n 2, 64 P3d 1193, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>187 Or App 472, 68 P3d 259 (2003) (it is not our \u201cproper function to make or develop a party\u2019s argument when that party has not endeavored to do so itself\u2019). Accordingly, we do not reach the balance of the argument that defendants make concerning the proof at trial as to adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">In sum, defendants\u2019 assertion that proof that a claimant used a roadway under the belief that he or she had the right to use it can never establish the sub-element of nonsubordinate use flies in the face of Oregon\u2019s application of the Restatement formulation of adverse use in section 458. Accordingly, we apply <em>Kondor </em>and <em>Sander </em>and turn to the sufficiency of the evidence, which defendants also challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">4. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">The trial court determined that plaintiff had established through clear and convincing evidence that he had used the road by claim of right and had not asked for, nor been given, permission from defendants to use the road on their property during the 10-year prescriptive period. We conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Plaintiff testified that (1) he believed that he had a right to use the road based on the seller showing him the road as the means to gain access to the property, the road\u2019s existence and course through defendants\u2019 property and beyond for a significant distance until its end at his property, and his mistaken belief that certain easements over portions of the road also covered defendants\u2019 property; (2) he had regularly used the road since he acquired the parcels in 1998; and (3) he had never asked for nor was given permission to use the road on defendants\u2019 property. Defendant testified that he, and the other property owners, had a right to use the road for access and that Larson did not need his permission, although Larson also did not have an easement. Although defendant also testified that, if you do not have a written easement you go at the \u201cgoodwill and grace\u201d of the owner, defendants behaved as if they believed that plaintiff, along with Larson and Woods, had a right to use the road through defendants\u2019 property, and the trial court found that permission was not actually given.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-4\">Thus, the trial court heard evidence from defendant and plaintiff concerning whether plaintiff\u2019s use was in subordination to defendants. And, for a number of good reasons, including the fact that defendant\u2019s trial testimony presented a new factual and legal twist that had never come up in defendants\u2019 pleadings or defendant\u2019s deposition, the trial court found defendant\u2019s testimony concerning permission to be lacking in credibility and accepted plaintiffs testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">The trial court did not commit legal error by considering direct evidence that plaintiff had not used the road in subordination to defendants, and we are hound by the trial court\u2019s express and implied findings concerning the factual dispute over whether plaintiff used the road by permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-6\">C. <em>Proof of 10 years of adverse use</em></p>\n<p id=\"b823-7\">We also reject defendants\u2019 contention that, contrary to the trial court\u2019s finding, plaintiff did not establish 10 years of adverse use because he acted in subordination to defendants when he asked defendants to sign a written easement at a time when he had owned three of his parcels for slightly less than 10 years. Plaintiff, though, asked for a written easement from defendants (and the other property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>owners along the roads) only to confirm his claimed rights in writing, as required by the county. Plaintiffs request did not end his claimed adverse use of the road; he continued to assert that he already had an established, legal right to use the road. <em>See Arrien, </em>263 Or at 372 (\u201cA willingness to purchase land from the servient owner does not, in itself, negate an adverse use.\u201d). There was no evidence that, following his request, plaintiff made his use subservient to defendants\u2019 rights. Accordingly, the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding of 10 years of adverse use of the road by plaintiff. Because all of the elements for a prescriptive easement were satisfied, we affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b808-7\"> The third defendant was also an owner of the property, but he died after plaintiff filed his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b810-6\"> Defendant also testified that he had a key for Woods but had not yet had the opportunity to give it to him.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\"> Section 457 of the Restatement sets forth the elements for creation of an easement by prescription, namely, use that is \u201cadverse\u201d and \u201cfor the period of prescription, continuous and uninterrupted.\u201d As stated by the Oregon Supreme Court in <em>Thompson, </em>270 Or at 546, an additional element of proof \u2014 use that is \u201copen and notorious\u201d \u2014 is required in Oregon. The Restatement formulation also requires proof of \u201copen and notorious\u201d use, but as a sub-element of \u201cadverse\u201d use instead.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b817-7\"> The dissent\u2019s argument that our holding effectively drops the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element from the proof required for a prescriptive easement, see 269 Or App at 838 (DeVore, J., dissenting), is incorrect. First, the dissent fails to fully acknowledge that defendants conceded the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element and that the trial judge proceeded accordingly. 269 Or App at 824 (DeVore, J., dissenting). Use not in subordination to the servient owner is a distinct and separate element from open and notorious use of the road; however, the dissent appears to conflate the two. Second, the dissent\u2019s argument depends on an inference that the trial court assumed that plaintiff had proved open and notorious use from his proof of use not in subordination to defendants. That inference is not supported by the record because defendants conceded at the outset of trial that plaintiffs use of the road was open and notorious.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b818-8\"> Neither has the dissent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b820-7\"> We disagree with the dissent\u2019s characterization of the analysis in <em>Kondor, </em>which is that it was divorced from the principles in the Restatement formulation of adverse use and simply \u201cproceeded on the familiar principle that continuous, open, and notorious use of a road would be <em>presumed </em>to be adverse \u2014 that is, to be without the defendants\u2019 permission.\u201d 269 Or App at 833 (DeVore, J., dissenting) (emphasis in orginal).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b824-5\">L AGE SEN, <em>J.,</em></author>\n<p id=\"AVX\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">I join fully in the majority opinion with the understanding that its discussion of the content of the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement, <em>see </em>269 Or App at 796-97, is <em>dictum. </em>I write separately for two reasons: (1) to elaborate on why the notice concerns raised by the dissent do not provide a basis for reversing the trial court\u2019s judgment under the circumstances present in this case; and (2) to highlight the fact that, in general, we no longer review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s determination as to the existence of a prescriptive easement, and to emphasize the significance of the applicable standard of review to my determination that the trial court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-9\">A. <em>My understanding of the Oregon law of prescriptive easements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b824-10\">Under Oregon law of prescriptive easements, a plaintiff seeking to establish a prescriptive easement generally must prove that the use for which the plaintiff seeks the easement had three characteristics: (1) the use must have been \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted\u201d for the prescriptive period; (2) the use must have been \u201cadverse to the rights\u201d of the defendant; and (3) the use must have been \u201copen and notorious.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Scott, </em>270 Or 542, 546, 528 P2d 509 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-11\">The meaning of the element of \u201ccontinuous and uninterrupted\u201d is not in dispute in this case, and I therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>do not discuss it further. With respect to the \u201cadverse\u201d element, a plaintiffs use of land is \u201cadverse to the rights\u201d of a defendant landowner if the use is under claim of right rather than by permission of the landowner. <em>See generally Feldman et ux. v. Knapp et ux., </em>196 Or 453, 467, 250 P2d 92 (1952); <em>see also Parrott v. Stewart, </em>65 Or 254, 260-61, 132 P 523 (1913) (explaining that a use of land is adverse to the rights of the owner if the use is by claim of right rather than permission); <em>Kondor v.

A servient landowner may then introduce evidence to rebut that presumption. <em>Woods v. Hart, </em>254 Or 434, 437, 458 P2d 945 (1969). What a landowner must show to rebut the presumption depends on the nature of the particular use. In all circumstances, a landowner may rebut the presumption by affirmatively proving that the use was, in fact, permissive. <em>See McGrath v. Bradley, </em>238 Or App 269, 274, 242 P3d 670 (2010);<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Wiser v. Elliott, </em>228 Or App 489, 501-02, 209 P3d 337 (2009). However, in some circumstances, a landowner may rebut the presumption by presenting evidence that does not affirmatively prove that the use was permissive, thereby shifting the burden of proving actual adverse use back to the plaintiff. <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 437 (observing that, \u201c[e]ven if the rebutted presumption is regarded as having some evidentiary value, it alone cannot preponderate in favor of plaintiff\u2019); <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number><em>also McGrath, </em>238 Or App at 274 n 5; <em>cf. Sander v. McKinley, </em>241 Or App 297, 306-07, 250 P3d 939 (2011) (if presumption of adverseness is not available to plaintiff, to obtain prescriptive easement, plaintiff must directly prove that use was adverse); <em>Nice v. Priday, </em>137 Or App 620, 625, 905 P2d 252 (1995), <em>rev den, </em>322 Or 644 (1996) (plaintiffs failed to prove that use was adverse where defendants rebutted presumption of adverse use and plaintiffs adduced no other evidence of adverse use); J. E. Macy, Annotation, <em>Easement by prescription: presumption and burden of proof as to adverse character of use, </em>170 ALR 776, 790-91 (1947)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. For example, where a plaintiff seeks a prescriptive easement over a roadway, a landowner rebuts the presumption that the use is adverse by demonstrating that the roadway was either constructed by the landowner or is of unknown origin, and that the plaintiffs use of the road did not interfere with the landowner\u2019s use of the roadway. <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 437; <em>Trewin v. Hunter, </em>271 Or 245, 247-48, 531 P2d 899 (1975); <em>McGrath, </em>238 Or App at 274 n 5; <em>Chambers v. Disney, </em>65 Or App 684, 689-90, 672 P2d 711 (1983). Proof of those circumstances rebuts the presumption that a use is adverse because those circumstances are more indicative of \u201ca friendly arrangement between neighbors\u201d than they are of a use under claim of right. <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 436-37. However, such proof does not necessarily result in a <em>de facto </em>showing of permissiveness or preclude a finding of adversity. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">With respect to the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element, a plaintiffs use of land is \u201copen and notorious\u201d if it is \u201csuch <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>that the landowner has a reasonable opportunity to learn of its existence and nature.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Schuh, </em>286 Or 201, 211, 593 P2d 1138 (1979). In particular, the landowner must have had a reasonable opportunity to learn of the <em>adverse character </em>of the use, that is, \u201cthat [the plaintiff] claimed a prescriptive right\u201d to the use. <em>Winters v.

However, in some circumstances a greater showing is required. <em>Restatement (First) of Property </em>\u00a7 458 comments h - k (1944) (describing how different circumstances affect what a plaintiff must prove to establish the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement); <em>see also Thompson, </em>270 Or at 548-49 (when use begins as permissive, prescriptive-easement claimant must show that landowner knew that claimant had repudiated permission in order to establish that use was \u201copen and notorious\u201d);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Hamann v.

In particular, as comment j to section 458 of the <em>Restatement (First) of Property </em>makes clear, in some circumstances, to establish that a use was \u201copen and notorious,\u201d a plaintiff must prove that the defendant knew of the adverse character of the plaintiffs use.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Although we have not explicitly addressed the issue (and, as explained further below, this case does not present the opportunity to do so), <em>Woods </em>suggests that one situation in which a plaintiff must prove that a landowner had actual knowledge of the adverse character of the use in order to prove the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement is where the use is over an existing roadway in a manner that does not interfere with the landowner\u2019s use of the road or damage the road. That is because, as <em>Woods </em>recognizes, under such circumstances a landowner reasonably would assume that the landowner was being \u201cneighborly\u201d in permitting the use, not that the neighbor was using the road under claim of right; in other words, the fact of the use alone \u2014 and knowledge of that fact \u2014 would not, under such circumstances, put a landowner on notice that the character of the use was adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">B. <em>Application to this case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">Applying the above standards to the present case, I would conclude that the trial court erred when it concluded that defendants had not rebutted the presumption of adverseness, because it applied the wrong legal standard in making that determination. In particular, the trial court applied the wrong legal standard when it found that plaintiff\u2019s use of the road \u201cinterfered\u201d with defendants\u2019 property because defendants had to view vehicles traveling by their house on the road. As a matter of law, that sort of \u201cinterference\u201d has no bearing on whether defendants rebutted the presumption of adverse use. Rather, to rebut the presumption in the context of an existing roadway of unknown origin, a landowner need only establish that the plaintiffs use of the road did not interfere with the landowner\u2019s <em>use of the road </em>(or damage the road). <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 437-38. Because we are not reviewing <em>de novo, </em>that legal error by the trial court ordinarily would require a remand to make the required factual findings (that is, the findings as to whether defendants proved that plaintiffs use of the road did not interfere with defendants\u2019 use of the road, and did not damage the road, thereby rebutting the presumption of adverse use) under the correct legal standard. Nevertheless, a remand is not required here because the trial court correctly concluded \u2014 based on the evidence presented and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>defendants\u2019 concession in court \u2014 that plaintiff established the elements of a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-4\">First, defendants conceded in their trial memorandum before trial that the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement was met in this case: \u201cDefendants concede that plaintiff has used the roadway open and notoriously. Defendants dispute that plaintiffs use has been adverse and dispute that plaintiffs use, if adverse, has been so for the requisite 10-year period.\u201d The trial court\u2014 appropriately so \u2014 relied on that concession in determining that plaintiff had established the elements of a prescriptive easement. Second, for the reasons stated in the majority opinion, the evidence in the record is sufficient to support the trial court\u2019s factual findings that the other two elements for a prescriptive easement are satisfied: (1) that plaintiffs use was adverse to defendants\u2019 rights (that is, under claim of right rather than by permission); and (2) that the adverse use was continuous for long enough to give rise to a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">The question of adverseness is a close one for me, albeit not for the same reasons that it is a close question for the dissent. In some of our previous cases we have concluded on similar evidence that prescriptive-easement claimants have not demonstrated that a use was adverse; we have even found that such evidence demonstrated affirmatively that a use was permissive. <em>See Nice, </em>137 Or App at 624-25 (on <em>de novo </em>review, finding that defendants rebutted presumption of adverse use and plaintiffs failed to prove adverse use where claimed easement was based on use of road in common with others and where defendants had put gate up on road but gave plaintiffs a key); <em>see also Bridston v. Panther Crushing Co., Inc., </em>206 Or App 178, 184-85, 136 P3d 84 (2006). In particular, in <em>Bridston </em>we found \u2014 again on <em>de novo </em>review \u2014 that a party\u2019s use of a road was permissive on facts similar to those present here: (1) the landowner had put up a gate across the road and given the user a key; (2) where the party used the road in common with others; and (3) where the party had assisted in the maintenance of the road. <em>Id. </em>However, in those cases we reviewed <em>de novo </em>and were ourselves acting as factfinders, charged with weighing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>the evidence and determining for ourselves whether we were convinced by the evidence that the use was under a claim of right, rather than permissive. Now, however, we review <em>de novo </em>a trial court\u2019s determination that a party has proved a claim for a prescriptive easement only in exceptional circumstances, ORS 19.415(3)(b) and ORAP 5.40(8)(c), and we have not elected to conduct <em>de novo </em>review in this case. As a result, we are bound by the trial court\u2019s factual finding that plaintiffs use of the road was under a claim of right, rather than by permission, if there is any evidence to support that factual finding. 269 Or App at 787. There is such evidence here. That evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the trial court\u2019s determination, shows that plaintiff used the road under the belief that he had the right to use the road, that plaintiff did not ask for permission to use the road and defendants did not give permission to use the road, and that defendants themselves, like plaintiff, believed that they had the right to use the road over other neighbors\u2019 properties. From that evidence, the trial court reasonably could infer that plaintiffs use of the road was under claim of right and not by virtue of defendants\u2019 permission.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">The dissent contends that the evidence is insufficient to support a factual finding that plaintiffs use of the roadway was adverse because, in the dissent\u2019s view, the evidence is insufficient to support a factual finding that defendants were on notice of the adverse character of plaintiffs use. 269 Or App at 823-43 (DeVore, J., dissenting). From that, the dissent reasons that the majority has adopted a \u201csubjective theory of adverseness\u201d that will result in the granting of prescriptive easements in circumstances in which the servient landowner was not given fair warning that a use of a road might ripen into a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">I tend to agree with the dissent that the evidence would not support a factual finding that defendants were on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>notice of the adverse character of plaintiffs use of the road. However, that does not suggest that the majority\u2019s formulation of the \u201cadverse\u201d element of a prescriptive easement is wrong. Whether defendants were on notice of the adverse character of plaintiffs use of the road does not bear on whether that use was by claim of right. Instead, the absence of notice bears on whether the use was \u201copen and notorious,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and, to obtain a prescriptive easement, a plaintiff will have to show that the owner of the servient estate had whatever notice of the adverse character of the plaintiffs use was required under the circumstances of the case. <em>See Winters, </em>154 Or App at 558-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\">As I noted above, <em>Woods </em>suggests that under the circumstances present here, a prescriptive-easement plaintiff may need to prove that the servient landowner had actual knowledge of the adverse character of the plaintiffs use in order to prove that the use was \u201copen and notorious.\u201d However, in the light of defendants\u2019 express written concession in the trial court that plaintiffs use of the land met the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement (a concession that, in my view, relieved plaintiff of the obligation to further develop the evidence on that element), this case does not present the opportunity for us to address the scope of the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a claim for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>prescriptive easement for use of an existing road across a neighbor\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-4\">With those considerations, I concur in the majority opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b832-6\">Sercombe, J., joins in this concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b825-5\"> This court sometimes misstates the presumption articulated in <em>Feldman </em>as being established by a showing of \u201copen and notorious\u201d use. <em>McGrath v.

The presumption of adverseness which supports him in the first instance is a typical legal presumption. It is not a mere evidential inference, although that may lie back of it. It is one which requires a trial judge, when no evidence opposes it, to direct a verdict for the claimant.

However, this court has relied on the comments to the <em>Restatement (Third) of Property </em>(2000) to support the proposition that, notwithstanding the word \u201cand\u201d, we treat \u201copen and notorious\u201d as a disjunctive term with specific and separate definitions for each element. <em>See Montague v.

That comment states, in pertinent part: \u201c[w]here a user of land and one having an interest affected by the use have a relationship to each other sufficient in itself to justify the use, <em>the use is not adverse </em>unless knowledge of its adverse character is had by the one whose interest is affected.\u201d <em>Restatement </em>\u00a7 458 comment j (emphasis added). Notwithstanding the emphasized wording, it is clear from the context of the comment that it is referring to what must be shown to establish the \u201copen and notorious\u201d element of a prescriptive easement, and not to what must be shown to establish that a use is \u201cadverse\u201d as that term is employed in the Oregon cases. First, the comment is titled \u201cOpen and notorious use \u2014 Special relationship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, as the majority opinion explains, the <em>Restatement </em>defines \u201cadverse\u201d more broadly than the Oregon cases define the term. 269 Or App at 795 n 3.

Here, a well-established line of cases collide with what will become a new line of cases. The conflict requires this court to decide whether the law will continue to require that, in order to claim a prescriptive easement over preexisting roads of unknown origin, the claimants must show that their use <em>interfered </em>with the owner\u2019s use of the road, so as to prove the requisite open, notorious, and adverse use. The majority opinion offers a nascent alternative that will render the long-established rule immaterial. The alternative posited is that the court will now recognize a claimant\u2019s testimony about a prior, unexpressed, and subjective belief in the claimant\u2019s right to use a road as sufficient evidence \u2014 indeed, as so-called \u201cdirect evidence\u201d \u2014 of open, notorious, and adverse use of preexisting roads of unknown origin. The result of this subjective theory of adverseness will be to tacitly overrule eight cases in concept and in practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-9\">Fearing this alternative to be ill-founded, I respectfully dissent. To explain why, this dissent (1) revisits the facts, (2) recalls the rules on preexisting roads, (3) compares how the parties and the majority grappled with the issues presented here, (4) questions the theory that a subjective belief constitutes \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverse use of preexisting roads, (5) observes how this case conflicts in concept and in practice with established cases on prescriptive easements, (6) suggests how the law should apply to this case, and (7) concludes with a hope that the conflict between neighbors and between cases might be resolved.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-10\">I. FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b832-11\">Plaintiff bought three parcels of land in December 1998 that are reached by Lewis Creek Road.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>that he could not remember any conversations with his seller about the road access. He admitted that he had noticed a disclaimer that appeared on the face of each of his three deeds, warning, \u201cThis property does not have access to or from a legally dedicated street, road or highway and access therefore cannot be insured.\u201d Plaintiff is not the only person served by Lewis Creek Road. It passes through defendants\u2019 property, Larson\u2019s property, public land, Woods\u2019 property, and more public land before reaching plaintiffs parcels. Before his closing, plaintiff had seen purchase documents that included written easements over the Larson and Woods properties, but he did not check to which sections of the road the easements applied. When plaintiff inquired about it, the title company said that it could not give legal advice. Plaintiff choose to assume that the two easements overrode the deeds\u2019 warning and gave him uninterrupted access to his properties. Plaintiffs use of the properties during the relevant years was limited to recreational use in the summer time. One of his parcels had an old cabin, which he improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">Lewis Creek Road has existed since at least 1934. Plaintiff admitted that he had not built the road over defendants\u2019 property, and he did not know who did. The neighbors shared the cost and tasks of maintaining the road. One neighbor oversaw things, asking others to help. Defendant Le Roy Hippe performed maintenance over his property, cutting brush, filling potholes, and cleaning the ditch. Plaintiff has dragged iron behind his pickup to grade the road; and, after asking defendant Hippe\u2019s permission, plaintiff trimmed branches on defendants\u2019 property along the road. In the last few years before trial, defendants have had a chain across the road as it enters their property, but the chain is usually down or down while defendants were home. Defendants have given keys to the chain\u2019s lock to plaintiff as well as the Larsons, UPS, FedEx, and the power company.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Plaintiff testified that, prior to 2009, he had never had any discussions with defendants about his use of the road across their property. In 2008, less than 10 years after his purchase, the county told plaintiff that, in order to get a building permit for a house, he had to have written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>easements to reach his property. In May 2008, plaintiff wrote to defendants\u2019 brother (in interest) to ask for a written easement, while simultaneously asserting that he already had a right to use the road by reason of a prescriptive easement, an implied easement, and a statutory way of necessity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants have not and do not object to plaintiffs use of the road. Because they preferred that future use be permissive use, they declined to grant a written easement. Their refusal prompted this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-4\">II. PREEXISTING ROADS</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The principles surrounding prescriptive easements are well-established. First among them is the reminder that \u201c[e]asements by prescription are not favored by the law[.]\u201d <em>Wood v. Woodcock, </em>276 Or 49, 56, 554 P2d 151 (1976). Second, clear and convincing evidence is required when claimants seek to prove the elements of a prescriptive easement. To prove those elements, claimants must show \u201cthat they or their predecessors used the roads in an open, notorious, adverse, and continuous manner for a period of ten years.\u201d <em>Webb v. Clodfelter, </em>205 Or App 20, 26, 132 P3d 50 (2006) (citing <em>Thompson v. Scott, </em>270 Or 542, 546, 528 P2d 509 (1974)). The first two fundamentals will become important when we turn to the requirements for open, notorious, and adverse use as applied to preexisting roads. And, those two fundamentals will be significant in recognizing a conflict between old and new lines of cases. 269 Or App at 836-40 (DeVore, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">In the varied situations that arise, there are many ways in which a claimant may demonstrate adverseness in making use of another\u2019s land. There is indeed no single way in which adverse, overt, and physical use of another\u2019s land might be manifested. Contrary to the majority\u2019s reading, this dissent and the defendants do not contend that an easement claimant can only rely on the presumption of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>adverseness from use of a road.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Examples of the many ways to demonstrate an adverse claim range from a claimant who builds a new road on another\u2019s land to a claimant who dams a seasonal creek so as to flood the meadow of an upstream neighbor. <em>See, e.g., Montague v. Elliott, </em>193 Or App 639, 653, 92 P3d 731 (2004) (physical deviation from written easement for street); <em>Arrien v. Levanger, </em>263 Or 363, 373, 502 P2d 573 (1972) (flooding as prescriptive use). Merely traveling over an existing road on occasion, however, is not nearly so overt and physical, nor open, notorious, and adverse, as a claimant building a driveway across a neighbor\u2019s lot or as establishing a trail of tire tracks across a neighbor\u2019s fields. <em>See Feldman et ux. v. Knapp et ux., </em>196 Or 453, 250 P2d 92 (1952); <em>R &amp; C Ranch, LLC v. Kunde, </em>177 Or App 304, 33 P3d 1011 (2001), <em>modified on recons, </em>180 Or App 314, 44 P3d 607 (2002) (road becoming tire track trail across field).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\">When the prescriptive claim involves simply the <em>use </em>of a road and no other demonstrable evidence of adverseness, Oregon\u2019s cases provide a rule that yields one or another answer, depending upon whether the roads were preexisting. The long-standing rule has been expressed in this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-5\">\u201cIt is generally said that the open and continuous use of a road for the prescriptive period is presumed to be adverse and under a claim of right. It is further generally said that the servient owner has the burden to rebut the presumption.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-6\">\u201cWhen the road is <em>preexisting, </em>however, and the claimant\u2019s use is <em>nonexclusive, </em>that presumption may be rebutted by proof that the claimant\u2019s use of the road did not <em>interfere </em>with the servient owner\u2019s use of the road.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-7\"><em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 26-27 (citations omitted; emphases added). Ordinarily, the use of the road will be presumed to be adverse, unless the servient owner proves that the use was permissive. But, if it is known that the owner built the road or if the road is of unknown origin, then mere use is not adverse. That use is no longer \u201cadverse and under a claim of right.\u201d To show open, notorious, and adverse use of a road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>of unknown origin, the claimant must show that the claimant\u2019s use of the road <em>interfered </em>with the owner\u2019s use of the road. <em>Id. </em>The importance and reasons for this standard are reflected in a line of cases from the Oregon Supreme Court and continuing through decisions of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">The Oregon Supreme Court explained the significance of preexisting roads in <em>Woods v. Hart, </em>254 Or 434, 436, 458 P2d 945 (1969). In that case, the roadway had been in existence before either the defendants or the plaintiffs acquired their lands. The plaintiffs used the defendants\u2019 road, and the defendants knew it. If the plaintiffs had built the road without asking, the court noted, then the use would have been adverse. <em>Id. </em>But, like our facts here, the most that could be said was that the plaintiffs shared in the work and expense of maintaining the road. <em>Id. </em>The court observed that helping with maintenance does not assert a right to the road, because it is equally possible that the money and work was compensation to the owners for the privilege of using the road. Offering the reason for our rule on preexisting roads, the court declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-5\">\u201cWhere one uses an existing way over another person\u2019s land and nothing more is shown, it is more reasonable to assume that the use was pursuant to a friendly arrangement between neighbors rather than to assume that the user was making an adverse claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-6\"><em>Id. </em>Even if the normal notion were imagined \u2014 that a presumption of adverseness arises when crossing another\u2019s land \u2014 \u201cthe fact that the claimant\u2019s use is of an existing way and the use <em>does not interfere with the owner\u2019s use\u201d </em>would \u201crebut the presumption of adverseness.\u201d Id. at 437 (emphasis added).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b836-7\">\u201c\u2018[T]he fact that [an owner] sees his neighbor also making use of [the road] under circumstances that in no way injures the road, or interferes with his own use of it, does not justify the inference that he is yielding to his neighbor\u2019s claim of right or <em>that his neighbor is asserting any right. </em>It signifies only that he is permitting his neighbor to use the road * * * \u201cin a neighborly way.\u2019\u201d\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b836-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 437-38 (quoting <em>Anthony v. Kennard Bldg. Co., </em>188 Mo 704, 723-24, 87 SW 921 (1905)) (emphasis added). The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>was pragmatic: To see a neighbor travel over a road, without interfering with the owner\u2019s use, does not alert the owner that the neighbor may harbor an adverse claim of right to use the road. The court affirmed the decree refusing the prescriptive claim. <em>Id. </em>at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-4\">The Supreme Court has made the rule plain in other decisions. In <em>Trewin v. Hunter, </em>271 Or 245, 531 P2d 899 (1975), there was recent adverse use, but not for a sufficient period of 10 years. Before the recent adverse use, the plaintiffs had used the roadway over the defendants\u2019 land and had never asked permission. The defendants did not object to the use, but they were not shown to have actually given permission. Citing <em>Woods, </em>our state\u2019s high court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-5\">\u201cIt is our opinion that when a road is used in common by the dominant and servient owner and there is no evidence to establish who constructed the road, <em>it should be presumed </em>that the servient owner constructed it for his own use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b837-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 247-48 (emphasis added). Another decree refusing a prescriptive use was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Again, in <em>Boyer v. Abston, </em>274 Or 161, 544 P2d 1031 (1976), the Supreme Court affirmed another judgment rejecting a prescriptive claim, observing that the road\u2019s \u201corigin is unknown\u201d and that \u201cplaintiffs and their predecessors did not use the road so as to injure it or interfere with defendants\u2019 use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 163. Decisions of the Court of Appeals have been in accord, following the same principles. <em>See, e.g., Read v. Dokey, </em>92 Or App 298, 758 P2d 399 (1988) (reversing judgment for prescriptive easement over a road in common use of unknown origin); <em>Hayward v. Ellsworth, </em>140 Or App 492, 915 P2d 483 (1996) (reversing judgment for prescriptive easement involving informal center road built by original owner of all lots).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">Oregon\u2019s rules on roads \u2014 both the general rule and its counterpoint \u2014 are paralleled in the commentary to today\u2019s more recent <em>Restatement:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b837-9\">\u201cIn states following the majority rule, <em>particular fact situations overcome the presumption of prescriptive use, </em>creating a counter-presumption that the initial use was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>permissive. * * * <em>Evidence that the use was made in common with the owner of the land, or </em>that the road over which a right of way is claim was constructed by the owner for his own use, may also overcome the presumption of prescriptive use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><em>Restatement (Third) of Property (Servitudes) </em>\u00a7 2.16 comment g (2000) (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">Because Oregon understands a cooperative use of roads of unknown origin to be a permissive arrangement, it inescapably follows that, in order to demonstrate an open, notorious, and adverse use, a claimant must show the claimant\u2019s use to interfere with the owner\u2019s use of the road. That is so because our rule on preexisting road parallels the same sort of requirement for proof of adverseness when permission was previously granted. <em>See Hamann v. Brimm, </em>272 Or 526, 537 P2d 1149 (1975) (to repudiate permission, claimant must show a use of a different character and the owner must have a reasonable opportunity to learn of the repudiation).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">Curiously, the first Oregon case on which the majority relies to show the court\u2019s reference to the old <em>Restatement </em>is a case illustrating the importance of showing interference in this parallel situation. In <em>Thompson v. Scott, </em>270 Or 542, 528 P2d 509 (1974), the plaintiffs claimed a prescriptive easement across the defendants\u2019 meadow to reach their timberland. Before a common property was split, the predecessor of the plaintiffs and the defendants had hired the plaintiffs to haul logs out of a timbered area of the property. That area was later sold to the plaintiffs who asserted a prescriptive right to the road to their property. Because the initial use was permissive, something more than ordinary use was required to alert the defendants to an adverse claim. The Supreme Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-7\">\u201cWhen the use of the servient owner\u2019s land is permissive at its inception, the permissive character of the use is deemed to continue thereafter unless the repudiation of the license to use is brought to the knowledge of the servient owner. This principle is stated in <em>[Restatement of Property </em>\u00a7 458 comment j (1944).]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-8\"><em>Thompson, </em>270 Or at 548-49. To alert the owner that the permitted use is changed to an adverse use, \u201c\u2018the claimant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>is required to prove the new and different character of the continued use very clearly.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549. In <em>Thompson, </em>the defendants knew the plaintiffs were using the road, but the character of their use \u2014 visiting rural land infrequently\u2014 was \u201clittle or no warning of an adverse claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551. To like effect, the Supreme Court rejected a prescriptive claim in <em>Hamann, </em>272 Or at 526, where there was no change in the claimant\u2019s use that would have alerted the owners to an adverse claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">In both the situation involving preexisting roads with assumed permission and the parallel situation involving prior, express permission, our courts have found one other fact to be noteworthy: A claimant who shares access with a number of other users, and has given no other demonstrable evidence of adverseness, is less likely to demonstrate adverseness by such shared use. In <em>Thompson, </em>the court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b839-5\">\u201cAnother fact militating against treating plaintiffs\u2019 use as adverse is the non-exclusive character of plaintiffs\u2019 use. Plaintiffs themselves introduced evidence establishing that the road was used by others for a variety of purposes, including the hauling of logs, the hauling of hay, the movement of farm equipment, and for hunting. It has been said that *** \u00a3[i]f the claimant is only one of two, or several, or many, who make the user in question, it is perhaps infer-able that all of these uses are permissive. In such a case the claimant must affirmatively prove the adverse character of his behavior.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">270 Or at 551 (quoting 3 <em>Powell on Real Property </em>\u00b6 413, p 483 (1973)). This recognition is consistent with the principle expressed by the Supreme Court as to preexisting roads that, when nothing else is shown, shared use of a preexisting road among a number of users will be understood to be a \u201cfriendly arrangement between neighbors.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 436; <em>Trewin, </em>271 Or at 247-48; <em>Boyer, </em>274 Or at 163-64.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">A better claim could be made if a claimant were the sole user who establishes a two-track trail across a neighbor\u2019s field. <em>See R &amp; C Ranch, LLC, </em>177 Or App at 313. The fact that plaintiff, here, used the road across defendants\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>property in common with others, and used the road no differently than did neighbors Woods and Larson, underscores the principle that use of a preexisting road is itself not adverse, may be understood as a neighborly arrangement, and requires the claimant to show demonstrable or open and notorious adverseness in some other form \u2014 that is to say, interference with the owners\u2019 use of the roads. <em>See Thompson, </em>270 Or at 551.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">The same circumstance was presented in <em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 20. In a like rural setting, the defendants owned land crossed by the road that served outlying neighbors. Midway along the road, a neighbor Prock owned land through his pension fund. At the far ends of the road system, the plaintiffs owned three parcels. The road existed longer than anyone remembered, and, except for a cut-off road (not relevant here), no one knew who had built the road system. Everyone used the roads in earlier years for moving farm equipment, and, in later years, for hunting or personal uses. The defendants lived on their land and never objected to the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the roads. Conflicts surrounded the plaintiffs\u2019 guests, a hunting club, whom the defendants believed frightened wildlife, brought in noxious weeds, crossed freshly seeded ground in the fall, and rutted wet roads. The defendants granted permission for the plaintiffs to accompany their paying hunters on the road to the plaintiffs\u2019 parcels. The arrangement deteriorated in years too-recent when the defendants found a locked gate had been forced open. The trial court granted the plaintiffs\u2019 claim for a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">This court acknowledged that ordinarily use of the road would be \u201cpresumed to be adverse and under a claim of right.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26 (citing <em>Feldman, </em>196 Or at 473). Where, however, the roads are preexisting and of unknown origin, and claimants\u2019 \u201cuse is nonexclusive,\u201d mere use does not show adverse use. <em>Id. </em>at 27. We summarized the factors by which a presumption of adverse use is defeated, quoting an earlier case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b840-6\">\u201c\u2018Where, as here, (1) a road is used in common by the owners of a putative servient estate and by others; (2) there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>is no evidence to establish who constructed the road; and (3) the evidence does not establish that the common use interfered, for the requisite period, with the servient owner\u2019s use, the claimants of prescriptive rights have not carried their burden of proof.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-4\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Petersen v. Crook County, </em>172 Or App 44, 53, 17 P3d 563 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\"><em>Webb </em>foreshadowed this case. We recognized the claimants were firmly convinced of their own belief in their right to use the roads. We acknowledged the claimants\u2019 argument \u201cthat club members did not seek out [the] defendants\u2019 permission to use the roads because they did not believe they needed it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 28. But there was no overt demonstration of the plaintiffs\u2019 belief. Referring to the relevant period, we observed, \u201cThere is not evidence of a single hostile encounter between hunting club members and [the] defendants between 1977 and 1995.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29. What was shown was not enough to establish adverse use of a neighbors set of preexisting roads. Focusing on what is needed for adverseness, we added, \u201cMore importantly, despite causing wear to roads and damage to locks and gates, plaintiffs never interfered with defendants\u2019 own use [of the roads].\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the plaintiffs\u2019 use of the preexisting roads, bereft of any presumption of adverseness and supported only by their belief that they did not \u201cneed\u201d permission, failed to establish a prescriptive easement. <em>Id. </em>We reversed the judgment for the claimants.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">We recognized another friendly arrangement as to a road of unknown origin in <em>Skidmore v. Clark, </em>205 Or App 592, 135 P3d 367 (2006), which shares some facts with the case at hand. There, too, we required that the claimants demonstrate that their use \u201cinterfered\u201d with the servient owners\u2019 use of the roads. Like defendants in our case here, the owners or predecessors had given the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessor a key to the lock on the road\u2019s gate, or they had allowed the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors to add their own lock. As in <em>Webb, </em>there was some testimony about ruts in the road, which damage the plaintiffs denied. Like defendants in our case here, a plaintiff trimmed back trees and bushes. Nevertheless, we noted, \u201cOregon courts have consistently held that maintenance is more indicative of a friendly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>agreement than it is of adversity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598. Finding little more than ordinary use of preexisting roads and \u201cno evidence of adverse use,\u201d we reversed the judgment for the claimants. <em>Id. </em>at 599.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">In <em>Insko v. Mosier, </em>235 Or App 451, 234 P3d 984 (2010), we confronted the notion that a claimant\u2019s subjective belief was affirmative evidence of adverseness. An early owner had deeded to the defendants\u2019 predecessor a strip of land for east and west access between a county road and the land of the defendants\u2019 predecessors. The defendants\u2019 predecessors had developed the road in dispute. The plaintiffs father and mother had bought landlocked land that lay immediately south of the road strip. Like plaintiff in our case at hand, the plaintiffs father, when buying the land, had thought that his deed included the access strip. Fences lined both sides of the access road, and the plaintiffs fence encroached along the defendants\u2019 access strip. For a couple of weeks in each of two years, the plaintiff had fenced off the access strip in order to enclose yearling cattle within the strip. The plaintiff and his parents made open and continuous use of the road for farming access to their field, and they had never asked permission. Some of their use caused damage to the road, for which the trial court would award the defendants money damages. Trial testimony included evidence of statements the plaintiff\u2019s father had made over the years to neighbors that he owned the disputed strip or had an easement over it. Finding the evidence was sufficient, the trial court granted a judgment recognizing a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">We reversed, focusing on a critical element needed for a prescriptive easement over a preexisting road. We explained that \u201cthe case turns on the question of interference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 455. We rejected the argument that the encroaching fence showed interference, because there was \u201cno evidence that the fence encroached on <em>the road.\u201d Id. </em>at 459 (emphasis in original). We rejected the argument that blocking the road for two weeks in each of two years was interference, because it did not continue over 10 years, and the plaintiffs did not do so when the defendants\u2019 predecessors would return to their property. We rejected the argument that the plaintiffs use had actually caused compensable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>damage to the road, because \u201cdamage to a road alone will not support a finding of interference if the damage did not <em>actually interfere </em>with the <em>owner\u2019s use.\" Id. </em>(citing <em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 29) (emphases added). And, finally, we rejected the fact that the plaintiffs predecessor over the years had objectively manifested his belief in his ownership or legal right to use the road by making statements to neighbors. Referring to adverse possession, we explained, that, with a prescriptive easement, it is not necessary that the claimant intended to assert ownership. Instead, a prescriptive easement turns on <em>\u201c\u2018the manner in which the property is used </em>[.]\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 460 (quoting <em>Wiser v. Elliott, </em>228 Or App at 489 (emphasis in <em>Insko). </em>Specifically, we rejected the suggestion that the plaintiffs subjective belief in his claim could make ordinary use become adverse use. We emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b843-4\">\u201cContrary to the implication of plaintiffs argument, the question of adverse use <em>does not depend on the claimant\u2019s subjective intentions </em>with regard to the disputed road; the question of adverseness turns on whether the property was <em>actually used in a manner that was inconsistent with the owner\u2019s use!\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b843-5\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis and underscoring added). The essential quality of adverseness lies, not in a \u201csubjective intention,\u201d but in the claimant\u2019s demonstrable \u201cmanner\u201d of use that is \u201cinconsistent with the owner\u2019s use\u201d of the road. We reversed and remanded for entry of a judgment for defendants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">III. GRAPPLING WITH THE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">If the law of prescriptive claims to preexisting roads governed this case, then there should be little doubt that our conclusion is controlled by the Supreme Court decisions in <em>Woods, Trewin, </em>and <em>Boyer </em>and our decisions in <em>Read, Hayward, Webb, Skidmore, </em>and <em>Insko. </em>Defendants presented the issue squarely, and, contrary to the majority, 269 Or App at 800-01, this dissent does not raise an issue that defendants failed to raise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendants argued in their briefs that plaintiff needed to prove plaintiffs use interfered with defendants\u2019 use of the road. In plain language, defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>literally underscored their point, \u201cThinking you have a right to use a road is not sufficient bv itself.\u201d (Underscoring in original.) Defendants cited and argued <em>Wood, </em>Trewin4 and <em>Boyer, </em>as well as <em>Read, Hayward, Webb, Skidmore, </em>and <em>Insko.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">Like the property owners in other cases of preexisting roads, <em>see, e.g., Woods, </em>254 Or at 436, defendants knew plaintiff was using the road in an ordinary way.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that sense, defendants recognized in their first trial memorandum that plaintiff \u201cused the roadway open <em>[sic] </em>and notoriously.\u201d In opening statement, defense counsel said that plaintiffs use gave plaintiff a presumption. He allowed, \u201c[W]e think he\u2019s got that <em>presumption </em>going in.\u201d (Emphasis added.) As a consequence, he continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-5\">\u201ctilt\u2019s up to Defendants to rebut that with \u2014 by showing that his use was of an <em>existing </em>road, <em>did not interfere </em>with Defendants\u2019 use of the road \u2014 and it was <em>not exclusive </em>* * * And if Defendants can rebut those three pieces, he [plaintiff] still has to come up with some other way to prove adversity by clear and convincing evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">(Emphases added.) Those were three keys recited in <em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 27 (quoted 269 Or App at 815 (DeVore, J., dissenting)), and they were also quoted in the same trial memo.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">To construe defendants\u2019 recognition of \u201copen and notorious\u201d travel as an unwitting legal concession that defendants knew or had reason to know of plaintiffs adverse claim <em>(i.e., </em>so-called adverseness reduced to \u201cuse not in submission\u201d) is to attribute a meaning that defendants did not intend and should not now be understood to have conceded. Viewed in context, defendants\u2019 counsel wrote and said that plaintiff must show interference or come up with some way other than mere travel to prove open, notorious, and adverse use. In this situation, defendants insisted, plain travel was not adverse. By frankly saying that plaintiffs travel was \u201copen and notorious,\u201d defendants were not conceding half the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>battlefield in an ordinary claim for a prescriptive easement. Defendants were saying that this is no longer an ordinary claim for a prescriptive easement. Because circumstances are different, plaintiff must now prove something more than known travel. Defendants were telling the trial court that plaintiff could not succeed by proving an ordinary claim (:i.e., simply traveling over the road without subordination to the owner) where the context of a preexisting road requires something significantly different. In other words, in a case of preexisting roads in common use, <em>the paradigm shifts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b845-4\">Defendants\u2019 cases, like the parallel cases of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Hamann, </em>explain that when roads are preexisting, ordinary use does not suffice as open, notorious, and adverse use. They explain why a plaintiff must show interference with the owner\u2019s use of the road or demonstrate some change in the character of the claimant\u2019s use, in order to bring to the owner\u2019s attention that the claimant\u2019s use is no longer friendly. By implication or expressly, those cases reject the proposition that a claimant\u2019s later testimony about an earlier, subjective, and unexpressed \u201cclaim of right\u201d somehow constitutes any evidence, let alone \u201cdirect evidence\u201d fully sufficient by itself to prove adverse use of roads of unknown origin. <em>See, e.g., Insko, </em>235 Or App at 460. Even when the claimant\u2019s subjective belief is objectively manifested during the prescriptive period in statements made to neighbors, a subjective belief cannot serve to recharacterize mere travel over preexisting roads as adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Our majority opinion acknowledges <em>Woods </em>and <em>Trewin, </em>but misses their significance. The majority \u201ccabins\u201d them as relevant only to presumptions. The majority does not mention <em>Webb </em>or <em>Insko, </em>on which defendants principally relied. The majority explores none of the reasons why our case law requires, as proof of open, notorious, and adverse use, something during the prescriptive period that is demonstrably more than ordinary use of preexisting roads, or why the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals would have erred repeatedly in requiring interference. The majority does not respond directly to defendants\u2019 reliance on these cases, nor do we consider them of any relevance to the prospect of an alternate theory of subjective proof of adverseness.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>Instead, the majority deems defendants and this dissent to have failed to cite anything that prevents an alternate theory of adverseness <em>(i.e., </em>belated testimony about an earlier, unexpressed, subjective belief); the majority says that defendants gave too narrow of an explanation of <em>Kondor v. Prose, </em>50 Or App 55, 622 P2d 741 (1981); and the majority sees the dissent\u2019s explanation of <em>Sander v. McKinley, </em>241 Or App 297, 250 P3d 939 (2011), which follows, as a wholesale rejection of the decision, rather than a reconciliation of it with established principles. 269 Or App at 826. The majority faults these seeming failures, while failing to recognize that defendants\u2019 authorities discredit the theory that an unexpressed, subjective belief suffices to transform unremarkable travel into adverse use. The majority sidesteps defendants\u2019 authorities, because there seems to be an easy and alternate theory of adverseness that renders defendants\u2019 authorities immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">If the criticism were redirected, the majority would be quite right to observe that more could have been said to examine today\u2019s issue \u2014 by <em>both </em>parties. At trial and on appeal, the parties predictably spent most of their energies arguing about the conflicting evidence of express permission. Although the trial court did posit an alternate theory of adverseness, citing <em>Kondor, </em>the successful plaintiff, curiously, did not cite or argue <em>Kondor </em>at all in his brief on appeal in support of his judgment. Even the trial court did not cite <em>Sander, </em>which is arguably a better case for an alternate theory of adverseness, and which was decided eight months before the trial court\u2019s judgment. In his brief, plaintiff did not cite <em>Sander, </em>either. Put in context, the majority opinion has done more to develop a subjective theory of adverseness than defendants ever had a chance to see in their opponent\u2019s brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Defendants did cite and distinguish <em>Kondor, </em>treating the decision as misconstrued by the trial court. As, however, the majority opinion reflects, an alternate theory of adverseness appears to be developing. In light of <em>Sander, </em>which neither plaintiff nor the trial court mentioned, the prospect of a subjective theory cannot be discounted in a paragraph, as defendants might have hoped. Although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>defendants could not have anticipated the majority\u2019s opinion, precognition would have helped little, because, despite the majority\u2019s claim, an alternate theory of adverseness is not rooted in the <em>Restatement (First) of Property, </em>nor in the cases of the Supreme Court. The theory that a subjective belief or a \u201clack of subordination\u201d is direct evidence \u2014 and itself fully sufficient proof of open, notorious, and adverse use \u2014 is a relatively recent conception appearing in our own work, particularly in <em>Sander, </em>a case which could be better explained in other terms. It is a theory that does not stand up well on its own, nor against the established law involving preexisting roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">IV. EVOLUTION OF A MISCONCEPTION</p>\n<p id=\"Alj\">A. <em>The Old Restatement</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">The majority traces its analysis upstream to the <em>Restatement (First) of Property. </em>Summarizing the law as it was understood in 1944 as to most situations, <em>the Restatement </em>introduced the concept that an easement is prescriptive, \u201cprovided the use is (a) adverse, and (b) for the period of prescription, continuous and uninterrupted.\u201d <em>Restatement (First) of Property </em>\u00a7 457 (1944). The <em>Restatement (First) </em>described adverse use as requiring several components, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-6\">\u201cA use of land is adverse to the owner * * * when it is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-7\">\u201c(a) not made in subordination to him, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-8\">\u201c(b) wrongful, or may be made by him wrongful, as to him, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b847-9\">\u201c(c) open and notorious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b847-10\"><em>Restatement (First) </em>at \u00a7 458. Although Oregon speaks of \u201copen and notorious use\u201d as a separate element of a prescriptive easement, <em>Thompson, </em>270 Or at 546, the old <em>Restatement </em>combines \u201copen and notorious\u201d as one of three components of adverse use. Ordinarily, the difference should matter little, so long as the \u201copen and notorious\u201d prerequisite is not dropped out of consideration of adverse, prescriptive use.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>The concept of a mistaken \u201cclaim of right\u201d is itself not a described component in the primary text of section 458 in of the old <em>Restatement </em>formulation of adverse use. Instead, the term appears in commentary as an optional possibility pertaining to the first component, which requires that a claimant show that the use was \u201cnot made in subordination\u201d to the owner. Use in subordination would defeat a claim. To ask for permission to use a road shows subordination to the owner. For example, although \u201cA\u201d uses a pathway across Blackacre, even telling third persons at various times that he has an easement, \u201cA\u201d asks the owner for permission. Such use would not be found adverse. <em>Id. </em>at comment c (illus 1). A \u201cclaim of right\u201d is one way by which a person may show that the use was \u201cnot made in subordination\u201d to the owner. But a \u201cclaim of right\u201d is not always necessary. \u201c[I]t is not necessary in order that a use be adverse that it be made either in the belief or under a claim that it is legally justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 458 comment d. A person could build a road or dig a mine on another\u2019s land, while knowing that there was no right and asserting no right and, yet, the physical acts would demonstrate the use was \u201cnot made in subordination\u201d to the owner. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 458 comment c (illus 2).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">That said, a \u201cmistaken claim of right\u201d or a lack of subordination does not wholly satisfy all the components of adverse use under the old <em>Restatement </em>formulation, because, by itself, it does not satisfy the second component of wrongfulness or the third component of adverseness, requiring \u201copen and notorious\u201d use. In short, a mistaken \u201cclaim of right\u201d is not the equivalent of adverse use. It is an optional factor relating to one component of adverseness (i.e., (a) that the use not be in subordination to the owner).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Section 458 of the old <em>Restatement </em>is only a generalized summary of older American case law. It did not address the specific and varied situations that arose then or that would be developed later in' Oregon\u2019s law. Even so, the old <em>Restatement </em>did anticipate the development of Oregon\u2019s law, when it explained the third component of adverse use, that component which requires that the use be open and notorious. It explained that something more than ordinary use <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>was required when the owner would understand that the use was friendly. The <em>Restatement </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-4\">\u201cWhere a user of land and one having an interest affected by the use <em>[e.g., </em>the owner] have a relationship to each other sufficient in itself to justify the use, the use is not adverse unless knowledge of its adverse character is had by the one whose interest is affected. The responsibility of bringing this knowledge to him lies upon the one making the use. It is not open to a user of land to contend as against one to whom he stands in a relationship sufficient to justify the use that, because the one to whom he stands in this relationship had a reasonable opportunity to learn of the existence of the use and of its nature, the use was as to him open and notorious and therefore adverse. Thus, a licensee cannot begin an adverse use against his licensor merely by repudiating his license under such circumstances that the licensor has a reasonable opportunity to learn of the repudiation. Justice to the licensor requires more than this. It requires that he know of the repudiation. If knowledge does come to him the source is immaterial. It is not necessary that it come from the licensee, but the responsibility of seeing that it does come to him is on the licensee, a responsibility the obligation of which cannot be satisfied by showing that the licensor neglected to avail himself of means of knowledge.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b849-6\"><em>Restatement (First) </em>at \u00a7 458 comment j (1944). This rule, governing a situation more specific than the generalities of section 458, was quoted as explanation for the decision in <em>Thompson, </em>270 Or at 549, rejecting a prescriptive claim when use had begun with permission. <em>See also Hamann, </em>272 Or at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">This commentary is also consistent with the understanding that, when neighbors use roads of unknown origin, the use is \u201cpursuant to a friendly arrangement between neighbors.\u201d <em>Woods, </em>254 Or at 436; <em>Trewin, </em>271 Or at 247-48; <em>Boyer, </em>274 Or at 163-64; <em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 27-28; <em>Skidmore, </em>205 Or App at 597; <em>Insko, </em>235 Or App at 458. After the <em>Restatement </em>was updated 56 years later, it acknowledged that such particular fact situations defeat the presumption of adverseness arising from ordinary use and create a \u201ccounter-presumption that the initial use was permissive.\u201d <em>Restatement (Third) </em>at \u00a7 2.16 comment g. For that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>reason, the claimant must demonstrably interfere with the owner\u2019s use of the road or must let the owner know, directly or indirectly, that the use of the road is no longer friendly, in order that the claimant\u2019s use may be proven openly and notoriously adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">To be sure, nothing in the old <em>Restatement </em>elevates a negative component \u2014 a lack of subordination \u2014 into the positive proof on the element of adverseness, especially without the other prerequisites of adverse use. By its nature, a mistaken belief in the claimant\u2019s right can only go so far, because proof of a mistaken belief is only \u201cevidence\u201d of something that is not. It is proof of a negative circumstance \u2014 that the claimant\u2019s use was not in subordination to the owner. It is like a claimant disproving a defense, while still needing to prove the affirmative claim. To prove that the claimant\u2019s use was not nonadverse does not go further to prove the positive proposition that the use is, in fact, adverse. To prove that the claimant had not done something to demonstrate subordination does not prove, thereby, that the claimant had actually done something demonstrably adverse. At best, proof that use was not in subordination means simply that the use still has the potential of being adverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">In <em>Restatement </em>thinking, in order to be adverse, a claimant must still show the use to be wrongful as to the owner and that the use was open and notoriously so. <em>See Restatement (First) </em>at \u00a7 458 (components (b) and (c)). Nothing in the <em>Restatement-old </em>or new-suggests that a subjective and unexpressed belief is somehow complete in itself as \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness. That misconception lies elsewhere \u2014 with <em>Sander. </em>Nothing in the <em>Restatement </em>suggests that an unexpressed \u201cclaim of right\u201d is a trump card applicable despite specific situations, like preexisting roads, which assume permissive use is the norm. That proposition will rest elsewhere \u2014 with this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">B. <em>Supreme Court Precedent</em></p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">The majority opinion correctly observes that the Supreme Court has made references to the <em>Restatement (First), </em>but those references are only references to general concepts in ordinary cases. <em>See Feldman, </em>196 Or at 474 (common driveway built by the claimants\u2019 predecessors); <em>Thompson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number><em>v. Schuh, </em>286 Or 201, 211, 593 P2d 1138 (1979) (the claimants\u2019 periodic trips to rural land not open and notorious use); <em>Hamann, </em>272 Or at 529 (prior permissive use and no change in character of use); <em>Arrien, </em>263 Or at 371 (the defendant\u2019s periodic flooding of owner\u2019s land \u2014 a physical invasion \u2014 was not in subordination, <em>i.e., </em>was under claim of right, even if the defendant thought he was trespassing); <em>Hay v. Stevens, </em>262 Or 193, 196, 497 P2d 362 (1972) (the claimant\u2019s use was not in subordination, despite his statement he would have stopped use of beach path upon objection, because that only meant that he did not claim full ownership).</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">None of these cases does more than treat the old <em>Restatement </em>as a secondary resource involving ordinary principles of prescriptive easements.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> None of these cases cites the <em>Restatement </em>for a theory that, where there has been no physical damage to an owner\u2019s land and no interference with the owner\u2019s use of a preexisting road on his land, a claimant\u2019s unexpressed \u201cclaim of right\u201d is somehow \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness. None of these Supreme Court cases employed the <em>Restatement </em>for such a proposition. None of these cases criticized, distinguished, or overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Woods, Trewin, </em>and <em>Boyer </em>on roads of unknown origin. In other circumstances, claims of noble lineage may lend authority, but, here, we should find no support for a prescriptive easement either in the <em>Restatement </em>or in decisions of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">C. <em>Source of the Confusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The source of today\u2019s confusion can be traced through several cases from correct statements of law to misapplications of those statements. In <em>City of Ashland v. Hardesty, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>23 Or App 523, 527-28, 543 P2d 41 (1975), there was no road of unknown origin. The city had built a roadway to its sewer plant, and the roadway deviated from its easements and trespassed on the defendants\u2019 land. Although city officials testified that they believed that the roadway followed the easements, we observed that their intent to be lawful did not mean that their use was \u201csubordinate to the property owners whose land they crossed [.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 528. Giving the text its proper application, we cited the same <em>Restatement </em>commentary at issue here for the proposition that a use is not in subordination to a land owner even when a claimant is mistaken about its claim of right. <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Restatement (First) </em>at \u00a7 458, comment d). This point is paralleled in the law on adverse possession. \u201cAn intent to claim land occupied under a mistaken belief of ownership is sufficient to prove hostile intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Rider v. Pottratz, </em>246 Or 454, 456, 425 P2d 766 (1967)). We did not declare that a mistaken \u201cclaim of right\u201d was itself \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness. Rather, the city\u2019s construction of the roadway on the defendants\u2019 land \u2014 a physical invasion \u2014 was the demonstration of adverse use.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">In <em>Kondor, </em>there was no road of unknown origin, nor a group of owners sharing a common road in a neighborly arrangement. There were only two tracts of land derived from common owners of both tracts. The northern and southern tracts respectively would become the plaintiffs\u2019 and the defendants\u2019 lands. Before then, the common owners of both tracts had allowed Mayfield, a third-party user, to build a mill on the southern tract \u201cabout 1950\u201d and \u201cshortly thereafter\u201d to build the disputed road that connected the northern tract, across the southern tract, to a public road. 50 Or App at 57. \u201cIn 1950,\u201d the prior owners of the tracts conveyed the southern tract to the defendants\u2019 predecessors, who apparently knew of the original owners\u2019 permission to Mayfield for his construction and use of the road. Hauling in the logs over the road, Mayfield built a cabin on the northern tract. The road served as the only access for the northern tract. For 16 years, Mayfield or Boats, the subsequent tenants, lived there.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">Mayfield \u201csupposed it was legal to go over the road at all times,\u201d because he had built the road and begun renting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>from the original owners of both tracts. <em>Id. </em>at 58. Whether he was right or wrong about that did not matter. We recited the principle from <em>City of Ashland, </em>recalling that, \u201ceven if the user mistakenly believes he has the right to use the easement, that use is sufficiently adverse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. That is to say, a mistaken belief does not make the use \u201cin subordination\u201d to the land owner. <em>Id. </em>The claim was adverse, because the original owner had granted permission for the construction of the road, a fact known to the defendants\u2019 predecessors, and because mere acquiescence by the defendants or their predecessors \u201cdoes not equal permission.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61. A decree for a prescriptive easement was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><em>Kondor </em>did not declare that a mistaken belief, standing alone, suffices as affirmative evidence in itself that a claimant\u2019s use is adverse. <em>Kondor </em>declared simply that, even if Mayfield might have been mistaken, his mistake did not mean his use was thereby in subordination to the defendant owners. That was the narrow point borrowed from <em>City of Ashland. Kondor </em>did not say that a subjective belief (lack of subordination) sufficed in itself as \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness. The term \u201cdirect evidence\u201d does not appear in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The analysis in <em>Kondor </em>proceeded on the familiar principle that continuous, open, and notorious use of a road would be <em>presumed </em>to be adverse \u2014 that is, to be without the defendants\u2019 permission. That presumption was especially appropriate when the road was not of unknown origin and was instead a road known to have been constructed by the original third-party user himself. In short, <em>Kondor </em>was just about the defendants\u2019 failure to overcome the plaintiffs\u2019 presumption of adverse use. It did not create a new and alternate theory of adverseness. <em>Kondor </em>was decided on traditional principles; it did not suggest an alternate way to prove adverseness simply by means of self-serving testimony in an eventual trial about a previously held unspoken, subjective belief during the years of allegedly prescriptive use.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The theory that a subjective \u201cclaim of right\u201d or lack of subordination might suffice as affirmative evidence to prove adverseness should be attributed to a case that the trial court did not mention and that plaintiff did not cite or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"834\">*834</page-number>argue on appeal. In <em>Sander, </em>241 Or App at 297, the claimants\u2019 devised that theory and, with its spin, gave <em>Kondor </em>a new meaning. As in <em>Kondor, </em>there were in <em>Sander </em>only two adjoining tracts. There was no group of neighbors using a common road in a neighborly arrangement. The defendants\u2019 predecessor bought what was to become the McKinley property in 1969, through which ran a county road. In 1968 and 1971, the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors bought the adjoining Sander property to the northeast. The upland portion, which immediately adjoined the McKinley property, could not be reached by road.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">In 1970, the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors began crossing from the county road, across the McKinley property, to reach their Sander property to the northeast. Their \u201cprimitive road\u201d had never been improved, graded, or surfaced in any way. It consisted of \u201ctwo narrow dirt tracks in the grass, which [were] the result of vehicles repeatedly following the same route.\u201d 241 Or App at 301. One of the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors had always assumed that there was an easement in place and had never asked for permission to cross the McKinley property.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The trial court granted a judgment recognizing a prescriptive easement for benefit of the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed, asserting that their predecessors had given permission, and that the plaintiffs had failed to prove that the primitive road interfered with the defendants\u2019 property. In a creative moment, the claimants reasoned that the lack of interference could only serve to rebut a presumption of permissive use, that they were not relying on any presumption, and that what they offered was affirmative evidence in itself of adverseness. Agreeing with the first premise that use gives rise to a presumption of adverseness and the second premise that a lack of interference serves to rebut the presumption of adverseness, we accepted the logic of the plaintiffs\u2019 syllogism, in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"835\">*835</page-number>\u201cThat said, as plaintiffs argue, an easement claimant need not rely on that presumption to establish the element of adverse use. Adverseness can be established directly by showing that the claimant\u2019s use was not in subordinatipn to the rights of the property owner. <em>Kondor </em>[, 50 Or App at 60]. A claimant\u2019s mistaken belief that he or she has the right to use the servient property is sufficient to establish adverse use. <em>Id. </em>In this case, plaintiffs contend that they established adversity directly and thus do not rely on the presumption. Because they do not rely on the presumption, we agree with plaintiffs that it is immaterial that the [plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors\u2019] use of the McKinley property did not interfere with any of its respective owners\u2019 use of it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">241 Or App at 306-07. Of course, <em>Kondor </em>did not actually hold that a mistaken belief was itself \u201csufficient to establish adverse use\u201d; the mistaken belief only avoided viewing the use to be in subordination to the owner. It was a constellation of facts \u2014 starting with construction of the road on the defendants\u2019 land and ending with the defendants\u2019 failure to overcome the plaintiffs\u2019 presumption \u2014 that established adverseness. Nevertheless, in <em>Sander, </em>we went on to conclude \u201cthat the [plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors\u2019] use of the road on the McKinley property was not in subordination to [defendants\u2019 predecessors\u2019] rights and, thus, that their use was adverse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 309. We affirmed the plaintiffs\u2019judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The language in <em>Sander, </em>adopting the claimants\u2019 novel theory that they were offering an alternate proof of adverseness, would seem to lend support to the majority\u2019s conclusion here, if it were not so overshadowed by <em>Woods, Trewin, Boyer, Webb, Skidmore, </em>and <em>Insko, </em>and if it were not better distinguished and explained on its facts. In <em>Sander, </em>there was only the one adjoining parcel that needed access across the defendants\u2019 property, such that travel by the one neighbor is of more significance. <em>Cf. Kondor, </em>50 Or App at 57 (road crosses to serve only northern parcel). The plaintiffs and their predecessors made exclusive use of the road. <em>See Thompson, </em>270 Or at 551. There were no other neighbors traveling the road pursuant to an understood neighborly arrangement. <em>See Woods, </em>254 Or at 436. This was a unique one-on-one situation of adjoining parcels.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>Perhaps of more significance, this was an unimproved, primitive road whose use seemingly begun in 1970 around the time the plaintiffs\u2019 predecessors bought their property. It consisted of two tracks through the grass. Therefore, this \u201croad\u201d was like the two track, primitive pathway along or across fields in <em>R &amp; C Ranch, LLC, </em>177 Or App at 304. Where it appears that the primitive road serves one remote parcel, the adverse use is better explained as the apparent establishment of the road by the claimant\u2019s use of the road to reach the remote parcel. The adverseness lies not in the negative, not in the lack of subordination by itself, and not in just the absence of nonadverseness, but in the positive evidence that the primitive path has been created.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In other words, <em>Sander </em>was correctly decided, even if it strayed when accepting the claimant\u2019s misconception that <em>Kondor </em>could be read to say that a mistaken \u201cclaim of right\u201d is sufficient in itself to constitute the full equivalent of adverse use. <em>Sander </em>need not be overruled. If it deserved any attention, which neither the trial court nor plaintiff gave it, the case only needs to be explained in terms of its facts and familiar principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">V. TROUBLED THEORY</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Although <em>Kondor </em>was cited by the trial court and the majority opinion, <em>Kondor </em>is not the problem, for the reasons reviewed above. It does not stand for the proposition attributed to it, and defendants did correctly distinguish it. If, however, <em>Sander </em>cannot be better explained in the terms suggested here, then <em>Sander, </em>together with this case, will present serious problems for the law on prescriptive easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">Although all cases agree that \u201c[e]asements by prescription are not favored,\u201d <em>Wood, </em>276 Or at 56, they will now be favored, because prescriptive claims will become much easier to win and often impossible to defend. In nearly every case in which people disagree so vigorously as to hire lawyers, take their dispute to court, and spend life savings in litigation, the easement claimants will insist that they have a right to use the road in dispute, and that, if somehow mistaken, they have a \u201cmistaken claim of right\u201d to use the road. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"837\">*837</page-number>If claimants did not believe themselves justified, there would never be lawsuits over prescriptive easements. Because nearly all claimants will come to court to swear that they held a subjective belief in their claims, nearly all prescriptive claims will begin with the element of adverseness established by the simple fact that there is a dispute. Although other elements such as continuity or defenses such as express permission will remain, the element of adverseness, as a practical matter, will be all but removed as a necessary element of the claim. Claimants can simply testify that they thought they could use someone\u2019s road without permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Although all cases agree that proof of a prescriptive easement must be established by clear and convincing evidence, proof of adverseness, when offered in the form of a \u201clack-of-subordination\u201d will be anything but clear and convincing. Proof of a subjective belief in a person\u2019s right to use a road is not a tangible thing and not suitable to meaningful cross-examination. Although circumstantial evidence might be offered to show whether the subjective belief was honestly held, pretrial discovery and trial proof of such matters will prove to be a morass. Because claimants will prove adverseness through their own opinion, efforts at discovery or cross-examination will be a waste of clients\u2019 fees, lawyers\u2019 efforts, and courts\u2019 time.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">This problem will be most troubling in this context of roads of unknown origin. Where a number of neighbors cross an owner\u2019s land on a road that predated them all, where they share maintenance, and where they assume a neighborly arrangement of permissive use, an owner cannot know which neighbor secretly harbors a \u201cmistaken claim of right\u201d (or lack of subordination) to use the road. An owner will not know against whom to protect from a future prescriptive claim. Surely, it must remain true that ordinary use of preexisting road is <em>not </em>presumptively adverse. But, if an uncommunicated, \u201cmistaken claim of right\u201d silently transforms ordinary, non-adverse travel over a shared road into adverse use, then an owner cannot know which of the neighbors holds such a subjective belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">In cases of preexisting roads, this is not just a problem that adverseness is effectively dropped from the disputable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"838\">*838</page-number>elements of a claim. The Oregon element requiring <em>open and notorious </em>use is now effectively dropped from the claim, as well, whenever roads preexist where mere travel does not demonstrate adverseness.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because an owner cannot tell which neighbor harbors a bad attitude from among those in a cooperative, permissive arrangement, the owner will have no reason to know of an allegedly adverse claim \u2014 because a claim now is proven by innocuous travel and an unexpressed attitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">To suggest that a subjective belief in one\u2019s right to use a road is itself, full and complete, open and notorious, \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness is a contradiction in terms. In most situations, it is an oxymoron, because to prove a subjective belief proves nothing. A mistaken \u201cclaim of right\u201d is only relevant to disprove subordination; it is not itself affirmative proof of adverseness. This court has already explained that a subjective belief does not make plain use become adverse use. The statement warrants repetition. We have recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-5\">\u201cthe question of adverse use does not depend on the claimant\u2019s subjective intentions with regard to the disputed road; the question of adverseness turns on whether the property was <em>actually used in a manner </em>that was inconsistent with the owner\u2019s use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-6\"><em>Insko, </em>235 Or App at 460 (emphasis added). It is the <em>conduct </em>of the claimant that matters, not the unseen attitude of the user. <em>See id. </em>(rejecting subjective intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">The claimants in <em>Sander </em>may have been ingenious. By offering so-called \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness \u2014 that is, the claimant\u2019s own belated testimony about a prior, subjective belief \u2014 without relying on their travel over the road for a presumption \u2014 without any other tangible proof of open, notorious, and adverse activity \u2014 without any overtly demonstrable facts that were known or even <em>could </em>be known by the defendants \u2014 the claimants avoided our long-established case law on preexisting roads of unknown origin. The claimants avoided the need to explain why, with their novel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"839\">*839</page-number>conception, three decisions of the Supreme Court and five decisions of this court should be effectively overruled. To overrule those cases <em>sub silentio </em>is much easier. It is much easier to assume eight cases on preexisting roads are left untouched, when they are ignored as immaterial in light of another theory of adverseness.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">Even if there were a subjective theory of adverseness, <em>Woods, Trewin, Boyer, Read, Hayward, Webb, Skidmore, </em>and <em>Insko </em>cannot be ignored. At the least, these cases would stand for the point that, in the case of roads of unknown origin or roads built by the land owner, the claimant\u2019s ordinary use of an owner\u2019s road is a fact of no consequence for a prescriptive claim. This is necessarily true because ordinary travel over roads of unknown origin does not give rise to a presumption of adverseness. This must be doubly true because the majority, like the plaintiffs in <em>Sander, </em>declares that plaintiffs are not relying on any presumptions from use. If so, then they cannot rely on the mere travel over the road as something that the landowner should notice as adverse. Ordinary use of a preexisting road is unlike the demonstrated adverseness of creating a roadway across an owner\u2019s land. Ordinary travel over a preexisting road does not alert an owner that a neighbor\u2019s trip over the road is unfriendly, hostile, or contrary to the owner\u2019s rights in his property. Ordinary travel over a preexisting road can mean nothing for a claimant who would shun the presumption of adverseness from such travel and who instead would assert the \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of his or her own subjective belief in a right to use the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Because such travel is insufficient for adverseness, and because the claimant does not rely on any presumption based on use of a road, we should ask: How is an owner to know that one of the neighbors harbors the unspoken attitude that is a \u201clack of subordination\u201d or a \u201cmistaken claim of right\u201d? If the law provides that travel over a preexisting road counts for nothing in itself, because such travel is not open and notorious adverse use, then how could the <em>addition </em>of the neighbor\u2019s eventual testimony at a trial about a previously uncommunicated, subjective belief during the prescriptive period somehow transform unremarkable use into open, notorious, adverse use? There is no good answer. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>In root concept, therefore, a subjective theory of adverseness conflicts with Oregon law on prescriptive claims on preexisting roads. In root concept, established law holds that ordinary travel over preexisting roads does not suffice to signal an open and notorious adverse claim; but now the same unremarkable use, when coupled with a belated disclosure of a subjective claim of right <em>does </em>constitute a purportedly open and notorious adverse claim. By endorsing this recently developed misconception, today\u2019s decision contradicts the principles that underlie eight decisions on prescriptive claims to preexisting roads.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">In practice, as in concept, an alternate theory conflicts with Oregon law on preexisting roads. If adverseness can be proven by accepting the claimant\u2019s belated testimony about a prior belief as so-called \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of adverseness, then no one will ever again need to bother with relying on the presumption of adverseness that arises from open and continuous use of a road for a prescriptive period. Nor will anyone need to prove one of the many, other, legitimate, manifest ways that adverseness might be shown, ranging from directly <em>telling </em>the owner that the use is adverse to demonstrating adversity with obvious interference with the owner\u2019s own use. To look for such real proof becomes unnecessary. Lawyers will simply choose the easier theory for their clients\u2019 cases. The fact that the user did not interfere with the owner\u2019s use of the road, that the user did not demonstrate that the character of the use had changed, that the owner has been shown <em>no </em>indication of an adverse claim in an \u201copen and notorious\u201d manner will all become immaterial. In practice, the long-settled law on preexisting roads will become a dead letter. If litigants may readily choose an easier theory to prove a prescriptive claim to a preexisting road, then that predictable change in litigation practice should reveal that there is an unacknowledged change in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">VI. THIS CASE</p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">If not our own decisions in <em>Read, Hayward, Webb, Skidmore, </em>and <em>Insko, </em>then the decisions of the Supreme Court in <em>Woods, Trewin, </em>and <em>Boyer </em>should control the resolution of this case. Application of that law should be straightforward, accepting the facts as the trial court found them. No one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>knows who built Lewis Creek Road. From the start, plaintiff had deeds that told him that there was no legal access to his parcels. Unlike cases in which claimants may establish use of a two-track road across an owner\u2019s fields, plaintiff admits that he did not build the road. He just used it. His use of a preexisting road, however, has no significance in suggesting open, notorious, adverse use. <em>See, e.g., Webb, </em>205 Or App at 20. Unlike cases in which the plaintiffs are the lone users of the road, plaintiffs here had nonexclusive use of the road. <em>Thompson, </em>270 Or at 551. The fact that the neighbors shared the costs and tasks of maintenance reflects a cooperative neighborly arrangement, not adverse claims. <em>Woods, 254 </em>Or at 436. The fact that defendant Le Roy Hippe and others used the road as their only access likewise reflects a cooperative, neighborly arrangement, not adverse claims. <em>Id. </em>The fact that defendant Hippe expressed confusion whether his own use was entitlement or permissive merely expresses the subtlety and confusion of this field of law. An honest and untutored lay witness could not be expected to testify any better, even while resisting an adverse claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Although this court defers to the trial court on any factual finding with sufficient evidence, the trial court here did not find \u201csomething more\u201d to support a prescriptive claim. The trial court did not believe defendant Hippe\u2019s testimony that, when speaking with plaintiff alongside a highway sometime between 2003 and 2005, Hippe had told plaintiff that plaintiff could use the road. Plaintiff agreed the men had talked, but plaintiff testified, \u201cI don\u2019t remember the conversation.\u201d Plaintiff did not go on to provide \u201csomething more.\u201d Plaintiff did not testify that, at some time sufficient for the prescriptive period, plaintiff had told defendants that he did not need permission. In fact, when asked if he ever had any conversation with defendant Hippe, prior to the time plaintiff asked for a written easement, plaintiff testified, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that was ever discussed.\u201d In short, this <em>was </em>the classic situation \u2014 or as the majority would say, the default situation \u2014 in which neighbors use a road in a cooperative arrangement. In the evidence and the trial court\u2019s findings, there was not \u201csomething more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">Like <em>Webb, </em>during all but a latter year when the issue arose, there was no evidence of even a single hostile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"842\">*842</page-number>encounter between the parties. Although the trial court disbelieved that defendant Hippe verbalized permission, there is still no dispute that defendant gave plaintiff and others a key to the lock on the chain across the road at his property line. The fact that plaintiff \u201cdid not seek out defendants\u2019 permission to use the roads because [he] did not believe [he] needed it\u201d does not show open and notorious adverseness. <em>Webb, </em>205 Or App at 28. Although plaintiff may have harbored a subjective belief that he had written easements, a subjective belief does not show adverseness.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Insko, </em>235 Or App at 460 (rejecting evidence of subjective intentions, beliefs about an easement or outright ownership, and even overt statements made to others during the prescriptive period). There is no evidence that plaintiff ever told defendants that plaintiff thought he had a right to use the road until plaintiffs letter in May 2008, less 10 years after his purchase. Put another way, plaintiff asserted an adverse claim less than 10 years before this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\">The road passes about 60 to 80 feet from defendants\u2019 house, but, contrary to the trial court\u2019s view, simply viewing a passing car does not bespeak adverse use, especially because defendants had never felt or expressed an objection to plaintiffs use and because a permissive arrangement among neighbors is understood to be the norm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Woods, </em>254 Or at 434. Plaintiff had a cabin on one of his parcels and testified that his trips over the road were limited to recreational use in the summer time. Defendants would have had little reason to have noticed or objected to plaintiffs infrequent trips. <em>See Thompson v. Schuh, </em>286 Or at 201 (periodic, intermittent visits). Passing by on the road is not adverse use, and, more importantly, it is not interference with defendants\u2019 use of the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">When asked, defendant Hippe testified that his wife did not care for the road\u2019s dust and that she would like it even less if plaintiffs parcels developed and created heavier use. Yet, because ruts or wear and tear on the road in <em>Webb </em>did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"843\">*843</page-number>not suffice, and, because actual, compensable damage to the road did not suffice in <em>Insko, </em>some dust from the road cannot suffice as interference with defendants\u2019 use. Dust would not notify defendants of an adverse claim. In sum, plaintiff offered no evidence that his use of a road that he shared in common with Larson and Woods was openly and notoriously adverse to defendants. The trial court should have dismissed this claim for a prescriptive easement, because plaintiff failed to offer sufficient evidence by any standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\">VII. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">If, in the end, neighbors cannot find a mutually agreeable way to provide access, then the law does provide plaintiff with a remedy in the form of a statutory way of necessity, just as he asserted in his letter in May 2008. <em>See </em>ORS 376.150 - 376.200 (ways of necessity). If, in the end, we do not find a better response than a subjective theory of adverseness, then, in cases of preexisting roads, we will prove the truth of the tired axiom that bad facts make bad law. Oregon landowners, lawyers, and courts will suffer from a misconception \u2014 the misapplication of a \u201cmistaken claim of right.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b863-6\">Ortega, Duncan, Hadlock, and Tookey, J., join in this dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b832-12\"> A fourth parcel is not at issue on appeal, because it was purchased in 2006 with too little time to support prescriptive use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b834-7\"> An implied easement presupposes a set of circumstances beginning with a common grantor of plaintiffs and defendants\u2019 properties, a fact that this situation lacked. <em>See Thompson v.

Because the claimant was alleged to know that he was trespassing and had said he hoped to \u201cstraighten up the matter,\u201d the issue was whether that evidence meant his use was in subordination. <em>Id. </em>Consistent with comment d <em>o\u00ed Restatement (First) </em>section 458, the court held such flagrant use of the other\u2019s property was not in subordination, regardless whether the claimant believed he was entitled. The decision did not suggest that the claimant\u2019s subjective claim of right, if he actually had one, would have sufficed in itself to prove adverseness.
