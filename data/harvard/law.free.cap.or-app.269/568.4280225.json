We reject without further discussion defendant\u2019s first assignment of error, regarding the trial court\u2019s order that defendant wear a stun belt beneath his clothing during trial. In his second, third, and fourth assignments, defendant contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal on the three counts of identity theft. He contends that the state did not establish his intent to deceive or defraud. In his final assignment, defendant asks this court to review, as plain error, the trial court\u2019s entry of a judgment of conviction for theft by receiving, arguing that the conviction is unsupported by evidence in the record. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The facts are undisputed. While defendant was driving a stolen car from California, Officer Freeman attempted to pull him over for failure to signal. The encounter escalated into a high-speed chase on Highway 101. During the chase, defendant \u201ctook out a bank of mailboxes, kind of vaulted up over a berm, and at that point, the passenger side door came open,\u201d and the passenger dove out of the car. Freeman stopped for the passenger and lost pursuit of defendant. A short while later, other officers discovered the car in an embankment further up the road from where the passenger had leapt out. Defendant was nowhere to be found. Officers told nearby businesses that they were searching for a suspect on foot in the area. A drug dog sniffed the outside of the car and alerted, indicating the presence of drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">During a search of the car, officers found a variety of evidence, including a methamphetamine pipe and residue, birth certificates with the surnames Isbaldo and Isbaldo, Jr., credit cards bearing the surname Ortiz, Social Security cards with the surnames Pablo and Dos, and several personal documents belonging to Long and to her two children, aged four and six. Those documents included Long\u2019s Social Security card, real estate license, passport, a copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>her birth certificate, both children\u2019s birth certificates and Social Security cards, IRS documents, and check receipts. The police also found a drugstore.com package containing baby-related products, addressed to \u201cMavris\u201d in Crescent City, California. Some papers and a cellular phone belonging to defendant were also discovered in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Early the next morning, and about one-half mile from the car, staff at the Whaleshead Resort found defendant asleep in a company linen van. They notified the police, who then arrested him. Defendant was charged with a number of offenses, including three counts of identity theft relating to the Long family\u2019s documents, and theft by receiving relating to possession of the drugstore.com box addressed to Mavris.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">At trial, Long testified that her home in Fresno, California had been burglarized earlier that year and that the burglar had made away with a safe containing all of the family\u2019s documents that were recovered in the car. Long had filed a police report concerning the burglary. She did not know defendant, and she said that he did not have permission to have their documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">One of the investigating officers, McCourt, had training in identity thefts. He testified that there is a market for Social Security cards and birth certificates, which may be used to create false financial accounts or for other fraudulent purposes. McCourt described the contents of the drugstore.com box as a package with a tracking number, addressed to Mavris in Crescent City. Before resting, the prosecutor reported to the trial court that Mavris was not present to testify as initially planned.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">Defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on the counts involving identity theft. Among other things, he argued that \u201c[t]here\u2019s been no evidence that [defendant] at any time with those identifications made any attempt to use or benefit from those IDs in any manner. [Y]ou have to show some intent to defraud with some type of an act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>by the defendant ***.\u201d The trial court denied the motion. Defendant was convicted of nine counts, including three counts of identity theft and one count of third-degree theft by receiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying his motion for a judgment of acquittal. He argues that \u201cthere is no evidence in the record that defendant had the conscious objective to use the victim\u2019s personal identification in an attempt to mislead another person or to deprive another person of something by fraud or stealth, and reciprocally, to obtain some benefit to which he was not lawfully entitled.\u201d We review the denial of the motion for a judgment of acquittal to determine whether, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the state, a rational factfinder could have found the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">At the time of defendant\u2019s conduct, the statute provided that a person commits the crime of identity theft if \u201cthe person, with the intent to deceive or to defraud, obtains, possesses, transfers, creates, utters or converts to the person\u2019s own use the personal identification of another person.\u201d ORS 165.800(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cIn establishing [an] element, the state may rely on circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Bivins, </em>191 Or App 460, 466, 83 P3d 379 (2004). \u201c[Established facts may support multiple reasonable inferences and, if they do, which inference to draw is for the jury to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">Defendant relies on <em>State v. Martin, </em>243 Or App 528, 534, 260 P3d 197 (2011), for the proposition that a \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s mere possession of [another\u2019s identification card] is not by itself probative of an intent to use the card to deceive or defraud.\u201d <em>See also State v. Cook, </em>265 Or App 506, 513, 335 P3d 846 (2014) (mere possession of a tool consistent with tools used in the commission of burglaries is insufficient to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>support a finding that the defendant intended to use the tool to commit a crime). In <em>Martin, </em>the defendant was arrested and booked for burglary. During an inventory of his personal effects, an officer found an Oregon DMV identification card bearing another individual\u2019s name and photograph. <em>Id. </em>at 530. The defendant claimed that he had found the identification card in a wallet but would not tell officers where he found the wallet or where the wallet was at that time. <em>Id. </em>At trial and again on appeal, defendant argued that his mere possession of someone else\u2019s identity card and his failure to account for the wallet was not sufficient to establish the intent element of the offense. <em>Id. </em>at 533. We reversed the judgment of conviction, explaining that the facts of the case did not \u201crise to the level of an inference beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant intended to use the card to deceive or defraud another at the time that he possessed it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">We distinguished <em>Martin </em>in <em>State v. McAtee, </em>245 Or App 233, 261 P3d 1284 (2011). In that case, a bus passenger observed the defendant \u201crummaging through a bag placed under the seat of the victim, who was sitting in the seat in front of defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 235. During a later search of the defendant, the police found the victim\u2019s identification card and credit card. <em>Id. </em>The defendant admitted to taking the victim\u2019s wallet, keeping the identification card and credit card, and disposing of the wallet and its other contents. <em>Id. </em>The defendant was charged with identity theft. At trial, he moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that there was no evidence to prove that he had the intent to deceive and defraud. The trial court denied the motion. On appeal, we concluded that the defendant\u2019s actions \u2014 going through the victim\u2019s bag to steal her wallet and removing the identification card and credit card from the rest of the wallet \u2014 \u201cshow more than mere possession of items that could be used with criminal intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238. In contrast to <em>Martin, </em>we explained that the defendant\u2019s conduct indicated that he had \u201cmade a deliberate choice to steal and keep only those items that would be useful for identity theft [.]\u201d That conduct permitted a reasonable inference about his intent to deceive or defraud. <em>Id. </em>at 239.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">In this case, there is additional evidence, beyond defendant\u2019s possession of another\u2019s identification card, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>supports the inference that defendant intended to deceive or defraud. First, the quantity and quality of identity-related documents in defendant\u2019s possession far exceeds the evidence at issue in <em>Martin. </em>When the police searched the car that defendant was driving, they discovered that defendant was in possession of many personal identification documents from different individuals, including a passport, credit cards, Social Security cards, and birth certificates. McCourt testified that those documents are consistent with items used to commit identity theft. Defendant inexplicably possessed \u201conly those items that could easily be used to steal another\u2019s identity.\u201d <em>McAtee, </em>245 Or App at 239. Second, similar to <em>McAtee, </em>the counts of identity theft, as alleged in this case, related to items that were reported stolen by the owner. Long testified that the personal identification documents were taken in the course of an earlier burglary. Her stolen documents were then recovered in the car that defendant was driving while eluding police during a high-speed chase. Given that defendant had possession of a number of stolen identity documents of the type that could easily be used to commit identity theft, a jury could reasonably infer that defendant intended to use the documents to deceive or to defraud.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal on the counts involving identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">We turn to defendant\u2019s request that we review, as plain error, the trial court\u2019s failure, sua sponte, to acquit him of theft by receiving. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1); <em>State v. Reynolds, </em>250 Or App 516, 520, 280 P3d 1046, <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 666 (2012). Defendant argues on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to support the conviction for theft by receiving because the record only establishes that defendant possessed a box from drugstore.com addressed to Mavris in Crescent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>City. Defendant contends that there was no evidence that he retained property that he had reason to know was stolen, as required under ORS 164.095.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state responds that there was no plain error, because defendant \u201cwas driving a stolen car with a bag containing a collection of stolen personal identification\u201d and that that evidence could permit a reasonable factfinder to infer that the box, addressed to another individual, was also stolen property. The state adds that, even if there were plain error, we should not exercise our discretion to correct it.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">We may review an unpreserved assignment of error as \u201can error of law apparent on the record\u201d under ORAP 5.45(1) if certain conditions are met: (1) the error is one of law; (2) the error is \u201capparent\u201d \u2014 that is, the legal point is obvious and is not reasonably in dispute; and (3) the error appears \u201con the face of the record\u201d \u2014 that is, \u201c [w] e need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990). Where those conditions are satisfied, \u201cwe must determine whether to exercise our discretion to reach the error and correct it.\u201d <em>Reynolds, </em>250 Or App at 520 (citing <em>Ailes v. Portland Meadows, Inc., </em>312 Or 376, 382, 823 P2d 956 (1991)). Among the factors that we consider in deciding whether to exercise our discretion are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-5\">\u201cthe competing interests of the parties; the nature of the case; the gravity of the error; the ends of justice in the particular case; how the error came to the court\u2019s attention; and whether the polices behind the general rule requiring preservation of error have been served in the case in another way, <em>i.e., </em>whether the trial court was, in some manner, presented with both sides of the issue and given an opportunity to correct any error.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-6\"><em>Ailes, </em>312 Or at 382 n 6. Additionally, we consider \u201cwhether the defendant encouraged the trial court to make the error; whether the defendant made a strategic choice not to object; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>and whether the trial court could have corrected the error if the defendant had raised it below.\u201d <em>State v. Lusk, </em>267 Or App 208, 212, 340 P3d 670 (2014) (citing <em>Reynolds, </em>250 Or App at 521).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Even if we assume that the alleged error is an error of law, we cannot conclude that the error is plain. That is so, because the purported insufficiency of the state\u2019s proof is \u201creasonably in dispute.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>310 Or at 355. It is certainly true that \u201cin a theft prosecution based upon a theory of illegally obtaining or receiving the property of another the state must prove that the property was, in fact, stolen.\u201d <em>State v. Niehuser, </em>21 Or App 33, 37, 533 P2d 834 (1975); <em>see also State v. Harper, </em>244 Or App 10, 15, 260 P3d 596, <em>adh\u2019d to as modified on recons, </em>245 Or App 292, 267 P3d 853 (2011). It is also true that dubious circumstances are not enough to establish that the property is stolen. For instance, in <em>Harper, </em>the victim of a laptop theft did not testify at the defendant\u2019s trial that her laptop had been stolen, and the state did not offer any other admissible evidence establishing that element. Although the defendant had \u201c\u2018good reason to know\u2019\u201d that the laptop had been stolen when he made arrangements to sell it to an undercover agent, it was still \u201cincumbent on the state to prove that the laptop had, in fact, been the subject of theft.\u201d 244 Or App at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">Here, however, there is more. There is defendant\u2019s immediate behavior: Defendant was apprehended after attempting to elude officers. There is the context within which the box was found: The box was found within the stolen car that defendant was driving and the box was found in the car along with a number of stolen documents. Finally, there is the box itself: Like the stolen documents with the names of others, the box was addressed to another name. It was to have been delivered to a \u201cMavris\u201d in Crescent City, and its contents were baby-related products. The circumstances need not be enough to survive a motion for a judgment of acquittal on the charge of theft; rather, the circumstances only need to be enough to permit the state to have made enough of a credible argument such that any error would not be plain. We do not here decide whether the circumstances were sufficient to have sustained a motion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>a judgment of acquittal, but we do conclude, under all the circumstances, that any error was not plain. Therefore, we will not review the final assignment of error regarding the theft conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b591-8\"> On the first day of trial, the prosecutor had indicated to the court that the state intended to call Mavris as a witness the following day but was unsure that he would attend, because \u201c[Mavris] said that he would be able to come, but he\u2014 since then he said he might not be able to make it, so I\u2019m not sure.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-7\"> The statute was amended during the 2013 regular session of the Legislative Assembly. <em>See </em>Or Laws 2013, ch 158, \u00a7 34. That amendment, expanding the definition of \u201canother person,\u201d is not applicable to this case. All subsequent references to ORS 165.800 are to the version in effect at the time of defendant\u2019s conduct in 2012.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b594-5\"> We have explained that, in identity theft cases, there is sufficient evidence to establish intent to deceive or defraud where \u201cthe state proved that the defendants had <em>stolen </em>credit cards and other documents, not merely possessed them.\u201d <em>Cook, </em>265 Or App at 511 (emphasis in original). Although the state did not allege or prove that defendant himself stole the documents found in the car, the state did demonstrate that defendant possessed numerous stolen identity documents while fleeing from the police. Therefore, there is a reasonable inference that, however defendant came into possession of Long\u2019s and her children\u2019s documents, he did not do so innocently.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b595-7\"> ORS 164.095 provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-8\">\u201c(1) A person commits theft by receiving if the person receives, retains, conceals or disposes of property of another knowing or having good reason to know that the property was the subject of theft.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
