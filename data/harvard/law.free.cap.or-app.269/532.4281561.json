He raises three assignments of error; we write only to discuss the first two and reject the third without published discussion. Defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion and offer of proof under OEC 412 (evidence of past sexual behavior is inadmissible unless it falls under an exception) to allow evidence of the victim\u2019s prior sexual behavior and nonsexual behavior while intoxicated. In defendant\u2019s view, the proffered evidence was relevant to the state\u2019s basis for the rape charge, which was that the victim was unable to consent to defendant\u2019s penetration of her because she was unconscious or passed out from drinking too much. Specifically, the evidence consisted of testimony from the victim\u2019s friends that related (1) instances in which the victim would get drunk, have sex, and then not remember having done so and (2) other times where the victim would get drunk and then not recall other kinds of conduct not involving sex. For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to allow the evidence of the victim\u2019s prior behavior and, accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">A. <em>Relevant Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">At trial, the victim\u2019s friend, Shannon, described the sexual assault and surrounding circumstances. In July 2011, Shannon and the victim celebrated the victim\u2019s birthday. They drank heavily before visiting some bars in Eugene, where they continued to drink. At about 3:00 a.m., they eventually found their way to the apartment of another friend, Spriggs. Shannon and the victim expected a friend to arrive and take them to another friend\u2019s house, but they fell asleep together on a mattress in the living room. Before they fell asleep, Shannon recalled seeing Spriggs and defendant talking together by a window on the opposite side of the living room. Later, another friend, Jason, arrived, and Shannon woke, noticed that the victim was still sleeping on the mattress, and went to use the bathroom. After five to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>10 minutes, Jason went to the bathroom to alert Shannon that the victim was \u201chaving sex.\u201d Shannon testified that, when she returned to the living room, she observed defendant on top of the victim, penetrating her. Shannon asked defendant whether the victim had \u201c[said he] could do that.\u201d Defendant replied, \u201cUh huh.\u201d Shannon recalled that she was surprised because the victim had indicated when she was sober that she did not want to have sex with defendant. On the other hand, the victim had told Shannon that she wanted to have \u201cbirthday sex.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">Shannon observed that as defendant penetrated the victim, the victim\u2019s eyes were \u201ca little bit open.\u201d Shannon testified that she \u201ccouldn\u2019t honestly say [whether the victim] was sleeping or not\u201d because she had seen the victim look like that before when the victim was awake but drunk. Shannon heard the victim moaning and initially thought that the victim was consenting to defendant\u2019s actions. But believing that the victim would not have had sex with defendant sober, Shannon pulled on the victim\u2019s arm to see if the victim was indeed aware of what was happening to her. The victim did not respond to Shannon pulling her arm. Shannon testified that she did not believe that the victim was asleep or passed out but that the victim was \u201cvery, very out of it.\u201d Shannon went to get Jason and, when they returned, defendant had fled. The victim did not respond when Shannon slapped or lightly tapped the victim\u2019s face. Shannon pulled the victim off the mattress, and the victim stood up, walked into a bedroom, and lay down without talking to Shannon. Shannon then left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Gilhuber, a police officer who had interviewed Shannon over the phone one or two days after the incident, testified to Shannon\u2019s account of events in that interview, which differed in some significant respects from Shannon\u2019s trial testimony. Referring to his report from that interview, Gilhuber testified that Shannon reported that she initially believed that the victim was awake when defendant was penetrating her because the victim was moaning. However, according to Gilhuber\u2019s report, Shannon slapped the victim a couple of times, pulled her arm, and after a closer look, she determined that the victim was passed out because her eyes were closed and she appeared to be sleeping. Gilhuber also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>testified that Shannon also reported having asked defendant, \u201cWhat the f[uc]k are you doing?\u201d After Shannon went to get Jason to help get defendant off of the victim and after defendant had left, according to Gilhuber, Shannon related that she again tried to move the victim, tapped her numerous times, and then, unable to wake her, proceeded to grab her by the ankle and jerk her off the mattress. At that point, the victim awakened slightly to the point where she got herself to the bed and returned to being completely passed out.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Shannon returned the next morning and recounted to the victim what had happened to her the night before. The victim testified that the last things she remembered about the previous evening were eating after leaving the bar and being at Spriggs\u2019s apartment, but after that she was \u201c[j]ust in and out throughout the night.\u201d She further testified that her tampon was missing when she woke up and that something \u201cdidn\u2019t feel right.\u201d She felt sore, as if she had been penetrated. The victim testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-5\">\u201cThen [Shannon] came in and asked me if I remembered what had happened the night before. I told her, no, because I was really drunk and she said, well, me and Jason walked out here and saw [defendant] having sex with you. I looked at her and I said, \u2018What?\u2019 She goes, yes, you were unconscious, [victim], and from there on, I was pretty emotional.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">The victim also testified that she had turned down defendant\u2019s advances before and never told him that he could have sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Shannon and the victim went to the hospital. The sexual assault nurse examiner, Walker, testified that the victim told her that \u201cit didn\u2019t feel right down there indicating it felt like [she] had sex, but that couldn\u2019t be.\u201d Walker also recalled that the victim told her that she did not \u201cremember anything\u201d and said that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-8\">\u201c[the victim] was confused about this and then later in the morning another friend told her that she had come from one of the bedrooms and saw [defendant] \u2018fucking me while I was asleep.\u2019 Then she reports a friend said, [\u2018W]hat are you doing? Stop. [\u2019] Then tried to wake other people in the household up but when they wouldn\u2019t wake up, her friend left and came back this morning and told me about it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>Walker performed a physical examination, and observed that the victim\u2019s genital area was tender and painful. Additionally, the victim\u2019s tampon was pushed up against the cervix, which had redness. Walker had to remove the tampon with forceps. Defendant stipulated to the results from the rape kit that conclusively established his DNA from spermatozoa.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">The state emphasized in its closing argument that, before the assault, there had been no sign that the victim wanted to have sex with defendant and that Shannon reacted the way she did, under both versions of her story, because she knew that the victim had previously indicated that she did not want to have sex with defendant. The state also characterized its case against defendant as primarily relying on Shannon\u2019s personal observations of the nonconsensual nature of the assault, rather than on the victim\u2019s inability to remember the assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">B. <em>Defendant\u2019s offer of proof</em></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Defendant moved before trial to offer evidence of the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior, specifically that the victim had \u201cengaged in sexual behavior with other men after drinking, and later claimed not to recall that sexual behavior.\u201d A victim\u2019s past sexual behavior is ordinarily not admissible under OEC 412 unless it falls under one of the exceptions provided by that rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In defendant\u2019s view, the evidence was</p>\n<p id=\"b558-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>\u201cnecessary and admissible as it relates to the impeachment of [the victim], and to explain or rebut evidence offered by the state to support its case against *** defendant. Such evidence is also constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d In his offer of proof, defendant did not concede that the evidence was subject to OEC 412. Before trial, the trial court held an <em>in camera </em>hearing in which Shannon and Spriggs testified for defendant\u2019s offer of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">1. <em>Shannon\u2019s offer of proof testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">Shannon testified that, on her seventeenth birthday, the victim was drunk and \u201cwas kind of hitting on some people\u201d and \u201cshe was all over guys. We have videotape of it. Her dancing on guys, to a song.\u201d At the party they attended, the victim went into a back room with a man, and, when Shannon questioned her about it, the victim \u201clike kind of swatted [Shannon] away.\u201d Shannon remembered that the victim \u201cdidn\u2019t want me to stop it, so I just left.\u201d Shannon testified that, when she asked the victim about it the next morning, the victim said that she did not remember their exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Shannon recalled another incident that she did not personally observe but was aware of because it was \u201ca well known story amongst her friends.\u201d The story was that the victim went to a house with three men, awoke the next morning in some bushes in Washington Park, and could not remember how she ended up there.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">2. <em>Spriggs\u2019s offer of proof testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">When defendant asked Spriggs if she \u201crecalled a specific instance where [she] observed [the victim] engage in sexual behavior where [the victim] subsequently did not recall [the sexual behavior],\u201d Spriggs replied that one night she had observed the victim at Spriggs\u2019s apartment interacting with a man. She described the victim as \u201c[j]ust all in his face, up on him, drunk, you know?\u201d and \u201c[s]miling in his face, hugging on him * * * how a drunk girl would act, how your ideal drunk girl would act.\u201d Both the man and the victim \u201cwere grabbing each other\u201d in a way that looked sexual. Spriggs stated that the victim and the man were in the bathroom together for some period of time, but she did not actually see what occurred in the bathroom. The victim told <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>Spriggs the next day that she could not remember being in the bathroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Spriggs testified about the victim\u2019s conduct generally in which she observed \u201c[mjaybe not full on sex, but I know she\u2019s \u2014 you know \u2014 went home from the bar drunk with guys, lots of guys, you know? I mean, I wasn\u2019t there obviously because we separated our ways after the bar[.]\u201d When questioned whether Spriggs had observed the victim go home with a man after witnessing \u201ctouching or kissing,\u201d she replied that she had. Spriggs added that sometimes the victim would remember having sex with the men and \u201c [o]ther times, she\u2019d be like, I don\u2019t really remember.\u201d Spriggs stated that she had \u201cwalked in\u201d on the victim but never personally observed the victim having sex with the men.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Defendant questioned Spriggs about instances of the victim not remembering engaging in nonsexual behavior and she replied that the victim had gotten drunk and \u201cflipp [ed] out on everybody, like my siblings, when we all stay together\u201d or \u201ckick[ed] a cop in the face * * *. Her blacking out[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">C. <em>Offer of proof arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Defendant first argued that the evidence was not covered by OEC 412 because the evidence offered did not concern sexual behavior but rather the victim\u2019s pattern of failing to remember her sexual behavior. He also contended that Spriggs\u2019s and Shannon\u2019s testimony should be admitted as \u201cconstitutionally required\u201d because it was exculpatory, given that the offered testimony \u2014 evidence of forgotten volitional intercourse while drunk- \u2014 was similar to the alleged conduct. In other words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-8\">\u201cspecific instances that the witnesses have mentioned are constitutionally required given their strong similarity to what the Defense is alleging happened in this instance, engaging in *** sexualized behavior, either touching or grabbing, the witnesses described as being \u2018all up in their face.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-9\">\u201cThat is very similar to what the Defense is intending to argue occurred in this case; and given that, it is exculpatory. It tends to show that the *** alleged victim is capable of acting in these ways and then not recalling it after the fact.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>\u201cI think the key part here is \u2014 there\u2019s an inference that\u2019s drawn by a jury from someone not recalling something afterwards. The inference being that they weren\u2019t awake or they weren\u2019t conscious.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">The state argued that the offered evidence was \u201cclassic rape shield evidence\u201d and therefore inadmissible under OEC 412. In other words, according to the state, the evidence was offered to show that, \u201cif [the victim] was doing it with all those other men, she must have consented to having sex with [defendant ***.\u201d Also, in the state\u2019s view, the evidence did not fall under the \u201cconstitutionally required\u201d exception of OEC 412 because it was not relevant: \u201cThe victim is going to testify that she was drunk and doesn\u2019t remember what happened, so there\u2019s no relevance that [defendant needs to have this other testimony that she gets drunk all the time and doesn\u2019t remember it because she is going to admit it.\u201d The state posited as well that the evidence was inadmissible OEC 404 character evidence: \u201cThe [d]efense *** can\u2019t argue that since she had sex with men on a bunch of other occasions, she also must have consented to having sex with [defendant in this particular case.\u201d The state added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-5\">\u201c[Shannon] never saw the victim talking or walking and so she\u2019s not going to testify that the victim, in fact, consented, so where is the evidence of consent going to be? It comes from this implication that she is a slut with these other men, so she must have consented with the Defendant on this particular occasion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">The state also contended that the evidence was unduly prejudicial under OEC 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion \u201cto allow in the 412 evidence.\u201d When defendant asked the court to clarify whether nonsexual evidence would be allowed, the court replied that the evidence was excluded for the reasons urged by the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-10\">Defendant\u2019s arguments, reprised on appeal, are summarized as follows: (1) The proffered evidence was relevant because the state, relied on the victim\u2019s lack of memory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>of defendant penetrating her to support its contention that the victim was unconscious at the time; (2) the proffered evidence was not subject to OEC 412 because it was not evidence of \u201cprior sexual behavior\u201d within the meaning of the rule; (3) even if subject to OEC 412, the evidence falls within the exception provided in OEC 412 (2) (b) because it is \u201cotherwise constitutionally required to be admitted\u201d; and (4) if the evidence does fall into the OEC 412(2)(b) exception, its probative value is not substantially outweighed by unfair prejudice to the state. The state responds that the proffered evidence was too vague to be helpful or concerned conduct inapposite to the circumstances of the crime in this case. Even if relevant, in the state\u2019s view, the marginal relevance of the evidence is outweighed by the state\u2019s interest in shielding the victim from disclosure of past sexual conduct. Moreover, the state contends, the evidence is unduly prejudicial under OEC 403 because it would have confused the issues or misled the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In determining whether evidence is admissible in an <em>in camera </em>hearing under OEC 412(4), the trial court first decides whether the evidence is relevant. Evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d OEC 401. \u201cOEC 401 establishes a \u2018very low threshold\u2019 for the admission of evidence; evidence is relevant so long as it increases or decreases, even slightly, the probability of the existence of a fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action.\u201d <em>State v. Barone, </em>329 Or 210, 238, 986 P2d 5 (1999), <em>cert den, </em>528 US 1086 (2000) (quoting <em>State v. Hampton, </em>317 Or 251, 255 n 8, 855 P2d 621 (1993)). We review the court\u2019s relevance determination for legal error. <em>Id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Defendant contends that the proffered evidence is relevant because the jury could draw an inference that the victim was unconscious because she could not remember what occurred. Defendant\u2019s proffered evidence of situations when the victim had drunk heavily and did not remember events that occurred when she was conscious counters that possible inference, decreasing the likelihood that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>was unconscious in this case. And to the extent that the victim\u2019s inability to remember the previous night\u2019s events makes it slightly more likely that she was unconscious, the evidence is relevant. Its relevance, as will be explained, is marginal considering the facts of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">A part of defendant\u2019s proffered evidence, however, is not relevant: Spriggs\u2019s testimony of the \u201cwell known story amongst her friends that the victim went to a house with three men and ended up in the bushes.\u201d Defendant\u2019s stated purpose for the proffered evidence is to provide examples of the victim\u2019s forgotten conscious and consensual conduct. However, Spriggs\u2019s testimony does not describe the victim as being either conscious or consenting to whatever may have occurred before waking up in Washington Park. Accordingly, it neither increases nor decreases the probability of the victim\u2019s consent in this case and, thus, is not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Before we review whether the remaining evidence should have been admitted under the exception provided under OEC 412(2), we address the proffered Spriggs testimony that described the victim getting drunk and exhibiting nonsexual behavior that she did not remember, namely, that the victim was \u201cflipping out on everybody\u201d and \u201ckicked a cop in the face.\u201d The state argues that all of the evidence created a danger of confusing the issues and misleading the jury and was therefore subject to a determination by the trial court \u2014 reviewed for abuse of discretion \u2014 as inadmissible under OEC 403. <em>See State v. Titus, </em>328 Or 475, 481, 982 P2d 1133 (1999) (a trial court\u2019s OEC 403 ruling is reviewed for abuse of discretion). We note here the dissimilarity of the nonsexual conduct at issue \u2014 assailing a police officer and \u201cflipping out,\u201d which is highly charged confrontational behavior \u2014 and the victim\u2019s state during the assault in this case, which at most, according to Shannon\u2019s trial testimony but not her initial account, consisted of half-opened eyes and some moaning. Given the marginal relevance of the proffered testimony and its dissimilarity to the assault in this case, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that the nonsexual evidence was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">We turn next to the admissibility of the remainder of the proffered evidence under OEC 412. The admissibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>of evidence under OEC 412 is determined by employing the following inquiry:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">\u201cFirst, the court determines whether the evidence concerns a victim\u2019s past sexual behavior; if it is does not, OEC 412 does not apply. If the evidence does concern the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior, the trial court determines whether it is offered in the form of opinion or reputation evidence; if it is, the court must deny admission. OEC 412(1).[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] If it is offered in some other form, the trial court must determine as a matter of law whether the purpose of the offer fits within one of the exceptions in OEC 412(2)(b); if it does not, again, the trial court must deny admission. Finally, if the evidence fits within an exception, the court must balance the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-5\"><em>State v. Fowler, </em>225 Or App 187, 192-93, 200 P3d 591, <em>rev den, </em>346 Or 257 (2009) (citations omitted). In <em>State v. Wright, </em>97 Or App 401, 406, 776 P2d 1294, <em>rev den, </em>308 Or 593 (1989), we defined \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">\u201ca volitional or non-volitional physical act that the victim has performed for the purpose of the sexual stimulation or gratification of either the victim or another person or an act that is sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse or sexual contact, or an attempt to engage in such an act, between the victim and another person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">OEC 412 is meant to \u201cprotect victims of sexual crimes from degrading or embarrassing disclosure of intimate details about their private lives\u201d and to \u201cencourage victims of sexual misconduct to report and assist in the prosecution of the crime by preventing highly prejudicial evidence from reaching the jury and thus helping to protect jury impartiality.\u201d <em>State v. Lajoie, </em>316 Or 63, 69, 849 P2d 479 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Defendant first argues that OEC 412 is not applicable because the proffered evidence does not concern the victim\u2019s past sexual behavior. The crux of his argument is that the proffered evidence only indirectly relates to sexual contact or gratification. He cites <em>State v. Weeks, </em>99 Or App 287, 782 P2d 430 (1989), <em>rev den, </em>309 Or 334 (1990), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>and <em>State v. LeClair, </em>83 Or App 121, 730 P2d 609 (1986), <em>rev den, </em>303 Or 74 (1987), in support of that argument. In <em>Weeks, </em>we concluded that evidence that one of the victims of attempted sexual abuse, a 10-year-old, had asked a five-year-old to pull down the pants of his three-year-old brother and play with the younger brother\u2019s genitals, was not evidence of past sexual behavior. 99 Or App at 290. We reasoned that the evidence did not satisfy our definition of past sexual behavior provided in <em>Wright </em>because the victim \u201cdid not perform any physical act for the purpose of sexual stimulation or gratification of herself or another person.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>LeClair, </em>we concluded that evidence of \u201cprevious false accusations by an alleged victim is not evidence of past sexual behavior within the meaning of the Rape Shield Law, and, therefore, is not inadmissible under OEC 412.\u201d 83 Or App at 126-27 (emphasis omitted). According to defendant, <em>Weeks </em>and <em>LeClair </em>\u201cmake clear\u201d that \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d means actual physical acts done for sexual gratification and that, in this case, some of the proffered evidence involved acts\u2014 namely, \u201chitting on guys\u201d and \u201ckissing and hugging guys\u201d\u2014 that inferentially suggested that the victim was motivated by a sexual objective but were neither \u201csexual contact\u201d nor \u201csexual conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument is not well taken. Shannon\u2019s testimony that the victim was \u201call over\u201d or \u201chitting on\u201d men at Shannon\u2019s birthday party preceded her account that the victim went into a room with a man and that she interrupted their sexual encounter. Moreover, Spriggs testified that, after the victim was \u201call in [a man\u2019s] face\u201d and \u201chugging on\u201d the man in Spriggs\u2019s apartment, the victim and the man went into the bathroom together. To suggest, as defendant does, that, because Spriggs did not personally observe what occurred in the bathroom, that testimony does not qualify as sexual contact because the contact must be inferred, is at odds with the clear implication that the victim engaged in sexual conduct; indeed, Spriggs described the bathroom encounter when asked by defendant if she had observed the victim \u201cengage in sexual behavior.\u201d It is also at odds with defendant\u2019s argument that the purpose of the proffered evidence was to show that the victim \u201chad a recent history of consciously engaging in volitional sexualized behavior while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>intoxicated.\u201d Indeed, the gravamen of the proffered evidence was to demonstrate that the victim engaged in consensual sex while drunk and later did not remember, which, according to defendant, would make it less likely that she did not consent to the sexual contact at issue. We therefore conclude that the remaining proffered evidence that is relevant or not prejudicial properly falls within the meaning of \u201cpast sexual behavior\u201d for purposes of OEC 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">We must next determine whether the proffered evidence falls within one of OEC 412\u2019s exceptions \u2014 namely, the exception argued by defendant, which is that the evidence of past sexual behavior is \u201cotherwise constitutionally required to be admitted.\u201d OEC 412(2)(b)(C). The constitutional rights asserted by defendant are the rights to confrontation conferred by Article I, section 11, of the Oregon Constitution and the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Included in those rights, according to defendant, is the right to impeach the victim\u2019s testimony that \u201cshe was unconscious during the intercourse with defendant, because she does not remember the event.\u201d Defendant relies on <em>State v. Herrera, </em>286 Or 349, 353-54, 594 P2d 823 (1979), which explains that the confrontation right protects a defendant\u2019s right to cross-examination in order to test the witness\u2019s \u201csincerity, memory, ability to perceive and relate, and the factual basis of his statements\u201d and to allow him to show \u201cthe witness\u2019s demeanor when confronted by the defendant so that the credibility of the witness is displayed in the courtroom.\u201d Furthermore, defendant notes that we have held that the right to confrontation \u201c\u2018tips the scales\u2019 in permitting cross-examination if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>could reasonably be expected to have an effect on the jury,\u201d <em>LeClair, </em>83 Or App at 129 (quoting <em>Hughes v. Rainer, </em>641 F2d 790, 792 (7th Cir 1981)), but acknowledges that the right is limited \u201cwhen the probative value of the evidence that the defendant seeks to elicit is <em>substantially </em>outweighed by the risk of prejudice, confusion, embarrassment or delay.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Thus, in defendant\u2019s view, his right to confront the victim includes the right to impeach her testimony with evidence that \u201cshe has a history of forgetting or \u2018blacking out\u2019 memories of consensual volitional sexual conduct [that] would provide the jury with substantial reason to conclude that [the victim\u2019s] memory loss indicates nothing about whether she was unconscious, and therefore reasonable doubt as to whether the state proved that element of the offense.\u201d The state responds that its interest in shielding the victim from inquiry about her prior sexual behavior \u201cfar exceeded [the proffered evidence\u2019s] minimal probative value.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state does not contend that the evidence does not fall within the constitutional right asserted by defendant but instead claims that the prejudicial effect outweighs its probative value.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">We agree with the state. That is so because the victim\u2019s conduct preceding the assault in this case has scant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>similarity to the proffered conduct described by Shannon and Spriggs. The trial testimony did not include any observation that the victim had made sexual advances of any kind toward defendant. To the contrary, both the victim and Shannon testified that the victim had refused defendant\u2019s previous requests for sex. When the victim passed out, defendant was talking with Spriggs. Shannon also testified that, when Jason woke her, she saw that the victim was sleeping. No one saw the victim interact with defendant. That evidence stands in stark contrast to the proffered evidence, which includes examples of the victim clearly demonstrating her attraction to certain men (the victim was \u201chitting on,\u201d \u201call over,\u201d \u201cdancing on,\u201d \u201cup on,\u201d and \u201chugging on\u201d guys). Additionally, Shannon provided an example of when she interrupted the victim during a sexual encounter and the victim demonstrably resisted \u2014 \u201cswatted *** away\u201d\u2014 Shannon\u2019s interruption. That reaction is the opposite of the victim\u2019s utter failure to respond when Shannon tapped her face and pulled her arm while defendant penetrated her.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">The proffered evidence clearly is the type of evidence that would have the prejudicial effect \u2014 \u201cdegrading or embarrassing disclosure of intimate details about [victims\u2019] private lives,\u201d <em>Lajoie, </em>316 Or at 69 \u2014 for which OEC 412 is intended to protect victims of sexual abuse. With the dissimilarity of the proffered descriptions of the victim\u2019s conduct and the description of the victim\u2019s behavior the night of the assault in mind, we conclude that the prejudicial effect of the proffered testimony outweighs its probative value, which in this case, is not significant in light of the trial evidence, the bulk of which consisted of the state\u2019s adduction of an eyewitness\u2019s accounts of the assault and medical evidence.

Indeed, the state\u2019s case primarily depended on Shannon\u2019s eyewitness accounts of the assault and the results of the victim\u2019s physical examination performed by Walker. Constitutional necessity arises in the context of the right to cross-examine the victim and impeach her testimony. <em>Herrera, </em>286 Or at 353-54. But the evidence at issue here does not appear to address the victim\u2019s testimony; rather, it seeks to contradict an inference that would be drawn from it.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
