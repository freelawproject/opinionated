The conviction is based on two incidents in which a dog owned by defendant\u2019s live-in boyfriend bit defendant\u2019s daughter.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant argues that the trial court erred in denying her motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) because the state proffered insufficient evidence to support the inference that she \u201cintentionally or knowingly * * * cause [d] physical injury\u201d to her daughter, as required for conviction under ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A). The state responds that a rational factfinder could infer from the dog\u2019s history of biting children that defendant knew that the dog had the \u201cpropensity to bite\u201d and that this permits an inference that defendant violated the statute when she knowingly failed to keep her daughter away from the dog. We conclude that ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A) requires proof that a defendant knowingly engaged in assaultive conduct. Because the evidence does not permit this inference, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">We begin by describing the events giving rise to the conviction in the light most favorable to the state. <em>See, e.g., State v. Turley, </em>202 Or App 40, 48, 120 P3d 1229 (2005), <em>rev den, </em>340 Or 157 (2006) (describing the standard by which we review the denial of an MJOA). Defendant lived in a small motor home with her boyfriend, her 10-year-old daughter (V) from a prior relationship, and the boyfriend\u2019s dog. The boyfriend\u2019s three-year-old son (E) from a prior relationship also stayed with them at times.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Both of the bite incidents upon which the conviction is based occurred during the summer of 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the first charged incident, V was petting the dog while it slept. After about five to 10 minutes, the dog woke up and bit V on the neck, leaving two bleeding puncture wounds. The wounds bled for at least 30 minutes and one left a scar. Defendant and her boyfriend were both asleep when the incident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>The second charged incident occurred as the dog and V rode together in the back seat of a car, with defendant and her boyfriend in the front. V was petting the dog when it suddenly turned and bit the right side of V\u2019s face, scratching her nose and cheek and splitting open her lip, which required three stitches to close. Defendant instructed V to lie to the doctor about how the injury occurred. Prior to those charged incidents and during that same summer, the dog also had bitten E on the face, requiring 12 stitches, after he apparently had provoked the dog, and bitten V once on the arm after she accidentally stepped on its tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Defendant was convicted following a trial to the court on two counts of first-degree criminal mistreatment under ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> after unsuccessfully moving for a judgment of acquittal. In opposing defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal, the state argued below: \u201c[A]fter two bites, not one, but two bites and one being a very, very, very significant life scarring injury to \u2014 to a young child [, defendant] knows that [the] dog has a propensity to bite.\u201d The trial court agreed that this \u201cknowledge\u201d was sufficient for a conviction of first-degree criminal mistreatment, ORS 163.205(1)(b)(A), and denied defendant\u2019s motion. On appeal, defendant renews her argument that the state\u2019s evidence does not permit an inference that defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d caused the injuries to her daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">At the outset, we address defendant\u2019s argument that the charges of first-degree criminal mistreatment under ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A) required the state to prove that defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d caused the injuries to her daughter. As to those charges, the indictment alleges that defendant, \u201chaving assumed the permanent or temporary care, custody or responsibility for the supervision of [V], a dependent child, did unlawfully and knowingly cause physical injury or injury to the said victim.\u201d The pertinent portions of ORS 163.205 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">\u201c(1) A person commits the crime of criminal mistreatment in the first degree if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>\u201c(b) The person, in violation of a legal duty to provide care for a dependent person or elderly person, or having assumed the permanent or temporary care, custody or responsibility for the supervision of a dependent person or elderly person, intentionally or knowingly:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">\u201c(A) Causes physical injury or injuries to the dependent person or elderly person [.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">In determining the meaning of the statute, we give primary weight to the text and context. <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171, 206 P3d 1042 (2009). Here, the grammatical structure of ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A), which places the modifier \u201cknowingly\u201d immediately before the element \u201c[clauses physical injury[,]\u201d supports defendant\u2019s argument that the mental state \u201cknowingly\u201d applies to the element \u201c[clauses physical injury [.]\u201d Indeed, that is the meaning we drew from a nearly identical grammatical structure in <em>State v. Schodrow, </em>187 Or App 224, 66 P3d 547 (2003). We held in <em>Schodrow </em>that the grammatical structure of ORS 166.250(l)(a), which makes it a crime to \u201cknowingly: (a) Carr[y] any firearm concealed upon the person,\u201d left \u201cno doubt that the prescribed culpable mental state \u2014 knowingly\u2014attaches to that element\u201d of \u201ccarrying any firearm [,]\u201d and applies both to the act of \u201ccarrying\u201d and to awareness that the object carried is a \u201cfirearm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 229-30; <em>see also State v. Christian, </em>354 Or 22, 28, 307 P3d 429 (2013) (\u201cA grammatical reading of the ordinance [restricting the carrying of firearms] is that \u2018recklessly,\u2019 an adverb, modifies the phrase that immediately follows it.\u201d); <em>Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 132, 46 P3d 729 (2002) (in antistalking statute, placement of adverbs \u201cintentionally,\u201d \u201cknowingly,\u201d and \u201crecklessly\u201d immediately before the verb \u201cengaged\u201d demonstrated that the adverbs modified the verb). Here, too, the grammatical structure chosen by the legislature leaves no doubt that the mental state \u201cknowingly\u201d is intended to modify the element it precedes: \u201c[clauses physical injury or injuries[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">Our determination as to the meaning of the statute, however, does not fully address what the state must prove for a conviction under ORS 163.205(l)(b)(A). For that question, defendant points us to <em>State v. Barnes, </em>329 Or 327, 986 P2d 1160 (1999), and to <em>State v. Jantzi, </em>56 Or App 57, 641 P2d 62 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>(1982), <em>overruled on other grounds as recognized in State v. McNair, </em>179 Or App 308, 315, 39 P3d 284 (2002). In <em>Barnes, </em>the Supreme Court examined what it means to \u201cknowingly\u201d cause injury in the context of the crime of second-degree assault, a statute that, similarly, requires that a defendant \u201c\u2018intentionally or knowingly cause[] *** physical injury[.]\u2019\u201d 329 Or at 330 (quoting ORS 163.175(l)(a)). The court emphasized that ORS 161.085(8) defines \u201c[k]nowingly\u201d as generally meaning that a person \u201cacts with an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists,\u201d without reference to awareness of a particular result. <em>Id. </em>at 337. Thus, the court concluded, to prove that a defendant knowingly caused serious physical injury, the state needed to prove that the defendant was \u201caware of the assaultive nature of his conduct\u201d but not that he was aware that his conduct would cause serious physical injury. <em>Id. </em>at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The state agrees that \u201cknowingly\u201d is defined as acting \u201cwith an awareness that the conduct of the person is of a nature so described or that a circumstance so described exists.\u201d ORS 161.085(8). The state also agrees that, under <em>Barnes, </em>proving that a defendant knowingly caused serious physical injury means proving that the defendant was \u201caware of the assaultive nature of his conduct [.]\u201d 329 Or at 338. The state, nevertheless, disputes defendant\u2019s contention that \u201c[k]eeping a dog that has a history of biting children in proximity to a child is not an assaultive act[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">According to the state, it is an assaultive act because (1) \u201cconduct\u201d that can be engaged in \u201cknowingly\u201d includes both \u201can act or omission\u201d;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (2) an \u201comission\u201d includes \u201cfailure to perform an act the performance of which is required by law\u201d;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and (3) \u201cfailure to perform\u201d the \u201clegal duty to provide care for a dependent\u201d is \u201cexactly what the criminal mistreatment statute is concerned with[.]\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201cGiven that,\u201d the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>reasons, \u201cthe trial court correctly concluded that defendant\u2019s awareness that her failure to remove a dangerous dog from the residence would cause physical injury to her dependent here could give rise to criminal liability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Even if we accept the state\u2019s argument that defendant\u2019s omission (\u201cfailure to remove a dangerous dog\u201d) can constitute a knowingly assaultive act,* <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the evidence does not permit an inference that defendant knew her omission was of an \u201cassaultive nature.\u201d <em>Barnes </em>does not illuminate what it means to know that one\u2019s conduct is of an \u201cassaultive nature,\u201d because there was no basis for dispute that the conduct of the defendant in <em>Barnes </em>\u2014 punching a security officer in the eye \u2014 was assaultive in nature. <em>See </em>329 Or at 329-30. Unlike the conduct in <em>Barnes, </em>defendant\u2019s conduct was not of a classically \u201cassaultive nature\u201d; rather than directly inflicting injury on V, defendant exposed V to the dog, an intervening actor, and the dog inflicted the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We agree with defendant that <em>Jantzi </em>offers some guidance for analyzing this case. The defendant in <em>Jantzi </em>hid in the bushes holding a knife he had used to slash the victim\u2019s tires and, when the victim jumped on top of the defendant, they rolled over in such a way that the victim was stabbed in the abdomen. 56 Or App at 59. The trial judge, who was the factfinder, believed that the defendant did not intend to stab the victim but reasoned that the defendant, nonetheless, \u201cknowingly\u201d caused the injury \u2014 as required for charge of second degree assault \u2014 because he knew he had a dangerous weapon and that a confrontation was going to occur. <em>Id. </em>at 61. We held that the court\u2019s findings did not permit conviction for a \u201cknowing\u201d assault, because \u201ca person who \u2018is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk\u2019 that an injury will occur acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>\u2018recklessly,\u2019 not \u2018knowingly[,]\u2019\u201d as those mental states are defined in ORS 161.085. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Defendant argues that, as in <em>Jantzi, </em>the evidence establishes at most that, in failing to remove the dog from the residence, she \u201c\u2018recklessly,\u2019 not \u2018knowingly\u2019\u201d caused the injuries to V. Because the second charged incident presents the closer question, we start by considering the evidence of defendant\u2019s knowledge at the time of that incident in the light most favorable to the state. <em>See Turley, </em>202 Or App at 48. By the time defendant allowed the dog to ride with V in the back seat of the car, defendant knew that the dog had bitten three-year-old E on the face so severely that he received 12 stitches. She also knew that the dog had twice bitten V: once on the arm after she accidentally stepped on his tail and once on the neck when she petted him while he was sleeping. Defendant knew that the first bite to V caused bruising and that the second bite caused two puncture wounds that bled for at least 30 minutes. She also believed that V should not have unsupervised contact with the dog, but she ignored those rules, in part \u2014 the state acknowledges \u2014 because V \u201cliked [the dog] and was not scared of him[.]\u201d Finally, the state argues that defendant\u2019s instruction to V to lie about how she hurt her face is additional evidence that defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d caused the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">We respectfully disagree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the evidence permits a finding defendant knowingly caused the injuries to V. Even if the state were correct that the evidence permits an inference that \u201cdefendant <em>knew </em>that [the dog] would bite [V] again[,]\u201d (emphasis added), the inference describes at most a kind of awareness of unjustified risk that, as <em>Jantzi </em>emphasizes, establishes a \u201creckless\u201d mental state. 56 Or App at 61. To prove that defendant <em>knew </em>her conduct was assaultive, the state would have needed evidence that defendant knowingly used the dog to engage in assaultive conduct. For example, in <em>State v. Martin, </em>240 Or App 357, 246 P3d 506, <em>rev den, </em>350 Or 530 (2011), the defendant was convicted of second-degree assault after he commanded his dog to attack two victims in his yard. We held that evidence of a recent incident in which the dog had also attacked on the defendant\u2019s command was relevant to prove that the defendant knew his command would cause the dog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>to attack. <em>Id. </em>at 361. <em>Martin </em>illustrates the type of scienter necessary to constitute a \u201cknowing\u201d assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">Nothing about the history of the dog here \u2014 a bite to a three-year-old, a bite to V when she stepped on the dog\u2019s tail, and a bite to V when she was alone with the dog and disturbed his sleep \u2014 permits an inference that defendant knowingly engaged in assaultive conduct or acted with an awareness that she was assaulting when she allowed the dog and V to ride together in the car.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nor does defendant\u2019s desire to conceal the circumstances of the bite suggest an admission that she knew beforehand that her conduct was assaultive, rather than a fear of the many adverse consequences that could be expected to follow regardless of whether defendant acted knowingly. We in no way minimize or excuse defendant\u2019s conduct. As we have emphasized, the evidence may permit an inference that defendant committed a crime involving a reckless mental state. The indictment, however, charges defendant with a crime that requires proof that she \u201cknowingly\u201d engaged in assaultive conduct. The evidence is insufficient to show that defendant knowingly caused V\u2019s injuries on either charged occasion, and the conviction must be reversed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b417-7\"> The boyfriend, Faill, was also charged and convicted of the same two counts after a consolidated bench trial.
