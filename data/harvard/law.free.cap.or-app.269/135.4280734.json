J.</author>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">This appeal requires us to decide whether Ballot Measure 73 (2010),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which created enhanced penalties for some repeat sex offenders and intoxicated drivers, was submitted to the voters for their approval in violation of the single-subject requirement of Article IV, section l(2)(d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Oregon Constitution. We conclude that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">The issue comes to us by way of a criminal appeal. Defendant was charged with, and convicted of, driving under the influence of intoxicants (DUII).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>already had two DUII convictions, the offense was treated as a Class C felony under section 3 of Measure 73, codified at ORS 813.011. Before trial, defendant objected to the application of Measure 73 to his case, arguing that the measure was invalid on the ground that it \u201cviolate [d] the \u2018single subject\u2019 rule of the Oregon Constitution.\u201d The trial court disagreed and, after defendant was convicted again of DUII, sentenced him in accordance with the requirements of section 3 of Measure 73, that is, ORS 813.Oil.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On appeal, defendant renews his argument that Measure 73 was submitted to the voters in violation of the Article IV, section l(2)(d), single-subject requirement. He requests that we invalidate the measure on that ground, \u201creverse his conviction for felony DUII[,] and remand for entry of a judgment convicting him of misdemeanor DUII and for resentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">We review for legal error a trial court\u2019s ruling regarding an initiative measure\u2019s compliance with the single-subject requirement of Article IV, section l(2)(d). <em>See State ex rel Caleb v. Beesley, </em>326 Or 83, 87-93, 949 P2d 724 (1997) <em>{Caleb) </em>(applying that standard). Here, the trial court did not err when it concluded that Measure 73 satisfies the Article IV, section l(2)(d), single-subject rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Oregon Constitution contains two \u201csingle-subject rules\u201d: one for legislative acts, codified at Article IV, section 20; and one for initiative measures, codified at Article IV, section l(2)(d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The text of those provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>nearly mirror one another; the single-subject rule for legislative acts mandates that \u201c[e]very Act <em>shall embrace but one subject, and matters properly connected therewith\u201d </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 20 (emphasis added), while the rule for initiative measures requires that \u201c[a] proposed law or amendment to the Constitution <em>shall embrace one subject only and matters properly connected therewith\u201d </em>Or Const, Art IV, \u00a7 l(2)(d) (emphasis added). Both provisions are aimed at the prevention of \u201clogrolling,\u201d or</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">\u201c\u2018the practice of inserting in one bill two or more unrelated provisions so that those favoring one provision could be compelled, in order to secure its adoption, to combine with those favoring another provision, and by this process of log-rolling the adoption of both provisions could be accomplished, when neither, if standing alone, could succeed on its own merits.\u2019\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-5\"><em>Lowe v. Keisling, </em>130 Or App 1,8-9, 882 P2d 91 (1994), <em>rev dismissed, </em>320 Or 570 (1995) (quoting <em>Lovejoy v. Portland, </em>95 Or 459, 465, 188 P 207 (1920)).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Although the two provisions are worded differently, the Supreme Court has held that they \u201cshould be given the same meaning,\u201d <em>OEA v. Phillips, </em>302 Or 87, 93, 727 P2d 602 (1986), and has adopted a two-part framework for evaluating whether a proposed law or constitutional amendment embraces only a single \u201csubject\u201d for purposes of Article IV, section l(2)(d). <em>See Caleb, </em>326 Or at 93 (case law interpreting both Article IV, section 20, and Article IV, section l(2)(d) is relevant to the analysis). Under that framework, a reviewing court asks whether it can discern a \u201cunifying principle logically connecting all provisions\u201d in the measure, such that it can be said that the measure embraces a single subject. <em>See Mclntire v. Forbes, </em>322 Or 426, 443-44, 909 P2d 846 (1996); <em>see also Caleb, </em>326 Or at 91. If the court cannot identify a logical unifying principle, the measure embraces more than one subject in violation of the single-subject rule, and the court\u2019s inquiry ends. <em>See OEA, </em>302 Or at 100. If it can, then the court examines whether any \u201cother matters\u201d contained in the measure are \u201cproperly connected\u201d to the unifying principle identified by the court. <em>See </em>id.; <em>see also Caleb, </em>326 Or at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>That standard typically is satisfied so long as a proposed law or amendment addresses a single substantive area of law, even if it \u201cinclud[es] a wide range of connected matters intended to accomplish the goal of that single subject.\u201d <em>Caleb, </em>326 Or at 91. Two Supreme Court decisions involving laws in the substantive area of criminal law illustrate that point. In <em>State v. Fugate, </em>332 Or 195, 204, 26 P3d 802 (2001), the law at issue, Senate Bill (SB) 936 (1997), effected substantive legislative change in five distinct ways: (1) \u201cdirectly provid [ing] various specific rights to crime victims\u201d (in sections 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, and part of section 20); (2) \u201cdealing] at various levels with the admissibility of evidence in criminal trials\u201d (in sections 1, 22, 29, and 37); (3) \u201cdeal[ing] with release criteria respecting those accused of crimes\u201d (sections 18 and 19, and the remainder of section 20); (4) \u201caddressing] criminal sentencing and orders for restitution\u201d (in sections 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 26, 27, and 32); and (5) \u201cmaking] various changes to the law respecting juries in criminal cases\u201d (in sections 8, 9b, 21, and 25).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Notwithstanding the wide range of criminal justice matters addressed by the law, the court upheld it against a single-subject challenge. The court characterized the subject matter of the law as \u201cthe prosecution and conviction of persons accused of crime,\u201d concluding that \u201c[t]hat subject logically connects and unifies all the provisions of SB 936, including those that create, within the process of criminal law enforcement, certain legal rights for the victims of crime, and those that deal with sentencing and restitution.\u201d <em>Fugate, </em>332 Or at 204. In concluding that such disparate provisions were united by the single principle of \u201cthe prosecution and conviction of persons accused of crime,\u201d the court, in effect, recognized that a law that addresses exclusively matters of criminal law has but one subject for purposes of Article IV. The court reached a similar result in <em>Caleb. </em>There, the court held that Ballot Measure 11 (1994), which created mandatory sentences for a range of offenses listed in the measure, comported with the single-subject requirement of Article IV, section l(2)(d), because it embraced the single subject of \u201cmandatory imprisonment of any person, 15 years of age or older, who is convicted of a listed felony on or after April 1, 1995.\u201d <em>Caleb, </em>326 Or at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>By contrast, a law that includes provisions addressing distinct and unrelated substantive areas of law risks violating the single-subject limitation. In <em>Mclntire, </em>the sole case in which an Oregon appellate court has invalidated a law under the single-subject rule, the law at issue, Senate Bill (SB) 1156 (1995), did eight different things across a range of unrelated substantive areas of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">\u201cSB 1156 *** (1) provides state funding [and land use procedures] for light rail, (2) expands the availability of card-lock service stations, (3) promotes \u2018regional problem solving\u2019 in land use matters, (4) regulates confined animal feeding, (5) preempts local pesticide regulation, (6) adopts new timber harvesting rules, (7) grants immunity to shooting ranges for \u2018noise pollution,\u2019 and (8) protects salmon from cormorants.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">322 Or at 444 (brackets in original; some internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[U]nable to discern a principle unifying those eight topics\u201d \u2014 beyond a unifying principle so broad that it would encompass the entire \u201cuniverse\u201d of potential legislative actions \u2014 the court held that the law violated the single-subject requirement of Article IV, section 20. <em>Id. </em>at 445-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">We are unable to meaningfully distinguish Measure 73 from the laws upheld against single-subject challenges in <em>Caleb </em>and <em>Fugate. </em>In particular, similar to Measure 11, Measure 73 creates enhanced punishments for listed offenses (certain sex offenses and DUII) for repeat offenders. It does so by categorizing a third DUII conviction as a felony \u2014 making it a more serious offense than it otherwise would be \u2014 and by creating mandatory minimum sentences for certain repeat sex and DUII offenders. The \u201cunifying principle\u201d that connects the different provisions of the measure can be articulated in much the same way that the Supreme Court articulated the unifying principles for the laws at issue in <em>Caleb </em>and <em>Fugate: </em>\u201cenhanced punishments for offenders repeatedly convicted of specified crimes.\u201d In the light of our ability to identify and articulate a unifying principle, <em>Caleb </em>and <em>Fugate </em>would appear to compel us to reject defendant\u2019s single-subject challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Defendant nonetheless asserts that we should view Measure 73 as addressing two subjects: (1) the creation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>a new crime of felony DUII for third-time offenders, subject to a mandatory minimum term of incarceration of 90 days; and (2) the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences of 25 years for major felony sex crimes for second-time offenders. Although defendant concedes that \u201csome \u2018subjects\u2019 could encompass both of Measure 73\u2019s topics, such as \u2018repeated criminal acts,\u201d\u2019 defendant argues that, under <em>Mclntire, </em>any such subject would be \u201ctoo \u2018broad and general\u2019\u201d to comply with Article IV, section l(2)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><em>Mclntire </em>does not stand for that proposition. Although the Supreme Court did, in that case, suggest that some purported \u201csubjects\u201d might be too broad to express a unifying principle, <em>Mclntire </em>was, as the court put it, an \u201cextreme case.\u201d 322 Or at 445. There, because the challenged law was a legislative act, the court, after concluding that it could not itself discern a unifying principle, turned to the relating clause in the title of the act. The relating clause provided simply that the act was one \u201c[r] elating to the activities regulated by state government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court held that that statement failed to identify and express a unifying principle, because it was \u201cso global that it d[id] little more than define the universe with respect to which the legislature is empowered to act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">This is not, in the words of the <em>Mclntire </em>court, an \u201cextreme case.\u201d Instead, it falls in line with <em>Caleb </em>and <em>Fugate. </em>As with the laws at issue in those cases, we can discern and articulate a discrete unifying principle connecting the provisions of Measure 73 (\u201cenhanced punishments for offenders repeatedly convicted of specified crimes\u201d). That subject identifies (1) the precise sphere of regulation (namely, the criminal justice system); (2) the targeted persons (repeat offenders); and (3) the intended outcome (enhanced punishments). Such a subject is not so \u201cglobal\u201d as the proposed unifying principle rejected in <em>Mclntire, </em>nor is it even as broad as the subject identified and approved in <em>Fugate </em>\u2014 \u201cthe prosecution and conviction of persons accused of crime.\u201d <em>Fugate, </em>332 Or at 204. In other words, although defendant asserts that \u201c[n]o unifying principle logically connects [the] two topics [of Measure 73] without being so broad as to encompass nearly everything in the legislative universe,\u201d that simply is not the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>In short, we can discern a single unifying principle connecting the provisions of Measure 73. Defendant does not suggest that the measure embraces \u201cother matters\u201d that are not \u201cproperly connected\u201d to the identified unifying principle, and we see none. Accordingly, we conclude that Measure 73 was not adopted in violation of the single-subject requirement of Article IV, section l(2)(d), and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-6\"> Measure 73 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201cSection 1.
