UNDERLYING FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Defendant\u2019s first trial for possession and delivery of marijuana ended in a mistrial. He was then retried and convicted of both offenses. The gravamen of defendant\u2019s post-mistrial motion to dismiss is his contention that prosecutorial misconduct deprived him of the favorable testimony of one of his witnesses, Oren Maney. For that reason, we begin with a detailed description of the prosecution\u2019s pretrial interactions with Maney before turning to a description of the prosecutor\u2019s conduct during defendant\u2019s first trial and the events that occurred following the mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">On April 8, 2010, Portland police officers executed a warrant authorizing a search of defendant\u2019s residence. During that search, the officers found \u201c[m]arijuana; drug packaging materials; a digital weighing scale; drug ledger; U.S. currency, money; and firearms.\u201d Some of that evidence, including the marijuana, was found in a locked room in defendant\u2019s basement. Defendant was indicted for possession and delivery of marijuana. ORS 475.864 (possession); ORS 475.860 (delivery).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">A. <em>Pretrial Prosecutorial Conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">Before defendant\u2019s first trial was scheduled to begin, Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Allison <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Williams, who had been assigned to prosecute defendant\u2019s case, provided defendant\u2019s witness list to Portland Police Officer Travis Law, the lead investigating officer who had executed the affidavit in support of the warrant to search defendant\u2019s residence. Law was also a member of the Metro Gang Task Force and, for that reason, was \u201ccross-designated as [a] federal agent [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">Oren Maney\u2019s name appeared on that witness list. According to Law, Maney did not \u201cappear to have any connection with * * * defendant.\u201d Law also learned that Maney had a \u201cmarijuana card\u201d through the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">After consulting with Williams, Law met with Maney. Law showed his federal identification to Maney, and federal Special Agent Burke, with whom Law was conducting surveillance in an unrelated matter, accompanied Law to the meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">According to Law, Maney made the following statements: (1) Maney had met defendant through his mother, Kimberly Maney (Kimberly). (2) Maney had lived with defendant for a time and had a key to the locked room in defendant\u2019s basement. (3) The marijuana found in the locked room (as well as other items found during the search of defendant\u2019s residence) belonged to Maney and were left behind when he moved out. (4) Maney had a \u201cmedical marijuana card.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">Because Maney\u2019s statement \u201cseemed rehearsed,\u201d Law said, \u201cLook, you know, I don\u2019t know how you became involved in this investigation, but, you know, you have to understand that if you intend on coming to court and perjuring yourself that you could potentially be arrested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) In addition, Burke told Maney that it is a crime to lie to a federal agent. At that point, Maney became agitated, and Law asked him to leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">After that meeting, defense investigator Frederick Gove met with Maney. Maney told Gove that Law and Burke had told him that he was lying and threatened <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>him by indicating that he would go to jail if he testified. Nevertheless, at that point, Gove believed that Maney would testify on defendant\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">Also after Law\u2019s meeting with Maney, Williams contacted Maney\u2019s mother, Kimberly, a probation officer with the Multnomah County Juvenile Department. Kimberly told Williams that Maney was not involved in the case but planned on testifying.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Shortly thereafter, Williams and Gary Boek, an investigator with the district attorney\u2019s office, met with Kimberly at her office. During their conversation, Kimberly indicated that defendant- \u2014 who was a juvenile counselor with the Clackamas County Juvenile Department \u2014 had contracted to work with her office as a group facilitator several years earlier but that she had not introduced defendant and Maney. She further indicated that Maney had been living with her before moving into his current residence. Finally, Kimberly stated that, before Williams had contacted her, she had had a conversation with Maney about his involvement in this case and that Maney had told her that he was not involved and that the marijuana was not his. According to Kimberly, \u201cas a mother and also as a probation officer,\u201d she told Maney \u201cnot to get involved in something that he wasn\u2019t involved in.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">At some point, Williams discussed this case with her supervisor, Mark McDonnell, who, in turn, discussed it with others in the office, including the chief deputy. Williams testified that \u201cthe thing that was unusual about this case was that we had very strong evidence that we had a witness that was coming in that intended to perjure himself in trial.\u201d According to Williams, they \u201ccouldn\u2019t find a clear link between [Maney] and the defendant.\u201d She further noted that it had been observed that \u201cthe only link\u201d that they could find between Maney and defendant was that defendant\u2019s current defense attorney, Barry Engle, had \u201crepresented both of them in a drug case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>As a result of those discussions, Williams, accompanied by Boek (the investigator from the prosecutor\u2019s office), met with Maney at his residence. While standing outside the front door, Boek told Maney that they had met with his mother and \u201cwere there to hear what he had to say and understood that he may want * * * to change what he had initially said about whose marijuana it was.\u201d Maney indicated that he had already spoken with Law and Burke and that \u201cthey started intimidating him and threatening him and he didn\u2019t trust what the officers were telling him\u201d but reiterated that he had lived with defendant for several months and that the marijuana was his. Williams told Maney that, if he came to court and lied, he could be arrested for a crime but that, if he told the truth, he could not be arrested.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> When Boek asked Maney to explain why his fingerprints were not found on any of the items seized from the locked room and about inconsistencies between Maney\u2019s assertions and his mother\u2019s statements, Maney became \u201cagitated\u201d to the point that Williams described his behavior as \u201cthreatening\u201d and \u201cscary.\u201d Ultimately, Maney\u2019s girlfriend \u201cput an arm\u201d between Maney and Williams and Boek. As Boek and Williams were leaving, Boek told Maney that he \u201cthought maybe [Maney\u2019s] marijuana was causing him to be a little delusional and he needed help[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Defense investigator Gove contacted Maney again after his meeting with Williams and Boek. According to Gove, Maney indicated that he \u201cwas not going to participate in the case anymore\u201d and had \u201cbeen receiving threats from the district attorney\u201d and felt that \u201cthere was a lot of harassment from the police and from the district attorney about him being a witness.\u201d Gove thought that Maney \u201cwas also quite concerned about his mother\u2019s job security at this point.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">B. <em>Prosecutorial Conduct During Defendant\u2019s First Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Against that historic backdrop and before his first trial began, defendant moved to dismiss the charges against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>him based on the prosecution\u2019s interactions with Maney and his mother. Defendant contended that those interactions violated, <em>inter alia, </em>his constitutional rights to compulsory process and due process.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court denied that pretrial motion, stating that, after hearing the evidence, it was \u201cnot convinced that the government conduct in this case is outrageous in violation of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Following the trial court\u2019s denial of that motion and the court\u2019s resolution of a myriad of other pretrial motions, defendant\u2019s first trial began. Throughout trial, the court granted.several defense motions and sustained a variety of defense objections and, on several occasions, ordered remedies in lieu of a mistrial. For purposes of our analysis, it is sufficient to describe three salient examples of Williams\u2019s conduct that precipitated a defense objection or motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">First, Williams attempted to elicit testimony from Kimberly that Maney had intended to testify falsely:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">\u201cIs it your understanding that at one point your son planned to testify for the defense in this trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: Objection. Just another form of hearsay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">\u201c [KIMBERLY]: Yes, it is my understanding.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-11\">\u201c[MS. WILLIAMS]: Is it your understanding that this testimony would have been untrue?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-12\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: Objection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-13\">Following a colloquy outside the presence of the jury, the court sustained defendant\u2019s objection, stating that it would instruct the jury to disregard the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-14\">When the court asked counsel whether there was anything further that should be addressed outside the jury\u2019s presence, Engle said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>\u201c[T]his inclination of Ms. Williams to ask objectionable questions and to admit objectionable evidence to get it [in] front of the jury and then either withdraw it or \u2014 or, you know, have it removed is becoming quite a pattern, which is greatly \u2014 I think should be greatly concerning to the \u2014 the veracity of the \u2014 of the Court, of the jury proceeding \u2014 the reliability of the jury proceedings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">\u201c*** [I]f she\u2019s got plans to introduce something that we\u2019ve been talking about previously that the Court has ruled on, you know, it would seem to be in the best interest of everybody if she\u2019d let us know now as opposed to uncorking in the middle in front of the jury just like she did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">After Williams responded that she did not \u201chave any other questions for this witness,\u201d the following exchanged occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: For this witness. I mean \u2014 I\u2019m sorry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: I\u2019m sorry, Judge. I\u2019m\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">\u201cTHE COURT: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: I\u2019m trying to hold my cool, but\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-11\">\u201cTHE COURT: I understand. Ms. Williams, if you intend to elicit any testimony from any additional witnesses, this witness or any others\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-12\">\u201cMS. WILLIAMS: Mm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: \u2014that even approach the matters that we\u2019ve addressed in pretrial motions, I\u2019d ask you to alert the Court first before\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-14\">\u201cMS. WILLIAMS: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-15\">\u201cMR. ENGLE: \u2014asking them questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-16\">Second, Williams failed to adduce any evidence from which a reasonable jury could find that defendant possessed the firearms that had been seized during the search of defendant\u2019s residence and introduced as evidence at trial for the purpose of using them in connection with a controlled substance offense as required by ORS 475.900(l)(b)(C), one of the commercial drug offense factors. Following the state\u2019s case-in-chief, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>on that ground as well as others. In response, the court allowed Williams to withdraw the allegation pertaining to that commercial drug offense factor. Williams explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\u201cJudge, quite frankly I had planned to make the argument to the jury that weapons are used as a means of protection in drug sale enterprises and their surroundings and I quite simply forgot to ask the officer to elaborate on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">\u201cI \u2014 when we were going through it I realized that I had forgotten to elicit that testimony. It\u2019s my fault. I did feel that there was a basis to support the allegation. So I stipulated to it being withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Defense counsel acknowledged the court\u2019s ruling, but explained that defendant had been prejudiced because \u201cthere\u2019s two firearms * * * in evidence and displayed in front of the jury.\u201d For that reason, counsel moved for a mistrial or, in the alternative, to remove the firearms from evidence. The state then sought to reopen its case to cure its prior omission concerning the firearms.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The trial court denied the state\u2019s motion to reopen its case and defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial, noting that the court was \u201csatisfied from Ms. Williams [\u2019s] explanation that the State did not offer the guns into evidence and show them to the jury with any nefarious intent for any purpose of improperly prejudicing the jury.\u201d However, the court agreed with defendant that \u201cthe weapons that were previously received should be withdrawn and removed from evidence and not shown in front of the jury.\u201d When the jury returned to the courtroom, the court gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cAt the beginning of the case[,] when I read the charges to you[,] you heard me read the following allegation. The allegation was that the defendant was in possession of a firearm * * * for the purpose of using it in connection with the controlled substance offense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cThat allegation has been withdrawn from this case. You\u2019re not to consider that allegation any further. And also in connection with that allegation the Exhibits 25 and 26, which were identified as two firearms [,] have been withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">\u201cThose exhibits will not be considered \u2014 should not be considered by you as well as Exhibits 14 and 16, two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>photographs that included \u2014 may or may not have included what appeared to be a firearm, have been withdrawn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\">\u201cSo all of those exhibits and that allegation should not be considered by the jury any further and I instruct you to ignore that allegation and ignore those exhibits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Finally, during closing argument, Williams commented on defendant\u2019s right to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">\u201c[Defendant] when he was first arrested before he had time to hire a lawyer, talk to a lawyer, think about what statements might benefit him in trial \u2014 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">As a result of that statement, defendant\u2019s attorney moved for a mistrial, contending that Williams was \u201cblatantly\u201d engaging in conduct \u201cand then each time shrugging her shoulders, and, you know, saying that she didn\u2019t know any better\u201d and that he did not know how the course of repeated conduct could be considered as \u201canything but intentional.\u201d In response, Williams asked the court to deny defendant\u2019s motion and offer a limiting instruction instead, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">\u201cI meant that comment. It was a careless comment. I should not have said it. I meant it as a timeline reference to when [defendant] made the statements that he made. I have not relied on it in my arguments. It has not become an essential part of the State\u2019s case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion for a mistrial. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-10\">\u201cI accept at face value Ms. Williams [\u2019s] statement that was not intentional. I also agree with Ms. Williams [\u2019s] comment that the statement alone * * * in the overall context of this case may not standing alone be sufficient to grant a mistrial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-11\">\u201cHowever, there comes a point and we may have crossed that point where the cumulative effect of a number of missteps along the way when added on to the \u2014 the failure to acknowledge the significance of approaching Oren Maney in a way that at least suggested to him that he should not come to court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-12\">\u201cThe statement that was made to Mr. Maney was that he should not come to court and lie. There was no suggestion that he should come to court and tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>\u201cWhen you tell a witness don\u2019t come to court and lie that[] suggests to the witness that he not come to court at all, and, in fact, Mr. Maney is not here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\">\u201cThe concerns of due process as described in <em>State v. Huffman, </em>65 Or App 594 [, 672 P2d 1351 (1983)], apply to a witness that the defense intends to call and has served with a subpoena.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-5\">\u201cI denied the defense motion to dismiss this case at the outset on the grounds of prosecutorial misconduct because I concluded at that juncture that there was not a sufficient showing to justify that remedy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-6\">\u201cAt this juncture when combined with all of the other statements and the other actions that occurred in this case culminating * * * in the statement * * * that led into the district attorney\u2019s closing argument in this case I\u2019m not satisfied that the trial that was conducted in this case comports with the requirements of due process when all of those circumstances are taken into account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-7\">\u201cI\u2019m not sure the State realizes that * * * when a district attorney approaches a witness and suggests that the witness should not come to court and lie contains an implicit suggestion to the witness that the witness not come to court at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">\u201cBut it certainly does in my mind and that\u2019s concerning to this Court and while it standing alone may not justify dismissal of the action it certainly is a concern as to the due process, whether the due process requirements have been satisfied for this trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">\u201cCombined with *** showing the jury firearms that ultimately did not become part of the State\u2019s case combined with the several missteps by the prosecution\u2019s office in this case is very troubling to me and I\u2019m concluding that all of those circumstances have combined to result in a trial that[] *** does not comport with the requirements of due process. So I\u2019m going to grant the defense motion for mistrial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">In conclusion, the court noted that \u201cthis trial would [have been] much more fair if Oren Maney [had come] and testified under oath\u201d and explained \u201cwhat he had to say good or bad.\u201d The court further commented that, to the extent that defendant pursued a second motion to dismiss, it \u201cmay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>be a moot point if the State is able to secure the testimony of Mr. Maney. And assuming that some of the other due process concerns that have occurred during the course of this trial don\u2019t occur in the retrial * *</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">C. <em>Post-Mistrial Prosecutorial Conduct and Motion to Dismiss</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Thereafter, defendant moved to dismiss the charges against him. Before the hearing on that motion, Maney was compelled to testify before a grand jury and given immunity.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Maney\u2019s grand jury testimony was different from his prior statements in several respects. Most significantly, Maney testified that he never resided with defendant and that the marijuana found in defendant\u2019s residence was not his. Maney explained that defendant had asked him whether the marijuana might be his and that he thought that it might have been because he had misplaced a backpack containing marijuana. After Maney had spoken with Law and Burke, he found his backpack and told Engle that his earlier statement that the marijuana was his was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">At the subsequent hearing concerning defendant\u2019s post-mistrial motion to dismiss, defense counsel alerted the court to Maney\u2019s grand jury appearance and the general nature of his testimony.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant contended that the charges against him should be dismissed because of prosecutorial misconduct, relying on both double jeopardy and compulsory process principles. Defendant contended that double jeopardy principles precluded a retrial because the state would be allowed \u201cto take another run at it\u201d with Maney, whose testimony is now \u201cby their own doing completely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>changed and modified.\u201d Further, relying on Williams\u2019s conduct before and during trial as well as the state\u2019s decision to compel Maney\u2019s testimony before the grand jury, defendant contended that the charges against him should be dismissed \u201cbecause of the extraordinary nature of what was done here.\u201d Specifically, Engle stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-4\">\u201c[Hiere a prosecutor keeps doing these same things over and over again. You know, she keeps saying \u2014 -she\u2019s pleading ignorance every time.

Kennedy, </em>456 US 667, 102 S Ct 2083, 72 L Ed 2d 416 (1982) <em>(Oregon v. Kennedy), </em>and our decision on remand from that court, <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>61 Or App 469, 657 P2d 717, <em>aff'd, </em>295 Or 260, 666 P2d 1316 (1983), defendant filed a supplemental motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds. Defendant contended that those cases preclude a retrial where the state engages in misconduct \u201c\u2018intended to interfere with the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, either by provoking a mistrial or by influencing the jury\u2019\u201d or where prosecutorial misconduct \u2014 whether inadvertent or intentional \u2014 is sufficiently prejudicial. (Quoting <em>Kennedy, </em>61 Or App at 473.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>The trial court denied that motion, noting again that Williams\u2019s conduct before and during the first trial was not intended to cause a mistrial or deprive defendant of his right to a fair trial. The court reiterated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-4\">\u201cBut, again, though, <em>I conclude that Ms. Williams was not intending to deprive the defendant of a right to a fair trial. </em>I think she was * * * her contact with Mr. Maney prior to trial was intended to ensure that Mr. Maney testified truthfully at trial and did not testify untruthfully at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">\u201cHowever, I was troubled by the words used and the fact that even though the prosecutor\u2019s intent wasn\u2019t to deprive defendant of a fair trial, the words that were used * * * in that context could reasonably be interpreted by Mr. Maney to be an effort to influence him to not appear at trial, which is troubling.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">D. <em>Defendant\u2019s Second Trial</em></p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Having determined that there was no impediment to a retrial, defendant\u2019s second trial began. When Maney failed to appear after being subpoenaed by the state, defendant obtained a material witness warrant and had him arrested. Maney ultimately testified. He could not recall or remember many aspects of his prior interactions with the prosecution or his prior statements. However, with regard to his interaction with Williams and Boek, Maney testified, \u201cI think I told them to stop harassing me, I think it was, and I closed the door.\u201d Consistently with his testimony before the grand jury, he explained any misunderstandings as the product of his misplaced backpack.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The jury convicted defendant of possession and delivery of marijuana. However, the jury did not find that the delivery was accompanied by the requisite number of commercial drug offense factors. Defendant appeals from the resulting judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-10\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-11\">On appeal, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his post-mistrial motion to dismiss on the ground that prosecutorial misconduct before and during his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>first trial violated his constitutional right to compulsory process under Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Defendant also assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because it will inform our analysis concerning the court\u2019s denial of his motion to dismiss on compulsory process grounds, we begin with defendant\u2019s contentions pertaining to the court\u2019s denial of his motion on double jeopardy grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">A. <em>Double Jeopardy</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Specifically, defendant contends that the trial court erred in rejecting his double-jeopardy contentions under Article I, section 12, because \u201cthe record in no way supports a conclusion that the prosecutor did not at least <em>know </em>that the conduct caused defendant severe prejudice and was indifferent to that result.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Further, defendant contends that the trial court erred in rejecting his Fifth Amendment contentions because there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding of lack of prosecutorial intent. Alternatively, relying on <em>Oregon v. Kennedy </em>and the Oregon Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or 260, 666 P2d 1316 (1983) <em>(State v. Kennedy), </em>defendant posits that the trial court should have granted his motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under both the state and federal constitutions because, \u201c[r]egardless of the prosecutor\u2019s culpability or lack thereof, the prejudice to defendant\u2019s case was so severe, that retrial could not have cured it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">As the state correctly notes, we described the principles governing the resolution of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under the state and federal constitutions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>in <em>State v. Kimsey, </em>182 Or App 193, 47 P3d 916 (2002). In <em>Kimsey, </em>we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-4\">\u201c[t]he double jeopardy protection embodied in Article I, section 12, *** is, in principle, the same as that embodied in the Fifth Amendment * * *. <em>See generally, State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or [at] 272-76 *** (concluding that the objective to be served by the two clauses is the same, even if the analyses adopted by Oregon and federal courts differ).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">182 Or App at 202-03. That protection \u201cis designed to spare a criminal defendant the embarrassment, expense, and harassment of being subjected to successive prosecutions for the same offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203; <em>see generally State v. Rathbun, </em>287 Or 421, 430, 600 P2d 392 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">However, as with other constitutional interests, a defendant can waive double jeopardy protections. \u201cThus, when a defendant moves for a mistrial or otherwise consents to have a trial terminated, a subsequent trial on the same charges ordinarily is not barred.\u201d <em>Kimsey, </em>182 Or App at 203. An exception to that general rule exists \u201cwhen a mistrial results from prosecutorial or judicial misconduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we explained in <em>Kimsey,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">\u201c[s]uch misconduct will, in a narrow range of circumstances, give rise to a double jeopardy bar on the theory that the official misconduct put the defendant \u2018to the \u201cHobson\u2019s choice\u201d of either moving for a mistrial or continuing with a jury which was, arguably, favorably disposed to the defendant but is now contaminated by the misconduct.\u2019 <em>Rathbun, </em>287 Or at 431; <em>see also Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 US at 672-73. Where the state and federal constitutional double jeopardy protections differ is the analyses that the courts have adopted for determining what kinds of official misconduct are sufficiently egregious to trigger a bar to retrial of the charges.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-9\">\u201cUnder Article I, section 12, the state may not again prosecute a defendant on the same charges if the misconduct that prompted the defendant\u2019s successful mistrial motion \u2018is so prejudicial to the defendant that it cannot be cured by means short of a mistrial, and if the official knows that the conduct is improper and prejudicial and either intends or is indifferent to the resulting mistrial or reversal.\u2019 <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or at 276. Thus, prejudice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>sufficient to warrant a mistrial is not enough, in and of itself. <em>State v. Pratt, </em>316 Or 561, 579-80, 853 P2d 827 [, <em>cert den, </em>510 US 969] (1993). The official also must have acted with <em>knowledge </em>of the improper and prejudicial nature of the conduct and with at least <em>indifference </em>to the resulting mistrial. <em>Id. </em>In other words, the standard requires \u2018some conscious choice of prejudicial action before the [double jeopardy] guarantee bars correction of the error by a new trial. Negligent error, \u201cgross\u201d or otherwise, is not enough.\u2019 <em>State v. Kennedy, </em>295 Or at 273 (footnote and some internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also State v. Curl, </em>65 Or App 227, 670 P2d 1058 (1983) (even gross negligence on part of prosecutor does not create a double jeopardy problem).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-4\">\u201cUnder the Fifth Amendment, the test for barring a retrial is even more rigorous. Although it too focuses on the official\u2019s mental state in engaging in the misconduct, neither the official\u2019s knowledge that the conduct is improper and prejudicial nor indifference to the resulting mistrial will suffice. Rather, the official must actually <em>intend </em>the mistrial in the sense that the conduct in question is \u2018intended to \u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u2019 <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 US at 676.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">182 Or App at 203-04 (emphasis and third brackets in Kimsey).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">In sum, notwithstanding defendant\u2019s suggestions to the contrary, in determining whether the state and federal constitutional double jeopardy provisions preclude a retrial, the dispositive issue is whether the prosecutor had the requisite <em>scienter. </em>For purposes of the state constitution, the trial court must determine whether \u201cthe prosecutor either intended or was indifferent to the resulting mistrial or reversal.\u201d <em>Garner, </em>234 Or App at 491. For purposes of the federal constitution, the inquiry is more <em>limited- </em>\u2014 viz., \u201cthe official must actually <em>intend </em>the mistrial in the sense that the conduct in question is intended to goad the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>Kimsey, </em>182 Or App at 204 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">Here, the trial court found that the prosecutor, Williams, did not intend to cause a mistrial and was not indifferent to that result. Thus, the dispositive issue in this case is whether there is evidence to support that finding. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Further \u2014 and critically here \u2014 the trial court\u2019s findings concerning the prosecutor\u2019s intent \u201care binding on review as long as there is evidence in the record to support them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 204. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">A factfinder will \u201cordinarily infer intent from circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Hennagir, </em>246 Or App 456, 462, 266 P3d 128 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 33 (2012). \u201cAn inference concerning [an individual\u2019s] subjective intent is reasonable if there is a logical connection between the surrounding activity and the [individual\u2019s] state of mind.\u201d <em>State v. Branch, </em>208 Or App 286, 289, 144 P3d 1010 (2006). An \u201cinference need not inevitably follow from the established facts; rather, if the established facts support multiple reasonable inferences, the jury may decide which inference to draw.\u201d <em>State v. Miller, </em>196 Or App 354, 358, 103 P3d 112 (2004), <em>rev den, </em>338 Or 488 (2005). Further, and significantly, where \u201ccredibility based on demeanor is a crucial factor in making an appraisal of the evidence,\u201d we will normally \u201cdefer to a trial court\u2019s findings of credibility.\u201d <em>State v. Russum, </em>265 Or App 103, 120, 333 P3d 1191, <em>rev den, </em>356 Or 575 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">Here, the court found that Williams, a prosecutor whom defendant described as having only \u201cthree years\u2019 experience,\u201d made a series of \u201cmistakes\u201d that resulted in a mistrial. As recounted above, those mistakes included (1) the \u201cwords used\u201d in communicating with Maney before trial, 269 Or App at 609-10, 614; (2) the attempt to elicit testimony in violation of the court\u2019s prior rulings, 269 Or App at 606; (3) the failure to connect the firearms evidence to the commercial drug offense factor alleged in the indictment, 269 Or App at 607; and (4) the comment on defendant\u2019s right to counsel in closing argument, 269 Or App at 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">However, the court expressly found that the prosecution had not acted with the requisite intent. <em>See </em>269 Or App at 613, 614. The trial court based that finding concerning Williams\u2019s <em>scienter </em>\u201cnot only on the written materials, but on my observation of Ms. Williams [\u2019s] conduct at the first trial,\u201d noting that it \u201crecall [ed]\u201d that conduct \u201cvery clearly.\u201d In other words, in assessing the circumstances, the trial court made an explicit demeanor-based credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>determination in light of its observations of Williams\u2019s conduct, which would have included, among other things, her tone of voice, facial expressions, and reactions to objections and court instruction. Accordingly, because Williams\u2019s demeanor was a crucial factor in the trial court\u2019s assessment of the evidence, we defer to its credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Given that, and in light of the nature of Williams\u2019s \u201cmistakes\u201d and her relative inexperience, we conclude that the record is sufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that Williams did not intend to cause a mistrial and was not indifferent to that result. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under either the state or federal constitutions. Accordingly, we turn to defendant\u2019s assignment of error concerning the trial court\u2019s denial of his post-mistrial motion to dismiss on the ground that the state violated defendant\u2019s compulsory process rights under Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">B. <em>Compulsory Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">Defendant asserts that, \u201cwhere the state has acted improperly and the result is the effective loss of a defense witness, the violation of defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial is the same, <em>regardless of the prosecutor\u2019s intent.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>13</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.) For that reason, defendant posits that, in this case, \u201cintentional or not, the state\u2019s repeated contacts irreversibly deprived defendant of the witness and permanently harmed defendant\u2019s ability to present his defense.\u201d However \u2014 and notwithstanding that ostensible premise that the prosecutor\u2019s intent was immaterial, given the purported effect of her conduct \u2014 defendant ultimately and completely reverses course and contends that the trial court \u201cshould have allowed the * * * motion to dismiss as a matter of due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>process\u201d because <em>\u201cthe evidence demonstrates an utter lack of support for the trial court\u2019s finding that the state\u2019s conduct was not intentionally done to interfere with defendant\u2019s ability to present a defense \u201d</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Defendant\u2019s contentions are unavailing in this case. Two salient observations demonstrate why that is so.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\"><em>First, </em>the premise underlying defendant\u2019s argument is that the state\u2019s conduct in this case was \u201cimproper.\u201d As described above, 269 Or App at 611, defendant\u2019s position before the trial court concerning the post-mistrial motion was that the state\u2019s conduct was \u201cimproper\u201d in this case <em>because </em>it was <em>intentional </em>\u2014 that is, the state intended to hamper defendant\u2019s ability to present his case. As the trial court explained, the gravamen of defendant\u2019s motion was his contention that there had been \u201ca pattern of misconduct and actions taken by the District Attorney\u2019s Office that amount [ed] to essentially intentional or willful misconduct by the District Attorney\u2019s Office.\u201d <em>See </em>269 Or App at 612-13. Thus, because defendant\u2019s compulsory process argument depends on characterizing the state\u2019s conduct as \u201cintentional,\u201d our inquiry again cycles back to whether there is evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that the state lacked the requisite intent \u2014 that is, that the prosecutor did not intend to hamper defendant\u2019s ability to present his case, <em>see </em>269 Or App at 612-13. Given that we have already concluded that evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>269 Or App at 618-19, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s post-mistrial motion to dismiss on compulsory process grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><em>Second, </em>had defendant asked the trial court to determine whether his compulsory process rights had been violated because, regardless of prosecutorial <em>scienter, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s conduct was otherwise improper because it effectively deprived him of a witness and permanently harmed his ability to present his defense, the court would have had to engage in a variety of other fact-intensive inquiries. Those inquiries include the following: (1) Did the prosecutor engage in qualifying \u201cmisconduct\u201d?<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (2) Did the \u201cmisconduct\u201d have some effect on the witness\u2019s testimony?<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> (3) If a prosecutor substantially interfered with a defendant\u2019s rights, was that interference harmless?<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Because of the manner in which defendant framed his compulsory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>process challenge, the trial court had no occasion to consider and determine those matters. Thus, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on compulsory process grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">In sum, the trial court did not err in denying defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds under Article I, section 12, and the Fifth Amendment and on the ground that prosecutorial misconduct violated his constitutional right to compulsory process under Article I, section 11, and the Sixth Amendment. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-7\"> The conduct at issue in this case occurred in 2010.

Further, we note that both statutes have been amended by Ballot Measure 91 (2014), a voter initiative approved at the November 4, 2014, general election. Those amendments became effective on December 4, 2014, but are not operative until July 1, 2015. Accordingly, for clarity, our references to ORS 475.860 and ORS 475.864 are to the 2009 version that was in effect at the time of the conduct in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b621-8\"> Those contentions pertain to the denial of defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss on compulsory process grounds, the denial of his motion to compel disclosure of the identity of the state\u2019s confidential informant, the denial of his motion to compel disclosure of the consideration given to that informant, the denial of his motion to suppress evidence obtained during the warranted search of his residence, the denial of his supplemental motion to suppress a particular item of evidence found during the search, the denial of his motion to exclude expert testimony related to that item of evidence, and the trial court\u2019s failure to merge defendant\u2019s guilty verdicts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b622-9\"> Shortly before defendant\u2019s first trial was scheduled to begin, the state dismissed the original indictment and reindicted defendant for possession of marijuana, ORS 475.864, and delivery of marijuana as a commercial drug offense, ORS 475.860; ORS 475.900(l)(b). As we explained in <em>State v. Huff, </em>253 Or App 480, 485 n 4, 291 P3d 751 (2012), \u201cORS 475.900(l)(b) provides that the crime of possession, delivery, or manufacture of a controlled substance is a commercial drug offense \u2014 resulting in a higher crime seriousness classification under the sentencing guidelines \u2014 if it is accompanied by at least three of several factors enumerated in the statute.\u201d Here, the indictment charged that the offense was a commercial drug offense because defendant possessed $300 or more in cash, ORS 475.900 (l)(b)(B); a firearm for the purpose of using it in connection with a controlled substance offense, ORS 475.900(l)(b)(C); materials being used for the packaging of controlled substances, ORS 475.900(l)(b)(D); and drug transaction records or customer lists, ORS 475.900(l)(b)(E).

Eventually, McDonnell \u201cwalked\u201d Maney to Multnomah Public Defenders and asked one of the senior attorneys if he would represent Maney \u201cas a courtesy.\u201d According to McDonnell, an attorney with that office advised Maney to voluntarily testify; however, he refused to do so and was eventually compelled to testify and given transactional immunity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> At the time, Engle stated, \u201c[I]t doesn\u2019t appear that the grand jury * * * was investigating a crime, but was rather just trying to depose a witness in some fashion.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\"> Article I, section 11, provides, in part, that, \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have the right * * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor [.] \u201d Similarly, the Sixth Amendment provides, in part, that, \u201c [i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor [.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b635-8\"> Article I, section 12, provides that \u201c[n]o person shall be put in jeopardy twice for the same offence [sic], nor be compelled in any criminal prosecution to testify against himself.\u201d The Fifth Amendment provides, in part, that \u201c[n]o person shall *** be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b639-7\"> As noted above, 269 Or App at 601 n 2, we have rejected without discussion defendant\u2019s contentions pertaining to his pretrial motion to dismiss.
