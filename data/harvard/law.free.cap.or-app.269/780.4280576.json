J.</author>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In this criminal case, defendant appeals the trial court\u2019s judgment convicting him of second-degree forgery, ORS 165.007, and second-degree theft, ORS 164.045. He assigns error to the court\u2019s denial of his motion to exclude a store security guard\u2019s testimony about what he saw while using the store\u2019s closed-circuit cameras and video monitors to visually track defendant in the store. Defendant argues that the guard\u2019s testimony was offered to prove the \u201ccontent of a recording\u201d and, therefore, was barred by OEC 1002, the \u201cbest evidence rule.\u201d The rule provides, in pertinent part, that, \u201c[t]o prove the content of a writing, recording or photograph, the original writing, recording or photograph is required [.]\u201d For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the officer\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove the content of a recording and, therefore, was not subject to the best evidence rule. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We begin with the historical facts relevant to defendant\u2019s motion, which we take from the evidence presented at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, viewed in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motion. <em>See State ex rel OHSU v. Haas, </em>325 Or 492, 498, 942 P2d 261 (1997) (when reviewing a trial court\u2019s pretrial determination of the admissibility of evidence, the court views the record in a manner consistent with the trial court\u2019s ruling).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">Defendant walked into a Walmart store, and a security guard, who was using the store\u2019s closed-circuit cameras and video monitors to observe activity in the store, recognized defendant as a member of a large theft ring. The guard then used the cameras and monitors to visually track defendant as he moved throughout the store. The guard saw defendant replace the price tag on an item with a fraudulent price tag, present the item for purchase, and purchase the item at the price on the fraudulent tag, which was lower than the store\u2019s price.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">The guard watched defendant on the \u201clive video feed\u201d from the cameras, which is displayed on monitors in the store\u2019s security office. The guard did not make any in-person observations of defendant in the store\u2019s shopping areas.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Video from the cameras is automatically recorded on the store\u2019s video recording system and saved for between three and six months. Video recorded on the system can be copied to a disc. After defendant was arrested, the guard watched the recorded video of defendant and copied it to a disc. At the motion hearing, the guard could not recall whether he had given the disc to the police or the district attorney\u2019s office, and, because he no longer worked for Walmart, he did not know whether the disc was still in the store\u2019s security office.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">The trial court ruled that the guard could testify to what he saw on the \u201clive video feed,\u201d but not to what he saw on the recorded video. After the court\u2019s ruling, defendant entered a conditional plea, reserving his right to appeal the ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">On appeal, defendant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the security guard\u2019s testimony regarding what he saw on the \u201clive video feed.\u201d Defendant contends that the testimony was evidence of the content of a recording and, therefore, subject to the best evidence rule, under which it could be admitted only if the state first proved that the recording itself had been lost or destroyed through no fault of its own. Defendant makes two arguments as to why the testimony was evidence of the content of a recording. We address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">First, defendant argues that the security guard\u2019s testimony about what he saw on the \u201clive video feed\u201d was evidence of the content of a recording because the \u201clive video feed\u201d is itself a recording. Specifically, defendant argues that the \u201clive video feed\u201d is a \u201cmoving picture,\u201d and \u201cmoving pictures\u201d are \u201cphotographs\u201d for the purposes of the best evidence rule. OEC 1001(3) (\u201c\u2018Photographs\u2019 includes still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes and motion pictures.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-7\">We reject defendant\u2019s argument. Defendant did not develop the record regarding the transmission of the images from the cameras to the monitors, and we cannot conclude that the transmission, which was described without contradiction as a \u201clive video feed\u201d and which appears to have been nearly instantaneous, constitutes a \u201cphotograph\u201d or other \u201crecording\u201d for the purposes of the best evidence rule. We acknowledge that viewing an image on a monitor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>is different from viewing the image with one\u2019s own eyes (or with vision-enhancing lenses, like binoculars), because the image on the monitor was captured by a camera and converted into an electronic form for transmission to the monitor. But, the same is true for sound that is transmitted from one telephone to. another and, as illustrated by one of the cases defendant cites, such transmissions are not subject to the best evidence rule. <em>U.S. v. Howard, </em>953 F2d 610, 612-13, <em>reh\u2019g den, </em>961 F2d 224 (11th Cir 1992) (holding that the best evidence rule did not apply to a law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony about what he heard when monitoring a telephone conversation between an informant and the defendant, who was in a different location than the officer).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">Defendant\u2019s second argument regarding why the best evidence rule applies to the security guard\u2019s testimony is that the testimony concerns the same images that the store\u2019s video recording system automatically recorded. Defendant contends that, because the guard\u2019s observations \u201c[were] <em>through </em>the [video] monitors that displayed the precise images that were digitally recorded [,]\u201d the guard\u2019s testimony about what he saw on the monitors \u201cwas evidence regarding the contents of the recording [,]\u201d and, therefore, \u201c[t]he best evidence rule applies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">We reject that argument as well. As defendant acknowledges, the fact that a recording of a sound or image is made does not preclude a person from testifying about his or her simultaneous observations of the sound or image. As Professor Kirkpatrick explains, \u201c[e]ven though a writing, recording or photograph exists that could be used to prove a particular fact, a party is not barred by the best evidence doctrine from using alternative forms of proof.\u201d Laird C. Kirkpatrick, Oregon Evidence \u00a71002.03 [3], 1003 (6th ed 2013). Thus, for example,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">\u201c[t]he rule does not require the production of a tape recording to prove a conversation merely because the conversation was taped. If it is what the person said that is at issue, and the statements can be proven by a witness who heard the statements made, the rule is inapplicable. If the witness did not hear the conversation personally, and only gained knowledge of the statements from a recording, the rule applies and the recording must be produced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 1004 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In this case, the trial court allowed the security guard to testify to his observations made while watching the \u201clive video feed,\u201d and not those made when he later reviewed the video recording. The guard\u2019s viewing of the \u201clive video feed\u201d is akin to listening to a telephone conversation as it occurs. The fact that a recording was made did not preclude the officer from testifying to his independent observations. <em>See Howard, </em>953 F2d at 612 (holding that a law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony about what he had heard during a telephone conversation was not barred by the best evidence rule, even though the conversation was tape recorded, because \u201cthe proffered testimony was offered not to prove the content of the tapes, but rather, the content of the conversations\u201d). The best evidence rule prohibits testimony about the contents of a recording; it does not prohibit testimony about events that are monitored, as they occur, through a device that also records. As the trial court explained, allowing the officer to testify regarding what he saw on the video monitors did not violate the best evidence rule because it was</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">\u201chardly any different than if somebody saw something with their eyes, took a picture, and that picture somehow got lost or disappeared. The suggestion that [the person\u2019s testimony should be excluded] * * * isn\u2019t supported by [the best evidence rule], which relates to secondary testimony about the contents of recordings or photographs.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">In sum, because we conclude that the security guard\u2019s testimony was not offered to prove the content of a recording, it was not subject to the best evidence rule, and, therefore, the trial court did not err denying defendant\u2019s motion to exclude it under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
