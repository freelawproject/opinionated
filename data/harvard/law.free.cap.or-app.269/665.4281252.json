J.</author>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Defendant, who sexually assaulted a resident of the adult foster care facility where he worked, appeals from a judgment of conviction for first-degree rape (Count 2), first-degree sodomy (Count 4), and first-degree sexual abuse (Counts 7 and 8, merged, and Counts 9 and 10, merged). Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10 were based on allegations that the victim, A, was incapable of consent by reason of mental defect. Counts 7 and 9 were based on a forcible compulsion theory. Defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal (MJOA) on all counts on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence: (1) as to Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10, of A\u2019s incapacity to consent; and (2) as to Counts 7 and 9, of forcible compulsion. <em>See </em>ORS 163.305(2), (3); ORS 163.315(1); <em>State v. Marshall, </em>350 Or 208, 253 P3d 1017 (2011) (evidentiary standard for forcible compulsion); <em>State v. Reed, </em>339 Or 239, 118 P3d 791 (2005) (evidentiary standard as to incapacity to consent due to mental defect). Because there was sufficient evidence of A\u2019s incapacity to consent, the trial court did not err in denying the MJOA as to Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10; conversely, because there was insufficient evidence of forcible compulsion, the trial court erred in denying the MJOA with respect to Counts 7 and 9 and in finding defendant guilty of those charges. We therefore reverse as to Counts 7 and 9, remand for entry of judgment in accordance with this opinion and for resentencing, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">In reviewing the denial of an MJOA, we view the facts and reasonable attendant inferences in the light most favorable to the state. <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>320 Or 47, 63, 880 P2d 431 (1994), <em>cert den, </em>514 US 1005 (1995). In accordance with that standard, we summarize the material facts, as amplified and supplemented below.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">Defendant worked as a caregiver at a foster care home for adults with mental disabilities from November 2009 until he was fired on January 13, 2011. During that period, A, who was 22 at the time, resided at the facility. She knew the defendant as \u201cMatt\u201d or \u201cLittle Matt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>The day after defendant\u2019s firing, two other caregivers were discussing his termination in the facility\u2019s kitchen. A, who overhead their conversation, entered the room and stated, \u201cI\u2019m glad he\u2019s gone.\u201d Then she took one of the caregivers by the hand and led the caregiver into her bedroom. A pointed to her television and to her bed, grabbed her breasts and groin area, and said, \u201cMatt touched me.\u201d After A and the caregiver left the bedroom, A started crying and wailing and became \u201chysterical.\u201d A few minutes later, A went back into the kitchen and stated, \u201cPenis in my mouth, yuck.\u201d At that point, the caregiver contacted her manager, who, in turn, contacted the Washington County Sheriffs Office, which initiated an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">A was interviewed at the Child Abuse Response and Evaluation Services Northwest (CARES) center, which evaluates children and developmentally disabled adults for sexual abuse.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">During the interview, A stated that defendant\u2014 whom she referred to as \u201cLittle Matt\u201d \u2014 had hurt her and that he had done so via \u201csex\u201d and with his \u201cpenis.\u201d When asked where he hurt her, A pointed to her crotch, and confirmed that defendant put his penis \u201cinside\u201d of that area, and that it felt \u201cawful.\u201d Responding to questions about whether defendant hurt her anywhere else, A said that his \u201cpenis\u201d hurt her \u201cbutt,\u201d pointed to her mouth and said \u201cyucky,\u201d and, when asked what his penis tasted like, replied, again, \u201cyucky.\u201d She also indicated that he had touched her breast with his mouth and hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">In response to questions about where and how the alleged abuse occurred and whether defendant said anything to her about \u201ctelling,\u201d A disclosed that the abuse took place in her room, on her bed, that everyone else was \u201cgone,\u201d and that it happened \u201clots.\u201d She indicated that defendant undid her zipper and took her pants off. She said that \u201cLittle Matt\u201d told her, \u201cI can\u2019t tell.\u201d Further, when asked, \u201cDoes anybody have secrets,\u201d A replied, after a pause, \u201cLittle Matt does.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>Several days later, detectives interviewed defendant at his home. Eventually, defendant admitted to a single \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual encounter with A involving him touching A\u2019s genital area over her clothes and receiving a \u201chand-job.\u201d Defendant, who insisted that A had been the aggressor, repeatedly stated that he \u201cfelt guilty\u201d about what had happened, and, at one point, expressed his belief that A was incapable of understanding what had happened between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\">Defendant was charged with various sex offenses, including first-degree rape, ORS 163.375 (Counts 1 and 2),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> first-degree sodomy, ORS 163.405 (Counts 3 to 6),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and first-degree sexual abuse, ORS 163.427 (Counts 7 to 10).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The state brought two counts for each factual episode, alleging that defendant had committed Counts 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 through \u201cforcible compulsion\u201d of A and, correspondingly, in Counts 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10, that defendant had engaged in the conduct with a person \u201cincapable of consent by reason of mental defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Defendant opted for a bench trial, at which the court heard testimony from various witnesses, including A. The state played a video of the CARES interview for the court, as well as portions of defendant\u2019s interview with the detectives. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal on all counts, arguing that the state had failed to prove (as applicable) the forcible compulsion and mental defect elements of the various crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">The trial court denied that motion in its entirety. With respect to the sufficiency of proof of forcible compulsion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>the court took into account the allegations as to A\u2019s disability, defendant\u2019s status as her care provider, and the incident occurring in her bedroom so that there was \u201cno place * * * for her to retreat.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">With respect to the mental defect issue, the trial court, while observing that it \u201cwould have clearly preferred that the State put on evidence by some sort of expert,\u201d concluded that such evidence was not necessarily required and that there was sufficient evidence that A had a mental condition that rendered her \u201cincapable of consent to the conduct in question.\u201d In that regard, the court specifically referred to the CARES interview and testimony that A lived in a facility that provided \u201c24/7 care\u201d for people with developmental disabilities who \u201cjust cannot take care of themselves on their own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">Ultimately, the trial court found defendant guilty of Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10 (requiring proof of incapacity to consent) and Counts 7 and 9 (requiring proof of forcible compulsion), and not guilty on Counts 1, 3, 5, and 6. The judgment of conviction merged Counts 7 and 9, respectively, with Counts 8 and 10, but otherwise reflected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">On appeal, defendant challenges the denial of the MJOA, arguing, as he did before the trial court, that the state failed to provide sufficient evidence of forcible compulsion and of A\u2019s lack of capacity to consent. We review that denial to determine whether there was legally sufficient evidence from which a rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of each crime proved beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Cunningham, </em>320 Or at 63.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">INCAPACITY TO CONSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">As noted above, defendant was convicted on Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10, which were based on A\u2019s incapacity to consent to certain sexual acts \u201cby reason of mental defect,\u201d <em>see </em>ORS 163.375(1) (first-degree rape); ORS 163.405(1) (first-degree sodomy); ORS 163.427(1) (first-degree sexual abuse); ORS 163.315(1) (\u201cincapacity\u201d statute), and challenges those convictions on the ground that the evidence did not demonstrate that A\u2019s mental condition rendered her incapable of consenting to the sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>We begin with a brief overview of the statutory scheme, including the meaning of, and relationship between, the archaic (and, to contemporary sensibility, offensive) terms \u201cmental defect\u201d and \u201cmentally defective person.\u201d ORS 163.315(1) provides that \u201c[a] person is considered incapable of consenting to a sexual act if the person is * * * [m] entally defective.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> ORS 163.305(3), in turn, defines \u201cmentally defective\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-4\">\u201c\u2018Mentally defective\u2019 means that a person suffers from a mental disease or defect that renders the person incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct of the person.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Thus \u2014 and somewhat confusingly \u2014 a person with a \u201cmental defect\u201d is not necessarily \u201cmentally defective\u201d for purposes of the requisite incapability to consent. Rather, the \u201cmental defect\u201d (a term that is <em>not </em>statutorily defined) must also render \u201cthe person incapable of appraising the nature of [the person\u2019s] conduct.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>In <em>Reed, </em>the Oregon Supreme Court explored that statutory scheme \u2014 and, particularly, amplified the definition of \u201cmentally defective\u201d in ORS 163.305(3) \u2014 under the methodology prescribed by <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). The court\u2019s majority opinion, based on a purely textual review, referred to the common meaning of such terms as <em>\u201cincapable\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., \u201clacking capacity, ability, * * * qualification for the purpose or end in view,\u201d and <em>\u201cappraise\u201d </em>\u2014 viz., to \u201cjudge and analyze * * * worth, significance or status.\u201d <em>Reed, </em>339 Or at 244 (quoting <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>105, 1141 (unabridged ed 2002). The court explained that ORS 163.305(3)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-4\">\u201crefers to a mental defect that prevents one from appraising the nature of one\u2019s own conduct. The \u2018appraisal\u2019 must constitute an exercise of judgment and the making of choices based on an understanding of the nature of one\u2019s own conduct. * * * [W] e view that standard in the context of interactions with other persons, such as offers and proposals from other persons to engage in certain kinds of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\"><em>Reed, </em>339 Or at 244. Consistently with that understanding, the court further explained that the statutory scheme \u201cdoes not support the notion that a person who has a mental disability is necessarily incapable of consenting to sexual relations under any circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, under certain circumstances, \u201ca person who can understand that another person has initiated some kind of sexual activity with that person may be capable of appraising the nature of the conduct and, thus, may be capable of consenting to a sexual act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">The majority opinion proceeded to address whether the state had adduced proof that, \u201cat the time of the alleged crimes, the victim had a mental defect and that that mental defect rendered [the victim] incapable of consent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 245, ultimately concluding that the state had failed to offer evidence demonstrating \u201cthe necessary link,\u201d the nexus, between the victim\u2019s mental condition and her incapacity to \u201cappraise the nature of the sexual conduct,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246-47. In so concluding, the majority emphasized that, although the state had presented some generalized testimony from an expert, constituting a \u201csummary description of the victim\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>mental deficiency,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 246, that witness\u2019s testimony (while perhaps having \u201csome bearing on the victim\u2019s qualifications to manage money or to participate in the work force\u201d) did not, \u201ceither directly or by permissible inference,\u201d pertain to the victim\u2019s \u201cunderstanding of sexual relations or her ability to make choices about having sexual relations with others,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Justice Kistler, joined by Justice Balmer, dissented, endorsing the majority\u2019s interpretation of ORS 163.305(3), but disagreeing that the evidence was legally insufficient to permit a reasonable juror to find the requisite incapacity to consent. That separate opinion\u2019s thoughtful explication of the statute, which is in no way inconsistent with the majority\u2019s construction, also informs our analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">\u201cThe question is whether a reasonable juror also could find that [the victim\u2019s] condition rendered her \u2018incapable of appraising the nature of [her] conduct.\u2019 As the majority recognizes, that question entails two issues. The first is what the phrase \u2018incapable of appraising the nature of the conduct\u2019 means. On that issue, I agree with the majority that the word \u2018appraising\u2019 is key to understanding the meaning of the quoted phrase. As the majority notes, the word \u2018appraise\u2019 means \u2018to judge and analyze the worth, significance or status of.\u2019 <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>105 (unabridged ed 2002). Thus, the question whether a person lacks the capacity to consent by reason of mental defect turns on whether the person is capable of judging or analyzing the worth, significance, or socially accepted status of engaging in particular sexual activity. Put another way, the question is whether the person is capable of assessing the personal and social consequences of his or her decision to engage in that activity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 248-49; <em>see also id. </em>at 251-52 (observing that appraising sexual conduct entails \u201cmakfing] judgments about the complex personal and social issues that surround decisions regarding sexual activity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">We return to this case. Here, as in <em>Reed, </em>there is no dispute that A\u2019s cognitive impairment is so substantial as to constitute a \u201cmental defect.\u201d Rather, the parties\u2019 disagreement centers around whether there was sufficient evidence that A\u2019s cognitive impairment rendered her incapable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>of appraising the nature of her conduct, such that she lacked the capacity to consent to the sexual activity. In other words, the issue is whether the state provided evidence that would allow a rational trier of fact to determine that A met the statutory definition for \u201cmentally defective.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude that the state adduced legally sufficient evidence. Before amplifying that conclusion, we recount the predicate proof, which consists of: (1) evidence of general circumstances pertaining to A\u2019s disability; (2) the CARES interview; (3) A\u2019s testimony at trial; and (4) defendant\u2019s inculpatory admissions, based on his observations and interaction with A, relating to her ability to appreciate the nature of sexual conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">1. <em>General circumstances</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">During the trial, the state presented evidence about A\u2019s disability. Several witnesses testified about the care provided at the group home. Defendant\u2019s former coworker testified that the facility is a \u201cresidential home\u201d for \u201cdevelopmentally disabled individuals.\u201d She also stated that, during defendant\u2019s employment, three clients, including A, resided there, and that, generally, two caregivers were on duty at any given time. The facility\u2019s manager testified that his company operated \u201c24-hour\u201d group homes \u201cfor people with disabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">2. <em>The CARES interview</em></p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">In addition to the other evidence, the state presented the recording of A\u2019s CARES interview as part of its case in chief. We note that, during oral argument, both parties urged this court to view the interview, which we describe in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">At the outset, CARES counselor Jennifer Wheeler and A entered the room and sat at a table facing an observation window. A was holding a stuffed animal (a toy bunny) which she clutched or held in her lap throughout the 35-minute interview. She smiled, initially, at Wheeler. A box of markers and a page from a coloring book were on the table, and A immediately selected a marker and started coloring. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Wheeler explained that they were recording the talk, and asked A if she had any questions. After a long pause, A \u2014 no longer smiling \u2014 turned to Wheeler and said, \u201cLittle Matt.\u201d Wheeler repeated A\u2019s words, and A said it again, more decisively: \u201cLittle Matt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Then Wheeler gently asked, \u201cWhat about Little Matt?\u201d Gesturing with the marker, A responded: \u201cSex me.\u201d Wheeler \u2014 who evidently interpreted that statement as \u201csucks,\u201d rather than \u201csex\u201d \u2014 softly repeated what she thought A had said: \u201cSucks you?\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d A said. Then she pointed in between her legs, and stated, \u201cSex. Penis.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">Wheeler asked who Little Matt was. A stopped coloring, looked directly at Wheeler, and started to answer, but then said, \u201cUm.\u201d A paused for several moments and then, without answering the question, turned back to her coloring. Wheeler tried a different approach: \u201cWhere do you see Little Matt?\u201d A responded immediately: \u201cAt my house sometimes.\u201d Wheeler then asked if A could \u201ctell [her] more about what Little Matt does.\u201d There was another long pause. A, looking downward and rolling her marker back and forth on the table, said \u201cum.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Wheeler changed the subject, asking \u201cWhat\u2019s your full name?\u201d A\u2019s response was unintelligible and did not sound like her name. Wheeler then asked A what her \u201cfirst name\u201d was and, after that question failed to elicit any response, suggested to A, \u201cYou\u2019re [A\u2019s first name],\u201d to which A replied, \u201cYa.\u201d After Wheeler asked, A stated her age (\u201c22\u201d) and wrote down her first name. She did so in painstaking fashion, like a child who is first learning to write. When Wheeler then asked A where she lived, A did not answer; she said \u201cum\u201d and rubbed her forehead and face. Then Wheeler said, \u201cI forgot to tell you this, but if you don\u2019t know the answer \u2014 \u201d and A interrupted, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">A few moments later, Wheeler asked A if she remembered Wheeler\u2019s name, and A indicated that she did not, so Wheeler said, \u201cI\u2019m Jennifer, you can call me Jennifer.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>A nodded. At that point, A seemed to be getting upset. Wheeler asked her how she was doing that day, and she replied, \u201cFine, tired.\u201d Following up, Wheeler asked, \u201cWhat makes you tired?\u201d A replied, \u201cNot sleep well night\u201d and went back to coloring. Then Wheeler asked, \u201cHow come?\u201d but A did not respond, so Wheeler took a different tack: \u201cAre you worried about anything?\u201d \u201cLittle Matt,\u201d A replied. At that point, Wheeler tried several times to get A to elaborate. Eventually, A, who had begun coloring furiously, confirmed that she was worried about \u201cLittle Matt\u201d and \u201csex.\u201d Wheeler asked, \u201cWhat is sex?\u201d A, still coloring, slowly said, \u201cSex... is...,\u201d but did not finish.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The 35-minute conversation continued in that manner, with Wheeler gently posing questions and A visibly struggling to answer even the most basic questions. More often than not, Wheeler\u2019s simple but open-ended questions elicited incomplete or unintelligible responses, or none at all.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Sometimes a halting answer came after Wheeler repeated or rephrased a question.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There were many long pauses where A focused on Wheeler and appeared to be contemplating a question. Other times, she simply withdrew, looking away or coloring intently. A frequently communicated nonverbally, gesturing with her hands, nodding or shaking her head, or through eye contact (or lack thereof). In many instances, she told Wheeler that she did not know the answer or did not want to answer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Those patterns were apparent throughout the interview, and, although A appeared to be more upset \u2014 indeed, traumatized \u2014 when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Wheeler asked about \u201cLittle Matt,\u201d the same dynamic was evident in A\u2019s responses to simple personal questions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Based on the CARES interview recording, an objectively reasonable viewer could find \u2014 indeed, we dare say, given our own review of the recording, would find \u2014 that A\u2019s affect, demeanor, conduct, and statements throughout the interview were characteristic of a young, preschool aged child. When asked what was her favorite TV show, she responded, \u201cSponge Bob\u201d; as noted, she kept her stuffed bunny in her lap throughout the interview, sometimes clutching it when she was distressed. When the interview was drawing to a close, A gave her not-quite-completed coloring sheet (a pink cat) and her paper cup to Wheeler. Those manifestations of distinctly childlike behavior exemplified A\u2019s conduct during the interview, the totality of which was unaffected, simple, and childlike.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">3. A\u2019s <em>testimony</em></p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In her testimony at trial, A repeatedly (in response to unchallenged leading questions from both parties) expressed the view that \u201cLittle Matt\u201d was \u201cmean\u201d and \u201cugly.\u201d A conveyed that she disliked defendant due to the sexual abuse that he had subjected her to, that she had liked him before the abuse took place, and that she was glad that he was gone. In describing what had happened, A, after pointing to her crotch, stated that he had put his penis \u201cinside.\u201d She also indicated that he had touched her chest area. When asked whether that touching was \u201cokay,\u201d A replied \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">On cross-examination, defense counsel asked A a series of questions about relationships, marriage, and \u201chow * * * people get babies.\u201d That line of questioning resulted in the following colloquy, which, given its subject matter, is particularly relevant to the question of whether A lacked the capacity to consent to sexual activity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-8\">\u201cQ. *** [D]o you understand what it means to get married?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>\u201cA.

Yeah.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">4. <em>Defendant\u2019s admissions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">The state introduced portions of defendant\u2019s interview with detectives into evidence, including an excerpt in which defendant conveys his belief that A was incapable of understanding sexual relations. Specifically, when one of the detectives alluded to A\u2019s disability and her inability to understand sexual relations, defendant agreed that A was not capable of understanding such matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">5. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">Given the totality of that evidence \u2014 the intensive, \u201c24/7\u201d nature of the care that A received and the 2:3 caregiver to resident ratio at the group home; A\u2019s behavior, demeanor, and statements during the CARES interview; A\u2019s testimony at trial bearing on her appreciation of matters of a sexual nature; and defendant\u2019s acknowledgment, based on his observation and experiences working with A for a year, that she was not capable of understanding sexual matters \u2014 a rational trier of fact could determine that A\u2019s mental disability rendered her incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct during the events in question and, therefore, incapable of consenting to the sexual activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">Based on that evidence, a trier of fact could reasonably infer that A\u2019s cognitive disability not only substantially impaired her ability to comprehend and respond coherently to simple questions, but also \u2014 critically here \u2014 that it severely limited her understanding of relationships and social interactions, including those of a sexual nature. A\u2019s statements and limited ability to answer many simple questions relating to the abuse, sexual activity, and her body demonstrated that her grasp of such matters was, at most, rudimentary, and would permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that she lacked the capability to appraise her conduct under the circumstances. Indeed, A \u2014 who was questioned at length about those topics \u2014 displayed, at most, a simplistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>understanding of sex and the body, and a childlike approach to relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\">Defendant argues, however, that As statements show that she was \u201caware of the sexual nature of the conduct\u201d and \u201cthat she had the ability to resist [his] advances.\u201d It is true that A was able to report and describe the abuse, that she identified some of defendant\u2019s conduct as \u201csex,\u201d and that, after the abuse took place, she expressed disgust with defendant as well as upset over the alleged abuse. However, as amplified in <em>Reed, </em>our review focuses on whether a reasonable trier of fact could conclude that A\u2019s mental disability rendered her incapable of appraising her own conduct, including the potential personal and social consequences of the sexual activity, during the events in question. To be sure, A\u2019s statements that defendant emphasizes are probative of whether she lacked the requisite inability to consent; however, they are not categorically legally conclusive of A\u2019s capacity to consent. Rather, based on the totality of the evidence, a reasonable trier of fact could infer that, at the time of the events in question, that she was not able to \u201cappraise\u201d her conduct, that she did not understand what was going on, and that she was unable to control the situation \u2014 which is why she was so vulnerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Finally, we emphasize that this case is materially and factually distinctive from <em>Reed. </em>There, as noted, <em>see </em>269 Or App at 672, the Supreme Court majority\u2019s conclusion regarding the insufficiency of the state\u2019s proof emphasized the distinction between generalized proof of mental disability and proof pertaining to the complainant\u2019s requisite, particularized inability to understand or consent to sexual relations. 339 Or at 247. Because the state had adduced only the former, without the latter, its proof was legally insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">Here, by contrast, there was significant evidence that bore upon A\u2019s understanding of sexual relations. A\u2019s testimony at trial almost exclusively related to her understanding of sexuality and romantic relationships, as did sizeable portions of the CARES interview. Moreover, the interview allowed the trier of fact not only to consider A\u2019s responses, but also afforded the opportunity to observe, at length, the outward manifestations of her mental disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Finally, here, unlike in <em>Reed, </em>the state presented evidence of defendant\u2019s admission that A was unable to understand what had happened. That evidence further supports our conclusion. <em>See State v. Barteaux, </em>212 Or App 118, 123, 157 P3d 225, <em>rev den, </em>343 Or 160 (2007) (the defendant\u2019s view that the victim was unable to understand sexual relations \u201csupport [s an] inference that the victim did not understand that she could choose whether to engage in sexual relations with [the] defendant,\u201d demonstrating, with other evidence, the necessary link between the victim\u2019s mental condition and her incapacity to consent).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The trial court did not err in denying the MJOA with respect to Counts 2, 4, 8, and 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">FORCIBLE COMPULSION</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the state\u2019s proof that he committed first-degree sexual abuse \u201cby means of forcible compulsion\u201d (Counts 7 and 9). Although those charges were merged with the convictions on Counts 8 and 10, which we have affirmed, our disposition in that regard does not obviate the need to address the denial of the MJOA with respect to those charges. <em>See State v. Link, </em>346 Or 187, 208 P3d 936 (2009) (where two charges are merged into a single conviction and there is sufficient evidence of one charge but insufficient evidence of the other, the error is not harmless, because the defendant is entitled to a judgment that reflects the correct determination of the charges in the indictment).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">ORS 163.427(1) provides, in relevant part, that a person who subjects another person to sexual contact commits the crime of first-degree sexual abuse when the victim \u201cis subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor.\u201d In the context of this case, to prove the element of forcible compulsion, the state was required to establish that defendant employed \u201cphysical force\u201d that \u201ccompelled the victim to submit to or engage in the [sexual] contact.\" <em>Marshall, </em>350 Or at 227; <em>see </em>ORS 163.305(2)(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In other words, there must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>a \u201ccausal connection\u201d between the forcible compulsion and the specific sexual contact at issue. <em>Marshall, </em>350 Or at 227. Furthermore, the state must show that the physical force used \u201cwas greater in degree or different in kind from the simple movement and contact that is inherent in the act of touching the intimate part of another and that the force was sufficient to compel the victim to submit to or engage in the sexual contact, against the victim\u2019s will.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\"><em>Marshall </em>is exemplary. There, the Oregon Supreme Court evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence against a defendant who had been convicted on two counts of first-degree sexual abuse, in connection with the following events:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">\u201cDefendant, who was 27 at the time, was a friend of the [14-year-old] victim\u2019s mother and had been living with the victim\u2019s family for a short time. Early in the morning on the day in question, the victim woke up and discovered defendant in her bed, partially on top of her, hugging her and trying to kiss her. The victim told him \u2018no\u2019 and tried to push him away. Defendant began to rub the victim\u2019s back, with his hand outside her t-shirt. The victim was \u2018a little bit\u2019 scared and wondered what defendant was doing. Defendant continued to rub the victim\u2019s back for 10 or 15 minutes and then took the victim\u2019s hand and held it on the bed between the victim and himself. Defendant asked the victim about her \u2018last boyfriend\u2019 and about whether she wanted him to help her \u2018get over her fears.\u2019 The victim responded \u2018no.\u2019 Defendant then \u2018grabbed\u2019 the victim\u2019s hand and \u2018forced\u2019 it down the front of his pants, placing it on his erect penis. After a few seconds, the victim \u2018jerked\u2019 her hand away, turned onto her stomach, and faced away from defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">\u201cDefendant began rubbing the victim\u2019s back again, this time with his hand underneath her shirt. Ultimately, he slipped his hand down the back of her sweatpants and put it on her buttocks. The victim said \u2018no\u2019 and scooted away from defendant. Defendant pulled his hand away.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">350 Or at 212-13. Based on those events, the state alleged, first, that the defendant had forcibly compelled the victim to touch his penis and, second, that he had touched the victim\u2019s buttocks by means of forcible compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The Supreme Court in <em>Marshall </em>affirmed the first count, concluding that the evidence \u2014 that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>had forced the victim\u2019s hand down his pants and against his penis, and that the victim had pulled her hand away \u2014 was sufficient, because the defendant\u2019s \u201cuse of his own hands to cause the victim to engage in that sexual contact\u201d constituted physical force \u201cdifferent in degree or kind from the simple movement and contact inherent in the act of the victim touching [the] defendant\u2019s penis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 227-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">With respect to the second charge, however, the court reached the opposite conclusion. It explained that, \u201c[i]n contrast to the physical force * * * used to cause the victim\u2019s hand to come into contact with [the defendant\u2019s] penis, nothing in the record suggests that the second touching itself involved any greater or different force than was inherent in that particular sexual contact \u2014 [the] defendant\u2019s touching of the victim\u2019s buttocks.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228. Although the court acknowledged that the victim \u201cdid not consent to the touching\u201d and that there were <em>\u201cother </em>prior acts involving physical force,\u201d the defendant did not \u201cexert [] any physical force other than that involved in briefly touching the victim\u2019s buttocks,\u201d and there was no evidence of an act of physical force that could have compelled the victim to submit to that particular contact. <em>Id. </em>at 228-29 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In this case, the state was required to prove, as to Count 7, that defendant used physical force to compel A to submit to his touching of her breasts. The evidence of that touching derived from the CARES interview,, in which A conveyed that defendant touched her breasts with his hands and his mouth, but said nothing about defendant using physical force in the course of that touching.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Specifically, there was no evidence that defendant used \u201cgreater or different force than was inherent in\u201d touching A\u2019s breasts. <em>Id. </em>at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Likewise, as to Count 9, the state was required to prove that defendant used physical force to cause A to touch his penis. That charge was not based on any statement by A \u2014 but, instead, was based on defendant\u2019s statement to detectives that he had permitted A (whom he painted as the aggressor) to touch his penis. There was no evidence that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>defendant employed physical force to cause A to engage in that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Thus, the state failed to establish the requisite nexus under <em>Marshall </em>between any use of forcible compulsion and the predicate sexual acts for both first-degree sexual abuse charges.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court erred in denying the MJOA on both Counts 7 and 9, and, notwithstanding the merger of those charges with defendant\u2019s convictions on Counts 8 and 10, the judgment must be modified to reflect an acquittal on Counts 7 and 9 and convictions on Counts 8 and 10. <em>Link, </em>346 Or 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Reversed as to Counts 7 and 9; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> Because we discuss that interview in detail below in analyzing the evidence of A\u2019s capacity to consent, 269 Or App at 674-77, we present only a brief summary of her statements here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"><em> ORS </em>163.375(1) provides, in relevant part, that a person who has sexual intercourse with another person commits the crime of first-degree rape if the victim \u201cis subjected to forcible compulsion\u201d or, alternatively, if the victim \u201cis incapable of consent by reason of mental defect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\"> Counts 3 and 4 alleged that defendant \u201cplac[ed] his penis in contact with [A\u2019s] mouth.\u201d Counts 5 and 6 alleged that he \u201cplac[ed] his penis in contact with [A\u2019s] anus.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">ORS 163.405(1) provides, in relevant part, that a person who engages in \u201cdeviate sexual intercourse with another person or causes another to engage in deviate sexual intercourse\u201d commits the crime of first-degree sodomy if the victim \u201cis subjected to forcible compulsion by the actor\u201d or \u201cis incapable of consent by reason of mental defect.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-10\"> Counts 7 and 8 were based on allegations of defendant \u201ctouching [A\u2019s] breasts\u201d and Counts 9 and 10 alleged that he \u201ccaus [ed A] to touch * * * [his] penis.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b691-6\"> ORS 163.315(1) also provides that persons who are \u201cunder 18 years of age,\u201d \u201cmentally incapacitated,\u201d or \u201cphysically helpless\u201d are incapable of consenting to sexual acts.
