After being pulled over in a stolen pickup truck, defendant was arrested and charged with unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV), ORS 164.135<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Count 1), possession of a stolen vehicle (PSV), ORS 819.300<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (Count 2), and possession of methamphetamine, ORS 475.894 (Count 3). The trial court found defendant guilty of all three charges and, because Count 2 merged with Count 1, defendant was convicted of Count 1, UUV, and Count 3, possession of methamphetamine. On appeal, defendant raises two issues relating to the UUV and PSV charges.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, defendant assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on both charges, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to prove that he knew that the truck was stolen.

Accordingly, we do not reach the issue of whether restitution was warranted, and we reverse the judgment of the trial court as to Counts 1 and 2, remand for resentencing, and otherwise affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">When reviewing the denial of a motion for judgment of acquittal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>to the state to determine whether a rational factfinder could have found that the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State v. Cervantes, </em>319 Or 121, 125, 873 P2d 316 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">During a residential burglary in Salem, the keys to the victim\u2019s Chevrolet Silverado pickup truck, along with the truck itself and other property, were stolen. According to the victim, a family member named Randy was arrested for the burglary and theft of the truck. Approximately 10 days after the burglary, defendant, whom the victim did not know, was seen driving the truck in Multnomah County. Police Officer Dick stopped and arrested defendant. When Dick asked defendant who the truck belonged to, defendant stated that he \u201cgot it from a guy named Dave,\u201d a \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d whom he had met \u201cabout a week and a half to two weeks\u201d prior. He stated that, as far as he knew, the truck belonged to Dave, and Dave had been driving the truck \u201cas long as he had known him.\u201d Defendant did not know Dave\u2019s last name, his telephone number, or where he lived, except that he was \u201cpretty transient,\u201d and defendant thought that Dave was \u201cpretty much\u201d living in another truck of his and \u201ckind of going between two trailers in a trailer park\u201d on Nile Street, in Salem. Dick asked defendant whether he thought it was \u201codd\u201d that Dave was transient, and living in his truck, while the truck that defendant was driving when he was stopped was \u201cpretty nice.\u201d Defendant responded that he \u201chad heard that Dave was going through a divorce, and his wife was pretty much taking him for everything [he was] worth,\u201d and that was why he was living in his truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Defendant told Dick that he had borrowed the truck from Dave in Salem the previous night, so that he could help a woman in Portland buy an all-terrain vehicle (ATV). He stated that he had arranged to go to Portland, get a trailer from the woman, and then meet the seller of the ATV in Longview. He stated that he had met the ATV seller in Longview at \u201csometime around\u201d 2:00 a.m. or 3:30 a.m. that morning, returned to Portland with the ATV, and dropped the trailer and ATV back off at the woman\u2019s house before being stopped by Dick. Defendant told Dick that he was supposed to return the truck to Dave later that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>Another officer, Edwards, arrived and assisted Dick by taking an inventory of the contents of the truck. During that process, Edwards removed the keys from the ignition\u2014 which were \u201cvalid\u201d keys for the truck \u2014 and used them to unlock the door to the canopy that covered the bed of the truck. When he opened the door, he found, \u201cright inside the door,\u201d a \u201ccouple huge sets\u201d of \u201cjiggle keys.\u201d As explained above, \u201cjiggle keys\u201d are \u201cregular old keys that [people] use to steal Honda Accords and Toyota Camrys, because those are easy to steal with any old key\u201d or \u201cother keys that sometimes the car thieves will file down * * * because if they file [a key] down a certain way, they\u2019re able to stick it into the ignition and just jiggle it around and start cars.\u201d The keys found in the truck included different car keys, home keys, and safe keys. Two bags were found behind the \u201cjiggle keys.\u201d The bags contained, among other things, drug paraphernalia and paperwork with defendant\u2019s name on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">Initially, defendant denied that any of the property in the back of the truck was his and stated that he had not been in the back of the truck because Dave had told him not to go there. After Edwards showed him the paperwork that he had found, defendant admitted to lying about being in the back of the truck. He admitted that the bags belonged to him but again denied that the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d were his.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Dick did not recall any damage to the truck, and she testified that there was nothing about the truck that, physically, would have indicated that the truck was stolen, such as a \u201cpunched\u201d ignition, \u201c[hot]wiring\u201d of the truck, or signs of forced entry. When the victim received her truck back, she found a dent in the hood that had not previously been there. The dent cost $1,800 to repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">As relevant to this appeal, defendant was charged with UUV and PSV. The indictment alleged that defendant \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly operate and exercise control over\u201d the truck \u201cwithout the consent of the owner\u201d (Count 1, UUV) and that he \u201cdid unlawfully and knowingly possess a stolen vehicle\u201d (Count 2, PSV). The case was tried to the court. After the state presented its case, defendant moved for a judgment of acquittal, arguing that the state had failed to prove that defendant knew that the truck was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>stolen. Defendant compared the circumstances in this case to <em>State v. Bell, </em>220 Or App 266, 185 P3d 541 (2008), a case in which we found that the evidence was insufficient to support an inference that the defendant had known that the car that he had been driving was stolen. Defendant argued that he, like the defendant in <em>Bell, </em>had \u201cproper keys\u201d and was using a vehicle that showed no signs of vandalism or of being \u201chot-wired.\u201d <em>See Bell, </em>220 Or App at 268. According to defendant, although he, like the defendant in <em>Bell, </em>had a plan to return the truck that the officers found suspicious, the state could not prove the element of knowledge through an inference based on an absence of evidence. In response, the state argued that defendant\u2019s lie to the police about whether he had been in the back of the truck \u201cdestroy[ed] any sort of credibility he had in the story that he provided,\u201d suggesting that he made the story up to \u201ccover his tracks.\u201d The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal and subsequently found defendant guilty of all counts. When announcing its verdict for Counts 1 and 2, the trial court acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s a close question,\u201d and explained that, \u201cthe key to this, in my view, is the proximity of the jiggle keys next to the bag with [defendant\u2019s] name in it that he lied about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">Defendant now appeals, assigning error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for judgment of acquittal on both counts. <em>See </em>ORS 136.445 (a court shall grant a motion for a judgment of acquittal \u201cif the evidence introduced theretofore is such as would not support a verdict against the defendant\u201d). He argues that the state failed to prove UUV and PSV, because the evidence did not establish a shared element of those crimes, as charged in the indictment \u2014 that defendant actually knew that the truck that he was driving was stolen. <em>See Bell, </em>220 Or App at 269 (because the indictment for UUV and PSV alleged that defendant had acted \u201cknowingly,\u201d \u201cthe state was required to prove that defendant <em>actually knew </em>that the car was stolen\u201d (emphasis in original)). In response, the state contends that, based on defendant\u2019s statements to the officers \u2014 including a \u201cvague and unconvincing\u201d description of who owned the truck and an \u201cimplausible\u201d explanation of how he came into possession of the truck \u2014 a rational factfinder could have concluded that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>defendant was covering up his knowledge that the truck was stolen. The state also contends that, because the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d were in plain view, next to defendant\u2019s bag in the back of the truck, a rational factfinder could have concluded that defendant had seen the keys, and that the keys were \u201ca clear signal to him\u201d that the truck was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Thus, we must determine whether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the state, a rational factfinder could have found that the state proved beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant knew the truck was stolen. <em>Cervantes, </em>319 Or at 125. The state may prove a defendant\u2019s knowledge with circumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences flowing from that evidence. <em>See Delgado v. Souders, </em>334 Or 122, 135, 46 P3d 729 (2002) (an element of a criminal offense may be established by \u201ccircumstantial evidence and reasonable inferences arising from such evidence\u201d). However, an inferred fact \u201cmust be one that a rational factfinder can be convinced follows beyond a reasonable doubt from the underlying facts.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>220 Or App at 270. Evidence is \u201cinsufficient to support an inference when the conclusion to be drawn from it requires \u2018too great an inferential leap\u2019 \u2014 that is, when the logic is too strained,\u201d or when it \u201crequires the stacking of inferences to the point of speculation.\u201d <em>State v. Bivins, </em>191 Or App 460, 466-68, 83 P3d 379 (2004). Whether the evidence supports a particular inference is a question of law. <em>Delgado, </em>334 Or at 135.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Our opinions in other UUV and PSV cases are instructive. In <em>Bell, </em>the defendant was convicted of UUV and PSV after he was stopped while driving a car that had been reported stolen. 220 Or App at 268. During a bench trial, the officer testified that the defendant had told him that he had rented the car from a stranger for $50, but the defendant had not explained how or when the vehicle was to be returned to its owner, and the officer had not asked defendant about those matters. <em>Id. </em>The defendant had the proper keys for the car, and the car itself had not been \u201chot-wired,\u201d showed no signs of vandalism, and had Oregon license plates. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the state contended that the evidence that the defendant had no way to recontact the stranger, no deadline to return the vehicle, and no location <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>to deposit the vehicle \u201clead to reasonable inferences that [the] defendant both knew the car was stolen and knew that he did not have permission from the owner to operate the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271. We noted that, even \u201c[a]ssuming for the sake of argument that such evidence would permit the inference that the state suggest [ed],\u201d there was no evidence in the record one way or the other about whether the defendant had a way to recontact the person who rented the car to him. <em>Id. </em>at 271. We also noted that there was \u201cno evidence about whether [the] defendant had a deadline to return the car\u201d or \u201cwhether [the] defendant was told where to return the car.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271-72. We stated that \u201c[t]he state cannot prove its case by relying on inferences to be drawn from an absence of evidence that it failed to establish at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 272. Because the record included no other evidence relevant to the defendant\u2019s knowledge, we concluded that the evidence was \u201csimply insufficient to permit a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that [the] defendant <em>actually knew </em>that the car was stolen and that he did not have the consent of the owner to drive it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Shipe, </em>264 Or App 391, 392-94, 332 P3d 334 (2014), the defendant was convicted of UUV after he was found sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a stolen pickup truck in the parking lot of an apartment complex. In that case, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, was that the defendant drove a stolen truck containing various items of stolen property, bolt cutters, a locked case labeled \u201ccrime committing kit,\u201d blankets, clothing, and baggies of methamphetamine matching baggies found on the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 397. The truck owner\u2019s registration and insurance card were missing, the interior and exterior of the truck had \u201cconsiderable\u201d damage, and the key that the defendant used to operate the truck did not belong to the truck\u2019s owner. <em>Id. </em>The defendant told the arresting officer that he had gotten the truck from someone named \u201cRichey,\u201d but he had actually gotten the truck from someone named \u201cSmith,\u201d who had stolen at least one vehicle before. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">On appeal, we concluded that the record did not include evidence legally sufficient to support a determination that the defendant \u201cactually knew that the truck he was using was stolen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 399. We noted that, although <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>the key did not belong to the truck\u2019s owner, there was \u201cno evidence that the key looked suspicious or that [the] defendant knew that the key did not belong to anybody who was authorized to use the truck.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397. We also noted that there was no evidence regarding the extent of damage to the truck, or whether that damage \u201cwould have suggested that the truck had been stolen\u201d (for example, damage to the windows, locks, ignition, or wiring). <em>Id. </em>at 397-98 (comparing <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Hal, </em>168 Or App 76, 78-79, 7 P3d 535 (2000) (driver of a stolen vehicle \u201cat least had reason to believe\u201d that the vehicle was stolen, in part because the interior had been stripped and wires hung from where the stereo had been), with <em>State ex rel Juv. Dept. v. Mitchell, </em>142 Or App 40, 43, 920 P2d 1103 (1996) (evidence of damage to door locks and ignition was not sufficient to prove \u201cknowledge\u201d element of UUV charge against a passenger when there was no evidence that the damage was obvious or that the passenger had noticed it) and <em>State v. Shuneson, </em>132 Or App 283, 286, 888 P2d 90 (1995) (noting that \u201c[tjhere was nothing unusual about the appearance of the vehicle, such as hot wires, that would have indicated to [the] defendant that it was stolen\u201d)). We also stated that, although the stolen property, bolt cutters, and \u201ccrime committing kit\u201d in the truck may have supported an inference that the defendant knew that <em>that </em>property was stolen, the state had failed to explain how \u201cthe presence of stolen property within the truck would have indicated to [the] defendant that <em>the truck itself </em>was stolen.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 398 (emphasis in original). Finally, regarding the defendant\u2019s lie to the officer about who had given him the truck, we stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-4\">\u201c[a]lthough it may be reasonable to infer that [the] defendant lied to protect Smith in relation to <em>some </em>wrongdoing, it does not follow, as a matter of logical probability, that [the] defendant lied because he knew that Smith had stolen <em>the truck, </em>particularly given the presence of apparently stolen documents, drug residue, and a \u2018crime committing kit\u2019 inside the truck.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 398-99 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\">In this case, the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the state, is that defendant was stopped while driving a stolen truck in Portland, and he told officers a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>detailed, \u201cimplausible\u201d story about borrowing the truck from \u201cDave,\u201d a \u201cpretty transient\u201d \u201cfriend of a friend\u201d in Salem whom the defendant had met only \u201cabout a week and a half to two weeks\u201d prior to his arrest. Defendant said that he had borrowed the truck to help a woman in Portland purchase an ATV, and that he planned to return the truck later that day, but he did not know \u201cDave\u2019s\u201d last name, address, or telephone number. Defendant lied to the officers about having been in the back of the truck, where the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d were found, in plain sight, next to belongings that defendant later admitted were his. Defendant used a valid key to operate the truck. When the truck was returned to the owner, the only damage that she reported was a dent in the truck\u2019s hood.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\">We note that defendant\u2019s \u201cimplausible\u201d story about borrowing the truck from \u201cDave\u201d is not, by itself, sufficient to support a reasonable inference that defendant actually knew that the truck was stolen. <em>See Shipe, </em>264 Or App at 398-99 (the defendant\u2019s lie about who had given him the stolen truck was insufficient to support a reasonable inference that the defendant knew that the truck was stolen). Similarly, evidence that defendant lied to cover up <em>\u201csome </em>wrongdoing\u201d is not, by itself, sufficient to support a reasonable inference that he knew that the truck was stolen. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Therefore, the question in this case is whether a factfinder could reasonably infer from the presence of the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d next to defendant\u2019s belongings in the back of the <em>truck </em>\u2014 in <em>addition to </em>defendant\u2019s implausible story about borrowing the truck from \u201cDave\u201d and his lies about being in the back of the truck and owning any of the property in the back of the truck \u2014 that defendant knew that the truck was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">We conclude that, although a factfinder may reasonably infer, from the evidence presented, that defendant had knowledge of <em>\u201csome </em>wrongdoing, it does not follow, as a matter of logical probability,\u201d that defendant knew that the truck was stolen. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). Arguably, a factfinder may reasonably infer, from the proximity of the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d to defendant\u2019s bags, defendant\u2019s lie about being in the back of the truck, and defendant\u2019s implausible story about borrowing the truck from \u201cDave,\u201d that defendant had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>seen the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d and was trying to hide his knowledge of them from the officers because he knew that the person he had gotten the truck from was involved in the theft of vehicles. But the state has failed to explain how the presence of the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d within the truck would have indicated to defendant that <em>this </em>truck was stolen. Defendant operated the truck itself with a valid key, and not the \u201cjiggle keys\u201d found in the back of the truck, and there was no other evidence that the appearance of the truck, or the way that defendant operated the truck, would have indicated that the truck had been stolen (such as evidence of damage to the truck\u2019s locks, windows, or ignition). Thus, based on the evidence presented at trial, an inference that defendant actually knew that the truck was stolen is not \u201cone that a rational factfinder can be convinced follows beyond a reasonable doubt from the underlying facts.\u201d <em>Bell, </em>220 Or App at 270. In other words, the evidence in this case \u201crequires the stacking of inferences to the point of speculation,\u201d <em>Bivins, </em>191 Or App at 468, and is therefore insufficient to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant knew that the truck was stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">Because the state failed to present sufficient evidence that defendant knew that the truck was stolen, the trial court erred in denying defendant\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal for both UUV and PSV.
