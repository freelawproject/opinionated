Estate of Angeline Dillard, </em>267 Or App 791, 341 P3d 187 (2014). In that decision, we agreed with defendant that his reservation of mineral rights \u201c\u2018includes common rock such as basalt\u2019\u201d and, accordingly, \u201creverse[d] the part of the judgment declaring that the reservation of mineral rights does not include \u2018rock *** used for construction purposes.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 799. We remanded \u201cfor further proceedings consistent with [our] opinion,\u201d but we did not address whether the trial court also erred in denying defendant\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment \u2014 because we did not understand defendant to have assigned error to the denial of his cross-motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Skidmore urges us to reconsider our decision and hold that the trial court\u2019s denial of his cross-motion for summary judgment was error. Plaintiff Copeland has not responded. We allow the petition for reconsideration but adhere to our original decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">Copeland\u2019s claim for declaratory relief consisted of two counts: (1) that defendants\u2019 mineral reservation \u201ccreated no right or interest in the rock\u201d and (2) that none of the defendants has a right in the property, \u201cincluding but not limited to any interest pursuant to the mineral reservation.\u201d Skidmore\u2019s answer contained no counterclaims. His motion sought \u201csummary judgment against [p]laintiffs complaint, establishing [defendant Skidmore\u2019s mineral rights in the property at issue and preventing Copeland Sand &amp; Gravel, Inc. from mining the minerals on said property, including the basaltic rock.\u201d He asked the court to \u201cdeny [plaintiff\u2019s claims in their entirety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">On appeal, Skidmore presented a single assignment of error: \u201cThe trial court erred in determining that the mineral rights reservation at issue did not include the right to mine common rock such as basalt.\u201d He asked the court to \u201creverse and instead rule that the mineral reservation at issue includes common rock such as basalt.\u201d That is precisely what we held, <em>Copeland, 267 </em>Or App at 799, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"906\">*906</page-number>the declaration entered on remand must be consistent with our holding. On the record and argument presented to us, however, it is not clear whether our ruling fully resolves Skidmore\u2019s motion for summary judgment, or whether there is merely an area of intersection between the two. The extent to which our ruling resolves the parties\u2019 disputes is an issue for remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-3\">Reconsideration allowed; former opinion adhered to.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b925-7\"> <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(3) (requiring opening briefs to separately assign error to and \u201cidentify precisely\u201d each ruling that is being challenged).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
