Defendant later admitted that he had violated two of the conditions of his probation. The trial court revoked defendant\u2019s probation and purported to sentence him on each of the four underlying convictions. Accordingly, as part of its judgment on revocation, the court \u201csentenced\u201d defendant to 60 days of jail on one of the convictions and to 18-month prison terms (plus post-prison supervision) on each of the other three convictions. After finding that \u201cthis all did not occur in one continuous course of conduct,\u201d the court ordered two of the 18-month prison terms to be served consecutively pursuant to ORS 137.123. Defendant appeals, challenging imposition of the consecutive terms of incarceration. As explained below, we conclude that the trial court erred by imposing consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123. Indeed, the court erred by sentencing defendant at all, as defendant had already been sentenced on his felony convictions when he received his probationary sentences at the time of conviction. Instead of sentencing defendant when it revoked his probation, the trial court should have imposed revocation sanctions. We reverse and remand for the trial court to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The facts pertinent to this appeal are procedural and undisputed. Defendant was charged with two counts of unauthorized use of a vehicle (UUV), second-degree burglary, and first-degree criminal mischief, all Class C felonies. One of the UUV counts (Count 1) related to defendant\u2019s unlawful use, in June 2012, of a truck that belonged to Lithia Motors. The prosecutor later asserted (and defendant did not dispute) that defendant committed that crime by entering the Lithia Motors lot through an unlocked fence, taking keys to the truck, and driving the truck off the lot, causing some damage to it. The other three charges \u2014 Counts 2 (burglary), 3 (UUV), and 4 (criminal mischief) \u2014 related to events that occurred one night in August 2012. The prosecutor asserted (again without contradiction by defendant) that defendant returned to Lithia Motors, took keys to another truck, and drove the truck off the lot by crashing it through a locked gate, causing \u201cpretty extensive damage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>The state and defendant entered plea negotiations, which culminated in defendant signing a plea petition that described the negotiated agreement as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">\u201c[T]he parties agree that counts 2, 3 and 4 [related to the August incident] fall under BM 57[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] with each count having a presumptive 18 month prison sentence. The defense represents that defendant has reunited with his parents, enrolled in school, and [is] back on track. Accordingly, the state and defendant agree to a downward dispositional departure to probation for a period of 36 months on all counts. Defendant will be exempt from structured sanctions so that any probation violation will be returned to the court at which time defendant can expect that the presumptive sentences will be imposed. The parties agree to 20 days jail and 100 hours of community service as a condition of probation, as well as restitution * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The trial-court file includes another, unsigned document titled \u201cWAIVER OF INDICTMENT AND PLEA,\u201d which includes a statement \u2014 apparently related to the parties\u2019 negotiations \u2014 that defendant would \u201cgo to the Department of Corrections for 18 months for any violations of probation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">During a change-of-plea hearing, the court questioned defendant about his desire to waive his right to a jury trial and to enter a guilty plea, and it cautioned defendant that it had not agreed to be bound by the parties\u2019 sentencing recommendation. The court also ensured that defendant understood that, by signing the plea petition, he would acknowledge that Counts 2, 3, and 4 \u201cwould fall under Ballot Measure 57, with each having a presumptive prison sentence of 18 months.\u201d The court further explained that, if it sentenced defendant to probation and his probation was later revoked, defendant would \u201ccome back to this Court for sentencing to prison.\u201d Defendant then pleaded guilty to each of the four counts and the case proceeded to sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>After hearing defendant\u2019s explanation of what led him to commit the crimes, the court announced that it would follow the parties\u2019 sentencing recommendation. Speaking directly to defendant, however, the court emphasized that, if defendant\u2019s probation was revoked in the future, the court would \u201csend [him] to prison\u201d without \u201ca second chance.\u201d After orally describing the probationary sentences that it would impose, the court again explained to defendant that, if he violated his probation and the probation was revoked, he would be returning to court \u201cfor sentencing in the amount of at least 18 months of prison with the Department of Corrections.\u201d The court said that it did not know \u201cif any one of them [would] be run consecutive, but at least 18 months with the Department of Corrections.\u201d Defendant acknowledged the court\u2019s explanation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The court then entered a judgment that reflected defendant\u2019s guilty pleas and that sentenced defendant in accordance with the parties\u2019 negotiated agreement. Thus, on Count 1, the court sentenced defendant to 36 months of probation (a durational departure from the presumptive sentence), with 20 days of jail time and 100 hours of community service. On Counts 2, 3, and 4, the court found that \u201cthe presumptive sentence [of incarceration] prescribed in ORS 137.717\u201d applied because of \u201cdefendant\u2019s previous criminal convictions,\u201d but it imposed dispositional departure sentences of 36 months of probation on each count, with 20 days of jail time (the time on all counts to be served concurrently). Finally, the court ordered defendant to pay fines and restitution. The court imposed general conditions of probation, including that defendant not possess weapons, firearms, or dangerous animals. The judgment also memorialized the trial court\u2019s authority \u201cto impose sanctions\u201d for any probation violation; it did not state that the trial court would have authority to impose sentence if it revoked defendant\u2019s probation (as explained below, any such statement would have been incorrect).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">About five months after the judgment was entered, the trial court issued an order to show cause why defendant\u2019s probation should not be revoked, based on the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>allegations that defendant had violated his probation in two ways: by failing to pay fines or restitution and by possessing weapons, firearms, or dangerous animals. At a hearing on the show-cause order, defendant admitted those allegations. The court then asked the parties whether there were \u201cany negotiations in this case.\u201d Defense counsel responded that the state \u201cwould agree to not seek greater than 3 6-month sentence\u201d and defendant was \u201cfree to argue for less.\u201d Defendant reiterated his admission to the two probation violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Later that day, the parties appeared before the judge who originally had imposed the probationary sentences, based on that judge\u2019s desire \u201cto do this sentence.\u201d At that hearing, the prosecutor asserted that \u201cthings [had] not gone well\u201d for defendant, who had been accused of stealing another truck as well as an expensive piece of jewelry, arming himself with pepper spray, and not paying restitution. The prosecutor recommended that the court order defendant to serve 36 months in prison and one year of post-prison supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">For the remainder of the hearing, the prosecutor, defense counsel, and the trial court apparently operated under the assumption that the court would be imposing sentence on the four convictions, pursuant to the statutes that would govern an initial sentencing at the time of conviction. For example, the court asked if it would \u201cbe sentencing on all four counts\u201d and the prosecutor said that it would \u201c[b]e sentencing, yes.\u201d The prosecutor then suggested that \u201cconsecutive sentences\u201d would be appropriate on Counts 2 and 4 because defendant\u2019s actions demonstrated his \u201cwillingness to commit more than one criminal offense\u201d and caused different harms. Defense counsel argued that, because the acts underlying Counts 2, 3, and 4 all \u201cwere committed in the *** same criminal episode,\u201d the \u201csentences\u201d should be \u201cmade concurrent to one another for 18 months total.\u201d Alternatively, defense counsel argued that the court should exercise its discretion \u201cto run that concurrent\u201d even if the sentences could be made consecutive. Both parties\u2019 arguments implicitly were directed to ORS 137.123, the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>that spells out the circumstances under which trial courts may and may not impose consecutive sentences.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">After hearing from the lawyers and from defendant personally, the trial court explained that it was going to revoke defendant\u2019s probation because the purposes of probation were not being served. On Count 1, the trial court ordered defendant to serve 60 days in the custody of the Lane County Supervisory Authority. On each of Counts 2, 3, and 4, the court explained that it would \u201csentence\u201d defendant to the presumptive term of 18 months\u2019 imprisonment, with one year of post-prison supervision. The court ordered that the prison term on Count 3 be served concurrently with the prison term on Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">On Count 4, however, the court ordered that the prison term be served consecutively to the prison term imposed on Count 2. The court based its imposition of consecutive terms of incarceration on a finding \u201cthat this all did not occur in one continuous course of conduct.\u201d Accordingly, the court ordered \u201cthat [18-month] sentence\u201d on Count 4 to be served \u201cconsecutive to the previous counts,\u201d for a \u201ctotal of 36 months with the Department of Corrections.\u201d The court\u2019s written revocation judgment reflects its oral rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>In his first assignment of error on appeal, defendant challenges the court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences on Counts 2 and 4. Citing the court\u2019s finding that \u201cthis all did not occur in one continuous course of conduct,\u201d defendant asserts that the court must have imposed consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123(2), which authorizes such sentences for offenses \u201cthat do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d According to defendant, the court erred by relying on that statutory provision because \u201cthe facts in the record do not support a finding that Count 4 did not occur in one continuous course of conduct as Count 2.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">In response, the state does not attempt to defend imposition of the consecutive prison terms under ORS 137.123(2). That is, the state does not argue that the record supports a finding that the convictions on Counts 2 and 4\u2014 which both related to the single August 2012 incident at Lithia Motors \u2014 did not arise from \u201cthe same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d The state\u2019s reticence is understandable, as the record does not support such a finding. Accordingly, defendant is correct that the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive sentences cannot stand \u2014 at least, not unless one of the state\u2019s proffered alternative bases for affirmance, discussed below, has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">We turn to two arguments that the state makes in urging us to affirm the judgment on a different ground. First, with respect to sentencing under ORS 137.123, the state contends that we should interpret the trial court\u2019s reasoning as being based on subsection (5) of the statute, not on subsection (2). That is, the state argues, the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>finding that \u201cthis all did not occur in one continuous course of conduct\u201d was actually a colloquial, shorthand way of stating that \u201cthe criminal mischief [Count 4] was \u2018not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision <em>in the course of </em>the commission of a more serious crime.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis in state\u2019s brief; quoting ORS 137.123(5)(a).) We disagree. In our view, the trial court\u2019s finding cannot fairly be read to refer to anything other than ORS 137.123(2); it certainly does not reflect any judicial determination of the relative seriousness of the criminal behavior underlying Counts 2 and 4 or suggest that the court had rejected the idea that one of defendant\u2019s acts was \u201cmerely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Second, and alternatively, the state asks us to affirm the judgment on a \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d basis. Relying on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>State v. Newell, </em>238 Or App 385, 242 P3d 709 (2010), the state argues that ORS 137.123 does not apply to this case at all, because that statute \u201cdoes not control probation revocation sanctions.\u201d Instead, the state argues, \u201cOAR 213-012-0040(2) controls whether probation-revocation sanctions may be imposed consecutively.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The state is correct that ORS 137.123 does not control the sanctions that a court may impose after revoking a defendant\u2019s probation on a felony conviction. As we explained in <em>Newell, </em>both statutes and case law distinguish \u201cbetween sentencing (or resentencing) and proceedings held concerning probation violations, and the sanctions that may be imposed as a result,\u201d at least for convictions for felonies committed on or after November 1, 1989. <em>Newell, </em>238 Or App at 393. In particular, ORS 137.545(5)(b) provides that, after revoking the probation of a defendant sentenced for such a felony, the trial court may \u201cimpose a sanction as provided by rules of the Oregon Criminal Justice Commission.\u201d When a court revokes probation on a felony conviction and decides how the defendant should be punished for the probation violation, the court is not imposing sentence on the original conviction. Rather, it is sanctioning the defendant for having violated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the conditions of his or her probation. <em>State v. Lane, </em>260 Or App 549, 555, 318 P3d 750, <em>rev allowed, </em>355 Or 317 (2014). Accordingly, ORS 137.123, which governs the imposition of consecutive <em>sentences, </em>does not apply in felony probation-revocation proceedings. <em>Newell, </em>238 Or App at 393-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">Instead, when a trial court revokes a probationary sentence on a felony conviction, its decision about what revocation sanctions to impose is governed by rules of the Criminal Justice Commission, which also distinguish between consecutive sentences and consecutive incarceration sanctions. <em>Id. </em>at 393-94. As pertinent here, OAR 213-012-0040(2) specifies the circumstances under which a trial court may choose to impose consecutive incarceration sanctions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-5\">\u201cWhen an offender is serving multiple terms of probationary supervision, the sentencing judge may impose revocation sanctions for supervision violations as provided by OAR 213-010-0002 for the violation of each separate term of probationary supervision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201c(a) If more than one term of probationary supervision is revoked for a single supervision violation, the sentencing judge shall impose the incarceration sanctions concurrently.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-7\">\u201c(b) If more than one term of probationary supervision is revoked for separate supervision violations, the sentencing judge may impose the incarceration sanctions concurrently or consecutively.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-8\">That rule references OAR 213-010-0002, which provides, in pertinent part, that, for defendants whose probationary sentence was a departure from a presumptive prison term, the revocation sanction \u201cshall be a prison term up to the maximum presumptive prison term which could have been imposed initially, if the presumptive prison term exceeds 12 months.\u201d OAR 213-010-0002(2). The rule additionally provides that, when a court imposes a revocation sanction, it \u201cshall also set a term of post-prison supervision * * * \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b255-9\">Referencing OAR 213-012-0040(2), the state argues that we should affirm the trial court\u2019s imposition of consecutive \u201csentences\u201d in this case because the trial court could have imposed consecutive probation-revocation sanctions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>and could have done so without making the kind of findings about the circumstances of the crimes that are pertinent to the imposition of consecutive sentences under ORS 137.123. That is, the state contends that, because \u201cdefendant admitted to two probation violations \u2014 failure to pay fees and fines and possession of a weapon * * * the trial court was permitted to impose two consecutive probation-revocation sanctions\u201d and, essentially, \u201cdid so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We decline to affirm on that \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d basis. First, the judgment revoking probation incorrectly states that defendant now has been given \u201csentence [s] \u201d that include prison terms on Counts 2, 3, and 4. The trial court lacked authority to impose sentence on defendant after it revoked his probation, and the judgment is incorrect \u2014 it is not \u201cright\u201d \u2014 insofar as it reflects that unauthorized action.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Second, and more fundamentally, we reject the state\u2019s argument because \u2014 even assuming that the trial court had authority to order defendant to serve consecutive 18-month terms of incarceration as probation sanctions under OAR 213-012-0040 \u2014 it is not clear that the trial court would have done so if it had understood that it was only imposing probation-revocation sanctions, and not imposing sentence. The two actions implicate different concerns. Sentences punish criminal activity that has resulted in convictions. <em>See State v. Hart, </em>299 Or 128, 138, 699 P2d 1113 (1985) (\u201ctraditional goals of sentencing\u201d include such matters as \u201crehabilitation of the defendant and deterrence to impress upon the defendant the seriousness and cost of his offense\u201d); <em>cf. </em>Or Const, Art I, \u00a7 15 (\u201cLaws for the punishment of crime shall be founded on these principles: protection of society, personal responsibility, accountability for one\u2019s actions and reformation.\u201d). The imposition of sanctions after revocation of probation on a felony conviction has a different purpose: \u201cto punish the conduct constituting the probation violation, <em>not </em>to punish the crimes of conviction.\u201d <em>Lane, </em>260 Or App at 554 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">In this case, the court purported to impose <em>sentences </em>after defendant violated his probation conditions, and it did so after hearing the prosecutor again describe the circumstances of defendant\u2019s original crimes \u2014 not just the ways in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>which defendant had violated his probation. Had the court and the parties understood that the court could not then sentence defendant for the criminal activity underlying his convictions, but could only punish his probation violations pursuant to OAR 213-010-0002 and OAR 213-012-0040(2), the record might have developed differently. For example, the parties might have provided the court with more details about defendant\u2019s probation violations. Moreover, a differently developed record might have materially influenced the trial court\u2019s ultimate decision. That is, it is reasonable to infer that, had the trial court properly considered only what sanctions would appropriately punish defendant for \u201cthe conduct constituting the probation violation,\u201d <em>Lane, </em>260 Or App at 554, and not what it belatedly might view as appropriate punishment for defendant\u2019s original crimes, the court might not have imposed the same consecutive 18-month terms of incarceration. Accordingly, we cannot affirm on a \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d basis. <em>See Outdoor Media Dimensions Inc. v. State of Oregon, </em>331 Or 634, 659-60, 20 P3d 180 (2001) (describing circumstances under which appellate courts may apply the \u201cright for the wrong reason\u201d doctrine).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b249-7\"> We understand \u201cBM 57\u201d to refer to Ballot Measure 57 (2008), which, among other things, increased the presumptive sentences for people convicted of certain property crimes who have certain previous convictions. Or Laws 2008, ch 14, \u00a7 7. The court also referred to \u201cBallot Measure 57\u201d during the change-of-plea hearing, as well as to ORS 137.717(l)(b), where the pertinent parts of the measure are codified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b252-6\"> As pertinent here, ORS 137.123 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201c(1) ** * * The court may provide for consecutive sentences only in accordance with the provisions of this section. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201c(2) If a defendant is simultaneously sentenced for criminal offenses that do not arise from the same continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct, * * * the court may impose a sentence concurrent with or consecutive to the other sentence or sentences.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-11\">\u201c(5) The court has discretion to impose consecutive terms of imprisonment for separate convictions arising out of a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct only if the court finds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-12\">\u201c(a) That the criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated was not merely an incidental violation of a separate statutory provision in the course of the commission of a more serious crime but rather was an indication of defendant\u2019s willingness to commit more than one criminal offense; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-13\">\u201c(b) The criminal offense for which a consecutive sentence is contemplated caused or created a risk of causing greater or qualitatively different loss, injury or harm to the victim or caused or created a risk of causing loss, injury or harm to a different victim than was caused or threatened by the other offense or offenses committed during a continuous and uninterrupted course of conduct.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b253-6\"> Because this case involves a stipulated sentencing agreement approved by the court, we have considered whether we have authority to review defendant\u2019s challenge to the judgment revoking his probation. <em>See </em>ORS 138.222(2)(d) (providing that a court may not review a sentence imposed for a felony conviction \u201cresulting from a stipulated sentencing agreement between the state and the defendant which the sentencing court approves on the record\u201d). Here, although defendant arguably stipulated that presumptive terms of incarceration would be imposed if his probation was revoked, he did not stipulate that any terms of incarceration imposed as probation-revocation sanctions would run consecutively. Accordingly, we have authority to review the trial court\u2019s imposition of those consecutive terms. <em>See State v. Ivie, </em>213 Or App 198, 202, 159 P3d 1257 (2007) (under ORS 138.222(2)(d), \u201c[i]f some aspects of a sentence comport with the stipulation and others do not, the portions that were not part of the stipulation are reviewable\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b254-6\"> In all events, as we explain below, the court lacked authority to impose sentence on defendant under ORS 137.123 or otherwise.
