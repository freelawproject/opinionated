The victims were two girls ages 12 and 7. On appeal, defendant seeks reversal of the convictions. In his first, second, and third assignments of error, defendant challenges the trial court\u2019s admission into evidence of a videotaped interrogation of defendant by Detective Gates.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The videotape, which was played for the jury, includes statements by Gates expressing her views that defendant was lying and that the victims were telling the truth. Defendant argues that those statements were prejudicial comments on the credibility of defendant and the victims and should have been excluded under OEC 403. The state responds that defendant\u2019s OEC 403 argument was unpreserved and that the trial court\u2019s admission of the evidence was not plain error. We agree with the state, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The conduct at issue occurred at the home of D, the 12-year-old victim. She lived there with her mother, father, and two brothers. A, the seven-year-old victim, is related to the family and stayed at the home one night. Defendant was a close friend of the family and also stayed that night. Both D and A later reported to family members that defendant had touched them. D said that she awoke to find defendant rubbing her thigh near her genital area. A said that defendant had touched her under her clothes. She later told a CARES interviewer that defendant had touched her on her \u201cpee\u201d with his hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Gates received a report of suspected abuse from the Department of Human Services and attended A\u2019s CARES interview. Gates later interviewed defendant; at the end of that approximately two-hour interview, she arrested defendant. That videotaped interview is the subject of this appeal. In the interview, defendant repeatedly denied the allegations. Gates made numerous comments indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>that she believed the victims and that defendant was not being truthful. The following examples are illustrative:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-4\">\u201c[GATES:] [B]ut if I have someone saying a completely different story than everyone else \u2014 -I have a little kid saying you did something, and she\u2019s crying and scared, doesn\u2019t want to go back to grandma and grandpa\u2019s, has no reason to lie about this, has no reason to pin it on you. She doesn\u2019t know you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-5\">\u201c* * * I have a little girl that\u2019s saying what she\u2019s saying, and I\u2019ve got a video of it, and it\u2019s extremely telling [because] it\u2019s heartbreaking. The girl had no history of, you know, lying, making accusations against people that have turned out to be lies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cWe have [D] that you sat here yourself and said she\u2019s a nice kid.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-7\">\u201c[GATES:] So here\u2019s how I work. When I talk to people, usually the suspect is the very last person I talk to, [because] I want to know as much about you as I can. I want to know much \u2014 -as much about that incident, what people saw and what people heard, you know, what you talked to people about since that happened. I want to know everything. I want to know about your past. I want to know what you\u2019re doing now. And I want to talk to you, and talk to you like I don\u2019t know any of it, and see if you\u2019re going to lie to me about stuff you don\u2019t even have to lie about. And that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ve done. And so some of [the] stuff, I know you\u2019ve been honest about. And I can see you act a certain way when you say something that\u2019s truthful, and I see you act a different way when you\u2019re saying something that I already know is a lie. So it\u2019s kind of nice because you\u2019re lying, thinking you\u2019re helping yourself, but it\u2019s showing me what you look like and how your body reacts when you lie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-8\">\u201c[GATES:] And that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. If you\u2019re just going to say, \u2018Oh, everybody\u2019s a liar. All these people that I trust that are family to me, that consider me an uncle, and, you know, I\u2019m like a son to them, they\u2019re all suddenly lying to me. They all lied about me, they have no reason to be lying about me, because they just are. Believe me, I didn\u2019t do it. I wasn\u2019t there. * * *\u2019 Why should I trust you if you lied to me. You\u2019re telling me to go against logic.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>\u201cNow, if you just told me, \u2018Yeah, I did it.\u2019 This is why and this is who I am,\u2019 then maybe I could believe who you are. But right now, you\u2019re already lying to me, so why would I believe who you\u2019re saying you are? It goes against what you\u2019re showing me that you are.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">Defendant moved to redact parts of the videotape that he contended were inadmissible for several reasons. In an addendum to his motion, defendant cited specific objections to 14 excerpts of the recording, including those quoted above. The only argument that is relevant to this appeal is defendant\u2019s contention that Gates\u2019s comments on the credibility or truthfulness of other witnesses were not admissible. The following two paragraphs are the entirety of what defendant argued to the trial court on that issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">\u201cThroughout the interview, Detective Gates invites the defendant to offer his opinion about the character or credibility of other witnesses. She baits the defendant to label other witnesses as \u2018liars.\u2019 The detective also offers her own frequent assessment of whether a particular witness\u2019 story is credible. In at least one exchange, she improperly vouched for the credibility of [A] and [D] by referencing the out-of-court statements of unidentified third persons who believe the children are \u2018not liars\u2019 who \u2018make up false accusations about people\u2019 and who have no allegations of abuse of any kind in the past. These exchanges and comments are inadmissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-6\">\u201c\u2018The law applicable to this issue is well understood. This court has long held that one witness may not give an opinion on whether he or she believes another witness is telling the truth.\u2019 <em>State v. Lupoli, </em>348 Or 346, [357, 234 P3d 117] (2010). The Oregon Supreme Court has repeatedly condemned the use of even isolated incidents of vouching testimony. <em>State v. Milbradt, </em>305 Or 621, [629, 756 P2d 620] (1988). (No witness <em>\u2018may render an opinion on whether a witness is credible in any trial conducted in this state...\u2019 </em>[(emphasis in original)].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion as to the admissibility of Gates\u2019s comments in the video, ruling, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-8\">\u201cTHE COURT: The rest of the thing * * * falls into two categories: * * * number one, * * * this is not * * * where * * * <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>one witness is testifying, giving his opinion as to another witness\u2019s credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\">\u201cIt\u2019s [a] fair comment when the officer during [her] interrogation says, \u2018Well, somebody else told me this and somebody else told me that.\u2019 And so I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a violation of the rule and so [she\u2019ll] be allowed to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">\u201cAs far as the officer\u2019s making statements that some witnesses said this and some witnesses said that, which is, of course, somewhat hearsay, * * * I think [because] it\u2019s * * * taken in the context of the interrogation the intent is to try to get the defendant\u2019s response.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">On appeal, defendant argues that the referenced parts of the recording were inadmissible under OEC 403 because their probative value was \u201csubstantially outweighed\u201d by the danger of unfair prejudice to defendant. The state objects that defendant\u2019s argument is unpreserved because defendant did not raise OEC 403 before the trial court; defendant only invoked the general rule that witnesses may not opine on the credibility of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">As noted above, defendant\u2019s argument to the trial court was very brief. In the addendum to his motion, where he simply listed the excerpts of the recording to which he was objecting, defendant included a bare citation to OEC 403. Defendant did not, however, develop any argument under OEC 403 in his brief to the trial court, although he did raise OEC 403 in support of some other evidentiary challenges. Nor did defendant cite the case on which he relies heavily in his appeal, <em>State v. Southard, </em>347 Or 127, 140-41, 218 P3d 104 (2009) (holding that medical diagnosis of child sex abuse is inadmissible, under OEC 403, in the absence of physical evidence, because it poses the risk that the \u201cjury will not make its own credibility determination, which it is fully capable of doing, but will instead defer to the expert\u2019s implicit conclusion that the victim\u2019s reports of abuse are credible\u201d). Instead, as noted above, defendant simply argued that Gates\u2019s comments were \u201cinadmissible,\u201d citing <em>Lupoli </em>and <em>Milbradt </em>for the rule that witnesses may not testify as to other witnesses\u2019 credibility. <em>See, e.g., Lupoli, </em>348 Or at 357 (\u201cThis court has long held that one witness may not give an opinion on whether he or she believes another witness is telling the truth.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>The principle that defendant argued to the trial court is different from what he now argues. Below, defendant relied on the <em>Lupoli </em>rule that witnesses may not opine on other witnesses\u2019 credibility; defendant now makes an OEC <em>403\u00a1Southard </em>\u201cunfair prejudice\u201d argument. The principles are distinct, as illustrated in <em>Lupoli, </em>where the Supreme Court declined to engage in an OEC 403 analysis (because the defendant had failed to assign error on that ground), <em>id. </em>at 357, but proceeded to hold that the trial court had erred in allowing \u201cvouching\u201d testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 362. As the state correctly points out, defendant\u2019s arguments below did not give the trial court an opportunity to undertake an OEC 403 analysis. If defendant had made an OEC 403 argument, the trial court would have had occasion to weigh the probative value against the asserted prejudice, make a record of its findings, and give an appropriate limiting instruction if the court deemed it necessary. Instead, the trial court never addressed OEC 403 or <em>Southard, </em>because defendant did not raise them.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">Because defendant did not make the argument that he now makes on appeal, we may entertain defendant\u2019s new argument only if defendant can establish plain error on the part of the trial court. <em>State v. Higgins, </em>258 Or App 177, 179, 308 P3d 352 (2013) (\u201cWe may consider, under ORAP 5.45(a), unpreserved issues if the error (1) is one of law; (2) is apparent, in that the legal point is obvious, not reasonably in dispute; and (3) appears on the face of the record, such that we need not go outside the record or choose between competing inferences to find it, and the facts that comprise the error are irrefutable.\u201d (quoting <em>State v. Brown, </em>310 Or 347, 355, 800 P2d 259 (1990) (internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted.))). Defendant has not requested plain-error review, however. Accordingly, we decline to further address the issue. <em>See, e.g., State v. Tilden, </em>252 Or App 581, 589, 288 P3d 567 (2012) (\u201cWe ordinarily will not proceed to the question of plain error unless an appellant has explicitly asked us to do so, and for good reason \u2014 it is incumbent upon the appellant to explain to us why an error satisfies the requisites of plain error and, further, why we should exercise our discretion to correct that error.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>On appeal, defendant merges the <em>Lupoli </em>argument and the OEC <em>403/Southard </em>argument together, even though, as just explained, they are not the same. Although we will not consider defendant\u2019s unpreserved argument under OEC 403, to the extent that defendant intended to reprise the argument that he actually made below \u2014 that Gates\u2019s comments were inadmissible \u201cvouching,\u201d regardless of any balancing test under OEC 403 \u2014 we note that the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Lupoli </em>line of cases has involved in-court testimony, not (as in this case) out-of-court statements admitted as evidence. <em>See, e.g., State v. Middleton, </em>294 Or 427, 657 P2d 1215 (1983); <em>State v. Odoms, </em>313 Or 76, 829 P2d 690 (1992). In <em>Lupoli, </em>the Supreme Court held that, in addition to barring opinion testimony from one trial witness as to the credibility of another trial witness, the rule also prohibits a trial witness from opining on the credibility of a nonwitness complainant. 348 Or at 365 (\u201cIn fact, all of the reasons for preventing one witness from vouching for another witness\u2019s credibility at trial apply with equal or greater force when the nonwitness is an unavailable complainant. In that circumstance, the defendant does not have the ability to confront the complainant or to impeach the accusations against him or her.\u201d). <em>Lupoli </em>left intact, however, the holding in <em>Odoms </em>that the prohibition does not encompass statements commenting on credibility that were made out of court. <em>Odoms, </em>313 Or at 83-84 (citing 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 18, 75 (4th ed 1992) for the proposition that \u201cthe opinion rule has no sensible application to statements made out-of-court\u201d). Accordingly, even if defendant had framed his argument under <em>Lupoli </em>rather than under OEC 403 and <em>Southard, </em>that argument would fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the trial court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b409-7\"> In a fourth, assignment of error, defendant argues that the trial court erred when it denied defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury that a unanimous vote was required for a conviction. We have rejected that argument on previous occasions and do so here without further discussion. <em>State v. Bowen, </em>215 Or App 199, 168 P3d 1208 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
