That statute specifies, \u201cIn a prosecution for theft it is a defense that the defendant acted under an honest claim of right [.] \u201d Defendant argues that he was entitled to the instruction because UUV is \u201cessentially, the theft of a vehicle.\u201d The state responds that defendant did not present evidence to support giving the instruction and, in any event, that the instruction was not appropriate, because \u201chonest claim of right\u201d is not a defense to UUV. We conclude that a prosecution for UUV is not a \u201cprosecution for theft\u201d for which the defense described in ORS 164.035(1) is available. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-5\">As we explained in <em>State v. Oneill, </em>256 Or App 537, 539-40, 303 P3d 944 (2013), a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a theory of defense \u201cif there is any evidence from which jurors could infer that the required elements of that defense are present and the proposed instruction correctly states the law.\u201d (Citations omitted.) We review a trial court\u2019s failure to give a requested instruction for legal error. <em>State v. Marsh, </em>186 Or App 612, 614, 64 P3d 1141, <em>rev den, </em>335 Or 655 (2003) (citing <em>State v. Moore, </em>324 Or 396, 427, 927 P2d 1073 (1996)). We view the evidence supporting the instruction in the light most favorable to the party who requested it, <em>id., </em>and state the facts accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b914-6\">At 3:15 a.m. on April 22, 2013, a Myrtle Point police officer saw defendant driving a Jeep that reportedly had been stolen from the front of a house in the nearby town of North Bend approximately 15 minutes earlier. Officers pursued defendant and, when they ultimately caught defendant and searched the Jeep, they found fishing gear that appeared to belong to defendant. At trial, one of the officers described his side of a conversation with defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you ask my client how he obtained this vehicle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\">\u201c[OFFICER]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-5\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, did he give you a response to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-6\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-7\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Did you ask him how recently he had obtained the vehicle \u2014 or, when he had obtained it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-8\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Hmm, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-9\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did he respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-10\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-11\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did \u2014 did you ask him if it was \u2014 how\u2014did you ask him if it was a purchase?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-12\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-13\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did he respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-14\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-15\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, did you find out \u2014 did you ask him how much he paid for it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-16\">\u201c[OFFICER]: I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-17\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And did he respond to that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-18\">\u201c[OFFICER]: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-20\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: And, did he tell you wherein what community he purchased it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-21\">\u201c[OFFICER]: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-23\">\u201c[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Was the community that\u2014 that \u2014 was\u2014was it the same community as North Bend? Was it North Bend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-24\">\u201c[OFFICER]: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-25\">\u201c [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: In fact, it was Coquille. Isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-26\">\u201c [OFFICER]: That\u2019s correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Defendant argues that the officer\u2019s testimony permits the inference that defendant answered the questions by stating that he had purchased the Jeep in the town of Coquille. He argues that the inference from the officer\u2019s testimony plus evidence that the officers found fishing gear in the Jeep that inferentially belonged to defendant was some evidence supporting an \u201chonest claim of right\u201d defense and required the court to instruct the jury on the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">The state disputes that that constitutes evidence to prove an \u201chonest claim of right,\u201d particularly given defendant\u2019s emphasis on inferring that defendant made statements that \u2014 if offered directly to prove defendant honestly acquired the vehicle \u2014 would constitute inadmissible hearsay. We need not decide whether defense counsel\u2019s strategy represents an effective way around the hearsay rules, because it appears that the state did not object on that basis and, in any event, because we agree with the state that the \u201chonest claim of right\u201d instruction does not describe a defense to a prosecution for UUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">ORS 164.035 sets forth the \u201chonest claim of right\u201d defense and provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-6\">\u201c(1) <em>In a prosecution for theft </em>it is a defense that the defendant acted under an honest claim of right, in that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-7\">\u201c(a) The defendant was unaware that the property was that of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-8\">\u201c(b) The defendant reasonably believed that the defendant was entitled to the property involved or had a right to acquire or dispose of it as the defendant did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">At trial, defendant requested Uniform Criminal Jury Instruction (UCrJI) 1826, which tells the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-11\">\u201cThe defense of honest claim of right has been raised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-12\">\u201cThe defendant is not guilty if [he/she] acted under an honest claim of right, in that the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-13\">\u201c(1) Was unaware that the property was that of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b916-14\">\u201c(2) Reasonably believed that [he/she] was entitled to the property involved; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>\u201c(3) Reasonably believed that [he/she] had a right to acquire the property as [he/she] did; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-4\">\u201c(4) Reasonably believed that [he/she] had a right to dispose of the property as [he/she] did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b917-5\">\u201cThe state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not acting under an honest claim of right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b917-6\">(Brackets in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b917-7\">Defendant does not dispute that ORS 164.035(1) makes the defense available \u201c[i]n a prosecution for theft.\u201d As set out above, defendant contends he was entitled to the instruction because UUV is \u201cessentially, the theft of a vehicle.\u201d Whether a prosecution for UUV is effectively a prosecution for \u201ctheft\u201d presents us with a question of legislative intent. Under the methodology set out in <em>State v. Gaines, </em>346 Or 160, 171-72, 206 P3d 1042 (2009), our first step is examination of the text and context of the pertinent statutes followed by consideration of legislative history to the extent it \u201cappears useful to the court\u2019s analysis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b917-8\">As pertinent to defendant\u2019s prosecution, a person commits the crime of UUV when \u201c[t]he person takes, operates, exercises control over, rides in or otherwise uses another\u2019s vehicle, boat, or aircraft without consent of the owner [.]\u201d ORS 164.135(l)(a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The statute requires proof that the defendant acted with a \u201cknowing\u201d mental state. <em>State v. Lasky, </em>259 Or App 307, 317, 314 P3d 304 (2013) (\u201cTo obtain a conviction on a UUV charge, the state must prove that the defendant knew that he did not have the owner\u2019s consent to use the vehicle.\u201d (Citing <em>State v. Bell, </em>220 Or App 266, 269, 185 P3d 541 (2008).)). Thus, in defendant\u2019s prosecution under ORS 164.135(1)(a), the state needed to prove that defendant knowingly used the Jeep without consent of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-9\">By contrast, to commit \u201ctheft,\u201d a person must act with \u201cintent to deprive another of property or to appropriate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>property to the person or to a third person [.]\u201d ORS 164.015. Both \u201cdeprive\u201d and \u201cappropriate\u201d are defined as including a degree of intended permanency not found in the elements of UUV.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See State v. Christine, </em>193 Or App 800, 809-10, 93 P3d 82 (2004) (explaining that, for a \u201ctheft\u201d conviction, \u201cthe state must prove an intent to cause permanent or near-permanent deprivation or appropriation of property[,]\u201d although emphasizing that \u201ctemporary control or use of property\u201d can permanently impair the property rights of the owner in certain circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">As we explained in <em>Christine, </em>\u201c[a]t common law, the crime of \u2018larceny\u2019 (now termed \u2018theft\u2019) required proof that a defendant acted with the intent to deprive another \u2018permanently\u2019 of property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 807 (citation omitted). When the 1971 legislature revised Oregon\u2019s criminal code, it \u201cconsolidated the various theft-related offenses\u201d and \u201ccrafted the definitions of\u2018appropriate\u2019 and \u2018deprive\u2019 \u201d in a way that would \u201c\u2018retain the traditional distinction\u2019 between larceny, which requires a thief to intend permanent or virtually permanent loss to the owner of the possession and use of property, and offenses that require the intent to obtain only temporary possession of property or to cause temporary loss to its owner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 809 (quoting Commentary to Criminal Law Revision Commission Proposed Oregon Criminal Code, Final Draft and Report \u00a7 121, 130 (July 1971) (Commentary)).</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">One of those offenses that traditionally did not require an intent to cause permanent loss to the owner was the crime <em>of\u201cjoy-riding,1n former </em>ORS 164.670,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>UUV. Commentary \u00a7 134 at 142 (UUV statute \u201ccovers the \u2018joy-riding\u2019 type of offense where the actor makes unauthorized use of another\u2019s vehicle <em>but without the intent to steal it or permanently deprive the owner of its </em>use\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also State v. Eyle, </em>236 Or 199, 201, 388 P2d 110 (1963) (concluding that \u201cjoy-riding,\u201d as set forth in <em>former </em>ORS 164.670, involves all of the elements of larceny \u201cexcept the intent to steal\u201d). Thus, a prosecution for the crime of UUV is not \u201cessentially\u201d a prosecution for theft because the text and context of the statutes, as well as the legislative history, demonstrate that the crime of \u201ctheft\u201d requires an element of intended result that is not an element of the crime of UUV.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\">Moreover, that distinction explains why the legislature did not make the defense of \u201chonest claim of right\u201d applicable to nonintent crimes like UUV. The defense set out in ORS 164.035(1) is a codification of the common law \u201chonest claim of right\u201d defense. <em>State v. Ramsey, </em>184 Or App 468, 472, 56 P3d 484 (2002); <em>see also </em>Commentary \u00a7 132 at 140 (explaining that ORS 164.035(1) is \u201ca restatement of common law principles, in language broad enough to cover all conduct designated as \u2018theft\u2019\u201d). Both the Commentary and our discussion in <em>Ramsey </em>describe the role of the defense as to negate the element of intent that is required for a conviction for larceny (theft). In <em>Ramsey, </em>we emphasized that, if a person uses self-help to recover specific personal property to which he has an honest claim of right, \u201cthe intent to commit theft does not exist.\u201d 184 Or App at 472-73 (citing <em>State v. Martin, </em>15 Or App 498, 516 P2d 753 (1973)). We also relied in <em>Ramsey </em>on <em>State v. Luckey, </em>150 Or 566, 571, 46 P2d 1042 (1935), in which the Oregon Supreme Court recited, \u201cIt needs no citation of authority to sustain the principle that a man can not be guilty of stealing his own goods if he is also entitled to the possession at the time of the taking.\u201d <em>See also State v. Kelley, </em>29 Or App 321, 329, 563 P2d 749 (1977) (where a person takes property with the intent to return it, there is \u201cno intent to permanently deprive\u201d); <em>Commentary </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>\u00a7 132 at 140 (observing that the defense is not strictly necessary as intent is already an element that the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt; however, \u201csuch a provision in the draft * * * seems preferable to make the Code as comprehensive as possible by spelling it out\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Defendant argues, however, that our decision in <em>State v. Noe, </em>242 Or App 530, 532-33, 256 P3d 166 (2011), requires us to hold that UUV is \u201cessentially, the theft of a vehicle.\u201d In <em>Noe, </em>the defendant was convicted on charges of aggravated theft, UUV, and possession of a stolen vehicle (PSV), all arising out of the same criminal conduct. His argument, that the trial court should have merged the conviction for PSV, ORS 819.300, with the conviction for UUV, ORS 164.135(l)(a), required us to determine if the crime of PSV includes an element distinct from the elements of the crime of UUV. The state urged us to view the PSV requirement that the vehicle has been \u201cstolen\u201d as distinct from any element of UUV, for which it is enough that the defendant \u201cborrows\u201d the car without consent, regardless of whether he intends to return it. <em>Noe, </em>242 Or at 533. In rejecting the state\u2019s argument, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b920-5\">\u201cThe state cites no authority, and we are aware of none, for the proposition that a person who \u2018borrows\u2019 another person\u2019s car, knowing that the other person has not consented to the \u2018borrowing,\u2019 has not stolen the car merely because the \u2018borrower\u2019 intends to return it * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b920-6\"><em>Id. </em>While our discussion above suggests that there may be reason to question <em>Noe\u2019s </em>view of \u201cstolen\u201d as requiring no intent to permanently deprive the owner, the quoted text clearly accepts the proposition that the crime of UUV requires no intent to permanently deprive the owner of the vehicle. Ultimately, <em>Noe\u2019s </em>discussion of the elements of PSV, ORS 819.300, does not inform our analysis of whether the legislature intended the phrase \u201ca prosecution for theft\u201d in ORS 164.035(1) to include the crime of UUV, ORS 164.135(l)(a), because <em>Noe </em>did not purport to address that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-7\">The trial court did not prevent defendant from arguing that the inference that he purchased the vehicle defeated the element that he \u201cknowingly\u201d lacked the owner\u2019s consent to use the vehicle. Indeed he made precisely that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>argument to the jury.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, defendant was not entitled to a jury instruction on the \u201chonest claim of right\u201d defense, ORS 164.035(1), because that defense is inapposite when a prosecution is for UUV, which does not require proof of \u201ctheft.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b914-7\"> The other crimes for which defendant was convicted include attempting to elude a police officer, ORS 811.540, escape in the third degree, ORS 162.145, failure to perform the duties of a driver, ORS 811.700, and criminal mischief in the second degree, ORS 164.354.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b917-10\"> ORS 164.135 describes two other ways in which a person can commit UUV in paragraphs (l)(b) and (c), both of which address a person who is in possession of a vehicle by agreement of the owner but uses the vehicle in a way that exceeds the scope of the owners consent.
