J.</author>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Following a trial in this legal malpractice case, the jury returned a verdict in favor of defendant and against plaintiffs. Plaintiffs appeal the resulting general judgment in favor of defendant, raising six assignments of error. We write only to address plaintiffs\u2019 fifth assignment of error, and reject without discussion the remaining assignments of error. In their fifth assignment, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in giving the jury a special instruction requested by defendant stating that \u201can attorney is not liable for alleged negligence in how he handled a client\u2019s case at trial if the clients had no valid claim to relief to begin with, because the attorney\u2019s conduct could not be a cause of any injury or damage to the clients.\u201d We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The background facts are undisputed. In November 2004, plaintiffs retained defendant to represent them in a real property dispute with their neighbors, the Bottems. Defendant filed a circuit court action against the Bottems on plaintiffs\u2019 behalf, alleging adverse possession, boundary by agreement, and trespass. That case eventually went to trial, and the trial court concluded that plaintiffs were or should have been aware of the true location of their property line near the time they purchased their property. Accordingly, the court entered judgment in favor of the Bottems and, later, awarded the Bottems costs, attorney fees, and an enhanced prevailing party fee.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiffs, represented by different counsel, unsuccessfully appealed the trial court\u2019s award of attorney fees and the enhanced prevailing party fee. <em>See Lenn v. Bottem, </em>221 Or App 241, 190 P3d 399, <em>rev den, </em>345 Or 503 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">In 2010, plaintiffs brought this legal malpractice case against defendant. With respect to the case against the Bottems, plaintiffs alleged that the \u201cclaims presented in that lawsuit were well-founded both in law and fact.\u201d However, the \u201ctrial court ruled against [them] and ordered them to pay the Bottems\u2019 attorney fees and an enhanced prevailing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>party fee, largely or entirely due to credibility findings made by the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">They also alleged that, at the time they retained defendant to represent them, they had potential claims for misrepresentation or fraud relating to the property line against the realtor and seller from whom they purchased their property. However, they asserted that, after the trial on their claims against the Bottems, their potential claims against the seller and realtor were barred by issue preclusion because, at that trial, the court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201cmade a binding factual finding that the plaintiffs knew or should have known about the true location of their deed line in 1995, so that the applicable limitations periods against the seller and realtor would be deemed to have started running no later than 1995, barring all of plaintiffs\u2019 available claims against the seller and realtor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">According to plaintiffs, defendant was negligent in a number of ways: (1) failing to advise them of the risk of issue preclusion on their potential claims against the seller or realtor; (2) failing to research the issue preclusion and statute of limitations issues regarding the realtor/seller claims in time to properly act on those issues before the Bottems trial; (3) failing to pursue settlement negotiations; (4) failing to properly advise them of the risks of going to trial on their adverse possession claim; (5) failing to properly advise them of the benefits of pursuing settlement with the Bottems and the realtor and seller; (6) failing to \u201ctake steps to discover and recognize difficult evidentiary issues regarding when [plaintiffs] knew or should have known of the correct boundary line\u201d; and (7) failing to timely and adequately respond to the Bottems\u2019 motion for attorney fees and an enhanced prevailing party fee. As damages, plaintiffs sought to recover the amount they paid to defendant for fees and costs, the judgment for the Bottems\u2019 costs, fees, and enhanced prevailing party fee, and the amounts they paid their appellate attorneys to appeal the attorney fee and enhanced prevailing party fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Defendant denied that he was negligent and also alleged that plaintiffs were at fault and caused their own damage in a number of ways: (1) not being truthful with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>him about when they learned of the true location of the boundary line of their property; (2) failing to inform him of critical facts concerning their adverse possession, boundary by agreement, and trespass claims against the Bottems; (3) failing to provide him with critical documents concerning their claims against the Bottems; (4) failing to heed his warnings about the possible consequences of proceeding to trial against the Bottems; (5) failing to testify truthfully about when they learned of the true location of the boundary line to their property; and (6) filing a meritless appeal and petition for review of the trial court\u2019s attorney fee and enhanced prevailing party fee award.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Before trial, the parties each submitted proposed jury instructions to the court. Defendant requested a special jury instruction that \u201can attorney is not liable for alleged negligence in handling a client\u2019s case if the clients had no valid claim for relief to begin with, because the attorney\u2019s conduct could not be the cause of any injury or damage to the clients.\u201d Plaintiffs responded that the instruction \u201cmakes no sense in the context of this case\u201d for two reasons. First, \u201cif an attorney takes [money] from a client to pursue a case where there is \u2018no valid claim for relief,\u2019 that in itself is negligence causing significant damages which the plaintiffs should be allowed to recover.\u201d Second, the Bottems\u2019 attorney testified \u201cthat his clients would have settled for a conservation easement\u201d and \u201cplaintiffs testified that they would have accepted such a settlement\u201d; therefore, \u201c[c]learly, there was some \u2018valid claim for relief,\u2019 because * * * the opposing party was willing to settle.\u201d The trial court ultimately gave the jury a modified version of the instruction: \u201c[A]n attorney is not liable for alleged negligence in <em>how he handled a client\u2019s case at trial </em>if the clients had no valid claim for relief to begin with, because the attorney\u2019s conduct could not be a cause of injury or damage to the clients.\u201d (Emphasis added.) After the jury was instructed, plaintiffs noted their exception to the instruction. However, they did not make additional arguments to the court regarding the instruction, as given.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On a special verdict form, the jury found that defendant was \u201cat fault in one or more of the ways the plaintiffs claim [ed]\u201d and that defendant\u2019s fault was a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>damages to plaintiffs. In addition, the jury found that plaintiffs were \u201cat fault in one or more of the ways the defendant claim [ed]\u201d and plaintiffs\u2019 fault was a cause of their damages. The jury was asked to apportion the \u201cpercentage of each of the parity\u2019s] fault that caused damage to the plaintiffs\u201d and concluded that defendant\u2019s percentage of fault was 25 percent, while plaintiffs\u2019 fault was 75 percent. Because plaintiffs\u2019 percentage of fault was greater than 50 percent, the verdict was for the defendant. Accordingly, the trial court entered a general judgment in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">As noted, on appeal, plaintiffs assert that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that \u201can attorney is not liable for alleged negligence in how he handled a client\u2019s case at trial if the clients had no valid claim for relief to begin with, because the attorney\u2019s conduct could not be a cause of any injury or damage to the clients.\u201d \u201cWe review jury instructions for errors of law and will reverse only if we can fairly say that, when considering all of the instructions as a whole, the instruction at issue probably created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jurors that affected the outcome of the case.\u201d <em>Watson v. Meltzer, </em>247 Or App 558, 564, 270 P3d 289 (2011), <em>rev den, </em>352 Or 266 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">In their opening brief, plaintiffs reiterate the arguments they made to the trial court. In particular, they assert that the instruction \u201cmakes no sense in the context of this case\u201d for two reasons. Those are (1) that, \u201cif an attorney takes [a large sum of money] from a client to pursue a case where there is \u2018no valid claim for relief,\u2019 a jury would be entitled to find that that in itself is negligence causing significant damages which the plaintiffs should be entitled to recover\u201d and (2) that, according to the testimony, the Bottems and plaintiffs could have settled the underlying case instead of spending money on attorney fees, and \u201c[c]learly there was some \u2018valid claim for relief,\u2019 because * * * in the underlying case, the opposing party was willing to settle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">We first observe that the challenges laid out in plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief do not directly address the instruction that was given by the court. The instruction related specifically to an attorney\u2019s liability for how he \u201chandled a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>client\u2019s case <em>at trial!\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Plaintiffs, in their brief, do not explain why <em>that </em>instruction was incorrect, but instead seem to contend that an attorney could commit malpractice in other ways \u2014 by taking money to pursue a bad case or by failing to settle a case. However, the instruction given did not instruct the jury that an attorney could not be liable for poor pretrial handling of a case if the case was no good to begin with. It only addressed an attorney\u2019s liability in the handling of a case at trial. To the extent that plaintiffs are of the view that the trial court should have given the jury more detailed instructions relating to an attorney\u2019s potential liability for pretrial conduct, they did not request such instructions. <em>See </em>ORAP 5.45(1) (\u201cNo matter claimed as error will be considered on appeal unless the claim of error was preserved in the lower court * * *.\u201d); ORCP 59 H (\u201cA party may not obtain appellate review of an asserted error by a trial court * * * in giving or refusing to give an instruction to the jury unless the party seeking review identified the asserted error to the trial court ***.\u201d); <em>see also State v. Wyatt, </em>331 Or 335, 343, 15 P3d 22 (2000) (\u201c[A] party must provide the trial court with an explanation of his or her objection that is specific enough to ensure that the court can identify its alleged error with enough clarity to permit it to consider and correct the error immediately, if correction is warranted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In any event, the jury instruction, as given, was a correct statement of law and, considered in the context of the instructions as a whole, was not likely to have created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jurors that affected the outcome of the case. As we have explained, an \u201caction for legal malpractice is not materially different from an ordinary negligence action.\u201d <em>Watson, </em>247 Or App at 565.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cIt is simply a variety of negligence in which a special relationship gives rise to a particular duty that goes beyond the ordinary duty to avoid a foreseeable risk of harm; accordingly, in order to prevail in a legal malpractice action, a plaintiff must allege and prove (1) a <em>duty </em>that runs from the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a <em>breach </em>of that duty; (3) a resulting <em>harm </em>to the plaintiff measurable in damages; and (4) <em>causation, i.e., </em>a causal link between the breach of duty and the harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number><em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original). In a legal malpractice case, a plaintiff \u201cmust show not only that the attorney was negligent, but also that the result would have been different except for the negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Thus, the \u201cjury in the malpractice case is called upon, in effect, to decide what the outcome for plaintiff would have been in the earlier case if it had been properly tried, a process that has been described as a \u2018suit within a suit.\u2019\u201d <em>Chocktoot v. Smith, </em>280 Or 567, 570, 571 P2d 1255 (1977). \u201cIf the jury determines that the defendant was negligent but concludes that the outcome of the underlying case would have been the same in all events, the defendant\u2019s negligence is deemed not to have caused the plaintiffs harm.\u201d <em>Woods v. Hill, </em>248 Or App 514, 524-25, 273 P3d 354 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Applied to an attorney\u2019s conduct <em>at trial, </em>that standard for causation means that \u201cthe client must show that he would have won the first suit as one step in order to win the second one.\u201d <em>Harding v. Bell, </em>265 Or 202, 205, 508 P2d 216 (1973) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the client must demonstrate \u201cthe existence of a valid cause of action or defense which, had it not been for the attorney\u2019s * * * negligence, would have brought about a judgment favorable to the client in the original action.\u201d <em>Id.', see also Milton v. Hare, </em>130 Or 590, 598, 280 P 511 (1929) (\u201cUnless plaintiff had a good cause of action against Lohmire, whom she accuses of having cheated and defrauded her, she has no cause of action against [her attorneys]. Unless she had a good cause of action against Lohmire for fraud, she lost nothing by the conduct of [the] defendants, even though they were guilty of gross negligence * * *.\u201d). Thus, the trial court did not misstate the law in its instruction that an attorney is not \u201cliable for alleged negligence in how he handled a client\u2019s case at trial if the clients had no valid claim for relief to begin with, because the attorney\u2019s conduct could not be a cause of any injury or damage to the clients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Although plaintiffs observe that they alleged malpractice based on, among other things, defendant\u2019s failure to settle the case before trial and his decision to take the case to trial in the first place, the court gave instructions on causation relating to those issues. The court specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>instructed the jury as to all the ways that each party alleged the other was negligent, and, in addition to the instruction specific to an attorney\u2019s conduct at trial, the court instructed the jury more generally on causation in the legal malpractice context. It instructed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">\u201cIf you find the defendant was negligent as claimed by the plaintiff[s], then you must decide whether that negligence caused any loss to the plaintiff [s].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-5\">\u201cIn determining whether the defendant\u2019s alleged negligence in fact resulted in a less favorable outcome for the plaintiff[s], you must first determine what the outcome for the plaintiff [s] would have been had the defendant not been negligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-6\">\u201cIf that outcome that would have occurred is no more favorable than the outcome that did occur, then the plaintiffs\u2019 loss or damage cannot be \u2014 have been caused by the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Thus, to the extent plaintiffs assert that the challenged instruction was too limited, in the context of all the instructions, it was not likely to have created an erroneous impression of the law in the minds of the jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">Finally, we observe that, in any event, plaintiffs do not cogently explain how the jury instruction could have been prejudicial in light of the jury\u2019s verdict in this case. Although, in their reply brief, plaintiffs appear to assert that the challenged instruction would lead the jury to believe that the attorney could not be liable for the conduct alleged in this case (a contention that we have rejected), the jury did not so conclude. Instead, the jury found that defendant was negligent and that his negligence caused damages to plaintiffs. However, as noted, the jury also found that plaintiffs themselves were negligent and that their negligence was a cause of their own damages, and concluded that plaintiffs\u2019 percentage of fault was 75 percent, while defendant\u2019s was 25 percent. In their contentions relating to the jury instruction, plaintiffs do not explain how, given the fact that the jury found both negligence and causation on defendant\u2019s part, the jury instruction could have nonetheless been harmful.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>For all of those reasons, we reject plaintiffs\u2019 contention that the trial court erred in giving the instruction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b210-7\"> The court awarded the Bottems attorney fees and an enhanced prevailing party fee pursuant to ORS 20.105(1), based on a conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were without an objectively reasonable basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
