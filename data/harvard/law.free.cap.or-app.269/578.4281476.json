The ALJ upheld an order on reconsideration by the Appellate Review Unit (ARU) of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division of the Department of Consumer and Business Services (DCBS) rejecting claimant\u2019s request for an award of compensation including an impairment value for a chronic condition significantly limiting claimant\u2019s repetitive use of his left shoulder. On review for legal error, we affirm. <em>See </em>ORS 183.482(8)(a); ORS 656.298(7) (judicial review).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">The relevant facts are undisputed. While working as a siding installer, claimant injured his left shoulder when he fell off of an extension ladder. He underwent surgery, and the post-operative diagnosis was \u201ctraumatic instability.\u201d A work capacity evaluation noted reduced motion and strength in the shoulder and, based on those findings, limited claimant\u2019s left arm overhead reaching to a weight limit of 15 pounds and limited siding installation to below head level. The evaluation stated that claimant could not meet the demands of his regular job. An independent medical examination, performed the same day, resulted in similar findings, except for somewhat greater shoulder motion. The attending physician, Dr. Carrie Ware, concurred in both exams and noted that her conclusions regarding range of motion were more consistent with the work capacity evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">SAIF issued a notice of closure with findings based on the work capacity evaluation. The accepted conditions for the left-shoulder injury included anterior dislocation, non-displaced glenoid rim fracture, type II SLAP lesion, and Hills-Sachs lesion. Impairment values were given for range of motion and strength loss, but no chronic condition impairment value was awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Claimant requested reconsideration of the notice by the ARU. In the request, claimant included a clarification report from Ware. Ware was asked, \u201cDoes the patient have a significant limitation in repetitive use [of] his left arm above chest level?\u201d Ware answered yes, and wrote, \u201cShould not lift materials exceeding 20 lbs above shoulder level with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>left arm.\u201d The parties did not dispute Ware\u2019s impairment findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">In the order on reconsideration, the ARU affirmed the whole person impairment value and increased the work disability to 21 percent. The ARU, however, did not award the five percent \u201cchronic condition impairment value\u201d provided by OAR 436-035-0019(1). Under that rule, a claimant is entitled to a chronic condition impairment value \u201cwhen a preponderance of medical opinion establishes that, due to a chronic and permanent medical condition, the worker is <em>significantly limited in the repetitive use of </em>[a listed body part].\u201d OAR 436-035-0019(1) (emphasis added). In its order, the ARU determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">\u201cThe attending physician clarified the worker was limited in repetitive use over the shoulder only. Chronic condition impairment must include the worker\u2019s overall conditions/motions and not just one motion. Accordingly, the clarification does not meet the minimum threshold for rating chronic condition impairment under OAR 436-035-0019(1) and OAR 436-035-0007(13).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Claimant requested a hearing before an ALJ, who affirmed the order on reconsideration. The ALJ determined that Ware\u2019s explanation did not \u201csatisfy the rule\u2019s requirement of a significant limitation in repetitive use. The inability to lift more than 20 pounds above shoulder level is not the same thing as a significant limitation in repetitive use of the shoulder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">Claimant appealed from the ALJ\u2019s order to the board. The board affirmed the order. The board distinguished claimant\u2019s case from <em>Lynette M. Miller, </em>58 Van Natta 2881 (2006), where it had determined that a chronic condition impairment value was appropriate where the medical arbiter had concluded that the claimant was \u201csignificantly limited in her ability to repetitively use her left shoulder to lift and transfer patients/weight due to her accepted diagnosis of tendonitis of that shoulder.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2884. The board explained that, in <em>Miller, </em>it interpreted the arbiter\u2019s additional explanation about the use of the claimant\u2019s left shoulder as an example of the limitation on the body part, not the only limitation on the shoulder\u2019s use. By contrast, the board <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>explained, Ware \u201cspecifically qualified the limitation on repetitive use\u201d to lifting more than 20 pounds above shoulder level. The board concluded, \u201c[b]ecause the limitation is qualified in this manner, we find it insufficient to establish entitlement to a \u2018chronic condition\u2019 impairment value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">Claimant now petitions for judicial review in this court and argues that both the ARU and the board have misinterpreted OAR 436-035-0007. Claimant contends that no deference is owed to the ARU\u2019s interpretation of the chronic condition impairment rule because the ARU did not \u201cexpressly define the terms of the administrative rule.\u201d Claimant also notes that we are not obligated to defer to the board\u2019s interpretation of the rule \u2014 which described claimant\u2019s limitation as \u201cqualified\u201d \u2014 because the board is not part of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Division, the agency that promulgated the rule. Therefore, claimant asks us to interpret the rule without deference and to apply the plain and ordinary meaning of the rule\u2019s terms. Under such an interpretation, claimant argues, a chronic condition impairment value should be awarded where there is \u201ca noticeable limit on using a \u2018body part\u2019 over and over again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">SAIF argues that, because the ARU is the \u201cauthorized representative\u201d of the Director of DCBS, its interpretation of the rule is entitled to deference.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> SAIF reasons that the ARU interpreted the rule in the process of applying it to claimant\u2019s case, and contends that we should uphold its \u201cplausible interpretation\u201d of the rule, given that it is not \u201cinconsistent with the wording of the rule itself, or with the rule\u2019s context, or with any other source of law[.]\u201d <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com. v. Energy Facility Siting, </em>320 Or 132, 142, 881 P2d 119 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">As explained below, we agree that the ARU did interpret DCBS\u2019s chronic-condition rule in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>applying it to claimant\u2019s case, and, because its interpretation is plausible, it is entitled to deference. ARU\u2019s interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule or any other source of law. We conclude that the board applied the ARU\u2019s interpretation in its order and that its application was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">Agencies are permitted to \u201cdetermine whether the standard established in a rule has been met in a particular instance by interpreting the rule in the course of applying it.\u201d <em>DeLeon, Inc. v. DHS, </em>220 Or App 542, 548, 188 P3d 354 (2008). When that is the case, we defer to the agency\u2019s plausible interpretation, \u201cincluding an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the ARU was asked to determine whether claimant had met the standard for a chronic condition impairment award as set out in OAR 436-035-0019. The rule requires that the \u201cworker is significantly limited in the repetitive use of [a listed body part].\u201d In applying that standard to claimant\u2019s case in its order on reconsideration, the ARU explicitly interpreted the rule to require impairment of the worker\u2019s \u201coverall conditions/ motions and not just one motion.\u201d <em>See Gienger v. Dept. of State Lands, </em>230 Or App 178, 186-87, 214 P3d 75 (2009), <em>rev den, </em>348 Or 13 (2010) (agency interpreted rule in the course of applying it by recounting, in the order, two of its own regulatory definitions and discussing how they applied, in concert, to the facts of the case); <em>SAIF v. Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App 173, 180-83, 96 P3d 1282 (2004) (in applying an ambiguous rule that had \u201ctwo possible meanings,\u201d the ARU implicitly interpreted the rule as having one of those meanings, and the interpretation was entitled to deference). <em>But see SAIF v. Miguez, </em>249 Or App 388, 395, 277 P3d 601 (2012) (the ARU did not interpret a rule by simply applying it to facts without any explanation). Therefore, the ARU\u2019s order on reconsideration constitutes an interpretation of OAR 436-035-0019(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The rules in OAR chapter 436 were promulgated by the Director of DCBS, <em>see </em>OAR 436-001-0001, and we defer to DCBS\u2019s plausible interpretation of its rules. <em>SAIF v. Eller, </em>189 Or App 113, 119-20, 74 P3d 1093 (2003). That deference extends to the ARU, which is the delegate of the director and has the authority to determine the proper application <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of OAR 436-035-0019. <em>Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App at 181; <em>Miguez, </em>249 Or App at 395. The deference owed to the ARU\u2019s interpretation is not negated by the ALJ\u2019s or the board\u2019s later application of the ARU\u2019s interpretation in affirming the order on reconsideration. <em>Donahue-Birran, </em>195 Or App at 182-83 (\u201cit is immaterial that the ALJ and board did not promulgate the rule in question\u201d because \u201cthey sustained a plausible interpretation of the rule by an agent of the promulgating entity\u201d). Although the board used different terminology in affirming ARU\u2019s order \u2014 speaking in terms of \u201cqualified\u201d limitations on repetitive use of a body part \u2014 the board nonetheless applied the ARU\u2019s interpretation of the rule in determining that the \u201cqualified\u201d nature of claimant\u2019s limitation did not entitle him to a chronic condition impairment value.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\">We agree that ARU\u2019s interpretation is plausible. \u201cWe defer to the agency\u2019s plausible interpretation of its own rule, including an interpretation made in the course of applying the rule, if that interpretation is not inconsistent with the wording of the rule, its context, or any other source of law.\u201d <em>DeLeon, Inc., </em>220 Or App at 548 (citing <em>Don\u2019t Waste Oregon Com., </em>320 Or at 142). To determine whether an agency\u2019s interpretation is plausible, we use the same interpretive framework for administrative rules that we use for statutes. That is, we consider \u201cthe text of the rule itself, together with its context, which includes other provisions of the same rule, other related rules, the statute pursuant to which the rule was created, and other related statutes.\u201d <em>Gafur v. Legacy Good Samaritan Hospital, </em>344 Or 525, 533, 185 P3d 446 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">To qualify for a chronic condition impairment value, OAR 436-035-0019 provides that the preponderance of medical evidence must establish that the worker \u201cis significantly limited in the repetitive use of [a listed body part].\u201d Both parties urge us to consider the plain and ordinary meaning of \u201csignificant\u201d and \u201crepetitive\u201d when interpreting that phrase. The definition of \u201csignificant\u201d includes \u201chaving meaning\u201d and \u201chaving or likely to have influence or effect\u201d; it is synonymous with \u201cimportant,\u201d \u201cweighty,\u201d and \u201cnotable.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary </em>2116 (unabridged ed 2002). \u201cRepetitive\u201d is redundantly defined as \u201ccontaining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>repetition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1924-25. The plain meaning of those terms does not demonstrate that the interpretation of the rule either by claimant or the ARU is unambiguously or necessarily correct. However, when determining the plausibility of an interpretation by the ARU, the mere fact that a claimant\u2019s interpretation is also plausible does not demonstrate that the ARU\u2019s interpretation is not. <em>See DeLeon, Inc., </em>220 Or App at 548 (\u201c[I]t is settled law that a petitioner\u2019s plausible alternative construction of an agency rule does not mean that the agency\u2019s own construction is implausible.\u201d). Claimant has not shown that the ARU\u2019s interpretation is <em>not </em>plausible or inconsistent with the text of the rule, its context, or any other source of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">SAIF also presents materials from the rulemaking history to support its interpretation. A prior version of the rule required \u201cthat the worker is unable to repetitively use\u201d a body part due to a chronic and permanent medical condition. <em>Former </em>OAR 436-35-010(6) (1992); <em>former </em>OAR 436-35-320(5) (1992). That rule was interpreted to mean that a worker was entitled to a chronic condition impairment award if there was \u201cat least a partial loss of ability to use the body part.\u201d <em>Weckesser v. Jet Delivery Systems, </em>132 Or App 325, 327, 888 P2d 127 (1995) (quoting <em>Donald E. Lowry, </em>45 Van Natta 1452 (1993)). When the agency amended the rule in 1996, it changed the text to require a \u201csignificant limitation\u201d in the use of a body part, explaining that the amendment was necessary \u201cto curb some of the overuse of this award[.]\u201d WCD Admin Order 96-051, Ex C, 11. When the rule was amended again in 2004, DCBS explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b604-5\">\u201cA previous legal decision determined the interpretation of the existing unscheduled rule simply required a partial loss of ability to repetitively use the body part. Consequently, by requiring a significant limitation in the ability to repetitively use a body part * * *, a higher threshold for receiving an award of impairment was established.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">WCD Proposed Disability Rating Standards, <em>Summary of Testimony and Agency Responses, xiii </em>(July 15, 2004). SAIF argues that adopting claimant\u2019s proposed interpretation of the rule \u2014 requiring only a \u201cnoticeable\u201d limitation on use \u2014 would ignore the agency\u2019s intent to exclude awards for a \u201cpartial\u201d loss of ability to use the body part. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>history of the rule strengthens the plausibility of the ARU\u2019s interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\">Finally, we conclude that the board\u2019s order is supported by substantial evidence. The only relevant medical evidence regarding claimant\u2019s use of his shoulder came from Ware, who concluded that claimant should not lift materials exceeding 20 pounds over his shoulder. That was evidence from which the board could find that claimant did not have a \u201climitation on his overall motions/conditions.\u201d The board\u2019s finding in that respect is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-7\"> SAIF also contends that claimant\u2019s argument concerning the interpretation of the rule was not adequately preserved below, because (1) claimant did not develop sufficient medical evidence that would support his interpretation of the rule, (2) claimant did not exhaust administrative remedies by presenting his proposed interpretation of the rule to the ARU on reconsideration, and (3) claimant did not provide an alternative interpretation of the rule until he filed his reply brief with the board. We conclude that the preservation requirements of ORAP 5.45 are satisfied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
