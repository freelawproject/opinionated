Pitt, </em>352 Or 566, 575, 293 P3d 1002 (2012) (\u201cIf a party rests his or her argument on appeal on a trial court\u2019s pretrial order declining to exclude certain evidence, we ordinarily will evaluate that argument in light of the record made before the trial court when it issued the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"871\">*871</page-number>order, not the trial record as it may have developed at some later point.\u201d). The police were called to investigate a residential burglary involving the theft of an Xbox. Three officers reported to the victim\u2019s residence: Toll, Harnden, and Ballou. Ballou was a patrol officer and school resource officer who knew youth because he had \u201cdealt with him in the past\u201d regarding in-school discipline issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">Toll asked the victim if he knew who may have taken the Xbox, and the victim, who knew youth, identified youth by name. The victim suspected youth because he had \u201cseen him by his house during that time when [the crime] could have occurred [.]\u201d The victim gave the officers a description of youth, stating that youth was wearing a blue jacket, black pants, black shoes, and a backpack. The victim also pointed to youth\u2019s house, which was two or three blocks away. Toll and Harnden went looking \u201cfor a subject matching the description that [the victim] gave [them].\u201d Ballou \u201cwent looking for the suspect that he [knew] as [youth].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Only a \u201cshort * * * time\u201d after the call came in to the police to investigate the residential burglary, and approximately 10 minutes after the officers had interviewed the victim, Ballou saw youth walking down a sidewalk \u201ca block to two blocks\u201d from the victim\u2019s house. The victim\u2019s description of youth was \u201cconsistent with what [youth] was wearing.\u201d Ballou contacted Toll and Harnden, who parked a half block away from youth and began walking toward him. Ballou pulled his vehicle over near the curb, alongside youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Youth was wearing \u201can average size backpack\u201d that could \u201creasonably contain a[n] Xbox console.\u201d As Ballou was pulling over alongside youth, youth took off the backpack, dropped it behind him near a fence, and took \u201ca step or two away\u201d from it. Ballou got out of his vehicle and initiated a discussion with youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Toll and Harnden then approached youth, and Toll asked youth \u201cquestions about what [the victim] had told [him] to verify that [youth] was indeed in *** that area during that time that the Xbox was taken from the residence.\u201d Specifically, Toll asked youth if he knew the victim, and youth replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Toll also asked youth if he had ever played Xbox with the victim, and youth replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Toll <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>also asked youth if he had been at the victim\u2019s house that day, and youth replied, \u201cYes.\u201d Toll then asked youth how long ago he had been at the victim\u2019s house, and youth replied that he had been there \u201cabout an hour ago.\u201d Finally, Toll asked youth if he had the victim\u2019s Xbox, and youth then asked to speak to Ballou.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">Ballou then confronted youth, telling him that the victim had named him as a suspect and asking him whether he had the victim\u2019s Xbox. After further questioning, youth admitted that he had the victim\u2019s Xbox, agreed to open the backpack, and showed the Xbox to the officers. The officers advised youth that he was under arrest, placed him in a patrol car, and took him to the police station, where he was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">After a petition was filed to adjudicate youth within the jurisdiction of the juvenile court for first-degree burglary and second-degree theft, youth moved to suppress the statements that he made to the officers and the evidence that was discovered during the search of his backpack, arguing that the officers, when questioning him on the sidewalk, failed to give him <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Accordingly, youth argued, the court should suppress youth\u2019s statements and conclude that his consent to the search of the backpack was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">During a hearing on youth\u2019s motion to suppress, Toll stood and demonstrated youth\u2019s acts of removing the backpack and dropping it near the fence. Specifically, Toll testified that youth \u201cwas walking like this with a few straps over his shoulders, the backpack directly behind him on his back[,]\u201d and that when youth \u201clooked over and [saw] Officer Ballou pulling up, he grabbed his backpack off his shoulder and went in this motion and dropped the backpack down.\u201d Toll also testified that youth took \u201cmaybe a step or two away from [the backpack] after he dropped it.\u201d Toll \u201cthought that that was kind of unusual for someone to just drop the backpack as they see an officer approach them, and step away from it [,] \u201d and he wondered if youth was trying to \u201cget rid of possible evidence [.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b892-7\">Ballou testified that he thought that youth \u201cwas distancing himself from the backpack, either to lighten his load, to make it easier for him to move * * * or to just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>distance himself away from ownership of the backpack[.] \u201d In addition, Ballou testified that he believed that he had probable cause to arrest youth, prior to his questioning of youth, based on the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-4\">\u201cthe statements of the victim that he knew it was [youth], that he\u2019d seen him by his house during that time * * * when it could have occurred, the short duration of time between us finding him and * * * the call coming in to us, * * * his distancing himself from the backpack and * * * the furtive gestures * * * with the backpack.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Based on the officers\u2019 testimony, the juvenile court first found that the officers had probable cause to arrest youth. Specifically, the court stated that the officers \u201cknew they were looking for this particular person. He was in the area, the furtive gesture, and Officer Toll made enough inquiry to determine that this was the person, the [youth] they were looking for.\u201d The court then suppressed any statements that youth made to the officers after Ballou confronted youth, on the ground that <em>Miranda </em>warnings were required and not given at that time. For the same reason, the court concluded that youth\u2019s consent to the search of the backpack was invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Although the court suppressed the statements that youth made to Ballou after Ballou confronted youth and concluded that youth\u2019s consent to the search was invalid, the court found that the officers had probable cause to arrest youth and that they would have arrested him regardless of his statements to Ballou. Accordingly, the court concluded that the evidence in the backpack \u2014 specifically\u2014the Xbox\u2014 would have been inevitably discovered during a search incident to youth\u2019s arrest. Pursuant to the court\u2019s ruling, testimony concerning the evidence that was discovered during the search of youth\u2019s backpack was later admitted into evidence, and the juvenile court adjudicated youth within the jurisdiction of the court for first-degree burglary and second-degree theft. Youth now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">On appeal, youth contends that the juvenile court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence that was discovered during the search of his backpack, contending that the search was not justified as a search incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>to arrest because, before Ballou confronted youth, the officers lacked objective probable cause to believe that youth had committed a crime. To support that contention, youth argues that his \u201cmere presence near his own house and also near a house which was burglarized, is insufficient to support a reasonable belief that the youth was involved in the burglary.\u201d Youth also argues that the victim\u2019s \u201cunexplained suspicion of the youth does not add to the reasonable belief.\u201d In addition, youth contends that his conduct was \u201cnot sufficiently \u2018furtive\u2019 to create probable cause [.]\u201d Thus, according to youth, \u201c[t]he totality of the circumstances (the youth being near the [victim\u2019s] (and his own) home, and that the youth dropped his backpack when talking to the officers) provides insufficient grounds for an objectively reasonable belief that it was more likely than not that the youth had committed the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> a police officer may conduct a search incident to arrest if the search \u201crelates to a crime which there is probable cause to believe the arrestee has committed, and when it is reasonable in all the circumstances.\u201d <em>State v. Owens, </em>302 Or 196, 204, 729 P2d 524 (1986). \u201cProbable cause under the Oregon Constitution has both a subjective and an objective component.\u201d <em>Id. </em>First, \u201c[a]n officer must subjectively believe that a crime has been committed and thus that a person or thing is subject to seizure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, \u201cthis belief must be objectively reasonable in the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe subjective component of the probable cause inquiry is satisfied if an officer believes that he or she has lawful authority to restrain the individual\u2019s liberty.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>State v. Vasquez-Villagomez, </em>346 Or 12, 23, 203 P3d 193 (2009). The objective component is satisfied if the state \u201cestablish [es] that the facts objectively are sufficient to establish probable cause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To determine \u201cwhether the state has established that the facts objectively are reasonable, the court looks at the totality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>circumstances,\u201d <em>id., </em>which are \u201cknown to the officer at the time of the arrest, viewed in light of the officer\u2019s experience,\u201d <em>State v. Martin, </em>260 Or App 461, 471, 317 P3d 408 (2014); <em>see also State v. Rayburn, </em>246 Or App 486, 492, 266 P3d 156 (2011) (\u201cTo establish probable cause, as opposed to guilt, the state needs to prove only that, <em>more likely than not, </em>defendant had the requisite mental state. That is a significantly less rigorous standard.\u201d (Internal citation omitted; emphasis in <em>Rayburn.)).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\">To the extent that youth argues that his conduct was \u201cnot sufficiently \u2018furtive\u2019\u201d to add to a finding of probable cause, his argument is unpersuasive. First, we observe that there is evidence to support the juvenile court\u2019s conclusion that youth made a furtive gesture. Specifically, there is evidence that youth dropped the backpack and stepped away from it in an apparent attempt to \u201cdistanc\u00ede] himself from the backpack[.]\u201d We note that a furtive gesture, alone, does not give rise to probable cause for an arrest. <em>State v. Jacobs, </em>187 Or App 330, 335, 67 P3d 408 (2003) (\u201cMere furtiveness *** does not establish probable cause.\u201d). However, \u201c[fjurtive movements <em>may add to </em>a finding of probable cause when they are contemporaneous with the officer\u2019s observations of other information consistent with criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added); <em>see also State v. Flores, </em>58 Or App 437, 648 P2d 1328 (1982) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s furtive gestures, combined with his attempts to conceal a baggie from the officer\u2019s view, provided probable cause to seize the baggie). Thus, youth\u2019s \u201cfurtive gesture\u201d may add to a finding of probable cause, when viewed in combination with the other circumstances known to the officers before Ballou confronted youth.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officers before Ballou confronted youth, we conclude that the officers had an objectively reasonable basis to believe that youth had committed a crime. In this case, the officers\u2019 objectively reasonable basis for that belief may be based on the evidence which was not excluded by the court and which was known to the officers when youth was arrested, including youth\u2019s admissions to Toll. When the officers went looking for youth, they knew, based on the victim\u2019s statement, that the victim\u2019s Xbox had been stolen. They also knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>the victim, who knew youth, had identified youth by name as the person who had stolen the Xbox, had stated that he had \u201cseen [youth] by his house during that time when [the crime] could have occurred,\u201d and had described what youth was wearing. When the officers located youth, approximately 10 minutes after they interviewed the victim, they obtained information that potentially corroborated the victim\u2019s statement \u2014 that is, they observed that youth was walking near the victim\u2019s house, that the victim\u2019s description of youth was \u201cconsistent with what [youth] was wearing [,]\u201d and that youth was wearing \u201can average size backpack\u201d that could \u201creasonably contain a[n] Xbox console.\u201d The officers obtained more information when they observed youth making \u201cfurtive gestures\u201d with the backpack in an apparent attempt to \u201cget rid of possible evidence\u201d or \u201cdistance himself\u2019 from the backpack. Finally, the officers obtained additional information when Toll asked youth questions to verify what the victim had told him: that youth knew the victim, the owner of an Xbox console, equipment, and games; that youth had played with the victim\u2019s Xbox; and that, about an hour previously, youth had been at the victim\u2019s house. The totality of the circumstances, when viewed together, establish an objectively reasonable basis for the officers to believe that youth had stolen the victim\u2019s Xbox.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">In sum, based on the totality of the circumstances known to the officers before Ballou confronted youth, we conclude that the officers had probable cause to arrest youth\u2014 that is, they had an objectively reasonable basis to believe that youth had committed a crime. The juvenile court did not err in denying youth\u2019s motion to suppress the evidence that was discovered during a search of his backpack.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-6\"> ORS 164.225(1) provides, in part, that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of burglary in the first degree if the person violates ORS 164.215 and the building is a dwelling!.]\u201d In turn, ORS 164.215 provides, in part, that \u201ca person commits the crime of burglary in the second degree if the person enters or remains unlawfully in a building with intent to commit a crime therein.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-7\"> ORS 164.045 provides, in part, that \u201c[a] person commits the crime of theft in the second degree\u201d if \u201cthe person commits theft as defined in ORS 164.015\u201d and the \u201ctotal value of the property in a single or aggregate transaction is $100 or more and less than $1,000.\u201d In turn, ORS 164.015 provides, in part, that \u201c[a] person commits theft when, with intent to deprive another of property or to appropriate property to the person or to a third person, the person *** Makes, appropriates, obtains or withholds such property from an owner thereof!.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b890-8\"> Youth requests that we exercise our discretion to review the record <em>de novo.
