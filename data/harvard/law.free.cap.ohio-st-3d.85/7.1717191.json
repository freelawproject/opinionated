Nevertheless, we disagree with the board\u2019s recommended sanction that respondent be publicly reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Respondent misappropriated client funds by placing settlement proceeds that he had agreed to use to pay his client\u2019s medical providers into his personal bank account for a period of over six years. In general, \u201c[t]he continuing public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest discipline, <em>lie., </em>disbarment] be imposed in misappropriation cases.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Belock </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 98, 100, 694 N.E.2d 897, 899.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Although we agree that the mitigating factors, <em>i.e., </em>restitution, no pattern of misconduct, and no evidence of deliberate conversion of client funds by respondent, warrant a lesser penalty than disbarment, we believe that the sanction should be more severe than a public reprimand. In other cases involving violations of DR 9-102(B)(3) and 9-102(B)(4) in which mitigating factors existed, we have imposed a one-year suspension or a one-year-stayed suspension. See <em>Erie-Huron Counties Joint Certified Grievance Commt. v. Miles </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 574, 669 N.E.2d 831 (mitigating evidence included character testimony, evidence that misconduct was limited to two incidents, and agreement to provide restitution); <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Warren </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 334, 612 N.E.2d 1223. Accordingly, we suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year, with the entire suspension stayed.
