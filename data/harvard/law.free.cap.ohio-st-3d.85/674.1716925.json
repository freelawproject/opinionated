It seeks to distinguish cases such <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721; <em>State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245; and <em>State ex rel. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 139, 642 N.E.2d 378, by observing that those cases involved the Industrial Commission of Ohio, which did, and continues to, have a statutory duty under former R.C. 4123.515 to explain its decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">While the bureau\u2019s statutory observations are true, we do not agree that they do \u2014 or should \u2014 excuse it from having to explain its decisions. The purpose of an explanation requirement is \u201cto inform the parties and potentially a reviewing court of the basis for the commission\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Yellow Freight </em>at 142, 642 N.E.2d at 380. As to the latter, we in <em>Mitchell </em>wrote:</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">\u201c\u2022[A] decision * * * which specifically sets forth the basis for the decision will enable this court, as well as the Court of Appeals for Franklin County, to readily discern the specific grounds relied upon and whether the record supports such a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>finding when a party to the proceeding initiates an action for a writ of mandamus. Our task will be eased by a succinct statement setting forth * * * why the claimant was granted or denied benefits.\u201d <em>Mitchell </em>at 484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E.2d at 725.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">From the perspective of the litigants, <em>Mitchell </em>also notes that \u201cequally as important, those parties precluded from perfecting an appeal in accordance with [former] R.C. 4123.519 will be better advised [by succinct explanation] as to why a particular decision was reached.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On a more personal level, Justice Douglas noted in his <em>Noll </em>concurrence:</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">\u201cIt is well to remember that we are dealing with the very existence of real live human beings who have suffered an industrial injury. They are not just another number to be dealt with in some perfunctory way. Surely it is not unreasonable, overburdensome or onerous to require the commission to set forth an explanation * * * .\u201d <em>Noll </em>at 210, 567 N.E.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">We do not believe that any of these considerations change merely because the bureau as opposed to the commission authored the order. Therefore, we find that the duty to explain its decisions also applies to the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">Having so found, we must next determine whether the order\u2019s explanation was adequate. The bureau denied the proposed settlement on a form specifically designed for that purpose. It lists three potential reasons for disapproval, with boxes next to each one. Those reasons are (1) \u201cthe requested settlement amount represents an excessive value for the above-referenced claim(s)\u201d; (2) \u201cthe employer was not willing to sign the settlement agreement\u201d; and (3) \u201cOther \u2014 There is no settlement value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">We find the selected option \u2014 no settlement value \u2014 to be self-explanatory. By so indicating, the bureau has articulated its belief that compensation paid previously is sufficient and that claimant is simply entitled to no more. Given the minor nature of claimant\u2019s injury, the ruling makes sense and, in and of itself, is deemed satisfactory.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">We affirm that portion of the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that imposes a duty to explain on the bureau. We reverse that portion which vacates the order and returns it to the bureau, and deny the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-11\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b814-12\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b814-13\">F.E. Sweeney, J., concurs in part and dissents in part and would grant the writ.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b814-14\">Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ALi\">dissenting. Because the majority imposes upon the bureau a requirement unjustified by any statute or rule, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">Former R.C. 4123.515 supplies the basis for the Industrial Commission\u2019s duty to explain its decisions, as set forth in <em>State ex rel. Mitchell v. Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St.3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E.2d 721, and its progeny. That statute expressly provided, in the context of a disputed claim for workers\u2019 compensation, that a district hearing officer <em>\u201cshall </em>present his decision <em>and the reasons therefor </em>in conformity with the requirements of division (B) of section 4121.36 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) (136 Ohio Laws, Part 1,1152.) See, also, former R.C. 4123.518 (imposing similar duties upon regional boards of review and the commission). (136 Ohio Laws, Part I, 1155.) That statutory mandate has since been <em>repealed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">R.C. 4123.65 governs agreed settlements of workers\u2019 compensation claims; it does not involve disputed claims. The statute grants the \u201cadministrator of workers\u2019 compensation\u201d and staff hearing officers appointed by the Industrial Commission the authority to approve or reject applications for final settlement between employers and their employees. Unlike former R.C. 4123.515 and 4123.518, R.C. 4123.65 does not impose upon the bureau, its administrator, or the assigned staff hearing officer, a duty to explain the rejection of a settlement. See R.C. 4123.65(C) and (D).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">While appellate panels may generally prefer decisions to be supported by explanations, in the absence of a requirement imposed by statutory scheme or rule, there seems to be no authority for an appellate court to insist that the bureau or the commission explain each decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">An analogy to appellate review of judicial decisions seems pertinent. Rules and statutes mandate explanation in only certain types of cases. But in other sorts of cases, appellate courts readily tolerate the unexplained decisions of trial courts \u2014 though the same benefits of explanation hold for judicial decisions no less than administrative decisions. See, <em>e.g., </em>Civ.R. 52; <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 325, 691 N.E.2d 275. Cf. R.C. 2953.21(C) and (G); <em>State ex rel. Konoff v. Moon </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 211, 680 N.E.2d 989.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-9\">I too prefer to have the bureau explain the reasons for its decisions. I believe, however, that this court may not \u201cenact\u201d a requirement to explain a settlement rejection; that is the function of legislation and lawful agency rulemaking.</p>\n<judges id=\"b815-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
