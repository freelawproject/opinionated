A prerequisite for such relief is a finding that \u201cthe performance of appellate counsel was deficient and the applicant was prejudiced by that deficiency.\u201d App.R. 26(B)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>Gillard was not denied the effective assistance of counsel on his first appeal as of <em>right </em>\u2014 i.e., his direct appeal to the court of appeals in 1987.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His counsel won the appeal for him. We cannot see how the assistance of counsel could have been more effective than that.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Moreover, assuming that Gillard had a viable ineffective-assistance claim against his appellate counsel, he should have raised any such claim in his 1988 cross-appeal to this court. See <em>Gillard III, 78 </em>Ohio St.3d at 549, 679 N.E.2d at 279. In that proceeding, Gillard was represented by different counsel. Hence, there was no obstacle to his presenting to us any ineffective-assistance claim he may have had.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Cf. <em>State v. Lentz </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 527, 529-530, 639 N.E.2d 784, 785-786 (counsel cannot be expected to argue his own ineffectiveness).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">The judgment of the court of appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

As we held in <em>Gillard III, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 550, 679 N.E.2d at 279-280, Gillard\u2019s counsel did not render ineffective assistance by failing to raise new issues in the court of appeals\u2019 1990 proceedings on remand from <em>Gillard I, </em>as such issues were beyond the scope of the remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-14\">. Jack A. Blakeslee represented Gillard before the court of appeals in 1987. After the state obtained leave to appeal, we granted Blakeslee\u2019s motion to withdraw. We then appointed John N. . Mackey and Kathleen O. Tatarsky to represent Gillard in this court. Five months after Blakeslee withdrew, Mackey and Tatarsky filed Gillard\u2019s delayed cross-appeal. Gillard\u2019s merit brief on cross-appeal was signed by Mackey and Tatarsky and filed nearly eight months after Blakeslee withdrew.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
