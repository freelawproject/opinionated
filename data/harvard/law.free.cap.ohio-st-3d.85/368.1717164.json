For the following reasons, the court of appeals correctly dismissed the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">First, any defect by the alleged failure to file criminal complaints is not cognizable in habeas corpus because Dozier was convicted and sentenced upon indictments rather than complaints. <em>Thornton v. Russell </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 93, 94, 694 N.E.2d 464, 465, citing <em>State v. Wac </em>(1981), 68 Ohio St.2d 84, 87, 22 O.O.3d 299, 301, 428 N.E.2d 428, 431, fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Second, Dozier did not attach copies of all of his pertinent commitment papers to his petition. R.C. 2725.04(D); <em>McBroom v. Russell </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 47, 48, 671 N.E.2d 10, 11. Although the attachments to his petition refer to a third criminal sentence, commitment papers for that sentence are not attached. <em>Smith v. Mitchell </em>(1998), 80 Ohio St.3d 624, 625, 687 N.E.2d 749, 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b507-14\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
