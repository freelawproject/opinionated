Upon review, we answer that question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-15\">Death benefits are set at sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the decedent\u2019s AWW, subject to a statewide maximum and minimum. R.C. 4123.59. In an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>occupational disease claim, average weekly wage is based on earnings for the year prior to disability onset. R.C. 4123.61. But where \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d exist and the traditional formula does not do \u201csubstantial justice\u201d to the claimant, an alternative method may be used. <em>Id,.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The traditional formula currently produced a zero AWW, which translated into an award at the minimum statewide AWW level. Claimant contends that mesothelioma\u2019s long latency presents the \u201cuncommon situation\u201d anticipated by the exception for \u201cspecial circumstances.\u201d See <em>State ex rel. Wireman v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 286, 551 N.E.2d 1265. She makes a convincing argument. We have already recognized the unique workers\u2019 compensation considerations posed by long-latency occupational diseases. This occupational disease, moreover, has certainly presented an uncommon situation \u2014 the occupational disease that killed claimant did not affect his income. We find, therefore, that \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d indeed exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The more difficult question is whether \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d notwithstanding, the AWW set by the commission is substantially just. We find that it is. AWW \u201c \u2018is designed to find a fair basis for award for the <em>loss of future compensation.\u2019 \u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Wireman, </em>49 Ohio St.3d at 287, 551 N.E.2d at 1266-1267. Here, when mesothelioma struck, the decedent had no future compensation to lose. He had withdrawn from the labor market without evidence of an intent to reenter.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Claimant last asserts that denial of a maximum award offends equal protection. This argument fails. Claimant compares her situation to that of claimants whose decedents experienced a loss of income due to death. The present claimant is not, therefore, similarly situated \u2014 a finding that is essential to a successful equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>protection claim. <em>State ex rel. Doersam v. Indus.
