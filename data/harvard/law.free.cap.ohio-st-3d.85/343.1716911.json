The first question requires us to determine whether the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as it is used in R.C. 3937.18 includes helicopters. It is well established that \u201c[i]n construing a statute, a court\u2019s paramount concern is the legislative intent in enacting the statute. * * * In determining legislative intent, the court first looks to the language in the statute and the purpose to be accomplished.\u201d <em>State v. S.R. </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 590, 594-595, 589 N.E.2d 1319, 1323. It is also well established that absent a specific statutory definition, words are to be given their usual, normal, and customary meaning. See R.C. 1.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">The General Assembly did not define the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as used in R.C. 3937.18 and other sections of R.C. Title 39. \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d is defined in various sections of R.C. Title 45. However, these definitions specifically indicate the statutory provisions to which they apply. None refers to R.C. 3937.18 or to any other provision of R.C. Title 39. All but one of these definitions specifically limit a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d to something that can be operated on a highway or public road. See R.C. 4501.01, 4509.01, 4511.01, 4549.41. We have previously considered these definitions and their application to other nonspecified statutes. <em>State v. Heins </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 504, 651 N.E.2d 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-10\">In <em>Heins, </em>we held that in the absence of a definition specifically applicable to the statute at issue, the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d did not include a State Highway Patrol helicopter. After reviewing the various definitions in R.C. Title 45 and reviewing the statutory scheme and context of those definitions, we concluded that the phrase \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is \u201cgenerally meant to refer to land-operated vehicles.\u201d <em>State v. Heins, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 508, 651 N.E.2d at 936. The United States Supreme Court has also held that in common usage, the term \u201cvehicle\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201ccalls up the picture of a thing moving on land.\u201d <em>McBoyle v. United States </em>(1931), 283 U.S. 25, 26, 51 S.Ct. 340, 340, 75 L.Ed. 816, 818.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">These cases are helpful but do not define the meaning of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d under the uninsured/underinsured motorist insurance (\u201cUIM\u201d) statute. The absence of a definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d in R.C. 3937.18 and conflicting definitions of- the term elsewhere in the Revised Code and in dictionaries of general usage create an ambiguity as to the meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in this context. Ambiguity in a statute should be resolved by examining the legislative intent of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">R.C. 3937.18(A) mandates that an \u201cautomobile liability or motor vehicle liability policy of insurance insuring against loss resulting from liability imposed by law for bodily injury or death suffered by any person\u201d with respect to \u201cany motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state\u201d must provide equal coverage for damage by an uninsured or underinsured \u201cmotorist.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The legislative history on this statute is scant; however, the Summary of 1970 Enactments, Jan.-June 1970, 108th General Assembly, at 94 (Am.H.B. No. 620) states that the purpose of the original uninsured motorist statute was to make additional coverage available in \u201cautomobile insurance policies.\u201d The purpose statement refers to the \u201cdriver at fault\u201d and victims who are \u201cinjured by a driver.\u201d \u201cDriver\u201d is not commonly used to refer to an owner or operator of a helicopter. Nowhere in the legislative history is there a reference to helicopters or other aircraft, or to any means of transportation that cannot be used upon a highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">Further, in reviewing the legislative history of more recent amendments, it appears that this section is related to the financial responsibility laws in R.C. 4509.01 <em>et seq. </em>See Bulletin, 120th General Assembly of the State of Ohio (1993-1994), S.B. No. 20, in 145 Ohio Senate and House Journals Index and Appendix (1993-1994) 171. This relationship is further supported by the use of parallel language and terminology in R.C. 3937.18 and 4509.01. R.C. 3937.18 specifically applies to any \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy\u201d of insurance. This same term is used and specifically defined in the financial responsibility statutes. A \u201cmotor-vehicle liability policy\u201d of insurance as defined in R.C. 4509.01(L) is based upon a definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d that is limited to \u201cdevice[s] by which any person or property may be transported upon a highway.\u201d R.C. 4509.01(H). Thus, although this definition does not specifically apply to R.C. 3937.18 and, therefore, is not controlling, it lends support to the argument that the financial responsibility laws and the UIM statute are related in purpose and that the General Assembly intended them both to apply only to policies that insure against liability arising from the ownership or operation of \u201cvehicles\u201d that can be used for transportation on the highway. A helicopter cannot travel \u201cupon a highway,\u201d and we therefore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>hold that it is not a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d subject to a \u201cmotor vehicle liability policy of insurance\u201d under R.C. 3937.18(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Accordingly, we answer both of the certified questions in the negative, holding that a helicopter is not a motor vehicle for purposes of Ohio\u2019s mandatory UIM coverage under R.C. 3937.18. Because we hold that the statute does not require that insurance providers offer UIM coverage for vehicles that cannot be used on the highway, insurance providers may contractually limit UIM coverage to motorized land vehicles.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b484-6\">F.E. Sweeney, Cook and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b484-7\">Douglas, Resnick and Pfeifer, JJ., dissent.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-11\">. We note that both the Pacific Indemnity policy and the Auto Owners policy use the \u201cland\u201d vehicle restriction somewhere in their policies. We make no comment as to whether the restriction affects the UIM coverage in both, however.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b484-11\">. R.C. 3937.01 excludes insurance against \u201cliability\u201d arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of aircraft from the provisions of R.C. 3937.01 through 3937.16, but not from R.C. 3937.18. The dissent cites this exclusionary provision to support its contention that the General Assembly clearly intended for insurance against liability arising from the use of an aircraft to be included in R.C. 3937.18. However, this exclusion provides no such clarity. The aircraft exclusion in R.C. 3937.01 could apply to motor vehicle insurance policies under the designated sections, or it could apply to other forms of casualty insurance also covered under the specified sections. At best, this exclusion provision may lend support to the argument that the statutory scheme is ambiguous and does not, on its face, define whether the General Assembly intended the UIM statute to apply to aircraft. Once this ambiguity is recognized, we must still look to the legislative history to determine the intent of the General Assembly.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b484-8\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A4h\">dissenting. The first certified question presented to this court is \u201cIs a helicopter a \u2018motor vehicle\u2019 under Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 4501.01 for purposes of the mandatory underinsured motorist coverage set forth in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3937.18?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Chief Justice Moyer, writing for the majority, states that the various code definitions and dictionary definitions are collectively ambiguous. See R.C. 4501.01, 4509.01, 4511.01, and 4549.41. I agree. However, a headlong plunge into a legislative-intent inquiry is quite unnecessary. R.C. 3937.01 states: \u201cSections 3937.01 to 3937.16 of the Revised Code apply to casualty insurance including fidelity, surety, and guaranty bonds, and to all forms of motor vehicle insurance * * * except * * * (C) Insurance against loss of or damage to aircraft or against liability, other than employer\u2019s liability, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of aircraft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">How much clearer could the General Assembly be? Why rely on \u201cambiguous\u201d code definitions and \u201cscant\u201d legislative histories, as the majority has done, when the answer is straightforward? If \u201caircraft\u201d were not regarded as included within the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d why then would the General Assembly carve out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>an exception for aircraft insurance from motor vehicle insurance? I do not know, nor do my colleagues.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">R.C. 3937.01 applies to R.C. 3937.01 through 3937.16, not to R.C. 3937.18. Had the General Assembly wanted to except aircraft from the provisions of R.C. 3937.18, it could easily have done so. Given the proximity of the sections, it defies credulity to suggest that the General Assembly did not consider the impact of not extending the aircraft exception to R.C. 3937.18. The majority would ignore this clear indication of legislative intent in favor of analyzing \u201cthe legislative history of more recent amendments\u201d in sections that appear related.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">If you choose to ignore R.C. 3937.01, the other various code definitions of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d are ambiguous. ' Therefore, the majority embarks on a global search of the code to find any definition of motor vehicle that could be engrafted onto R.C. 3937.18 to permit a negative answer to the certified question. The majority chooses to rely on R.C. 4509.01(H), which applies only to parts of R.C. Chapter 4509. I would rely on R.C. 4501.01, which applies to R.C. Chapter 4501 and \u201cChapters 4503., 4505., 4507., 4509., 4511., 4513., 4515., and 4517. of the Revised Code, and in the penal laws, except as otherwise provided.\u201d R.C. 4501.01. That is, I would rely on the definitional provision that has the widest code application, not the one with the most limited. R.C. 4501.01 even applies to the sections of R.C. Chapter 4509 to which R.C. 4509.01(H) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">According to R.C. 4501.01(A), \u201cvehicles\u201d means \u201ceverything on wheels or runners * * * but does not mean vehicles that are operated exclusively on rails or tracks or from overhead electric trolley wires and vehicles that belong to any police department, municipal fire department, or volunteer fire department.\u201d Respondents argue, in essence, that a helicopter cannot be a \u201cvehicle\u201d because it does not have wheels or runners. They argue that helicopters are equipped with \u201cskids,\u201d which are not the same as \u201crunners.\u201d However, Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1986) 2133 defines \u201cskid\u201d as \u201ca runner used as a member of the landing gear of an airplane or helicopter.\u201d Based upon this definition, skids and runners are the same for purposes of this statute. Therefore, a helicopter on wheels or runners is a \u201cvehicle\u201d as defined in R.C. 4501.01(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">A \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is defined in R.C. 4501.01(B) as \u201cany vehicle * * * that is propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power or power collected from overhead electric trolley wires.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A helicopter is a vehicle as defined in R.C. 4501.01(A) and is propelled by power other than the two types excepted. Therefore, a helicopter is a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The second certified question is \u201cDoes the word \u2018land,\u2019 incorporated by reference in the form Auto-Owners policy [or used in the Pacific Policy], impermissibly modify the words \u2018motorized vehicle\u2019 so as to eliminate UIM coverage mandated by Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 3937.18?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Because R.C. 3937.18 mandates coverage for all motor vehicles, as defined above, such a modification would impermissibly restrict the coverage and would, therefore, violate public policy. See <em>Horsely v. United Ohio Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 58 Ohio St.3d 44, 567 N.E.2d 1004; <em>Ady v. W. Am. Ins. Co. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 593, 23 O.O.3d 495, 433 N.E.2d 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Accordingly, I would answer both of the certified questions in the affirmative, holding that a helicopter on wheels or runners is a motor vehicle for purposes of Ohio\u2019s uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage and that insurance providers may not limit the types of motor vehicles to be covered. I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b486-7\">Douglas and Resnick, JJ., concur in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b485-9\">.
