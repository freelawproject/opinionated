We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">The fence, in this case, indeed set forth the boundaries of work activity. It also served to keep unauthorized nonemployees out, and, in so doing, established its confines as a place accessible only to employees for the purpose of carrying out the company\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is reversed, and a limited writ is granted, which returns the cause to the commission for further consideration of claimant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-13\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited unit granted.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b511-14\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

This controversy is another in a line of cases that have struggled with the concept of \u201cworkshop\u201d for purposes of Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 applicability. Because I do not believe that claimant was injured in a \u201cworkshop,\u201d I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-16\">Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 covers \u201cworkshops and factories.\u201d The former is \u201c \u2018a room or place wherein power driven machinery is employed and manual labor is exercised by way of trade for gain or otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Buurma Farms, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 111, 113, 630 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>686, 687. Claimant contends that because the scrap yard was a \u201cplace\u201d utilizing the requisite machinery and labor, it constituted a workshop.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Claimant\u2019s argument has already been twice rejected. In <em>State ex rel. Double v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 13, 599 N.E.2d 259, decedent died in an accident at an open construction site. In declaring that the site was not a workshop, we reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201cA VSSR is an employer penalty and must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor. * * * It must also be specific enough to \u2018plainly apprise an employer of his legal obligations towards his employees.\u2019 * * * It thus follows that an employer should not have to speculate as to whether it falls within the class of employers to whom a specific safety requirement applies. Ohio Adm. Code Chapter 4121:l-5\u2019s reference to \u2018workshops and factories\u2019 does not make it apparent that <em>all </em>employers and places of employment fall thereunder. Had the commission intended Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 to encompass all employers and places of employment, it would presumably have used that very language.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at 16-17, 599 N.E.2d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\"><em>State ex rel. Waugh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 453, 674 N.E.2d 1385, reaffirmed this position, in denying applicability to a claimant injured while mowing the plant\u2019s lawn:</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">\u201cWaugh contends that Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 also applies to workplaces without structural boundaries by seizing on the \u2018room <em>or place\u2019 </em>language. Since this language is in the disjunctive, he argues that the definition transcends boundaries, extending to <em>any </em>place the requisite machinery and labor are in use. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">\u201cWe disagree. Our definition refers to a place wherem the relevant power machinery and manual labor [are] employed, not whereat these activities occur. The court of appeals in <em>State ex rel. York Temple Country Club, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(Apr. 18, 1985), Franklin App. 84AP-818, unreported, recognized this small but significant distinction and, adopting its referee\u2019s reasoning, concurred that \u2018the \u201cshop\u201d portion of \u201cworkshop\u201d connotes some sort of enclosure.\u2019 The <em>York </em>court therefore concluded that a claimant\u2019s injury by an errant golf ball while working at a golf course driving range had not occurred in a workshop. We find this logic compelling, as is manifest' from our decisions in <em>Buurma Farms, [State ex rel.) Wiers Farms [v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 569, 634 N.E.2d 1019], and <em>State ex rel. Double v. Indus. Comm. </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">\u201cIn the face of this logic, we cannot transform the accepted meaning of workshop to account for provisions in Ohio Adm.Code Chapter 4121:1-5 that seemingly regulate outdoor activity.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 455-456, 674 N.E.2d at 1387-1388.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>Buurma Farms </em>and <em>Wiers Farms </em>reinforce the concept of \u201cworkshop\u201d as having some sort of structural enclosure. The question currently posed is whether perimeter fencing is enough of a structural enclosure. I do not believe that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Pivotal to safety code applicability in both <em>Buurma Farms </em>and <em>Wiers Farms </em>was the presence of the injurious machinery <em>within a building </em>on the farm property. This is consistent with the commission\u2019s position that the structural enclosure contemplated by a workshop is something more than a boundary marker.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">A VSSR must be strictly construed in the employer\u2019s favor. <em>State ex rel. Burton v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 170, 545 N.E.2d 1216. Towards this end, a specific safety requirement must \u201c \u2018plainly * * * apprise an employer of his legal obligations towards his employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Frank Brown &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St.3d 162, 163, 524 N.E.2d 482, 484, quoting <em>State ex rel. Holdosh v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 179, 36 O.O. 516, 78 N.E.2d 165, syllabus. <em>Waugh </em>reasoned that these tenets were such that \u201c \u2018an employer should not have to speculate as to whether it falls within the class of employers to whom a specific safety requirement applies.\u2019 \u201d <em>Waugh </em>at 456, 674 N.E.2d at 1388, quoting <em>Double, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 17, 599 N.E.2d at 261. The cited decisions do not imply \u2014 let alone plainly apprise an inquiring employer\u2014 that an outdoor scrap yard, fenced or unfenced, is a workshop. To the contrary, one is left with the impression that outdoor work is exempt from classification as a workshop-related activity. Accordingly, a VSSR penalty is inappropriate.</p>\n<judges id=\"b513-7\">Moyer, C.J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
