Johnson has also filed a cross-appeal, contending that the trial court and court of appeals erred in dismissing his products liability claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">R.C. 2745.01</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">R.C. 2745.01 became effective November 1, 1995. See Am.H.B. No. 103, 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 756, 760.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This legislation represents yet another attempt by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>the General Assembly to govern when and under what circumstances an intentional tort claim may be commenced and maintained by an employee against his or her employer.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Notably, in Section 3 of Am.H.B. No. 103, the General Assembly has declared its intent to supersede the effects of several decisions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>this court and to establish statutory standards, different from the common law, with respect to intentional torts in the workplace.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">BP and its supporting <em>amici curiae </em>contend that R.C. 2745.01 is constitutional in all respects. To that end, BP and its supporting <em>amici curiae </em>argue that the General Assembly has the authority under its police powers to enact legislation that establishes standards different from the common law, that other jurisdictions have upheld legislation similar to R.C. 2745.01, and that R.C. 2745.01 represents a reasonable balance between employee and employer interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We do not dispute the long-standing principle that the General Assembly has the authority, within constitutional limitations, to change the common law by legislation. See <em>Thompson v. Ford </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 74, 79, 57 O.O. 96, 99, 128 N.E.2d 111, 115. We are also mindful of the fundamental precepts that all legislative enactments enjoy a strong presumption of constitutionality, <em>Arnold v. Cleveland </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 35, 38, 616 N.E.2d 163, 166, and that the role of a court when considering the constitutionality of an Act is not to judge the wisdom of the legislation, <em>Austintown Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Tracy </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 353, 356, 667 N.E.2d 1174, 1176. However, these general principles are not absolute. Thus, when the validity of a statute is challenged on constitutional grounds, it is our duty to determine the meaning and effect of the Constitution vis-a-vis the challenged legislation. <em>State ex rel. Bishop v. Mt. Orab Village School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1942), 139 Ohio St. 427, 438, 22 O.O. 494, 498, 40 N.E.2d 913, 919. Moreover, if the legislation at issue exceeds the limits of legislative power, we must protect the rights of the citizens effected by the law and, if appropriate, declare the legislation invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">In response to our holdings in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, and <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, the General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Assembly enacted former R.C. 4121.80 (Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 733-737). See <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 631, 576 N.E.2d 722, 727, citing <em>Kunkler v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 135, 136-137, 522 N.E.2d 477, 479. In <em>Brady, </em>the court invalidated former R.C. 4121.80 in its entirety, and, in doing so, we thought that we had made it abundantly clear that any statute created to provide employers with immunity from liability for their intentional tortious conduct cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny. See, also, <em>State ex rel. Ohio AFL-CIO v. Voinovich </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 225, 230, 631 N.E.2d 582, 587.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Notwithstanding, the General Assembly has enacted R.C. 2745.01, and, again, seeks to cloak employers with immunity. In this regard, we can only assume that the General Assembly has either failed to grasp the import of our holdings in <em>Brady </em>or that the General Assembly has simply elected to willfully disregard that decision. In any event, we will state again our holdings in <em>Brady </em>and hopefully put to rest any confusion that seems to exist with the General Assembly in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">In <em>Brady, </em>the court held that former R.C. 4121.80 exceeded the power conferred by and conflicted with both Sections 34<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and 35,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Specifically, this court concluded that former R.C. 4121.80 was \u201ctotally repugnant\u201d to Section 34, Article II, because, in enacting the legislation, the General Assembly eliminated an employee\u2019s right to a common-law cause of action for an employer intentional tort that would otherwise benefit the employee. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d at 728. Therefore, former R.C. 4121.80 was not a law that furthered the \u201c \u2018comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>quoting Section 34, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Additionally, the court in <em>Brady </em>adopted the rationale from the dissent in <em>Taylor v. Academy Iron &amp; Metal Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 149, 162, 522 N.E.2d 464, 476,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and concluded that R.C. 4121.80 represented an invalid exercise of legislative authority. Specifically, the court held that \u201cthe legislature cannot, consistent with Section 35, Article II, enact legislation governing intentional torts that occur within the employment relationship, because such intentional tortious conduct will always take place outside that relationship. <em>Blankenship, supra. </em>Since we find that Section 35, Article II authorizes only enactment of laws encompassing death, injuries or occupational disease occasioned within the employment relationship, R.C. 4121.80 cannot logically withstand constitutional scrutiny, inasmuch as it attempts to regulate an area that is beyond the reach of its constitutional empowerment.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Clearly, the constitutional impediments at issue in <em>Brady, </em>concerning former R.C. 4121.80, also apply with equal force to R.C. 2745.01. Both statutes were enacted to serve identical purposes. Like former R.C. 4121.80, R.C. 2745.01 was created to provide immunity for employers from civil liability for employee injuries, disease, or death caused by the intentional tortious conduct of employers in the workplace.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Specifically, R.C. 2745.01(A) provides that an employer is not generally subject to liability for damages at common law or by statute for an intentional tort that occurs during the course of employment, but that an employer is subject to liability only for an \u201cemployment intentional tort\u201d as defined.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cEmployment intentional tort\u201d is defined in R.C. 2745.01(D)(1) as \u201can act committed by an employer in which the employer <em>deliberately and intentionally </em>injures, causes an occupational disease of, or causes the death of an employee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Further, R.C. 2745.01(B) states that employees or the dependent survivors of deceased employees who allege an intentional tort must demonstrate \u201cby <em>dear and convincing </em>evidence that the employer deliberately committed all of the elements of an employment intentional tort.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) This standard of clear and convincing evidence also applies to a response by the employee or the employee\u2019s representative to an employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment. R.C. 2745.01(C)(1). In addition, the statute requires that \u201cevery pleading, motion, or other paper\u201d be signed by the attorney of record or, if the party is not represented by an attorney, by the party. R.C. 2745.01(C)(2).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> And, if the requirements of R.C. 2745.01(C)(2) are not complied with, the court shall impose \u201can appropriate sanction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The sanction may include, but is not limited to, reasonable expenses incurred by the other party, including reasonable attorney fees. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">By establishing the foregoing standards in R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly has created a cause of action that is simply illusory. Under the definitional requirements contained in the statute, an employer\u2019s conduct, in order to create civil liability, must be both <em>deliberate </em>and <em>intentional. </em>Therefore, in order to prove an intentional tort in accordance with R.C. 2745.01(D)(1), the employee, or his or her survivors, must prove, at a minimum, that the actions of the employer amount to criminal assault. In fact, given the elements imposed by the statute, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>is even conceivable that an employer might actually be guilty of a criminal assault but exempt from civil liability under R.C. 2745.01(D)(1). <em>Taylor, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 162-163, 522 N.E.2d at 476 (Douglas, J., dissenting).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Indeed, the requirements imposed by R.C. 2745.01 are so unreasonable and excessive that the chance of recovery of damages by employees for intentional torts committed by employers in the workplace is virtually zero. In this regard, we agree with the court of appeals that R.C. 2745.01 \u201ccreates an insurmountable obstacle for victims of \u2018employment intentional torts.\u2019 \u201d See, also, Claybon, Ohio\u2019s \u201cEmployment Intentional Tort\u201d: A Workers\u2019 Compensation Exception, or the Creation of an Entirely New Cause of Action? (1996), 44 Clev.St.L.Rev. 381, 405-406 (\u201cTo impose a clear and convincing standard of proof, in addition to requiring specific intent, distorts the very balance the legislature was trying to achieve. Foreseeably, it will be extremely difficult for an employee to prove a case of intentional tort in anything short of a flagrant battery. With the threat of sanctions it is also foreseeable that an employeefs] attorney will not want to file .employee cases, otherwise risk being punished for what the court feels was not a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>\u2018good faith\u2019 argument, or for \u2018causing unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the action.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Accordingly, we find that R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional in its entirety. Because R.C. 2745.01 imposes excessive standards (deliberate and intentional act), with a heightened burden of proof (clear and convincing evidence), it is clearly not \u201ca law that furthers the \u2018 * * * comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d at 728, quoting Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. See, also, <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 615, 23 O.O.3d at 509, 433 N.E.2d at 577 (\u201cone of the avowed purposes of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act is to promote a safe and injury-free work environment. * * * Affording an employer immunity for his intentional behavior certainly would not promote such an environment, for an employer could commit intentional acts with impunity with the knowledge that, at the very most, his workers\u2019 compensation premiums may rise slightly.\u201d). Furthermore, because R.C. 2745.01 is an attempt by the General Assembly to govern intentional torts that occur within the employment relationship, R.C. 2745.01 \u201ccannot logically withstand constitutional scrutiny, inasmuch as it attempts to regulate an area that is beyond the reach of constitutional empowerment.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">After determining the constitutionality of R.C. 2745.01, and after reviewing the complaint, the court of appeals concluded that Johnson properly set forth a claim for common-law intentional tort against BP. We agree. In his complaint, Johnson alleged that he was exposed to a dangerous situation at the plant and that BP knew that such exposure would be substantially certain to cause injury. Accepting these allegations as true, as we are required to do, we hold that the complaint properly sets forth a claim of intentional tort sufficient to survive a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. See <em>Mitchell v. Lawson Milk Co. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 190, 532 N.E.2d 753.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">Therefore, for the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed with respect to its holding that R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional and with respect to its ruling that the complaint states a cause of action for common-law intentional tort sufficient to withstand a Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion to dismiss. Thus, Johnson\u2019s common-law intentional tort claim is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Cross-Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">In his complaint, Johnson also sought recovery against BP based upon various theories of products liability. The trial court held, and the court of appeals agreed, that Johnson was precluded from maintaining a products liability action against BP. Johnson has filed a cross-appeal in this court with respect to this matter, and we accepted jurisdiction. However, upon further consideration thereof, we dismiss the cross-appeal, <em>sua sponte, </em>as having been improvidently allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and cross-appeal dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b447-7\">Resnick, F.E.

If the victim brings an intentional tort suit against the tortfeasor, it is a tort action like any other. The employer has forfeited his status as such and all the attendant protections fall away. The Industrial Commission can have no jurisdiction over such an action. The lawsuit has no bearing upon any question relating to employment. The jurisdiction of the commission is limited to the matters delineated in Section 35, Article II. The General Assembly has no power to confer jurisdiction on the commission except as authorized by that constitutional provision. See <em>Crawford, supra </em>[110 Ohio St.], at 276, 143 N.E. at 575-576. Section 35 concerns itself solely with compensation for injuries arising from employment. R.C. 4121.80 concerns itself solely with injuries which by their nature have no connection whatsoever with the fact of employment. In enacting R.C. 4121.80, the General Assembly has exceeded the scope of the authority granted to it by the constitutional amendment, and the statute is, therefore, void as an improper exercise of legislative power.\u2019 (Emphasis <em>sic.)\u201d Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729, quoting <em>Taylor, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 162, 522 N.E.2d at 476 (Douglas, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\">.

See, however, Section 5(B), Article IV, Ohio Constitution (\u201cThe supreme court shall prescribe rules governing practice and procedure in all courts of the state, which rules shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right. * * * All laws in conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or effect after such rules have taken effect.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\">. The following excerpt from the <em>Taylor </em>dissent dealt with the definition of \u201cintentional tort\u201d contained in former R.C. 4121.80(G)(1), but the excerpt also exemplifies and adequately summarizes the absurdity of the elements imposed by the General Assembly in R.C. 2745.01(D)(1):</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">\u201cUnder this definition [former R.C. 4121.80(G)(1) ], an employer, in order to be held civilly liable, must have proceeded <em>deliberately </em>to cause death or injury to an employee. The implications of this standard are astounding. Legally speaking, an employer is now subject to civil liability <em>only if his actions amount to criminal assault or murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">\u201cR.C. 2903.02(A), setting forth the crime of murder, states: \u2018No person shall purposely cause the death of another.\u2019 \u2018Purposely\u2019 is defined in R.C. 2901.22(A), which provides that \u2018[a] person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result * * *.\u2019 R.C. 4121.80(G)(1) requires that the employer act with \u2018deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer * * * death.\u2019 Anything less will not result in civil liability. Thus, an employer is now civilly liable for an employee\u2019s death only if he commits murder, and even then his liability is substantially limited by other provisions of R.C. 4121.80.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">\u201cThe same is true of an employer who acts intentionally to cause injury to an employee. In fact, the criminal assault statutes require a <em>less </em>culpable mental state than R.C. 4121.80. R.C. 2903.11 sets forth the elements of felonious assault as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">\u201c \u2018(A) No person shall <em>knowingly </em>:</p>\n<p id=\"b445-11\">\u201c \u2018(1) Cause serious physical harm to another * * (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">\u201c \u2018Knowingly1 is defined in R.C. 2901.22(B): \u2018A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that such circumstances probably exist.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u201c \u2018Knowingly\u2019 is a less culpable state than \u2018purposely.\u2019 R.C. 2901.22(E); <em>State v. Wilkins </em>(1980), 64 Ohio St.2d 382, 18 O.O.3d 528, 415 N.E.2d 303. To act \u2018knowingly,\u2019 a person need not act with deliberate intent. <em>State v.

The majority opinion views the issue presented by this case as a question of \u201cwhat is right?\u201d but I believe the true question is \u201cwho decides what is right?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">The General Assembly passed this legislation as part of its policy-making function, a function inherent in the legislative power. With this decision, however, the majority usurps the legislative function; it cloaks judicial legislation in the guise of constitutional scholarship. Unconstitutionality is a legitimate basis for overturning democratically enacted legislation, but even gentle scrutiny of the majority opinion shows that there is no justification for labeling this legislation unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">We should be concerned by the use of judicial power to advance a particular social philosophy. When judges declare governmental actions unconstitutional based upon a personal distaste for the policies adopted through the legislative process, we cease to be governed by democracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Our Ohio Constitution restrains the powers and discretion of government \u2014 all three branches of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">This case is about properly defining the term \u201cintentional tort\u201d in the employment context. In <em>Harasyn v. Normandy Metals, Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 173, 551 N.E.2d 962, this court distinguished \u201cdirect intent\u201d intentional torts from other intentional torts. That case defined \u201cdirect intent\u201d intentional torts as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>\u201cwhere the actor does something which brings about the exact result desired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175, 551 N.E.2d at 964. It classified other intentional torts as where \u201cthe actor does something which he believes is substantially certain to cause a particular result, even if the actor does not desire that result.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Prior decisions of this court have set forth a broad definition of the term in the employment context, including both direct intent and inferred intent within the definition of employer intentional tort. By enacting R.C. 2745.01, the General Assembly sought to statutorily narrow that common-law definition to \u201cdirect intent\u201d torts only. The majority here determines the General Assembly has no authority to do this, but does not support its position with legitimate reasoning that R.C. 2745.01 offends both Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">The majority, citing <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, concludes that R.C. 2745.01 violates Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because it \u201cclearly\u201d does not further the \u201ccomfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes.\u201d Whether the legislation does or not, Section 34, Article II does not disqualify it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Section 34, Article II resulted from claims that the General Assembly had no authority under the Constitution to legislate in the area of minimum wages and the like. The argument against enacting such laws was that they impaired the constitutional right to contract. So, the citizens approved a constitutional amendment setting forth that \u201c[ljaws <em>may </em>be passed fixing and regulating the hours of labor, establishing a minimum wage, and providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes; and no other provision of the constitution shall impair or limit this power.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Section 34, Article II, Ohio Constitution. From that, the majority gleans a prohibition against any legislation that does <em>not </em>\u201cprovid[e] for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employes.\u201d This section does not say that the General Assembly may pass <em>only </em>laws that provide for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of employees. It also does not say that no law may ever be passed that <em>does not </em>provide for the comfort, health, safety, and general welfare of employees. There is nothing in this <em>grant </em>of authority that can properly be read as a <em>limitation </em>on authority. Yet this is exactly the interpretation given it by a plurality in <em>Brady </em>and followed today.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">It is interesting to note that in <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 196, 530 N.E.2d 1, and <em>Rocky River v. State Emp. Relations Bd. </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 1, 539 N.E.2d 103, this court was deeply divided on the issue of whether Section 34, Article II applied to anything more than wage and hour regulation. A mere two years later, the <em>Brady </em>plurality jumped from the hotly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>debated conclusion that Section 34, Article II allows broader legislation for the welfare of employees, to the specious conclusion that it <em>prevents </em>any legislation that is not specifically enacted for employees\u2019 welfare. There is no better argument in today\u2019s decision, just a repeat of the <em>Brady </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">Moreover, for the majority to cite Section 34, Article II, a provision aimed at <em>employee </em>welfare, as a basis for holding R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional is inconsistent with its premise that the injuries to Brady and Johnson were not sustained by them as <em>employees </em>\u2014 given that employer intentional torts fall outside the scope of employment. Justice Brown noted this inconsistency in his <em>Brady </em>concurrence when he stated, \u201c[Section 34, Article II] does not apply to employer intentional torts because they are not part of the employment relationship.\u201d <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 639, 576 N.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Accordingly, Section 34, Article II offers no basis for finding R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The other basis the majority cites for finding R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional is the immunity/exclusivity provision of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The majority\u2019s argument, resurrected from <em>Brady, </em>is that Section 35 grants authority to the General Assembly to enact laws regarding injuries occasioned within the employment context, and thus, somehow, this section thereby proscribes the passing of any laws affecting injuries outside the scope of employment. Like its Section 34 argument, the majority\u2019s Section 35 argument is unconvincing in its efforts to convert a grant of authority into a restraint. <em>Brady, </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 634, 576 N.E.2d at 729. Justice Brown also noted this inconsistency in his <em>Brady </em>concurrence, saying: \u201cIntentional torts do not * * * come within the scope of Section 35, Article II. This does not mean, however, that the General Assembly has <em>no </em>power to modify intentional tort law by legislation. The legislature may do so in the exercise of its police power.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 640, 576 N.E.2d at 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The majority concedes that \u201cthe General Assembly has the authority, within constitutional limitations, to change the common law by legislation.\u201d If, as <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, concludes, Section 35, Article II does not preempt common-law or statutory actions for employer intentional torts, then the General Assembly has authority to legislate in this area. This includes the authority to determine the contextual definition for intentional tort. If, as <em>Brady </em>concludes, Section 35, Article II precludes the legislation now at issue, then it can only be because such torts <em>do </em>arise within the course of employment. But Section 35, Article II cannot be both inapplicable to employer intentional torts and, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>same time, offended by any legislation regulating such torts. Yet those are exactly the contradictory conclusions reached by <em>Brady </em>and followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Though unnecessary in this dissent, I wish to take issue with the \u201coutside the scope of employment\u201d fiction initially employed in <em>Blankenship. </em>In <em>Ruckman v. Cubby Drilling, Inc. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 117, 689 N.E.2d 917, this court stated that the phrase \u201cin the course of employment\u201d limited compensable injuries \u201cto those sustained by an employee while performing a required duty in the employer\u2019s service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 120, 689 N.E.2d at 921. \u201cAn injury is compensable if it is sustained by an employee while that employee engages in activity that is consistent with the contract for hire and logically related to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\"><em>Blankenship </em>involved employees who claimed they were rendered ill by exposure to noxious chemicals while performing assigned duties for their employer. Nevertheless, the <em>Blankenship </em>majority concluded that employer intentional torts, although occurring within the course of employment, were nonetheless excluded from the pervasive immunity provided by Section 35, Article II. <em>Blankenship, </em>69 Ohio St.2d at 612-614, 23 O.O.3d at 507-508, 433 N.E.2d at 575-577.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">In <em>Brady, </em>an employee who was on his shift, performing the duties expected of him, claimed he was injured when he helped clean up an accidental chemical spill caused by another employee, similarly performing his assigned duties for the same employer. In <em>Walton v. Springwood Products, Inc. </em>(1995), 105 Ohio App.3d 400, 401, 663 N.E.2d 1365, 1366, an employee was injured \u201cin the course and scope of his employment\u201d when his hand was caught in the machine he was operating for his employer. In <em>Cook v. Cleveland Elec. Illum. Co. </em>(1995), 102 Ohio App.3d 417, 419-420, 657 N.E.2d 356, 358, an employee was injured \u201cin the course and scope of his employment\u201d while performing \u201ca normal part of his duties.\u201d And in <em>McGee v. Goodyear Atomic Corp. </em>(1995), 103 Ohio App.3d 236, 239, 659 N.E.2d 317, 319, an employee claimed he suffered liver damage due to exposure to a chemical solvent \u201c[throughout his employment.\u201d See, also, <em>Richey v. Johnson &amp; Hardin Co. </em>(July 17, 1998), Hamilton App. No. C-970767, unreported, 1998 WL 395899 (employee injured while cleaning a printing press for his employer); <em>Jones v. Gen. Motors Corp. </em>(May 9, 1997), Defiance App. No. 4-96-21, unreported, 1997 WL 232730 (employee fatally injured while performing an ordinary task assigned by his employer).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Despite what would seem to be an indisputable fact that <em>all </em>of these injuries arose in the course of employment, and despite the clear language of Section 35, Article II precluding remedies other than workers\u2019 compensation for such ipju<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ries, the courts in these cases found that the employer could be liable to respond in damages. The facts in this case are similar. As the majority notes, Johnson himself concedes in his complaint that he was injured \u201cduring the course of his employment.\u201d But, following <em>Blankenship, </em>the majority concludes that Johnson was injured outside the scope of his employment, although his injuries were sustained \u201cwhile performing a required duty in the employer\u2019s service,\u201d <em>Ruckman, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 120, 689 N.E.2d at 921, and while \u201cengage[d] in activity that is consistent with the contract for hire and logically related to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Our Constitution requires that such injuries be compensated by workers\u2019 compensation <em>in lieu of any other </em>statutory or common-law remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The morass created by <em>Blankenship </em>and its progeny concerning the definition of an employer intentional tort is exactly what the General Assembly attempted to remedy by enacting R.C. 2745.01 \u2014 to foreclose the filing of cases in derogation of the clear language of Section 35, Article II and the exclusivity intended to be afforded that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The majority opinion discloses its unfavorable view of the public policy behind R.C. 2745.01 by characterizing it as the General Assembly\u2019s attempt \u201cto provide employers with immunity from liability for their intentional tortious conduct.\u201d The statute, however, codifies a cause of action for employees for injuries not covered under Section 35, Article II.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The majority is troubled by the legislative policy of setting a high bar for tort actions in derogation of Section 35, Article II, calling the resulting cause of action \u201csimply illusory\u201d and the requirements \u201cunreasonable and excessive.\u201d But in a constitutional democracy, one is moved to ask, \u201cSays who?\u201d The majority also complains about the General Assembly\u2019s choice of policy, commenting that \u201cthe chance of recovery of damages by employees for intentional torts committed by employers in the workplace is virtually zero.\u201d The likelihood of recovery, however, seems far afield of the two asserted arguments for unconstitutionality. Instead, it expresses disdain for the General Assembly\u2019s public-policy decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">It is true that the statute may rarely be invoked. But that ought to be the case when claims are permitted in derogation of the constitutional compromise between employers and employees. And one would hope that an employer deliberately injuring an employee would be very rare indeed.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>YII</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">\u201c \u2018The question, whether a law be void for its repugnancy to the Constitution is, at all times, a question of much delicacy, which ought seldom, if ever, to be decided in the affirmative in a doubtful case.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel.

In Ohio, prior to 1911, an employee attempting to recover damages against an employer for injuries sustained in the workplace had to file a common-law action against his or her employer. <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 643, 576 N.E.2d 722, 735 (Holmes, J., dissenting). Injured employees were required to prove that the employer had a duty of care toward them and that the employer breached that duty. Keeton, Dobbs, Keeton &amp; Owens, Prosser <em>&amp; </em>Keeton on the Law of Torts (5 Ed.1984), Section 80, 569, 572-573. Employers could raise three defenses against such claims: (1) contributory negligence, (2) assumption of the risk, and (3) the fellow servant rule. Note, Exceptions to the Exclusive Remedy Requirements of Workers\u2019 Compensation Statutes (1983), 96 Harv.L.Rev. 1641, 1644. But \u201c[t]his system of litigation for obtaining compensation for work-related injuries became widely recognized as not meeting the needs of injured workers. In Ohio, a great number of such injuries were reportedly going uncompensated because of the legal defenses available to the employer.\u201d <em>Brady </em>at 643, 576 N.E.2d at 735 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">In response to the crisis, in 1911, the General Assembly enacted Ohio\u2019s first workers\u2019 compensation law. See 102 Ohio Laws 524 <em>el seq. </em>The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act provided a more equitable system for compensating employees\u2019 work-related injuries. Both employer and employee could avoid the burdensome cost of litigation. Claybon, Ohio\u2019s \u201cEmployment Intentional Tort\u201d: A Workers\u2019 Compensation Exception, or the Creation of an Entirely New Cause of Action? (1996), 44 Cleve.St.L.Rev. 381, 386. The employee received a prompt recovery for injuries that occurred in the workplace without having to prove negligence. <em>Id. </em>In return, the employer was no longer subject to uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>damages by way of lawsuits, but also could no longer assert any defense. <em>Id. </em>G.C. 1465-57 of the newly enacted workers\u2019 compensation law provided that any employer who paid the state insurance fund premiums \u201cshall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute, save as hereinafter provided, for injuries or death of any such employee.\u201d 102 Ohio Laws 524, 528. However, there were two exceptions to the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation remedy. If an employee\u2019s injuries were caused by a \u201cwilful\u201d act of the employer or if an employee\u2019s injuries were caused by an employer\u2019s violation of a safety ordinance or statute, the employee could opt for either a common-law action against the employer or recovery under the workers\u2019 compensation system. G.C. 1465-61, 102 Ohio Laws 524, 529. Employer participation was not compulsory. G.C. 1465-57,1465-58, <em>id. </em>at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In 1912, Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution was adopted, which authorized the General Assembly to establish and regulate a workers\u2019 compensation fund that required employer participation.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In 1931, the General Assembly repealed the exceptions for willful acts and for employers\u2019 violations of safety standards. 114 Ohio Laws 26, 39, repealing G.C. 1465-76 (formerly G.C. 1465-61). Awards for violations of specific safety requirements were absorbed and codified into the workers\u2019 compensation system as awards supplemental to the workers\u2019 compensation benefits if an employer\u2019s violation of a specific safety requirement (\u201cVSSR\u201d) caused the employee\u2019s injury. See, <em>e.g., State ex rel. Go-Jo Industries v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 529, 700 N.E.2d 1264. Subsequent to the repeal of the willful-act exception, courts interpreted the workers\u2019 compensation system to be the exclusive remedy for work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">But in 1982, this court in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572, held that an employee is not precluded by the exclusivity provisions of the workers\u2019 compensation laws from bringing a common-law intentional tort action against the employer because workers\u2019 compensation covers only injuries received in the course of or arising out of employment, whereas an intentional act occurs outside the scope of employment. Two years later, in <em>Jones v. VIP Dev. Co. </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, the court defined an intentional tort in the employment setting as \u201can act committed with the intent to injure another, or committed with the belief that such injury is substantially certain to occur.\u201d <em>Id., </em>paragraph one of the syllabus. While recognizing that \u201cintent to injure\u201d was a requirement for intentional tort, the court in <em>Jones </em>also determined that conduct by an employer that <em>lacks </em>specific intent to injure can also be an \u201cintentional\u201d tort. In response to <em>Jones, </em>the General Assembly enacted R.C. 4121.80, which defined \u201cintentional tort\u201d in the employment setting as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201c(G) As used in this section:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">\u201c(1) \u2018Intentional tort\u2019 is an act committed with the intent to injure another or committed with the belief that the injury is substantially certain to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\"><em>\u201c </em>* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">\u201c <em>\u2018Substantially certain\u2019 means that an employer acts with deliberate intent to cause an employee to suffer injury, disease, condition, or death.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 1986 Am.Sub.S.B. No. 307, 141 Ohio Laws, Part I, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Despite the General Assembly\u2019s definition in R.C. 4121.80 of \u201csubstantially certain\u201d as requiring \u201cdeliberate intent to cause * * * injury,\u201d the court in <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100, 522 N.E.2d 489, held that some acts committed with a culpability greater than recklessness, but not deliberately done with an intent to injure, should be recognized as intentional. <em>Id. </em>at paragraph six of the syllabus. This holding was essentially echoed in <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115, 570 N.E.2d 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">In a final undoing of the General Assembly\u2019s work, the court in <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp. </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722, held that R.C. 4121.80 was unconstitutional <em>in -toto.' Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-10\">In these cases, this court has blurred the distinction between conduct truly outside the scope of employment (an intentional act) and conduct that is part and parcel of the employment relationship. But I believe that only injuries caused by truly <em>intentional </em>acts fall outside the coverage of the workers\u2019 compensation system, as established by Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, and may be the basis for an intentional tort action against an employer, while all other injuries are compensable only through the workers\u2019 compensation system. Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution does not differentiate between types or causes of injuries. Its language is all-encompassing:</p>\n<p id=\"b454-11\">\u201cFor the purpose of providing compensation to workmen and their dependents, for death, injuries or occupational disease, occasioned in the course of such workmen\u2019s employment, laws may be passed establishing [a workers\u2019 compensation system]. Such compensation shall be in lieu of <em>all other rights </em>to compensation, or damages, for such death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law, passed in accordance herewith, <em>shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law </em>or by statute for such death, injuries or occupational disease.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">The court makes no differentiation between degrees of risk levels of knowledge and certainty in interpreting the workers\u2019 compensation laws. The fact patterns in <em>Jones </em>and <em>Van Fossen </em>clearly fall under Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution as part of the workers\u2019 compensation trade-off. This court, in its line of decisions since <em>Blankenship, </em>has imposed another level of compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>for employees despite the clear proof that these injuries were part and parcel of the employment relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">It is in light of this history that I disagree with the majority\u2019s holding that R.C. 2745.01 is unconstitutional pursuant to Sections 34 and 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In supporting its position in this case, the majority reiterates reasoning from <em>Brady v. Safety-Kleen Corp., </em>61 Ohio St.3d 624, 576 N.E.2d 722. In <em>Brady, </em>the court determined that R.C. 4121.80 exceeded the authority granted by Sections 34 and 35 of Article II of the Ohio Constitution. The majority, therefore, holds that R.C. 2745.01 likewise violates these sections of the Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">I would hold that R.C. 2745.01 does not conflict with Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution states:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">\u201cLaws may be passed * * * providing for the comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees * *</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">The plurality opinion in <em>Brady </em>stated that \u201c[a] legislative enactment that attempts to remove a right to a remedy under common law that would otherwise benefit the employee cannot be held to be a law that furthers the \u2018 * * * comfort, health, safety and general welfare of all employees * * *.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>61 Ohio St.3d at 633, 576 N.E.2d at 728. The majority here makes the same conclusion about R.C. 2745.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">In support of its holding that R.C. 2745.01 violates Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution, the majority states, \u201c[L]ike former R.C. 4121.80, R.C. 2745.01 was created to provide immunity for employers from civil liability for employee injuries, disease, or death caused by the intentional tortious conduct of employers in the workplace.\u201d I disagree and believe that the opposite is true. R.C. 2745.01 does not deny but instead expressly provides employees a statutory avenue of redress for employee injuries caused by employer intentional torts. Specifically, R.C. 2745.01(A) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">\u201cAn employer <em>* </em>* * shall be <em>subject </em>to liability to an employee * * * for damages <em>for an employment intentional tort.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">This language does not remove a right to a remedy. It codifies it. Codification is not removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-14\">Without question the General Assembly\u2019s definition of intentional tort sets a higher threshold in defining intentional tort than the court-fashioned definition. However, it was the court that resurrected the intentional tort exception to workers\u2019 compensation laws in <em>Blankenship </em>and then diluted its definition in <em>Jones </em>and its progeny to an act done with knowledge that it is substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>certain to cause harm, as opposed to an act done with the intent to cause harm. See <em>Bishop v. Hybud Equip. Corp. </em>(1988), 42 Ohio App.3d 55, 58, 536 N.E.2d 694, 697. Further, in the original workers\u2019 compensation laws, there was a willful-act exception to the exclusivity of the workers\u2019 compensation coverage. See G.C. 1465-76, 104 Ohio Laws 193, 194 (which defined \u201cwilful act\u201d as \u201can act 'done knowingly and purposely with the direct object of injuring another\u201d). Thus, in effect, R.C. 2745.01, which requires \u201cdeliberate intent\u201d to cause injury, does not remove a right to a remedy; it merely restores the definition of intentional tort to its proper and original, bargained-for definition. But even this definition was part of the <em>Jones </em>holding: \u201cAn intentional tort is an act committed with the intent to injure another * * *.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 90, 15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046, at paragraph one of the syllabus, and, therefore, has already been approved by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\">The majority also complains that the definitional restrictions in requiring an employment intentional tort to be deliberate and intentional render the cause of action illusory. Yet the original definition of \u201cintentional tort\u201d is an act done with intent to cause harm, not an act done with knowledge that it is substantially certain to cause harm. <em>Bishop, </em>42 Ohio App.3d at 58, 536 N.E.2d at 697. The mere fact the evidence will seldom dictate that an employee has a legitimate intentional tort case does not render R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional. I believe we must uphold the true definition of intentional tort to prevent an \u201cexpansive interpretation of the intentional tort exception [which] would thwart the [workers\u2019 compensation] scheme by eroding the exclusivity of both the liability and the recovery provided by workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d <em>Van Fossen, </em>36 Ohio St.3d at 113, 522 N.E.2d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">It is important to remember, in contrast to the bleak picture the majority depicts, that there is an avenue of redress for these particularly egregious, but not quite intentional, acts perpetrated by the employer that cause injury to an employee. Where an employer violates a specific safety requirement and that violation causes the employee injury, the employee can recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits <em>and </em>a VSSR award, which works not only to provide additional compensation to the employee but also to punish the employer for that conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Thus, R.C. 2745.01 does not remove a right to remedy, because employees have remedies available to them, as they had prior to the enactment of R.C. 2745.01. For injuries caused by no fault at all or by the negligence or recklessness of an employer, an employee may recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits. For injuries caused by more egregious acts of recklessness, an employer may be fined and employees may receive additional compensation by way of a VSSR award. Finally, where the employer commits a truly intentional act, the employee may bring an intentional tort action against the employer pursuant to R.C. 2745.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Accordingly, I would hold that R.C. 2745.01 does not conflict with Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">The majority also finds R.C. 2745.01 unconstitutional because Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution authorizes only legislation pertaining to acts that occur within the employment relationship. Therefore, the majority holds, the General Assembly went beyond the authority of Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because R.C. 2745.01 attempts to regulate conduct, intentional torts, that necessarily occurs outside the employment relationship. I would hold that the General Assembly has authority beyond Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution to enact R.C. 2745.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">I believe that the General Assembly never intended to rely on Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution as authority for enacting R.C. 2745.01. Am.H.B. No. 103, which enacted R.C. 2745.01, states:</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">\u201cThe General Assembly hereby declares its intent in enacting sections 2305.112 and 2745.01 of the Revised Code to supersede the effect of the Ohio Supreme Court decisions in <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chemicals, Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608 [23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572] (decided March 3, 1982); <em>Jones v. VIP Development Co. </em>(1982 <em>[sic, </em>1984]), 15 Ohio St.3d 90 [15 OBR 246, 472 N.E.2d 1046] (decided December 31, 1982 <em>[sic, </em>1984]); <em>Van Fossen v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 100 [522 N.E.2d 489] (decided April 14 <em>[sic, </em>13], 1988); <em>Pariseau v. Wedge Products, Inc. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 124 [522 N.E.2d 511] (decided April 13, 1988); <em>Hunter v. Shenango Furnace Co. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 235 [527 N.E.2d 871] (decided August 24, 1988); and <em>Fyffe v. Jeno\u2019s, Inc. </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 115 [570 N.E.2d 1108] (decided May 1, 1991), to the extent that the provisions of sections 2305.112 and 2745.01 of the Revised Code are to <em>completely and solely control </em>all causes of action <em>not </em>governed by Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution * * (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at Section 3, 146 Ohio Laws, Part I, 758.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">The General Assembly had authority to enact R.C. 2745.01 under its general grant of legislative power and did not need to rely on the specific grant of authority in Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution. And, in fact, the General Assembly specifically stated that R.C. 2745.01 was to control actions <em>not </em>governed by Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">Section 1, Article II of the Ohio Constitution provides that \u201c[t]he legislative power of the state shall be vested in a General Assembly.\u201d Within this general grant of authority is the General Assembly\u2019s police power. See <em>Marmet v. State </em>(1887), 45 Ohio St. 63, 70, 12 N.E. 463, 468. The General Assembly\u2019s ability to legislate under the police power \u201cis plenary, except as it may be specifically and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>clearly limited in the constitution.\u201d <em>Champaign Cty. Bd. of Commrs. v. Church </em>(1900), 62 Ohio St. 318, 344, 57 N.E. 50, 52. Within the scope of these police powers, the General Assembly \u201cmay modify or entirely abolish common-law actions and defenses.\u201d <em>Thompson v. Ford </em>(1955), 164 Ohio St. 74, 79, 57 O.O. 96, 99, 128 N.E.2d 111, 115. The General Assembly has authority to codify the common law. See, <em>e.g., Long v. Tokai Bank of California </em>(1996), 114 Ohio App.3d 116, 123, 682 N.E.2d 1052, 1057 (recognizing the General Assembly\u2019s power to codify products liability law). Thus, R.C. 2745.01 is a valid exercise of the General Assembly\u2019s police power because R.C. 2745.01 is a codification and modification of employer intentional tort case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">While the majority may prefer its own definition of \u201cintentional tort,\u201d it does not have the right to usurp the General Assembly\u2019s role in this regard because \u201c[j]udicial policy preferences may not be used to override valid legislative enactments, for the General Assembly should be the final arbiter of public policy.\u201d <em>State v. Smorgala </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 222, 223, 553 N.E.2d 672, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Therefore, I would hold that pursuant to its police power, the General Assembly had the authority to change and codify the law of employment intentional torts pursuant to R.C. 2745.01. I would also hold that R.C. 2745.01 addresses acts that occur outside the scope of employment; therefore, Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution is no impediment to its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">In conclusion, I would find that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate Section 34, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because it does not deprive employees of a right to a remedy, but in fact provides an action for an employment intentional tort. I would further find that R.C. 2745.01 does not violate Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution because the General Assembly derived the authority to enact R.C. 2745.01 from its police power. Therefore, I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
