For the following reasons, Call\u2019s assertion lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">First, Call was not entitled to a transcript because his transcript had already been filed in his direct appeal. <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 325, 326, 691 N.E.2d 275, 276. Only one copy of a transcript of a criminal trial need be provided to an indigent criminal defendant. <em>State ex rel. Murr v. Thierry </em>(1987), 34 Ohio St.3d 45, 45-46, 517 N.E.2d 226, 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">Second, although Call claimed that he needed the copy of the transcript to help him prepare an appeal in Supreme Court case No. 98-1264, that appeal was no longer pending when the court of appeals denied the writ. <em>State v. Call </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 1471, 701 N.E.2d 379. The right of an indigent prisoner to relevant portions of a transcript is limited to <em>pending </em>actions. <em>Murr, </em>34 Ohio St.3d at 45, 517 N.E.2d at 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">Finally, Call possessed an adequate legal remedy to obtain the requested transcript, <em>i.e., </em>a motion in this court while his latest appeal was pending. See <em>State ex rel. Jones v. Montgomery Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 642, 643, 665 N.E.2d 673, 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b506-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
