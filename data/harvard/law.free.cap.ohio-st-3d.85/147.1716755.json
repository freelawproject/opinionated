Arnold\u2019s assertion is merit-less.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Arnold had an adequate legal remedy by appeal to raise his claim concerning the trial court\u2019s alleged failure to journalize decisions relating to the speedy-trial provisions. See <em>State v. King </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 158, 162, 637 N.E.2d 903, 906; <em>State v. Mincy </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 6, 2 OBR 282, 441 N.E.2d 571, syllabus. Unlike <em>State ex rel. Grove v. Nadel </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 325, 691 N.E.2d 275, appellees\u2019 alleged failure to journalize these entries did not preclude an appeal raising this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">In addition, appeal and postconviction relief are not rendered inadequate by the fact that Arnold can no longer raise this issue on appeal or claim ineffective assistance of counsel in a postconviction relief petition for failing to raise this issue in his direct appeal. Cf. <em>In re Estate of Davis </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 45, 46, 671 N.E.2d 9, 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b286-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
