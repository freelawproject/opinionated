On November 18, 1996, we remanded the cause to the Court of Common Pleas of Cuyahoga County for a hearing on his competence to make the decision to waive review. <em>State v. Berry </em>(1996), 77 Ohio St.3d 1439, 671 N.E.2d 1279. On June 16, 1997, Berry reiterated, in open court, his desire to forgo any further challenges to his conviction and death sentence. On December 3, 1997, after reviewing the hearing record, we found Berry \u201ccompetent to decide for himself whether to pursue or forgo further legal challenges to his conviction and death sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 371, 383, 686 N.E.2d 1097,1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-12\">In support of the pending Renewed Motion _ for Additional Evaluation of Appellant\u2019s Competence to Forgo Challenges to Convictions and Death Sentence, the Public Defender submits evidence relating to a severe beating Berry received during a prison disturbance on September 5, 1997 \u2014 several weeks <em>after </em>Berry, in open court, reiterated his desire to waive further review of his case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1202\">*1202</page-number>We have reviewed the evidence, which includes court documents, physician\u2019s progress and nursing notes, and affidavits from a psychiatrist and neurologist. That evidence fails to raise a question as to the correctness of our original decision on this issue that Wilford Berry was competent to decide to forgo appeals of his conviction and death sentence at the time he decided to do so. Neither does the submitted evidence raise a question as to Berry\u2019s continued competence to forgo his rights to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">The Public Defender\u2019s motions for additional evaluation of Berry\u2019s competence to forgo his challenges to convictions and death sentence and for stay of execution are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-6\">\n<em>Motions denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b826-7\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.

On September 17, 1997, the Public Defender filed a \u201cMotion for Additional Evaluation\u201d on the basis of the September 5 beating. We denied that motion on September 23, 1997. <em>State v. Berry </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 1402, 684 N.E.2d 335. Today the Public Defender renews it and also requests a stay of Berry\u2019s execution, scheduled for February 19,1999.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
