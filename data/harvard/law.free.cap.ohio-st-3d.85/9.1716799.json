He also averred that he had not received any subpoena from relator and had not received any requests from Tyus for the return of documents. He further said that he had settled with Tyus. Respondent expressed his remorse and regret at not cooperating with relator\u2019s investigation, ascribing his failure to clinical depression for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>which he is currently being treated at the Cleveland Clinic. Respondent appeared at oral argument and made the same statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">We accept the findings and conclusions of the board. However, no evidence exists that the return receipt accompanying Tyus\u2019s demand for the return of her documents bore respondent\u2019s signature. Even Tyus\u2019s own affidavit states that the receipt was \u201c[apparently\u201d signed by respondent. Given these circumstances, we would have imposed only a public reprimand for respondent\u2019s violation of the Disciplinary Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">But the evidence is clear that respondent also completely failed to cooperate with relator\u2019s investigation, failed to answer the complaint, and failed to reply to the default-judgment motion. Only after we issued an order to show cause did respondent awake to the consequences of his inaction and make a belated attempt to excuse and justify his failure to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Although we were impressed at oral argument by respondent\u2019s forthright admission of and remorse for his failure to abide by the Rules for the Government of the Bar, as we said in <em>Lake Cty. Bar Assn. v. Vala </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 57, 59, 693 N.E.2d 1083, 1084, \u201cThe requirement to cooperate in disciplinary investigations is rooted in the self-governing nature of the legal profession. As a corollary, each lawyer has a duty to participate in the regulation of the profession, even when he himself is the subject of the investigation.\u201d In this case, as in both <em>Vala </em>and in <em>Medina Cty. Bar Assn. v. Muhlbach </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 224, 699 N.E.2d 459, the relator may not have brought a disciplinary action had the respondent been forthcoming when first advised of the grievance. Therefore, agreeing with the board\u2019s conclusion that respondent violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G), we hereby suspend respondent from the practice of law in Ohio for one year with the entire year of the suspension stayed. No conditions are imposed. Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-8\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b149-9\">Moyer, C.J., and Cook, J., dissent and would suspend respondent from the practice of law for one year with six months stayed.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
