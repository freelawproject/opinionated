The Franklin County Court of Appeals found that BWC\u2019s premium assessment could not be attacked in mandamus because BWC had not formally ruled on Northfield Park\u2019s pending petition for an R.C. 4121.23 hearing. The court of appeals therefore granted a limited writ of mandamus ordering BWC to grant, deny, or dismiss Northfield Park\u2019s petition and to explain the reasons for its decision. BWC appeals as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-13\">In 1995, Northfield Park protested BWC\u2019s premium assessment -before the BWC adjudicating committee and then appealed to the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Board Subcommittee. On September 1, 1995, amendments to R.C. Chapter 4121 effectively abolished the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Board and replaced the board subcommittee appeal with an appeal to BWC\u2019s \u201cadministrator or his designee.\u201d On October 2, 1995, Northfield Park filed a petition for hearing before the BWC pursuant to R.C. 4121.23, which provides, in part:</p>\n<p id=\"b811-14\">\u201cAny employer or other person interested either because of ownership in or occupation of any property affected by any order of the bureau of workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>compensation, or otherwise, may petition for a hearing on the reasonableness and lawfulness of any bureau order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">BWC did not issue a formal order granting, denying, or dismissing this petition. Instead, on October 11, 1995, the adjudicating committee\u2019s secretary advised Northfield Park by letter that \u201call [its] administrative remedies ha[d] been exhausted,\u201d that \u201cthe Bureau ha[d] made its final determination,\u201d that \u201cno further administrative hearings w[ould] be granted, and that \u201cto pursue this matter further [Northfield Park] must file a mandamus action through the courts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">BWC argues that R.C. 4121.23 does not afford any further administrative review at this stage of BWC\u2019s proceedings; however, we agree with the court of appeals that the secretary\u2019s letter is no substitute for this agency\u2019s order. Like the Industrial Commission of Ohio, BWC speaks on adversarial issues only through its orders. <em>State ex rel. Ewart v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 139, 142, 666 N.E.2d 1125, 1128. Neither this court nor the court of appeals can review an order that has yet to be rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">The court of appeals\u2019 judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b812-9\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
