The court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of Suburban\u2019s complaint for failure to \u25a0 state a claim upon which relief can be granted is appropriate if, after all factual allegations of the complaint are presumed true and all reasonable inferences are made in Suburban\u2019s favor, it appears beyond doubt that Suburban can prove no set of facts warranting relief. <em>Clark v. Connor </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 309, 311, 695 N.E.2d 751, 754.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">In order to be entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition, Suburban must establish that (1) Judge Skok is about to exercise judicial power, (2) Judge Skok\u2019s exercise of judicial power is legally unauthorized, and (3) the denial of the writ will cause injury for which no other adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law exists. <em>State ex rel. White v. Junkin </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 335, 336, 686 N.E.2d 267, 268. Here, Suburban sufficiently alleged that Judge Skok is exercising judicial power in the appropriation cases. At issue is whether the judge\u2019s exercise of this power is unauthorized and causes injury to Suburban for which it has no other adequate legal remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Regarding these remaining requirements for a writ of prohibition, in the absence of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, a court having general subject-matter jurisdiction can determine its own jurisdiction, and a party contesting the court\u2019s jurisdiction has an adequate legal remedy by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Red Head Brass, Inc. v. Holmes Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 149, 152, 684 N.E.2d 1234, 1237.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Suburban initially claims that Judge Skok patently and unambiguously lacks personal jurisdiction to proceed in the appropriation cases because service was never perfected on it in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-10\">Suburban\u2019s claim is not cognizable in prohibition. If contested allegations of defective service of process are not premised upon a complete failure to comply with the minimum-contacts requirement of constitutional due process, prohibition does not lie. See <em>State ex rel. Gelman v. Lorain Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1961), 172 Ohio St. 73, 74, 15 O.O.2d 132, 133, 173 N.E.2d 344, 345; <em>State ex rel. Ruessman v. Flanagan </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 464, 467-468, 605 N.E.2d 31, 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">In <em>Gelman, </em>we denied a writ of prohibition where relator\u2019s complaint alleged that service was defective and that the trial court erred in overruling a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>quash service, and the trial court claimed in its answer that service had been properly perfected.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">We similarly denied a writ of prohibition in <em>Ruessman, </em>where the relator contended \u201cthat respondents lack personal jurisdiction because [relator] has not been served with a copy of the petition below.\u201d 65 Ohio St.3d at 467, 605 N.E.2d at 35. We stated that \u201ca patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction is not present in the ease before us. Here, respondents assert that relator was duly served a copy of the petition, and relator challenged service by filing a motion to quash, which is pending below. Accordingly, we find it appropriate for the trial court to consider the pending motion and that relator\u2019s appropriate remedy is through appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 467-468, 605 N.E.2d at 35. By so holding, we distinguished <em>State ex rel. Connor v. McGough </em>(1989), 46 Ohio St.3d 188, 546 N.E.2d 407, where we granted a writ of prohibition because the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment patently and unambiguously prevented the trial court from assuming personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant who had no minimum contacts with this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The foregoing conclusions are consistent with our precedent that issuance of a writ of prohibition based on the alleged lack of personal jurisdiction is, even more than a claimed lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, an \u201cextremely rare occurrence.\u201d <em>Clark v. Connor </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 309, 315, 695 N.E.2d 751, 757. In those extremely rare cases where we issued the writ, the lack of personal jurisdiction was \u201cpremised on a complete failure to comply with constitutional due process.\u201d See <em>Fraiberg v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Div. </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 374, 378, 667 N.E.2d 1189, 1193, distinguishing <em>State ex rel. Connor, supra, </em>and <em>State ex rel. Stone v. Court </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 32, 14 OBR 333, 470 N.E.2d 899. Here, unlike <em>State ex rel. Connor </em>and <em>Stone, </em>Suburban does not assert that it lacks sufficient due-process minimum contacts with Lake County. <em>Fraiberg, </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 378, 667 N.E.2d at 1193. And like <em>Gelman </em>and <em>Ruessman, </em>there is an issue about whether service on Suburban in the appropriation cases has been perfected. Consequently, Suburban has adequate legal remedies by motions to quash service, motions to vacate the default judgments, and appeal to raise its personal jurisdiction claim. By so holding, we need not expressly rule on the merits of Suburban\u2019s claim. <em>Goldstein v. Christiansen </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 232, 238, 638 N.E.2d 541, 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">Suburban also claims that Judge Skok erred by intending to direct a verdict on valuation and not granting Suburban a continuance to prepare for the scheduled trial. But these claims do not patently and unambiguously divest Judge Skok of jurisdiction, and Suburban has an adequate remedy by appeal. \u201cThe extraordinary remedy of prohibition may not be employed before trial on the merits, as a substitute for appeal to review mere errors or irregularities of a court having <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Whitehall ex rel. Wolfe v. Ohio Civ. Rights Comm. </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 120, 123, 656 N.E.2d 684, 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Finally, the mere fact that Suburban may lose its right to enter and take possession of the property pending appeal, see R.C. 163.15 and 163.19, does not render appeal an inadequate remedy. If Suburban prevails on appeal, it would be entitled to repossess the property. Under R.C. 163.19, the trial court can require that Mentor \u201cgive adequate security for any further compensation and costs\u201d pending appeal in order to cover any damages from a temporary loss of possession of the property pending appeal. And, as noted by Judge Skok, R.C. 163.22 permits Courts to hear appeals pursuant to R.C. 163.19 in appropriation cases on an expedited basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Based on the foregoing, the court of appeals did not err in granting Judge Skok\u2019s motion and dismissing the prohibition action. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b786-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
