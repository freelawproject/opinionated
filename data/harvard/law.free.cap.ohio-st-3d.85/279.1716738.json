The court of appeals in effect overruled Keller\u2019s motion to strike by failing to rule on it. \u201c[W]hen a trial court fails to rule on a pretrial motion, it may ordinarily be presumed that the court overruled it.\u201d <em>State ex rel. The V Cos. v. Marshall </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 467, 469, 692 N.E.2d 198, 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">However, we do find that the court of appeals erred in overruling Keller\u2019s motion to strike the attached affidavit and unsworn factual allegations in appellees\u2019 memorandum in support of their Civ.R. 12(B)(6) dismissal motion. Civ.R. 12(B)(6) movants like appellees cannot rely on allegations or evidence outside the complaint to support their motion. <em>State ex rel. Boggs v. Springfield Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 94, 96, 647 N.E.2d 788, 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-11\">Nevertheless, the court of appeals\u2019 error in overruling Keller\u2019s motion to strike did not prejudice Keller. See <em>State ex rel. Fuqua v. Alexander </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 206, 208, 680 N.E.2d 985, 987. Although the court of appeals cited some of the unsworn factual allegations contained in appellees\u2019 memorandum in its decision, it did not rely on these allegations to resolve its Civ.R. 12(B)(6) legal determination, and the allegations cited were also contained in the government motion attached as an exhibit to Keller\u2019s complaint. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Findlay Publishing Co. v. Schroeder </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 580, 581, 669 N.E.2d 835, 837, where we held that courts \u201ccannot rely on allegations or evidence outside [a] complaint in determining [a] Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion\u201d; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Crabtree v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Health </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 247, 249, 673 N.E.2d 1281, 1283, fn. 1 (\u201cMaterial incorporated in a complaint may be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>part of the complaint for purposes of determining a Civ.R. 12[B][6] motion to dismiss\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">Regarding Keller\u2019s main contentions attacking the court of appeals\u2019 decision to dismiss pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) his complaint for a writ of mandamus, we disagree with the court of appeals that <em>Steckman </em>applies to this case. The records sought by appellant are not part of \u201ccriminal discovery\u201d because they have nothing to do with the crime or the criminal case itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">But based on <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 136 F.3d 1055, the requested records are exempt because they are protected by the constitutional right of privacy. Police officers\u2019 files that contain the names of the officers\u2019 children, spouses, parents, home addresses, telephone numbers, beneficiaries, medical information, and the like should not be available to a defendant who might use the information to achieve nefarious ends. This information should be protected not only by the constitutional right of privacy, but, also, we are persuaded that there must be a \u201cgood sense\u201d rule when such information about a law enforcement officer is sought by a defendant in a criminal case. On the other hand, any records needed by a defendant in a criminal case that reflect on discipline, citizen complaints, or how an officer does her or his job can be obtained, if any exist, through internal affairs files in accordance with previous decisions of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">Accordingly, based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b420-8\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Lundberg Stratton, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b420-9\">Cook, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b420-10\">Cook, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ATf\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent from the judgment affirming the court of appeals\u2019 dismissal of Keller\u2019s mandamus action. As a preliminary matter, I agree with the majority that the constitutional right of privacy exempts certain personnel records of police officers from disclosure under the Public Records Act. See <em>Kallstrom v. Columbus </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 136 F.3d 1055.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">Nevertheless, the majority\u2019s and appellees\u2019 reliance on the constitutional right of privacy does not support dismissal of Keller\u2019s mandamus action because any argument that Detective Reece\u2019s constitutional right to privacy exempts all of the requested records is, at this juncture, premature. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Beacon Journal Publishing Co. v. Akron </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 605, 640 N.E.2d 164 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>(federal constitutional right to privacy exempts disclosure of city employees\u2019 Social Security numbers). Exemptions from disclosure must be strictly construed against the public records custodian, and the custodian has the burden to establish an exemption. <em>State ex rel. McGowan v. Cuyahoga Metro. Hous. Auth. </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 518, 519, 678 N.E.2d 1388, 1389. Based solely on the allegations of the complaint, appellees have not established that all of the contents of the requested personnel files and internal affairs investigative reports relating to Detective Reece are exempt. In this regard, <em>Kallstrom, </em>the sole authority cited by the majority to support its holding, does not hold that the constitutional right to privacy necessarily exempts from disclosure the entire contents of the testifying officers\u2019 personnel files. <em>Kallstrom </em>merely holds that disclosure of testifying police officers\u2019 addresses, phone numbers, and driver\u2019s licenses, as well as the names, addresses, and phone numbers of their family members, violates their fundamental constitutional rights to privacy, but that other information in their personnel files would have to be analyzed to see whether it also violated these constitutional rights. <em>Id., </em>136 F.3d at 1069-1070.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">In fact, the majority concedes that personnel files that reflect discipline, citizen complaints, or how an officer does her or his job are public records. By affirming the dismissal of Keller\u2019s action, the majority had to have assumed, before the court of appeals conducted an <em>in camera </em>inspection of the records, that all of the requested personnel records in this case are of the types that are shielded from disclosure by the constitutional right of privacy. Keller requested access to all personnel and internal affairs records relating to Detective Reece. His request is broad enough to include the records that the majority concedes would be subject to disclosure under R.C. 149.43, <em>i.e., </em>records that \u201creflect on discipline, citizen complaints, or how an officer does her or his job * * The majority\u2019s holding, which assumes that all personnel records relating to Detective Reece are exempt, is therefore unsupported by the record, <em>Kallstrom, </em>or the court of appeals\u2019 duty under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) to construe the material factual allegations of Keller\u2019s complaint most strongly in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-7\">Finally, to the extent that the majority relies on a \u201cgood sense\u201d rule in addition to the constitutional right of privacy, we have rejected analogous public-policy exemptions by holding that \u201c \u2018in enumerating very narrow, specific exceptions to the public records statute, the General Assembly has already weighed and balanced the competing public policy considerations between the public\u2019s right to know how its state agencies make decisions and the potential harm, inconvenience or burden imposed on the agency by disclosure.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Thomas v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 245, 249, 643 N.E.2d 126, 130, quoting <em>State ex rel. James v. Ohio State Univ. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 168, 172, 637 N.E.2d 911, 913-914; see, also, <em>State ex rel. Multimedia, Inc. v. Snowden </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 141, 143-144, 647 N.E.2d 1374, 1378. In fact, the fundamental policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>advanced by R.C. 149.43 is to promote open government, not to restrict it. <em>State ex rel. The Miami Student v. Miami Univ. </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 168, 171, 680 N.E.2d 956, 959. As noted previously, the applicability of any privacy exemption cannot yet be determined in ruling on appellees\u2019 Civ.R. 12(B)(6) motion because this determination is restricted to the allegations of Keller\u2019s complaint. See <em>State ex rel. Natl. Electrical Contractors Assn., Ohio Conference v. Ohio Bur. of Emp. Serv. </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 179, 181, 699 N.E.2d 64, 66.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Based on the foregoing, it appears that after construing the material factual allegations of Keller\u2019s complaint most strongly in his favor, he can prove a set of facts entitling him to the requested writ of mandamus. The court of appeals consequently erred in dismissing Keller\u2019s complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6). Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals should be reversed and remanded for further proceedings. See <em>State ex rel. Rogers v. McGee Brown </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 408, 410\u2014411, 686 N.E.2d 1126, 1128. Because the majority does not so decide, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
