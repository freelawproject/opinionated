We therefore adopt only the board\u2019s conclusion in case No. 95-48 that respondent\u2019s conduct violated DR 9-102(A) and (B)(3), in that he converted and commingled client and personal monies.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">We adopt the findings and conclusions of the board in case No. 97-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Because public confidence in the judicial system and the bar requires that the strictest discipline be imposed in misappropriation cases, we have previously held that absent mitigating circumstances, disbarment is the appropriate sanction when a fiduciary misuses the assets of an estate. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Romaniw </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 462, 700 N.E.2d 858. Where sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, and the board recommends it, we have, on occasion, imposed a lesser penalty. <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Kurtz </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 55, 693 N.E.2d 1080; <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Knowlton </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 76, 689 N.E.2d 538. We do so in this case. Respondent is hereby indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio, with his reinstatement conditioned upon his making full restitution, with interest at the current judgment rate, in the Castrovince and Santarelli matters. Cost are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">\n<em>Judgment accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b539-11\">Moyer, C.J., Douglas, Resnick, F.E.
