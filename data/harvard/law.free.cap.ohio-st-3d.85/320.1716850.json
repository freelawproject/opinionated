It essentially claims that the order merely \u201cdecided to decide\u201d whether to reopen claimant\u2019s eligibility for PTD compensation. This is not the case, however, as the order clearly sets claimant\u2019s application for PTD compensation for reconsideration. The question thus becomes whether, in so doing, the commission properly exercised continuing jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Continuing jurisdiction is proper when an order contains an obvious mistake of fact or law. <em>State ex rel. Weimer v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St.2d 159, 16 O.O.3d 174, 404 N.E.2d 149; <em>State ex rel. B &amp; C Machine Co. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 538, 605 N.E.2d 372. Discussing this prerequisite, we recently found an abuse of discretion where reconsideration was granted \u201cbased on the possibility of error in the previous Industrial Commission order.\u201d We reasoned:</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">\u201cThere is also no <em>clear </em>error of any kind. The reconsideration order cites only the <em>possibility </em>of error, and an unspecified error at that.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">\u201cOur approval of the staff hearing officers\u2019 order on reconsideration would effectively give the commission unrestricted jurisdiction. Error is always possible, and its existence cannot be refuted when the commission is not made to reveal what the perceived error is. We find, therefore, that the mere possibility of unspecified error cannot sustain the invocation of continuing jurisdiction.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) State ex rel. Nicholls v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 454, 459, 692 N.E.2d 188, 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">In this case, the commission abandoned conjecture and found that there was error. But, again, it does not identify the error. Thus, despite any \u201cimprovement\u201d in the order\u2019s language, it still defies the spirit of <em>Nicholls. Nicholls </em>recognized that the propriety of continuing jurisdiction cannot be evaluated if the commission does not reveal, in a meaningful way, why it was exercised. In this instance, as in <em>Nicholls, </em>claimant cannot refute the allegation of error without knowing what the alleged mistake is. Saying that an error is \u201creal\u201d as opposed to \u201cpossible\u201d is equally hollow if there is no way to test the legitimacy of the assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">The commission alternatively alleges that claimant\u2019s cause of action is premature, since it continued PTD compensation pending reconsideration. In support, it cites <em>State ex rel. Lantz v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 29, 607 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>456. There, the commission awarded PTD compensation but then granted the employer\u2019s motion for reconsideration after conceding that evidentiary requirements were not satisfied. Claimant\u2019s mandamus action was met with motions for summary judgment and dismissal. Claimant responded to the former but not the latter, and the motion to dismiss was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">Claimant appealed here. After rejecting claimant\u2019s arguments, we added:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">&lt;rWe also affirm the appellate court\u2019s dismissal of claimant\u2019s action as being premature. At this point, claimant\u2019s ability to establish a <em>clear </em>legal right to relief is compromised by his inability to demonstrate any loss. In this case, the commission\u2019s reconsideration order effectively continued permanent-total-disability benefits pending a merit reconsideration of his application, pursuant to <em>[State ex rel. Noll v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1991), 57 Ohio St.3d 203, 567 N.E.2d 245].- Since no deprivation has yet occurred, there is nothing from which claimant can seek relief. If the commission ultimately denies permanent-total-disability benefits, then a mandamus review of the commission\u2019s continuing jurisdiction to reconsider may be appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis <em>sic.) Id. </em>at 31-32, 607 N.E.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">The commission\u2019s reliance on <em>Lantz </em>is misplaced. <em>Lantz </em>was never intended to excuse the improper exercise of continuing jurisdiction. Where continuing jurisdiction is improperly exercised and a party is forced to needlessly relitigate an issue, that party has been adversely affected. <em>Lantz </em>cannot be used to shield the commission where it has exercised continuing jurisdiction based on error that it declines to identify.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We accordingly overrule the motions to dismiss, issue a writ of mandamus, and order the commission to vacate its September 2,1998 order. We also issue a writ of prohibition to prevent the commission from proceeding with the reconsideration generated by the September 2,1998 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">\n<em>Writs allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b461-9\">Douglas, Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer and Cook, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"A_P\">Moyer, C.J., would grant a writ of prohibition only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b461-10\">Lundberg Stratton, J., dissents.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b461-11\">Lundberg Stratton, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A7g\">dissenting. I respectfully dissent. The September 2, 1998 order is not a final order subject to mandamus, and the claimant is not facing an actual loss that can be prevented only by a writ of prohibition. Therefore, I would grant the motions of White Consolidated and the Industrial Commission to dismiss the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">The September 2, 1998 order is an interlocutory order that does not grant reconsideration. The order sets for hearing the issue of whether the Industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>Commission may exercise continuing jurisdiction in this matter. Although the order states that the claimant\u2019s IC-2 application is also to be heard, rehearing on the merits is, of course, conditional upon the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">The interlocutory nature of the September 2, 1998 order is also apparent from the lack of any findings of error in the prior order of July 16, 1998, and from the continuation of PTD benefits to the claimant. The majority criticizes the language in the order, claiming that the commission found real error but failed to identify it. However, the order states only that the commission found that the employer presented \u201cprobative evidence of a clear mistake of fact and of law.\u201d The commission made no independent findings of error with respect to the prior order.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Furthermore, because claimant\u2019s PTD benefits continued, she suffered no loss as a result of the September 2, 1998 order. She is unable to meet all the criteria necessary for issuance of a writ of prohibition because she cannot prove that refusal to issue the writ would result in injury to her for which she does not otherwise have an adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Consequently, for the reasons given, I believe this action is improper, premature, and subject to dismissal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
