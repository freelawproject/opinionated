The appellants claim that she died testate as to all her property, both salable and collectable, and that the words in the residuary clause, \u201camong my heirs as above mentioned,\u201d limit the balance of her property to the heirs named in the preceding clauses of the will. 2 <em>Wms. on Exc\u2019rs, </em>(3 <em>Am.

We are also of opinion that the residuary clause of said will, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>which is in these words: <em>\u201c </em>The balance of my property I direct to be sold by my executor, and the money to be divided among my heirs <em>as above mentioned, </em>\u2019 \u2019 confines the bequest of the residue of her estate to the persons <em>specifically </em>mentioned in the preceding part of her will. We can* see no room for doubt on the subject, and therefore reverse the order of the orphans court appealed from, and direct a distribution to be made in conformity with the views herein indicated.
