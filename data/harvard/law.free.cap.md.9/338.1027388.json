Plea, <em>non cul.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\"><em>Exception. </em>It was proved on the part of the plaintiff, by a witness who was present at the time, that plaintiff said to defendant, he had understood the latter was going to work only seven horses in liis machine; the reply was, that this was a fact; plaintiff then said the weather was so hot he was afraid it would kill the horses, and that defendant could not get any of <em>their horses </em>(meaning his father\u2019s) unless he worked a full team of eight, for it w\u2019ould be too hard for seven; after some further conversation, defendant said to plaintiff: \u201c\u00cd didnot have anything to do with you about the horses; I said nothing to you on the subject; I borrowed them of your father.\u201d To this plaintiff replied: \u201cYes, you had a conversation with me <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>on the subject;\u201d defendant said he had not; plaintiff said he had; witness cannot say how often these contradictions were repeated: plaintiff then said something which the witness did not hear or remember, when defendant said: \u201cIf you say that again I will slap you;\u201d after this the same assertion and contradiction were repeated, perhaps twice, when defendant said: \u201cIf you say I had anything to do with you about the horse, you lie;\u201d plaintiff replied: \u201cit is no use to get mad about it, for you know you did ask me for the horses; defendant again said, \u201cif you say that we had any conversation on the subject you are a liar;\u201d whereupon the plaintiff said, \u201cthen you lie too:\u201d upon which defendant struck the plaintiff two blows upon the left eye, or near it, which prostrated him, and that plaintiff had for many years been blind in his right eye, and his sight by the left was very defective.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-5\">The plaintiff then, for the purpose of showing that defendant had in fact a conversation with him on the subject of borrowing the horses for the machine, offered to prove by a competent witness, that, on one or two evenings before.the assault, witness was present at a conversation between plaintiff and defendant, about the latter getting horses from plaintiff, or his father, to be used in defendant\u2019s threshing machine, and that witness heard the plaintiff tell defendant he could certainly get three horses, and probably one or two more, one of which was a first rate machine horse, and worked better in that place than in any other. To the admissibility of this testimony, for the purpose offered, defendant objected, which objection the court (Perry, J.) overruled, and the defendant excepted; and the verdict and judgment being against him for <em>$375 </em>damages and costs he appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b347-6\">Further proof was offered in regard to the extent of the injury occasioned by the assault, and an exception was taken by the <em>plaintiff, </em>which need not be stated, as the judgment in his favor was affirmed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b347-7\">The cause was argued before Le Grand, C. J., Eccleston, Tuck and Mason, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b348-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Richard H. Alvey </em>for the appellant argued:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB0\">that the evidence proposed to be offered was wholly irrelevant to (he issue. It was no part of the <em>res gestee, </em>and the effect of such testimony was, to render the defendant odious in the estimation of the jury by stigmatising him with falsehood in relation to a matter not at all legally characterising the injury complained of. There should have been no issue made before the jury, outside of the pleadings, in regard to the character or veracity of either of the parties. 1 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., secs. 52, 55. </em>9 <em>Gill, 251, Marshall vs. Haney. </em>3 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>162, <em>Anderson vs. Johnson. 5 Md.

The epithet, <em>\u201cliar,\u201d </em>or even an offensive and pertinacious contradiction of a statement, especially if the party making the statement is stating the <em>truth, </em>as known to both parties, is a circumstance which the jury would have the right to consider as a material mitigation of the assault. But if the party be making a false statement, then the pertinacious contradiction being the <em>truth </em>of the case, is-no offence, no provocation, and no mitigation of the assault. On the other hand, an assault committed under such circumstances is <em>aggravated </em>in the extreme. It was therefore material for the plaintiff to prove, that in his contradiction of the defendant\u2019s statement he was but asserting the <em>truth, </em>and this could only be done by the testimony proposed to be given. It shows that the assault was without excuse or provocation, a fact highly material for the jury in the assessment of damages. 2 <em>Greenlf. on Ev., secs. </em>85, 89, 93, 267. 1 <em>Do., sec. </em>53. 4 <em>H. &amp; J., </em>448, <em>Pratt vs. Ayler.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b348-6\">Mason, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ag\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">The altercation in this case grew out of a question of veracity between the parties. The fact that the assault was committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>in alleged vindication of the truthfulness and integrity of the defendant, might have been regarded by the jury as a mitigating circumstance in his behalf, which it certainly would have been had such been the case. Hence it became important for the plaintiff, if he could, to rebut the force of this mitigating circumstance by showing, that the truth of the matter in dispute was with him. In this way, the testimony objected to becomes admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
