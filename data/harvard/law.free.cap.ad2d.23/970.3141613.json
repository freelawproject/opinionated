Defendant contends that the sentence to a term of one year on the petit larceny count and the sentence to a term of <em>\u201c </em>time already served <em>\u201d </em>[117 days] on the unlawful entry count are concurrent and not consecutive. Appeal dismissed as moot. It appears that the defendant has served the full term of his sentence and that he has been released from imprisonment. Beldoek, P. J., Ughetta, Christ, Hopkins and Benjamin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
