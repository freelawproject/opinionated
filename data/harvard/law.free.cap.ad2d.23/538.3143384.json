Defendant asserts leniency was promised a codefendant in return for such codefendant\u2019s testimony in aid of obtaining defendant\u2019s conviction. Defendant states that there was a perjurious denial of any promise of leniency by the codefendant and the District Attorney knowingly failed to contradict the codefendant or reveal such promise to the jury. The assistant who tried the ease for the People is readily available but no affidavit of denial by him was submitted in opposition to defendant\u2019s application. In light of the sequence of events as to the eodefendant, and the absence of an affidavit of denial, a hearing is warranted. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garrcmay, </em>20 A D 2d 861; <em>People </em>v. <em>Burrell, </em>20 A D 2d 546.)
