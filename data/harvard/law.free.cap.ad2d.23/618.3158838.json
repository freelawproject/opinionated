Memorandum: We agree with the conclusion of the trial court that the verdict is contrary to the weight of the evidence. We conclude, however, that it was error to dismiss the complaint. Accordingly, a new trial is granted. All concur, except Bastow and Noonan, JJ., who dissent and vote to reverse and to reinstate the verdict. (Appeal from judgment of Oneida Trial Term, setting aside the verdict of the jury in an automobile negligence action; also appeal from order granting motion to set aside the verdict.) Present \u2014 Williams, P. J., Bastow, Henry, Noonan and Del Vecehio, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
