Appeal dismissed, without costs. The order of November 13, 1964 merely denies reargument and reconsideration of prior motions and is not appealable <em>(Mitchell </em>v. <em>A. A. Truck Renting Gorp., </em>21 A D 2d 677). The so-called orders of November 8, 1961 and December 19, 1961 are in fact not orders but memorandum decisions of the court. No appeal lies therefrom <em>(Quaglio </em>v. <em>Weiss, </em>21 A D 2d 884). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>Nor, in the absence of a recitation of the papers used on the motion, may such decisions be treated as appealable orders (CPLR 2219, subd. [a]; of. <em>Haftel </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>21 A D 2d 651; <em>Matter of Gowdey, </em>101 App. Div. 275). The purported order of September 28, 1964 is not contained in the record. No appeal lies therefrom <em>(Atkin </em>v. <em>New York State Elec, \u00e9 Gas Co., </em>18 A D 2d 821). In any event, we have examined the merits and find no abuse of discretion in the denial of a calendar preference. Beldock, P. J., Ughetta, Christ, Brennan and Hopkins, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
