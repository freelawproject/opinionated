Motion to vacate order of November 27, 1961, denied. After re-examining the entire record in the light of petitioner\u2019s present contentions and brief, we have again reached the conclusion that the Referee\u2019s report should be confirmed and that petitioner\u2019s application to vacate the prior order of the court striking his name from the roll of attorneys, should be denied. Beldoek, P. J., Ughetta, Christ, Hill and Hopkins, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
