His chief attack upon his conviction of the crime of escape under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751 is that these guards of the Public Health Service were not \u201crepresentatives of the Attorney General\u201d within the meaning of the statute. Piscitello had been convicted of violation of the anti-narcotics laws; his immediate incarceration at this drug-addiction-treatment center was in pursuance of a sentence to 18 months\u2019 imprisonment for violation of probation involving the use of narcotics, the sentence \u201cto be served at the United States Public Health Service Hospital at Lexington, Kentucky.\u201d He was a federal prisoner at an institution properly designated by the Attorney General for his confinement, and he escaped from the employees of the institution charged with his custody. The statute clearly applies, and his point is quite without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-20\">Piscitello\u2019s further attacks upon Judge Kaufman\u2019s claimed overzealous conduct of the trial and pressure upon defense counsel for concessions must fail, since the criticized acts seem to us but commendable efforts to expedite proceedings in a case where the issues were simple and clear and substantial defense was lacking. The trial was fair, and the charge quite adequate. While the court\u2019s charge on defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand may not have been ideally cast, it was not prejudicial and no objection was taken to it. See Bruno v. United States, 308 U.S. 287, 60 S.Ct. 198, 84 L.Ed. 257; United States v. Tannuzzo, 2 Cir., 174 F.2d 177, certiorari denied Tannuzzo v. United States, 338 U.S. 815, 70 S.Ct. 38, 94 L.Ed. 493.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-21\">Conviction affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
