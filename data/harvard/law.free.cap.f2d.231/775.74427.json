Summerfield), 97 U.S.App.D.C. -, 231 F.2d 773. Oakley is a photographer and not a publisher. However, he sells numerous admittedly innocuous books and publications, in addition to the photographs found by the Post Office Department to be obscene. The judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>the District Court, which was similar to its order in Tourlanes, will likewise be affirmed (No. 12,971).

On a like basis, the appeals by Oakley will be dismissed (Nos. 12,918 and 13,023).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">So ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
