MILLER, FAHY and BASTIAN, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b292-23\">BASTIAN,' Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b292-24\">Appellant (defendant) was indicted, tried and convicted of a violation of the Miller Act,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it being claimed that he took indecent liberties with a minor child with the intent of satisfying defendant\u2019s lust, passions and desires.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-25\">At the trial, the trial judge properly found, on inquiry of her, that the child (who was five years of age) was incompetent to testify. The child\u2019s mother testified that on the day of the alleged occurrence she saw the child coming from the laundry room on the floor below the main floor of the building, and saw her running until she (the child) came to an apartment on the main floor; that when the mother reached the door to her own apartment she saw the child crying and, under questioning, the child said that a man \u201cdown in the basement\u201d did something bad to her, that he had \u201cput his nasty tongue in [her] mouth\u201d and had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>\u201cput his fingers down in [her] panties and kept fooling with [her] parts.\u201d It appears that the defendant had been in the basement of the building and had been selling magazines in the building. Almost three hours after the occurrence the defendant was arrested and taken to the precinct station where, in a line-up, he was identified by the child.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 3 The defendant, when confronted with the child and the mother, denied any such assault or wrong-doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">The child was taken to a doctor, who was unable to find any evidence whatever of marking or injury. Upon completion of the Government\u2019s evidence a motion for judgment of acquittal was made and overruled. Defendant was found guilty. Upon the overruling of a subsequent motion for acquittal, defendant was sentenced, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">The statement of the child to the mother was admissible as a spontaneous declaration; but since it was the only evidence of the occurrence, the child herself not being eligible as a witness, it was insufficient to support the verdict. For one of the requisite elements with respect to evidence in a case such as this is the establishment of the <em>corpus delicti. </em>The Seventh Circuit considered this very question in United States v. Echeles, 222 F.2d 144, 155. There the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">\u201cMost American courts take the view that the phrase <em>\u2018corpus delicti\u2019 </em>includes first, the fact of an injury or a loss and secondly, the fact of somebody\u2019s criminality (in contrast e. g. to accident) as the cause of the injury or loss. The proof of these two elements involves the commission of a crime by somebody. But the phrase <em>\u2018corpus delicti\u2019 </em>does not include the fact of the connection of the accused with the crime \u2014 his identity as the criminal, or the guilty agent through whom the wrong has occurred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-12\">In Forte v. United States, 1937, 68 App.D.C. 111, 94 F.2d 236, 127 A.L.R. 1120, the late Chief Judge Harold M. Stephens, in an able and exhaustive opinion, demonstrated that it is necessary to establish the <em>corpus delicti </em>even when a confession has been obtained. See also Ercoli v. United States, 1942, 76 U.S.App.D.C. 360, 131 F.2d 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-13\">In Brown v. United States, 1945, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 152 F.2d 138, this court pointed out that the exception to the hearsay rule, known as spontaneous statements or declarations, has commonly been applied only where there has been independent evidence of an exciting event. In Brown, as here, the only evidence that any indecent assault took place was the hearsay evidence itself, the child not being physically injured or marked, and we reversed. We pointed out 152 F.2d at page 140:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-14\">\u201cAs we held in the Snowden and Beausoliel cases [Snowden v. U. S., 2 App.D.C. 89; Beausoliel v. U. S., 71 App.D.C. 111, 107 F.2d 292], if a child makes spontaneous statements they are admissible in evidence <em>when a foundation is laid for them, and either the child\u2019s condition or the child\u2019s testimony may lay the foundation.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-17\">In the instant case, as in Brown, we have no testimony from the child and no evidence reflecting injury to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>In Dickey v. State, 147 Tex.Cr.R. 588, 183 S.W.2d 469, a somewhat similar ease, the court reversed where, as here, there was nothing shown to prove mistreatment of the child \u2014 who did not testify \u2014 \u201csave she pointed to her private parts and was crying; no bruises shown, no disarranged clothing, no disarrangement of appellant\u2019s clothes, and no overt act, save the father\u2019s statement that T didn\u2019t see the defendant do anything to my daughter outside of holding her in his arms like he was planning to do something.\u2019 \u201d In Dickey, too, the court had approved the admission of evidence that the child had stated, on questioning by her mother, that \u201c\u2018[a] man had played with her. * * * [The mother] asked her how he had played with her and she pointed to herself. She pointed down here (indicating). That was her private parts. She didn\u2019t say anything else to me at that time.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">The Government relies on Snowden v. United States, 2 App.D.C. 89, a case involving an alleged rape. There the court admitted \u2014 as did the District Court in the present case \u2014 statements made by the child (about five and a half years old) to her grandmother, made shortly after the alleged act. But in Snowden the abuse of the child was clearly demonstrated by injuries to the private parts of the child; thus the <em>corpus delicti </em>was established. .</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">In Smith v. United States, 1954, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 320, 215 F.2d 682, 683, this court reversed after ruling evidence of a declaration not to have been spontaneous \u201cin view of the evidence as a whole.\u201d In Smith the Government had attempted in its brief to distinguish Brown v. United States, supra, where the child was not physically marked or injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Government urges in the instant case that no exception was taken to the admission of the extra-judicial declarations of the child. This, however, loses sight of the fact that, even if this be so, the <em>corpus delicti </em>has not been proven. Certainly such evidence would be no more convincing than a confession, which is not sufficient to excuse lack of proof of the <em>corpus delicti. </em>See Forte v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">This is a repellent charge, but such a charge does not destroy the presumption of innocence or justify a conviction on evidence which is not sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt every element of the alleged offense (here, the <em>corpus </em>delicti).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">The judgment of conviction must be and is</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b292-26\">. \u00a7 22-3501 (a), D.C.Code 1951.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\">. The testimony as to the identification of the defendant was as follows, the mother testifying:</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">\u201cQ. Did there come a time, ma\u2019am, when you again saw the defendant in this case, James C. Jones? A. Yes. The next day we had to go to the Police Headquarters and he was \u2014 oh, later that night. Yes, later that night we went to the Police Department, No. 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">\u201cQ. Now, who is \u2018we\u2019, ma\u2019am? A. My little girl, Marcia Dynn, and I. We went to No. 14 Precinct that night. And he was in a line up and my little girl identified him out of the line up.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-19\">\u201cQ.
