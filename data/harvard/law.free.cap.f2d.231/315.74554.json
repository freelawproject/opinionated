Later one Ojeda was arrested with heroin in his possession, and he testified to the circumstances of pickup of the heroin at the designated address and directly implicated Dragotto. The evidence was clearly sufficient to present a jury issue and to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-27\"> The errors asserted as to the conduct of the trial are without merit. There being evidence of transactions on November 1 and 2, 1954, involving Dragotto and two of the defendants, as well as on November 4, which brought Ojeda into the picture, it results that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>declarations of codefendants were admissible against Dragotto. United States v. Manton, 2 Cir., 107 F.2d 834, certiorari denied 309 U.S. 664, 60 S.Ct. 590, 84 L.Ed. 1012; Dodson v. United States, 6 Cir., 215 F.2d 196. Although the judge in his original charge failed to cover Dragotto\u2019s defense of an alibi, he corrected this inadvertence in his supplemental remarks before the jury retired \u2014 the utmost to which the defendant can be entitled. United States v. Blount, 2 Cir., 229 F.2d 669. The appeal is fruitless.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
