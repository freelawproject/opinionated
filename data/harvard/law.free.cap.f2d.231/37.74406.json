While asserting in brief and oral argument that Specification No. 6, complaining of the action of the commission in rejecting evidence of prices paid by the United States for the purchase in fee by private negotiation, of lands in the flowage area, was error, appellant cites only authorities supporting the general principle that consideration should be given to prices paid in voluntary sales, that is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>dealings between persons willing and able, but not compelled, to buy or sell, it cites none applying that principle to prices paid by one having the right of eminent domain.</p>\n<p id=\"Aez\">Appellee, on its part, cites many cases from this circuit and elsewhere,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> laying down the rule that \u201cThe prices paid in settlement of condemnation proceedings or the sum paid by the condemnor for similar land, even if proceedings have not been begun, is inadmissible\u201d. This rule, based upon the view that such payments are in the nature of compromise to avoid the expense and uncertainty of litigation and are not fair indications of market value, is the generally prevailing rule in this circuit and elsewhere. The only recognized exceptions to it are in cases where the fact that parties were condemnor and condemnee either was not known or had no influence because the sale was not in connection with, or in anticipation of, condemnation proceedings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfW\">When it comes, however, to Specifications 3 and 4, which in a frontal attack upon findings and award as denying just compensation, assail the judgment as taking its property without affording due process of law,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we think that the matter stands quite differently and that, for the reasons hereafter stated, the judgment must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"A7T\">This is a period of great governmental expansion, with enormously stepped up numbers of takings of private property for public use by expropriation, a streamlining of the procedures for taking,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and, because familiarity breeds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>contempt, a consequent growing and, therefore alarming attitude of complacency, instead of viewing with alarm, with which government and public alike look upon the exertion of the power of eminent domain by which all that a man has can be taken from him by force. Because this is so, we deem it advisable, if not necessary, before stating wherein appellant was denied due process, to first set briefly down the simple but fundamental principles which, despite their being sometimes and in some places apparently more honored in the breach than in the observance, still govern expropriation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">Completely consonant, as it is, with Madison\u2019s historic pronouncement, \u201cIn framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies m this: you must first enable the government to control the governed, and, in the next place, oblige it to control itself\u201d, perhaps the best and most moving statement of the basic principle controlling here is to be found in the opinion of the Supreme Court, in Monongahela Navigation Co. v. United States, 148 U.S. 312, 13 S.Ct. 622, 37 L.Ed. 463, a portion of which was recently quoted as the conclusion of the opinion of the minority in United States v. Twin City Power Co., 350 U.S. 222, 76 S.Ct. 259, in support of its view that the failure of the majority to correctly apply them had resulted in depriving the property owner of the protection which this basic principle affords.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-6\">\u201cThe question presented is not whether the United States has the power to condemn and appropriate this property * * * for that is conceded, but how much it must pay as compensation therefor. Obviously this question, as all others which \u2022 run along the line of the extent of -the protection the individual has under the constitution against the demands of the government, is of importance, for in any society the fullness and sufficiency of the securities which surround the individual in the use and enjoyment of his property constitute one of the most certain tests of the character and value of the government. The first 10 amendments to the constitution, adopted as they were soon after the adoption of the constitution, are in the nature of a bill of rights, and were adopted in order to quiet the apprehension of many that without some such declaration of rights the government would assume, and might be held to possess, the power to trespass upon those rights of persons and property which by the Declaration of Independence were affirmed to be unalienable rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-9\">\u201c * * * And in this there is a natural equity which commends it to every one. It in no wise detracts from the power of the public to take whatever may be necessary for its uses; while, on the other hand, it prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government, and says that when he surrenders to the public something more and different from that which is exacted from other members of the public, a full and just equivalent shall be returned to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-10\">\u201cBut we need not have recourse to this natural equity, nor is it necessary to look through the constitution to the affirmations lying behind it in the Declaration of Independence, for in this fifth amendment there is stated the exact limitation on the power of the government to take private property for public uses. And with respect to consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>tutional provisions of this nature, it was well said by Mr. Justice Bradley, speaking for the court, in Boyd v. United States, 116 U.S. 616, 635, 6 S.Ct. 524 [29 L.Ed. 746]: \u2018Illegitimate and unconstitutional practices get their first footing in that way, namely, by silent approaches and slight deviations from legal modes of procedure. This can only be obviated by adhering to the rule that constitutional provisions for the security of person and property should be liberally construed. A close and literal construction deprives them of half their efficacy, and leads to gradual depreciation of the right, as if it consisted more in sound than in substance. It is the duty of courts to be watchful for the constitutional rights of the citizen, and against any stealthy encroachments thereon. Their motto should be obsta principiis.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cThe language used in the fifth amendment in respect to this matter is happily chosen. The entire amendment is a series of negations, denials of right or power in the government; the last (the one in point here) being: \u2018Nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation/ The noun \u2018compensation,\u2019 standing by itself, carries the idea of an equivalent. * * * So that, if the adjective \u2018just\u2019 had been omitted, and the provision was simply that property should not be taken without compensation, the natural import of the language would be that the compensation should be the equivalent of the property. And this is made emphatic by the adjective \u2018just.\u2019 There can, in view of the combination of those two 1 words, be no doubt that the compensation must be a full and perfect equivalent for the property taken * * *. This excludes the taking into account as an element in the compensation any supposed benefit that the owner may receive \u2022 in common with all from the public uses to which his private property is appropriated, and leaves it to \u25a0 stand as a declaration that no private property shall be appropriated to public uses unless a full and exact equivalent for it be returned to the owner.\u201d 148 U.S. at pages 324-325-326, 13 S.Ct. at page 625.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">With these declarations and admonitions kept firmly in mind, we turn to the record to test by this basic principle the claim of the appellant that the findings and award of the commissioner are clearly erroneous<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> within the meaning of the cases in that they furnish the basis for taking its property without just , compensation and the due process the Fifth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Appellant is the owner of a tract , of land of approximately 1200 acres, situr ated a short distance south and in thq direct path of growth of the, City of Shreveport, Louisiana. Numerous suburban residential subdivisions have1 already been opened near the property, and it is most likely that, in the not too distant future, a large portion, of it will be encompassed by the normal growth of Shreveport.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The land has been owned by the Slattery family for more than sixty years, during which time Shreveport has grown from a small town a considerable distance away to a large city approaching this property. The land, because of its proximity to the City of Shreveport, was being held as an investment for subdivision purposes, which was its. highest and best use.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">On July 23, 1952, the United States filed in the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana a Declaration of Taking<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> by the Secretary of the Army, and on Aug. 14, 1952, a judgment of taking was entered expropriating a flowage easement in connection with the operation and maintenance of the Wallace Lake Reservoir dam project, which had been completed in 1946, on and over a number of tracts under separate ownership, including Tract 74, 915.40 acres of appellant\u2019s 1200 acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">The lands of appellant covered by the flooding servitude were all of the lands lying below the 165-foot contour, and the United States acquired the right to \u201cintermittently and/or permanently\u201d flood the lands with water impounded by Wallace Lake Dam up to the 165-foot contour. The flowage easement permitted the Government to remove all timber from the property below the 150-foot contour, prohibited the land owners from constructing any buildings or improvements on the land below the 158-foot contour, and required the removal of all buildings presently situated below that contour.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">The landowners presented to the commission the testimony of three expert real estate appraisers, each of whom had been engaged in the real estate business in Shreveport for thirty years, who, with a unanimity not unusual in such cases, fixed the value of the 1200 acres as a whole without the servitude at $78,735, and its value subject to the servitude at $30,281.60 with a difference of value attributable to the servitude of $48,453.40. While they came at this by dividing the 1200 acres up into tracts for purposes of valuation and by putting a valuation with and without the servitude on each tract, the effect of their testimony was to value the tract as a whole without and with the servitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">The government\u2019s three experts, on the other hand, were interrogated, and they testified on the basis of an inspection made in 1954, <em>not as to the value of the property with and without the servitude </em>\u2014 this is greatly important because the project was completed in 1946, and though the servitude was not legally imposed until the order for taking was entered in 1952, the property had been in public estimation for six years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>subject to the actual, though not the legal, burden of the dam \u2014 but with reference to the value <em>before and after the filing of the declaration of talcing. </em>Two of them, with the same not surprising unanimity that had attended the views of the condemnee\u2019s witnesses, agreed on a value, just before of $36,000 and $38,000, and after the taking of $30,000 and $32,000. One of them, Mr. Buvens, however, confronted with the stock question, Did you arrive at and did you fix the fair market value in a transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer at the moment prior to the declaration of taking, which was in August, 1952?, answered, \u201cI did. I fixed the value at $50,000\u201d; and when asked the next question, Did you arrive at a value of the property as of the moment after the taking, the lapse of one second, answered, \u201cYes, I get the same value of $50,000 before and after the declaration of taking.\u201d \u201cYou mean the property is not hurt?\u201d \u201cPhysically, I don\u2019t believe so. But I did give damages of $5000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">This answer to the question was a wise and proper one because, without full and careful instruction, it was inevitable that the witness would conclude that, for the purpose of the question, the property was already damaged by the presence of the dam, and that it could not have been damaged in any substantial amount more just after the declaration of taking than before because as regards damaging effects it had already been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The same witness further testified:</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">\u201cQ. Mr. Buvens, do you think the property would sell for as much immediately following the easement as it would sell immediately before?</p>\n<p id=\"AH0\">A. I do. I base my opinion on this: Because I find a lot of other properties have sold for just as much if not more than what they did before the easement. I don\u2019t <em>mean to say they sold for more on account of the easement, but it was the general conditions. </em>I have sold different property down there. <em>I had to be very careful to explain to these people about this easement. It was on record and I made sure it was in the deed. After I explained it the way I saw it, there wasn\u2019t any sales resistance getting them to buy the property on account of the easement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">While it is quite probable that the other witnesses for the government were laboring under the same misapprehension that, though the threat and menace of the servitude had been present for many years, the instant before and the instant after the filing of the declaration of taking in 1952 were the only matters to be taken into consideration, this is not quite as clear in their testimony as in the testimony of Buvens, though their chief witness, May, said that the influence of the dam on values <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> had been felt for many years prior thereto. Cf. Pappenheim v. Metropolitan Elev. Ry. Co., 128 N.Y. 436, 28 N.E. 518, 13 L.R.A. 401, at pages 405-406, 26 Am.St.Rep. 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-12\">As further evidence of the failure, of the proof on the part of the government and of the award of the commission, to conform to the standard of market value required, attention is particularly called to this testimony of their chief witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u2022 \u201cI think in arriving at this damage, it .is purely a matter of judgment. <em>You are actually not taking anything .away from the man. He has it yet and it has every value it ever had before and, therefore, it would be an arbitrary figure to try to state that property was damaged ten or twenty percent.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">Cf. 18 Am.Jur., \u201cEminent Domain\u201d, Sec. 356, p. 1001, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AnI\">\u201cOpinion Evidence as to Damage. \u2014In determining the damage to land not taken, a witness must be familiar with the market value before the injury was inflicted and the market value afterward, and estimates .of percentage of value lost, not based upon some substantial ground, should be excluded. * * * In some jurisdictions it is held that a witness should not be allowed to state the amount of damage, but should limit himself to the value before and the value after the injury. * * *\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">and Cumulative Supplement thereto, page 131, citing People v. McReynolds, 31 Cal.App.2d 219, 87 P.2d 734.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">In another way, the presence of the dam in contemplation for many, and completed more than six years before 1952,, had the effect, if not cleared up by appropriate questions and explanations, of clpuding the whole proceeding and everybody\u2019s view about it, not only with reference to the evidence given as to purchases which were offered for purposes of comparison, which prices were necessarily influenced by the fact of the dam and its flowage, but also in the minds of the commission in trying to straighten the problem out.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-13\">Finally, perhaps the strongest evidence of the whole state of confusion, created by the existence and operation of the dam for some time before the declaration of taking was filed, is the amount of damages awarded by the commission. This appears in the fact that, while the commission apparently fixed the market value of the property before the declaration of taking at $60,000, it fixed the damage award at an amount which, if regarded as based upon the valuation of the property after the declaration of taking, was a value greatly in excess of the value fixed by three witnesses for condemnee and two witnesses for the government, and considerably above the price fixed by the lone witness for the government who, testifying not as to the value with and without the servitude but before and after the declaration, said that the property was actually worth as much after the filing of the declaration of taking as it was before.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-14\">With these basic considerations and facts in mind, we turn to appellant\u2019s specific complaints against the findings and award. These are in substance that: contrary to the settled law pertaining to such awards that the standard and measure of value in condemnation proceedings, where the estate taken is less than the fee or absolute ownership, as a flowage easement or servitude, and of the compensation to be paid for the rights appropriated is the difference between the fair market value of the land as a whole, with and without the burden,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and -\u201cthat a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>parcel of land which has been used and treated as an entity shall be so considered in assessing compensation for the taking of part or all of it.\u201d United States v. Miller, 317 U.S. at page 376, 63 S.Ct. at page 281; the commission has determined the value of the property without the burden and then deducted from it amounts arbitrarily arrived at by trying to state that the property was damaged ten, twenty, or some other arbitrary percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">We think it clear: that the commission, instead of determining just compensation under the settled rule of law as the difference between the value of the land as a whole with and without the servitude, determined it by its unguided, unregulated, and, therefore, arbitrary opinion of the proper amount of damage to allow to theoretically separate parcels, and thus deprived the condemnee of the fundamental safeguards which the law has set up for its protection; and that its findings and award have operated to take appellant\u2019s property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">It is true that the witnesses for the condemnee testified that they had divided the land into separate tracts for the purpose of arriving at a proper valuation of it as a whole with and without the servitude, and that the commission, though not the government witnesses, used the same division. In their final testimony, however, condemnee\u2019s witnesses gave a total value of the whole with and without the servitude, while the commission did not do so. It is true, also, that the commission does state in its award, \u201cIn fixing our values we have throughout kept in mind the fact that we are dealing with a 1200 acre tract of land. However, in order that this opinion may conform to the testimony, we will discuss our findings by reference to the above method of subdivision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">When, however, they came to make up their findings, they did not follow the rule they had laid down for themselves, for though they found the fair market value for each of the separate tracts just prior to the declaration of taking, they made no finding as to fair market value of the property with the servitude. Indeed, they undertoook to determine the just compensation due as the equivalent of what was taken by a process not made clear, except as the commission states it on pages 464-5 of the record.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Saying, \u201cThe deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>mination of the amount of impairment of value which resulted from the imposition of the servitude is extremely difficult\u201d, it proceeded to determine, not the value of the property as a whole with and without the servitude, but, using the method which May, the government\u2019s chief witness, correctly condemns as arbitrary, it declared: \u201cWe believe the percentage of damage to tracts one and two is twenty percent, and the amount of just compensation for the rights taken to be $8000\u201d; as <em>to </em>tract, 3, \u201cthe damage to the land amounts to ten percent, or $480\u201d; as to tracts 4 and 5, \u201cWe have arrived at a before taking value of $15,300 and a total value of the damage to this land of $765.\u201d; and <em>\u201cbased upon the above conclusions, we submit our findings of the amount of just compensation owed to the landowners as $9,285.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Thus, though the commission had stated that it had kept in mind that the property must be valued as a whole and it did this as to the fair market value of the sum of all the parts, free of the servitude, it did not make findings of value subject to the servitude, but merely of its opinion as to how much it should arbitrarily deduct for damage here and damage there.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The effect of this, in addition to being without support in the principles of valuation for condemnation, was to deprive appellant of just compensation for all the tracts below the higher contour lines by treating these tracts as though they were small isolated useless pieces of land, unconnected with and not a part of a larger tract, the value of which with and without the servitude they were entitled to have fixed as a basis for the award of compensation to which they were entitled. In addition, however, to the use of wrong procedures in arriving at their findings, the findings on their face are clearly erroneous. This is so because, valuing the separate tracts in the aggregate at $60,000 without the servitude, as the commission did, and then arbitrarily deducting about fifteen percent from this value for what the commission called damages, if indeed its award could be considered as really a finding of $60,000 without and $50,000' with the servitude, this finding would be unreasonable on its face when it is considered that all the witnesses but one fixed its burdened value at from $30,000 to $32,000, and that one fixed its value at $50,000 both before and after the declaration of taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Finally, if on another trial evidence is offered as to what might reasonably be expected in the way o'f actual, as opposed to theoretical, overflow-age from the dam, the judgment of condemnation should be so framed, as to conform it to the findings and the evidence on which they are based, and thus protect the condemnee from, having its award based upon a servitude which the evidence showed to be less than the judgment of taking conferred upon the taker, and finding itself in the position in which it now stands under the judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not. inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-12\">.

All of the experts agree that the damages should be fixed as the amount by which the value would be lessened to a willing purchaser by vir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>tue of the imposition of the servitude. The only appraisal method which is of any assistance is the use of sales of comparable land, before and after the servitude. Unfortunately, because of the small number and points of difference of such sales, this method gives only a general guide to the Commission. Insofar as actual damage is concerned, the servitude does not apply above the 165 feet elevation and the amount of severance damage to the property above that elevation would be based entirely upon the damage to the remainder of the tract.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b96-10\">RIVES, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A_K\">(dissenting),</p>\n<p id=\"Al\">I respectfully dissent. As to Specification of Error No. 1, the easement to overflow or flood the lands is limited by the judgment as follows: \u201cwith the waters impounded by Wallace Lake Dam <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>constructed by the United States of America.\u201d Wallace Lake Dam had been completed before the judgment was entered. Its spillway had a height of 158 feet; the overall height of the dam was 165 feet; there were four sluices three feet wide by eight feet high at an elevation of 142 feet, designed to be and remain permanently open, without means of being closed and not capable of being closed accidentally by debris or otherwise. Thus the dam would create a permanent pool up to 142 feet only, the water would go over the spillway at 158 feet and over the dam at 165 feet. It seems to me clear enough that the easement is based upon the flooding caused by the particular dam as so constructed and that the landowner would, without more, have the right to additional compensation if any structural changes should ever be made in the dam which would cause additional flooding. So thinking, I cannot join my brothers in agreeing in principle with Specification N-o. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The only lands that would ever be flooded permanently by waters impounded by Wallace Lake Dam are those below the 142 foot contour, and the undisputed evidence shows that little, if any, of these lands are below that contour. The majority finds with the Government as to Specifications 2, 5 and 6, and I agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The majority states as a fact that, \u201cThe land, because of its proximity to the City of Shreveport, was being held as an investment for subdivision purposes, which was its highest and best use.\u201d That statement seems to me not in accord with the findings of the Commission<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> amply supported by the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">The measure of compensation is the difference in values before and after taking. The Commission found the value of the property before the taking and then determined \u201cdamages\u201d by depreciating the value of the property after the imposition of the easement. To me that seems a departure in form rather than in substance from the prescribed formula. Cf. 18 Am.Jur., Eminent Domain, \u00a7 356.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-12\">Subtracting the \u201cdamages\u201d from the Commission found value of the property before taking, there is produced an after taking value of the land larger than that fixed by any of the witnesses. However, the difference between the value before taking and such after taking value was within the limits testified to by the witnesses, that is, it was more than such difference according to the testimony of the Government\u2019s witnesses and less than the difference according to the landowner\u2019s witnesses. It was within the province of the Commission, I think, to accept and act on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>all or any part of the testimony of any witness and to draw all reasonable inferences therefrom. I cannot agree that the findings, either on their face, or in fact, are clearly erroneous. To the contrary, I think that they are amply supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Finally, it seems to me that the time of taking was in August, 1952, at the time of the filing of the declaration of taking and accompanying deposit of estimated compensation. True, the construction of the dam had been authorized in 1938, and it had been completed in 1946, but none of these lands were within the bed of Wallace Lake or were permanently flooded, and there was no evidence that before the declaration of taking any of the lands had in fact been flooded by waters impounded by the dam, though that fact does not seem to me material. The servitude, according to my understanding, was not imposed prior to the declaration of taking. Any reduction in value which may have occurred by reason of the legislation or the beginning or completion of the project prior to the declaration of taking cannot be recovered in thes\u00e9 proceedings.

United States, 308 U.S. 271, 285, 60 S.Ct. 231, 236, 84 L.Ed. 240.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> *****8 Indeed, that would be true even if any damage had theretofore been caused by actual flooding with the impounded waters. \u201cThe property taken was the right to use in the future. The commissioners were not authorized to make any award on account of damages caused by unlawful flooding of shore-lands prior to the taking.\u201d Olson v. United States, 292 U.S. 246, 262, 54 S.Ct. 704, 711, 78 L.Ed. 1236.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">A reading and study of this record convinces me that the case was carefully tried by a district judge thoroughly familiar with the applicable principles of law and with the aid of a conscientious and thorough Commission, and that the result reached was right and just. I, therefore, respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">.

This portion of the land is traversed by Brushy Bayou and is subject to frequent overflows from headwater. Unlike the high lands, which appear well suited for subdivision purposes, it is doubtful that the lower property by itself could ever be economically subdivided due to the necessity of expensive and extensive drainage work. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">\u201cTract 3 consists of some thirty-five acres of high land, about forty-five acres of land similar to the lower portions of Tracts 1 and 2 and of some forty acres of extremely low, swampy, poor quality land of very little value. * * * \u201cTracts 4 and 5 contain approximately one hundred ten acres of high land, about one hundred acres of intermediate land which is suitable for cultivation and pasturage and the remainder is very low, swampy land of the type described under Tract 3.
