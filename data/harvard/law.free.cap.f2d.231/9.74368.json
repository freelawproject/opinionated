Plaintiff,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a resident of New York, sought specific performance of an agreement to sell designated oil and gas leasehold interests in Garfield County, Oklahoma. Judgment was rendered for the defendants, a motion for a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence was overruled and plaintiff appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">Many of the basic facts were admitted in the answer. White, president of the corporate defendant, had written two letters to plaintiff under date of May 25, 1954. In one the corporation offered to drill a test well on one of its properties \u201cfor the sum of $41,250.00 plugged and abandoned, with an assignment * * * of a %ths interest\u201d in three leases to plaintiff. The well was to be drilled to a depth \u201csufficient to test the Arbuckle dolomite at approximately 5200 feet, unless commercial production * * * [should be] found at a lesser depth.\u201d In the other it was stated a \u201cverbal agreement\u201d between the corporation and plaintiff was confirmed, under which \u201cthe difference between the amount deposited by * * * [plaintiff] and the $41,250.00 required to drill the * * * Prospect,\u201d would be paid to plaintiff at the time such sum should be deposited. The second was obviously written to enable plaintiff to negotiate a sale of his interest, or a portion of it, to others; and one McCrary, of Texas, ultimately collaborated with plaintiff in an effort to secure the leases upon the payment of the sum named.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-16\">The issue raised by the pleadings was whether an attempt by plaintiff and his associate, on or about June 21, 1954, to accept the offer of May 25, 1954 was, under the circumstances, timely, i. e., made while the offer was still open. The trial court resolved it in favor of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>ants, making findings of fact and conclusions of law as required by Rule 52, F.R.C.P., 28 U.S.C.A. Its ultimate finding was: \u201cThat plaintiff\u2019s evidence does not show that his alleged acceptance of June 21, 1954, was acceptance of any offer open for acceptance at that time.\u201d This finding and the three preceding ones <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> are assailed as not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">During the course of the trial and before the findings were made, the court indicated why it felt those now attacked should be made. It was stated that whether the court believed the testimony or not, to the effect that the offer had been specifically withdrawn, plaintiff \u201cwould know that it was withdrawn because the test was such as to put an experienced oil man on notice in that area materially.\u201d Doubt was expressed that the parties would \u201cact contrary to the ordinary actions of human beings under those circumstances\u201d and the court stated there was \u201cnot sufficient evidence here to indicate it.\u201d Counsel for plaintiff having called the court\u2019s attention to the testimony of plaintiff, which he characterized as \u201cdirect and positive,\u201d the court stated it could not believe the testimony, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cIt is contrary to * * * what any normal human being would have done under the circumstances. I couldn\u2019t believe that the defendants \u2022* * * -would make any such statement. There would be no reason for them to make it, and I don\u2019t believe they did * * * and if Mr. Sowder contends that far, I ' think his testimony is untrue and so find it to be.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The brief references to the colloquy indicate, as indeed the record clearly shows, that whether the offer had been withdrawn before acceptance was the crucial issue of fact submitted to the trial court upon conflicting evidence. Its findings should not be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and due regard should be given to its opportunity to judge the credibility of the witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Applying the usual test whether the findings are \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d this court, after a careful review of all of the evidence, ,is not \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Plaintiff argues that the trial court \u201cwas obviously influenced too much by the fact that there was a successful * * * test in the offset well,\u201d which, it is said, must have been the basis for the court\u2019s finding that the offer had been withdrawn by implication. Thq finding, it will be noted, was that the offer had been \u201cwithdrawn, either expressly, by implication, or both.\u201d Evidence obviously in the mind of the court included the testimony of plaintiff that the test had made \u201cthe value of the property look better\u201d although plaintiff stated he \u201cdidn\u2019t know whether it would establish the price\u201d mentioned in the offer; also the opinion of a witness called as an expert, who stated \u201cthat the-very fine positive drill test would add substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>tially to the value of that acreage\u201d; and the testimony of a vice-president of the company that an extremely good test in the offset well, which he stated the present one was, would treble the value of the acreage in issue. Whether evidence of that type, coupled, as it was, with an expressed feeling of the court that \u201ca drill stem test with a showing like this had greatly increased the possibility of a well,\u201d would support a conclusion that the offer had been withdrawn by implication, need not be decided. It was, at least, a circumstance to be considered in resolving a difficult fact question. One somewhat akin is suggested in a quotation from the opinion by the Supreme Court in Twin-Lick Oil Co. v. Marbury, set out in the footnote.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Recently this court, in Justheim Petroleum Company v. Hammond,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> applied essentially the same principle, holding that a party to a contract for the purchase of an interest in oil and gas properties could not delay, if he wished to rescind the contract, until after drilling had disclosed the property to be valueless or of less value than anticipated.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The contention that the trial court abused its discretion in refusing, to open the judgment and permit the introduction of additional testimony and in refusing to grant plaintiff a new trial on the ground of newly discovered evidence remains for consideration. The additional evidence concerns a long distance telephone call which White, the president of the corporate defendant, testified he had placed from his office in Oklahoma City to the plaintiff in New York on June 18, 1954. It would tend to indicate that White made no such telephone call and that the only calls to New York by him on that date were to a Mr. Conway, who was not involved in this lawsuit nor acting directly or indirectly for plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">The affidavits indicate that the records of the telephone company pertaining to long distance calls made by White on June 18 through June 20 were produced at the trial by an employee of the telephone company; that the witness was excused from further attendance upon the court at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s evidence, at which time he removed the original records; that thereafter White testified he placed a call to plaintiff in New York City on June 18; that subsequent to the trial the telephone company was unable to locate the long distance (toll) ticket evidencing the charge for White\u2019s call to New York City; and that the missing ticket was subsequently mailed to counsel for plaintiff by an unknown, unidentifiable, addressor, attached to which was a typewritten note stating : \u201cMy conscience has troubled me. I hope no questions will be asked.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b60-10\">The trial court in overruling the motion for a new trial held that the evidence came too late; that its decision upon the merits did not rest on the evidence of the telephone calls; and that it would not permit the plaintiff, by innuendo, to cast aspersions upon anyone involved in the lawsuit. Our decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>will be based squarely upon the second\u2014 i. e. that the number or origin of the telephone calls is not determinative. While we cannot condone the perpetration of a fraud upon the court or approve the deliberate withholding of what may have been important evidence in the trial, we pass this phase of the matter without further discussion, setting out in the footnote, however, a statement from defendant\u2019s brief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">We are of the opinion the trial court did not abuse its discretion or commit reversible error in overruling plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial. Whether White had called plaintiff, or vice versa, at best would only effect the credibility of the witnesses. Plaintiff could not recall whether he had called White or White had called him on June 18,1954; but it is clear that plaintiff, on that date, was told about the indication of oil and gas in commercial quantities in the offset well. He stated that he \u201cwanted to follow the progress of that well naturally\u201d; and the evidence indicates that in spite of an adverse report to McCrary by his geologist plaintiff\u2019s efforts to interest him in the leases continued. He testified that he talked to White \u201con the 18th, I suppose on the 19th, and on the 20th.\u201d The precise number of telephone calls and who made them was only incidental to the issue being tried \u2014 whether the offer of May 25 remained open after the showing of oil and gas in the offset well. Plaintiff\u2019s testimony was far from convincing. At one point he stated that after he \u201cgot the information that the Wilcox [offset well] was open for 90 minutes and showed at the rate of 50 barrels an hour, that made it worth just about the price we were asking for it and I told him [White] so.\u201d Later he testified that during the period between June 17 and June 20 he had \u201ctelephoned Mr. White,\u201d passing on to him information concerning an offer of a company to \u201cpay $25,000.00 in cash and carry them for a quarter overriding royalty,\u201d but that White had said \u201cit wasn\u2019t acceptable and as far as that is concerned it wasn\u2019t acceptable to me, but I was keeping him posted on everything how we were doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">It would serve no useful purpose to quote more extensively from the evidence. The portion which has been set out points up the difficult factual question submitted to and resolved by the trial court. Its conclusion, we believe, was clearly justified under the evidence. Nor is our holding contra to Prudential Ins. Co. v. Gilroy<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or R. E. Crummer &amp; Co. v. Nuveen,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> upon which plaintiff heavily relies. In the Prudential case the newly discovered evidence pertained to premium receipts, alleged to be forged, which, if established, would bar recovery under the policy. The rationale of the Crummer case is applicable only if it be found that there is no evidence to support the trial court\u2019s finding that there was an express withdrawal of the offer, which we decline to make.</p>\n<p id=\"AWAv\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b58-17\">. During the pendency of the appeal plaintiff died and the executor of his estate was substituted as appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\">. The other findings were that the test in an offset well indicated the presence of oil and gas in commercial quantities and materially increased the market value of oil and gas leases in the area, including the lease involved in this case; that at the time of a telephone conversation between plaintiff and White on June 18, 1954, the offer had not been accepted and \u201cduring the course of the conversation\u201d it \u201cwas withdrawn, either expressly, by implication, or both\u201d; and that there was not, at any time, any agreement between the parties, oral or written, that the offer would be \u201cheld open for any specified period of time or until the property was sold to other \u2022 parties.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b59-15\">.

Property worth thousands to-day is worth nothing to-morrow; and that which would today sell for a thousand dollars as its fair value, may, by the natural changes of a week or the energy and courage of desperate enterprise, in the same <em>time </em>be \u2022made to yield that much every day. The injustice, therefore, is obvious, of permitting one holding the right to assert an 'ownership in such property to voluntarily await the event, and then decide, when the danger which is over has been at the risk of another, to come in and share the profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-12\">\u201cWhile a much longer time might be allowed to assert this right in regard to real estate whose value is fixed, on which no outlay is made for improvement, and but little change in value, the class of property here considered, subject to the most rapid, frequent, and violent fluctuations in value of any thing known as property, requires prompt action in all who hold an option, whether they will share its risks, or stand clear of them.\u201d 91 U.S. 587, 592-593, 23 L.
