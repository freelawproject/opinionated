The making of an investigation, which ultimately led the police to get certain evidence from remote places, was suggested to them by their finding a clipping of a newspaper account of the crime in an entirely different place. Because the appellant frequented this place, the police were led to suspect him. Because the police had no right to be in this place, appellant contends the evidence should have been excluded. Though the question is close, we think the connection between the evidence and the previous misconduct of the police is \u201cso attenuated as to dissipate the taint.\u201d Nardone v.
