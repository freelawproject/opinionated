This stated purpose is probably conclusive, we think. \u201cThe parties are not at liberty to say that their purpose was other or narrower than that which they formally set forth in the instrument under which their activities were conducted.\u201d Helvering v. Coleman-Gilbert Associates, 296 U.S. 369, 374, 56 S.Ct. 285, 287, 80 L.Ed. 278. See also Main-Hammond Land Trust v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 200 F.2d 308, 311-312; Second Carey Trust v. Helvering, 75 U.S.App. D.C. 263, 126 F.2d 526, 528; Royalty Participation Trust v. Commissioner, 20 T.C. 466, 472-473. Our decision in National Investors Corp. v. Hoey, 2 Cir., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>144 F.2d 466 does not require a contrary holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">More important, even if we were to accept taxpayers\u2019 contention that some business activity is essential in order to treat these \u201canonymous associations\u201d as corporations for tax purposes, we have the fact that the Tax Court found they were actually engaged in business activity ; and we think that this finding is not \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">Since there was sufficient business activity to treat these associations as corporations, it necessarily follows that exceptional circumstances do not exist for disregarding the separate business entity. See Moline Properties, Inc., v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436, 63 S.Ct. 1132, 87 L.Ed. 1499; Porter Royalty Pool v. Commissioner, 6 Cir., 165 F.2d 933; Paymer v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
