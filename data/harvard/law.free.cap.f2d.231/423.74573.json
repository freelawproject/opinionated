Wolf, 217 F.2d 203, was handed down holding that the jurisdiction of the District Court under the Tort Claims Act over the United States will not support as ancillary thereto a claim against the agent of the government. In the instant case, there was no independent <em>ground </em>of jurisdiction between the Dooleys and Carroll, Hedlund &amp; Associates. The stock basis of jurisdiction in virtue of diversity of citizenship was negatived by express allegations of the complaint. No federal question was outlined.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-18\">Jean Dooley, according to the testimony, fell upon a walk at a housing project because a wire which had been erected to protect newly seeded grounds of the project had been allowed to fall down and was lying loose across the sidewalk. The housing project was owned by the United States and was managed by Carroll, Hedlund &amp; Associates, Inc., a Washington corporation, as the agent of the United States. The fences had been erected by a landscape gardening firm. Jean Dooley and her husband were tenants of this project, and these walks were maintained as commonways for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>tenants. Various employees of the project and of Carroll, Hedlund &amp; Associates were assigned the duties of inspecting and maintaining these fences continuously for the protection of those lawfully using the walks. All of such employees had notice that the wires so erected were apt to be down at any time day or night and be a danger to the user of the walks. The trial judge made findings as to both of the defendants. In view of the fact that the United States now becomes the sole defendant, there must be a modification of these findings in accordance with the express terms of the Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1346 (b), 2671-2680.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">It seems that there were sufficient facts here to establish liability as to the United States, as the trial court concluded. There must be a finding that some employee of the government was negligent in some particular founding liability under Washington law. In view of the fact that a joint judgment cannot be upheld, the findings to support this liability should, upon remand, be clearly drawn. There should be included all the elements made requisite by the basic statute: (a) \u201cpersonal injury\u201d, (b) \u201ccaused by\u201d, (c) \u201cthe negligent * * * act or omission\u201d, (d) \u201cof any employee of the Government\u201d, (e) \u201cwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment,\u201d (f) \u201cunder circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the place where the act or omission occurred\u201d, and all facts shown by the record which are essential under the law of the State of Washington to render a private party responsible for the acts of its employees under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">\u201c \u2018Employee of the government\u2019 includes * * * persons acting on behalf of a federal agency in an official capacity, temporarily or permanently * * 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2671.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Under the Tort Claims Act, the government cannot be held as landowner or landlord. But the United States, by the express terms of the enactment, is liable for the acts and omissions of its employees. Here the alleged negligence of the caretakers consisted in the building and failure to maintain the fences which were in such position that a wire which fell or broke got on the walk. The duty of the landowner and the landlord was in the background. The duty of these agents was to prevent these wires from becoming a hazard. This can be easily distinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-10\">The joint judgment is set aside and the cause remanded, the pleadings will be amended in accordance with the record to eliminate the private defendant, and the trial court will, without retrial, make specific findings of fact upon the present record and enter appropriate judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
