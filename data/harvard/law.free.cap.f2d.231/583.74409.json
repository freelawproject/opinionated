John W. Fisher and Lurene W. Fisher set up that they were the owners in fee simple of the property in litigation and that the United States claimed an interest therein adverse to the Fishers which constituted a cloud upon their title. They further pleaded that they had acquired title at judicial sale in an action in which Nash Building Company, Inc., was defendant and the Fishers were plaintiffs. Further, it was alleged a Sheriff\u2019s Deed had been delivered and that the time for redemption had expired. It was also alleged that a lis pendens had been recorded in that suit before the recordation of the claimed government lien. The cause was removed by the government to the United States District Court, where answer was filed claiming that the Fishers entered into an escrow for the sale of this property and authorized the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>completion of the escrow and the delivery of title to the purchaser upon receipt of about $120,000.00. It was contended that Tesseyman acquired an interest in the property subsequent to the original purchase to which the lien of the United States for unpaid income taxes against Tesseyman attached.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">This action by the Fishers to remove the cloud caused by the alleged government lien came on for trial March 1, 1954. Evidence was adduced and the government called Tesseyman as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">On March 17,1954, Tesseyman filed his petition therein for intervention on the ground he had an interest in the property. An affidavit controverting the petition set up that Tesseyman had been adjudicated to have no interest in the property by the alleged government lien c-6\"> The first ground for dismissal was that the court had not acquired jurisdiction over the person of the Attorney General. This officer has his official residence in the District of Columbia and may be served with process only in that district, unless otherwise provided by statute. No exception has been made for this type action. The Attorney General did not consent to jurisdiction over his person. His motion for dismissal was made \u201cwithout waiving any of his objections to the jurisdiction of the Court and especially appearing for the purpose of this Motion only.\u201d It is clear enough that there was no jurisdiction of his person. This would dispose of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">There are no allegations of fact which hint that there were any proceedings which could be reviewed under the Administrative Procedure Act in accordance with Shaughnessy v. Pedreiro, 349 U.S. 48, 75 S.Ct. 591. The petition for declaratory judgment was insufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court under the provisions of 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1503. There was no averment of fact from which it could be concluded that petitioner was denied any specific right or privilege as a national of the United States upon the ground that he was not such a national. The petition does not allege that it was filed within five years after final administrative denial of a claimed right or privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">The Declaratory Judgment Act merely enlarges the range of remedies available in federal courts. It does not afford an independent basis for federal jurisdiction. No other allegations of fact indicate that there were other bases for jurisdiction of the District Court. There is no allegation of diversity of citizenship. There is no allegation of a jurisdictional amount. The gist of the claim of petitioner is that he is being deprived of citizenship without due process, but no \u201cfacts\u201d are alleged which give even a shadow of basis for such a claim. The adjudication of alleged constitutional rights in a declaratory judgment action is not to be encouraged for the reason that decisions in that field tend to be advisory unless based upon proof of definite and specific fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Finally, the allowance of a petition for declaratory relief is discretionary with the trial court. There was no abuse of discretion in dismissing the petition even if the jurisdictional grounds were present.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">In the event that the Attorney Ge
