This statute, no longer in effect, authorized the Secretary to terminate employment of any officer or employee of the Department, \u201cwhenever he shall deem such termination necessary or advisable in the best interests of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-21\">In the District Court appellant sought a decree holding the statute to be unconstitutional, declaring his removal illegal in any event, and requiring the Secretary to reinstate him. The District Court, after hearing, found that appellant was discharged upon a determination by the Secretary, acting pursuant to the statute, that in his absolute discretion he deemed it advisable in the best interests of the United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judgment was entered for the Secretary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-22\">The constitutionality of the statute is upheld by the reasoning of this Court in Bailey v. Richardson, 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248, 182 F.2d 46, affirmed by an equally divided court, 341 U.S. 918, 71 S.Ct. 669, 95 L.Ed. 1352.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And since the Secretary complied with the statute the judgment must be</p>\n<p id=\"ARq\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b542-15\">. The Court also concluded that the evi.dence did not support appellant\u2019s con.tention that the Secretary acted in an arbitrary or unreasonable manner.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b542-23\">. It should be noted, however, that in the case at bar appellant\u2019s discharge carries no implication that he might be either disloyal or a security risk.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
