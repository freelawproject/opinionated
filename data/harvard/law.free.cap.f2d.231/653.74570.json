Similar appeals by the same prisoner have been before us on prior occasions. See Jackson v. United States, 4 Cir., 214 F.2d 485, and Jackson v. United States, 4 Cir., 224 F.2d 556. His contention now is that at the time of his sentence he was not notified of the right of appeal by the trial judge. Buie 37(a) (2) of the Buies of Criminal Procedure, 18 U.S.C., has no application to the case because sentence was not im* posed after trial, but upon a plea of guilty, and defendant was represented by counsel. The facts are fully set forth in the orders of the court below dated December 21, 1955 and December 2, 1955. The motion was frivolous and was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
