In each, a UHF television station complains of action by the Federal Communications Commission which allegedly threatens its economic position by licensing a VHF station to function in its area. The UHF stations, whom we may refer to collectively as \u201cpetitioners,\u201d seek stays of the Commission\u2019s actions, pending appeal. All rely on our decision, one judge dissenting, in Greylock Broadcasting Co. v. United States, No. 12,989 (stay granted December 9, 1955).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b547-14\">In Case No. 13,034, Coastal Bend has filed an appeal under Section 402(b) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(b), from actions of the Commission on December 9, 1955, granting the application of Gulf Coast (intervenor here) for a new television station on VHF Channel 6 in Corpus Christi, Texas, and simultaneously denying Coastal Bend\u2019s requests to intervene or secure a stay of action in the Corpus Christi Channel 6 proceeding. In Case No. 13,035, Coastal Bend has filed a petition for review under Section 402(a) of the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 402(a), from an action of the Commission denying, on November 10, 1955, a Coastal Bend petition to \u201cdeintermix\u201d Corpus Christi, Texas, which sought to delete VHF television assignments from that area and make it an all UHF area.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-15\">In Cases Nos. 13,038 and 13,039, Monona and Bartell operate UHF Channels 27 and 33, respectively, in Madison, Wisconsin. They are appealing (1) from the December 12, 1955, order of the Commission which granted the application of Radio Wisconsin (intervenor here) for VHF Channel 3 in Madison, Wisconsin, (2) from the December 12, 1955, order of the Commission which denied their petition to intervene in the Radio Wisconsin proceedings, and to reopen the record in that case; or in the alternative to stay any grant in that proceeding until the Commission has disposed of pending rule-making proceedings. In addition, Monona and Bartell are seeking review of the November 10, 1955, order of the Commission which denied their petition to \u201cdeintermix\u201d Madison.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>Cases Nos. 13,057 and 13,058 are similar. Premier and Ohio Valley in Case No. 13,057 and Mid-America in Case No. 13,058 are appealing the Commission action of December 27, 1955, which granted VHF Channel 7 to Evansville TV (intervenor), denied appellants\u2019 requests to intervene in the proceeding and refused appellants\u2019 requests to stay the proceeding pending the completion of the general rule-making proceeding dealing with the UHF-VHF problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">The orders sought to be stayed in the present cases are all adjudicatory, and represent awards of licenses for stations on VHF channels which had long since been finally assigned by the Commission\u2019s Sixth Order and Report, adopted in April, 1952, to the communities here involved. Petitioners have thus far made no serious challenge to the adjudicatory proceedings as such, and, indeed, did not even seek to enter them until the hearings had been completed. Petitioners\u2019 real aim appears to be to stop these adjudicatory proceedings from reaching a conclusion until what they hope will be a more favorable channel allocation rule is adopted by the Commission. The Commission, however, has decided not to impose such a freeze. This is the sort of quasi-legislative policy decision which is virtually immune from attack in the courts. Nor is it likely that petitioners will be able to establish any retroactive invalidity, because of changed circumstances or otherwise, in the 1952 channel allocations rule under which the adjudicatory proceedings took place. They have thus advanced little to show that they are entitled to succeed on the merits of their appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In Greylock, by way of contrast, the Commission\u2019s decision was not purely adjudicatory. The Commission there created a new channel which had not existed before under the channel allocation rule, a \u201cdrop-in\u201d in the parlance of the trade. This channel was a VHF channel in what had theretofore been a predominately UHF area. UHF stations had become established there, evidently not anticipating VHF competition. Yet the Commission, under its rule-making procedure, finalized the allocation of the new VHF channel. The petition in Grey-lock may thus present a substantial question for the consideration of this court. That is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-11\"> These differences also result in distinctions between the relative equities of the respective petitioners and intervenors (the VHF interests). The areas served by petitioners in the instant cases had as long ago as April, 1952, been allotted one or more VHF channels.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 2Thus, petitioners opened their UHF stations with notice of the potential competition from VHF stations on channels already allotted to their areas, whereas in the Greylock \u201cdrop-in\u201d situation the UHF station had had no such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-12\">Petitioners have not shown sufficient likelihood of success on the merits of their cases to justify the granting of stays, in the face of the very great public interest in obtaining additional service through the grants to intervenors. It is, after all, the public interest which must govern.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commission, of course, has not found that injury to the business of UHF station operators would be in the public interest. But that is not the issue. The Commission, after considering petitioners\u2019 pleadings, has affirmatively found that the additional VHF service which intervenors will provide is required in the public interest. If extinction of UHF stations results from the Commission\u2019s policy and actions, the responsibility must lie at the Commission\u2019s door. See Federal Communications Commission v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 1940, 309 U.S. 134, 144-145, 60 S.Ct. 437, 84 L.Ed. 656. For us to interfere with the Commission\u2019s de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>cisi\u00f3n, through the issuance of stays, requires a far stronger case than petitioners have made.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Stays must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"AsW\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b547-16\"> An opinion on reconsideration is being filed today, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 414, 231 F.2d 748.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b548-6\">.

We note, also, that in No. 13,058 the petitioner (Mid-America) is now and for some time has been off the air and hence cannot establish irreparable injury resulting from the Commission\u2019s action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-5\">BAZELON, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"APr\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">I think the court\u2019s action is in conflict with Greylock Broadcasting Co. v. United States.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The public and private injury involved here is not distinguishable from that involved in Greylock. The court does not suggest otherwise. But it says that the question presented on the merits of these appeals is not as substantial as the one presented in Grey-lock. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">It is true that the UHF and VHF allocations to the communities involved here were made at the same time (by the Sixth Report and Order, adopted April 1952) while in Greylock the Commission sought to assign a VHF channel to an area after the UHF stations had been allocated and were operating there. Hence it is said that the UHF stations in the instant cases, unlike the UHF stations in Greylock, accepted their licenses subject to the VHF competition which they now seek to restrain. But these licenses were sought and accepted in reliance upon the premise implicit in the determination in the Sixth Report and Order to intermix UHF and VHF in the same communities, namely, that UHF could exist with VHF competition. Now the Commission recognizes that that premise, which everyone accepted in good faith, did not withstand the test of experience. Accordingly it has ordered a new rule-making proceeding for the purpose of re-examining its previous determination to intermix. Relying upon the undeniable fact that the VHF operations contemplated in the instant cases would inevitably destroy their UHF operations, our appellants petitioned the Commission to stay the VHF grants pending resolution of the new rule-making proceeding. This refusal frames the question on the merits of these appeals, namely, whether due process and common sense require the Commission to consider de-intermixture and other proposals as means of saving UHF before leaving it to face certain destruction on the theretofore uncharted rocks of VHF competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The question we found substantial enough to support the grant of a stay in Greylock was whether due process considerations required the Commission to pass upon proposed solutions in the rule-making proceeding before <em>allocating </em>a VHF channel whose eventual operation would destroy Greylock\u2019s UHF operation. It seems to me that the authorizations in these cases to <em>actually operate </em>a VHF station present an even sharper and more substantial question of due process.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-18\">.
