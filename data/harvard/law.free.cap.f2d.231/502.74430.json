Appellee Hortense Priscilla Jones is the daughter of one Nero Jones, who died intestate in November, 1951. He owned, among other things, certain real estate. The plaintiff in the action is his mother. She alleged that he was unmarried, that he left surviving him brothers and sisters, and that Hortense was illegitimate. Hortense alleged that her father, Nero, and her mother were husband and wife in a common-law marriage and that she was the child of that marriage. The issue upon the trial was the existence of that alleged common-law marriage;</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>The trial court heard numerous witnesses. It found as facts that the common-law marriage existed and continued over a period of years, from 1932 until the death of the wife in 1941, and that Hortense was born in October, 1933. We think the evidence was ample to support the findings; the findings were not clearly erroneous. The trial court made no error of law respecting common-law marriage. Its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"A6ca\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
