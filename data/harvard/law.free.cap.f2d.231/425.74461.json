L. Price, on July 7, 1953, in the face amount of $5,000.00. Appellant defended on the theory that the policy had been cancelled on September 6, 1954, pri- or to the loss on September 10, 1954. Trial to a jury resulted in a verdict and judgment for appellee, and the main inquiry upon this review is whether the proof and controlling Texas authorities support the jury finding and award based upon Price\u2019s apparent authority orally to revoke appellant\u2019s attempted cancellation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-20\">The policy was issued upon the Texas standard form, for a term of five years, with a total premium of $176.00. Appellee made a down payment of $44.00 to appellant\u2019s agent, Price, upon issuance of the policy on July 7,1953, and, executed a deferred premium note in favor of the Fort Worth National Bank at Fort Worth, Texas to secure payment in three succeeding annual installments of the premium balance, the installments being due on successive anniversary dates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>of the policy, i. e., on July 7,1954, July 7, 1955 and July 7, 1956.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">According to testimony by appellee and Price, appellee gave Price the <em>money </em>for the installment premium due on July 7, 1954, three days late on July 10, 1954,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and was given a company receipt therefor. It is undisputed, however, that Price did not then forward appellee\u2019s cash payment either to the Fort Worth bank named as payee in the deferred premium note or to appellant, but simply placed the money in his hip pocket and forgot about it until appellee\u2019s first cancellation notice was received.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Upon receipt of such notice, appellee again went to see Price in Tyler, Texas, who assured him that he \u201cwas dealing with a regular agent\u201d and that appellee \u201cwould get a letter reinstating it\u201d, so he should simply disregard the notice, upon which representations appellee relied without further action. Two or three days later, after Price had forwarded his personal check to the Fort Worth National Bank as payment of appellee\u2019s premium, appellee did in fact receive a letter from appellant revoking its prior cancellation notice,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> just as Price had represented he would. However, Price's personal check, forwarded by him in lieu of appellee\u2019s cash payment previously received, was subsequently dishonored for insufficient funds, as a result of which a second notice of cancellation, dated August 26,1954, was received by appellee on August 28, 1954, notifying him that his coverage would cease in accordance with the policy cancellation provisions at 12:-01 A. M. on September 6, 1954. This second cancellation notice, however, appeared to have been issued both by \u201cR. L. Price Insurance Agency\u201d and \u201cThomas M. Ryan Company,\u201d by one James H. Fulton, rather than simply bearing a notation that a copy had been sent to Price, as the first notice had done.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">On the same day that he received this second cancellation notice, appellee called Price by phone to protest, but was again reassured that he could safely \u201cdisregard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>it\u201d and need not worry because another letter revoking the company\u2019s cancellation would be forthcoming; that he, Price, was appellant\u2019s \u201clegal agent\u201d, and that appellee\u2019s property was still covered. Appellee relied upon all of these representations by Price <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> without conferring either with the Bank or with appellant direct. Furthermore, although Price\u2019s agency had by then been terminated by appellant, it is without dispute that appellee had no actual notice of such termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">Finally, on the evening of September 9, 1954, less than twenty-four hours before the total destruction of appellee\u2019s property by fire, and three days after the purported effective date of the cancellation of appellant\u2019s coverage under its second notice, it was shown that Price went by appellee\u2019s home, and admitted that this second cancellation notice had been prompted by his own dereliction in tendering his insufficient funds check in payment of the premium. Price then gave appellee a money order receipt showing payment of the delinquent premium installment, and, according to further credited testimony by appellee, assured him that he should not worry about his property because his insurance was in force \u201cif it bums down tonight.\u201d Price\u2019s money order did not reach the bank until September 13th, three days after the fire, at which time it was rejected on the ground that cancellation of appellee\u2019s coverage had antedated the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Price\u2019s agency in fact with appellant having been expressly terminated before the loss occurred, though without actual notice to appellee, and appellant having intended by its second notice to cancel appellee\u2019s coverage before any liability arose, the crucial inquiry under this proof is whether, under the applicable 'Texas authorities, Price nevertheless had apparent or ostensible authority, after termination of his express agency, orally to bind appellant with his revocation of its second cancellation notice; or, stated differently, whether because of appellant\u2019s prior representations and course of conduct it is now estopped to deny Price\u2019s authority to revoke its second cancellation prior to the loss. Speaking recently upon this doctrine of apparent authority, the Supreme Court of Texas has held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of apparent authority is based on estoppel, and one seeking to charge a principal through the apparent authority of an agent to bind the principal must prove such conduct on the part of the principal as would lead a reasonably prudent person, using diligence and discretion, to suppose that the agent has the authority he purports to exercise. Great American Casualty Co. v. Eichelberger, Tex.Civ.App., 37 S.W.2d 1050, writ refused.\u201d Chastain v. Cooper &amp; Reed, 152 Tex. 322, 257 S.W.2d 422, 427.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">The general rule, however, in Texas and elsewhere, is that an insured is entitled to assume that an insurance agent is continuing to act within the scope of his agency, unless and until he has either actual or constructive notice to the contrary; and \u201ca revocation by the principal, of the general authority of his agent, is ineffective as between the principal and such third persons as deal with the agent, as such, on the faith of the continued existence of his authority, without notice of the revocation.\u201d Scott v. Law, Union &amp; Rock Ins. Co., Tex.Com. App., 12 S.W.2d 147, 149; Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Hanna, 81 Tex. 487, 17 S.W. 35; 24 Texas Jurisprudence, p. 803; 29 Am.Jur., Insurance, \u00a7 88, p. 11; 14 A.L. R. 846. While the declaration and representations of the agent alone are insufficient to establish the scope of his authority to bind his insurer, we think Texas law authorizes recovery in a situation where, as here, an insurer has by its own confirmation and ratification of similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>acts by its agent at least impliedly, albeit inadvertently, misled an insured to Ms prejudice in his reliance upon that same agent\u2019s repeated assertions of his continuing authority. See Great American Casualty Ins. Co. v. Eichelberger, Tex.Civ.App., 37 S.W.2d 1050, 1052; Texas Hardware Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Flewellen, Tex.Civ.App., 68 S.W.2d 521, 524; Prudential Fire Ins. Co. v. Williams, Tex.Civ.App., 148 S.W.2d 264, 265.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\"> Applying the above rules, we think appellant\u2019s proof is not only insufficient to show either actual or constructive knowledge by appellee of any limitation on Price\u2019s continuing authority to bind it, but reads as fairly and affirmatively implying simply a continuation of his previously exercised authority to revoke appellant\u2019s attempted cancellation in much the same manner as Price had theretofore effectively revoked appellant\u2019s first attempted cancellation of the policy, with express company approval. Considering other testimony showing appellant\u2019s knowledge that Price was attempting to pay the premium which he had already collected from appellee, its notation on the first cancellation notice forwarded to appellee that an information copy had been mailed to Price, and the clear implication upon the face of its second notice of cancellation that it had originated jointly from appellant\u2019s general agent and Price, in the light of the comparatively short period of time intervening between appellant\u2019s termination of Price\u2019s agency and the loss,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we think that appellee was not foreclosed from recovery as a matter of law by his asserted lack of diligence and ordinary business acumen in failing to verify Price\u2019s authority during this period. Price\u2019s repeated assurances of his continuing authority to act as \u201clegal agent\u201d for the company, coupled with the other indicia tending to support its existence, were enough to induce a reasonable belief by appellee that Price could do again what he had already successfully done once before, i. e. revoke appellant\u2019s cancellation and continue the coverage. In view of the equivocal situation apparently existing during this period between appellant and Price, inferably precipitated by Price\u2019s own derelictions, but unknown to appellee, we think it was incumbent upon appellant to give appellee some positive notice of Price\u2019s lack of actual authority during this period, so that he would have had a chance to protect his property otherwise, rather than to permit his continued reliance upon Price to his prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">There remains for consideration only appellant\u2019s suggestion that appellee was himself estopped by the express provisions of his deferred premium payment note to the Bank,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from disputing the Bank\u2019s authority effectively to cancel his coverage in the manner attempted prior to the loss. Cf. United Fidelity Life Ins. Co. v. Fowler, Tex.Civ.App., 38 S.W.2d 128, 131. We do not construe the doctrine of \u201cestoppel by contract\u201d as applicable to bar recovery under the facts shown, especially since we think appellant, by its own acquiescence in Price\u2019s collection and attempted payment of the delinquent premium and its own attempted cancellation, has itself assumed positions inconsistent with the express provisions of the note, and in effect waived its right now to insist upon such strict compliance by appellee with its terms. See Home Ins. Co. of New York v. Roberts, 129 Tex. 178, 100 S.W.2d 91, 93. But pretermitting the inferentially contested issue of whether appellant\u2019s strict reliance upon the provisions of the note is, in effect, in conflict with Texas\u2019 asserted statutory policy prohibiting an insurance company from so circumscribing the authority of its authorized agents to transact its business,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we merely -hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>that the instant proof is sufficient under Texas law to justify the jury\u2019s finding of appellant\u2019s liability, based on Price\u2019s apparent authority to revoke the second cancellation notice. Texas Hardware Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Flewellen, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b475-7\">. The note further provided, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-8\">\u201cAny or all of the above described policies may be canceled by the Bank, at any time, after first giving ten days\u2019 written notice of its intention to cancel by depositing such notice in ordinary mail directed to the undersigned at the designated address appearing below. If payment is not made in full of the unpaid balance hereunder within ten days after the mailing of such notice, the Bank may without further notice cause to be canceled, and may demand and receive all return premiums on, all policies listed above, and for such purpose the undersigned hereby constitutes and appoints the Bank attorney-in-fact and agent of the undersigned, to execute any and all instruments in that behalf which may in the judgment of the Bank be necessary, and action of the Bank in canceling any such policy shall be conclusive and binding upon the undersigned. The undersigned will at any time, either before or after cancellation, upon demand therefor deliver all policies to the Bank. The undersigned hereby authorizes the Bank to pay the net proceeds of this notice, to the named insurance companies, or authorized agents thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b475-9\">. Appellee testified that his delay in payment was in reliance upon Price\u2019s representation that he had \u201cten or maybe thirty days\u201d after the due date to pay the premium, and that \u201cit wasn\u2019t convenient to come any quicker\u201d to Tyler, Texas, and make the cash payment to Price, as the latter suggested.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b475-13\">. This notice of cancellation bore the names of \u201cThomas M. Ryan &amp; Company\u201d and \u201cR. L. Price Insurance Agency\u201d, and stated \u201cthe Policy will be canceled and all liability of (appellant) under said Policy will cease at and from 12:01 A.M. standard time, August 9, 1954, without further notice.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b475-14\">. This letter, dated August 3, 1954, informed appellee that \u201cthe cancellation notice effective August 9, 1954, on above captioned policy has been withdrawn and the policy is now in full force and effect,\u201d and was signed by appellant\u2019s general agent, Thomas M. Ryan &amp; Company, with a notation that a copy was sent to \u201cR. L. Price Insurance Ageney.\u201d Though appellant in brief refers to this letter as \u201creinstating the policy,\u201d actually the policy was then still in full force and effect anyway, since this first attempted cancellation of the policy by its-express terms was not to become effective until August 9, 1954. (Footnote 3, supra.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b476-10\">. Appellee relied also upon certain other indicia of Price\u2019s authority to act for appellant, which he had seen at Price\u2019s office in Tyler, Texas, such as stationery bearing appellant\u2019s letterhead,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b477-6\">. Appellant revoked Price\u2019s agency on August 25th, by mailing the required statutory notice of its cancellation to the Board of Insurance Commissioners at Austin, Texas, but admittedly without any notice of its action to appellee. As heretofore stated, the loss occurred on September 10th, only about two weeks later.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b477-12\">.
