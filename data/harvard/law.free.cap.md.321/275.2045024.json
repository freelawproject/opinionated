(Atlantic), entered into a contract with the State of Maryland for scour protection at the Route 50 bridge in Ocean City, Maryland. The work covered under the contract included, among other things, the placement of stone and rock (riprap) under and adjacent to the bridge, as well as along the bulkhead and shore. Atlantic was responsible for furnishing riprap that met State guidelines and State specifications, as well as for installing it at the Ocean City job site. Pursuant to the \u201cMaryland Little Miller Act,\u201d Maryland Code (1985), State Finance and Procurement Article, \u00a7 13-501,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Atlantic posted a payment bond in the amount of the total contract price with Federal Insurance Company, Co-Petitioner, as its surety.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">On May 12, 1986, Atlantic issued a purchase order for the rock needed for the Route 50 bridge project to Marine Structural Applications, Inc. (MSA). MSA was to deliver the rock to a location in Snow Hill, Maryland, from where Jarmon\u2019s Construction would truck the riprap to the job site <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>in Ocean City. MSA purchased the rock from an approved quarry in Occoquan, Virginia. At that quarry, MSA sorted the riprap according to contract specifications and loaded it onto barges for transport from Occoquan to Snow Hill via the Potomac River, Chesapeake Bay, and Pocomoke River. In delivering the rock to Snow Hill, MSA initially used its own barges and tugboats.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">When one of MSA\u2019s tugboats failed, MSA contracted with the Respondent, Robert Dann Company (Dann), for towing services. From August 11 to August 31, Dann tugged MSA\u2019s barges carrying the riprap from Occoquan to Snow Hill. Dann billed MSA for its services rendered, but MSA never paid. In the fall of 1986, MSA filed for bankruptcy and Dann filed suit for payment under Atlantic\u2019s payment bond for its towing services in the amount of $37,100.00. Atlantic refused to pay Dann\u2019s claim, contending that Dann was not entitled to recover under the Maryland Little Miller Act<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> because MSA, the entity with which Dann had contracted, was an ordinary material suppli\u00e9r and not a subcontractor of Atlantic.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Atlantic filed a motion for summary judgment before trial and made a motion for judgment at trial alleging there was no dispute as to any material fact and that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The trial judge denied the motions and submitted the case to the jury. The court instructed the jurors that if they found that MSA was a subcontractor of Atlantic, then they should find for Dann; but if they found that MSA was an ordinary material supplier of Atlantic, they should find in favor of Atlantic. The jury found that MSA was a subcontractor of Atlantic, and a verdict was returned in favor of Dann.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Upon appeal, the Court of Special Appeals initially noted that the issue of MSA\u2019s status as a subcontractor or materialman should not have been submitted to the jury because \u201cthe evidence failed to generate any material disputed facts____\u201d The intermediate appellate court then held that, even though Dann was a supplier of labor to a materialman, Dann was \u201cnevertheless\u201d entitled to coverage under Atlantic\u2019s payment bond as a matter of law. <em>Atlantic Sea-Con v. Dann Co., </em>80 Md.App. 161, 164, 560 A.2d 592, 593 (1989). We agree that there was no dispute of material facts and that, as a matter of law, MSA was a materialman rather than a subcontractor. We granted certiorari, however, to review the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination that one who supplies labor or materials to a materialman is entitled to the protection of the Little Miller Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The statutory language at issue in this case was found in section 13-501(c) of the State Pin. &amp; Proc. Art., which is now codified at State Pin. &amp; Proc. Art., \u00a7 17-108.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section 13-501(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>\u201c(c) <em>Suits on payment bonds </em>\u2014 Right <em>to </em>institute.\u2014 <em>Every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work provided for in such contract, </em>in respect of which a payment bond or other security is furnished under this section and who has not been paid in full therefor before the expiration of a period of 90 days after the day on which the last of the labor was done or performed by him or material was furnished or supplied by him for which such claim is made, <em>shall have the right to sue on the payment bond </em>or other security for the amount, or balance thereof, unpaid at the time of institution of such suit and to prosecute said action to final judgment and execution for the sum or sums justly due him; <em>provided, however, that any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor of the contractor, or with any sub-subcontractor of the contractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor furnishing said payment bond or other security, shall have a right of action upon the payment bond </em>or other security upon giving written notice to the contractor____\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">As the Court of Special Appeals recognized in its discussion of this language, there are two clauses dealing with who may assert a claim under a Little Miller Act bond. Under the first part of section 13-501(c) (which is now codified at section 17-108(a)), to acquire a lien one must have supplied \u201clabor or material in the prosecution of the work.\u201d The last clause of this statute (which is now codified at section 17-108(b)(l)), however, is susceptible to more than one interpretation. <em>Atlantic Sear-Con, </em>80 Md.App. at 166-67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>560 A.2d at 594-95. It is either a notice requirement or a limitation on who may make a claim on the contractor\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The intermediate appellate court construed the last clause of the Little Miller Act as merely a requirement of notice to the principal contractor by claimants as a prerequisite to collection under the payment bond. <em>Atlantic Sea-Con, </em>80 Md.App. at 168, 560 A.2d at 595. This interpretation deviates from the construction accorded a similar provision contained in the federal Miller Act, 40 U.S.C. \u00a7 270b(a) (1988),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which has been interpreted by the federal courts since 1944 as a limitation restricting the class of persons who have standing to file a claim against a payment bond under the Act. <em>See J. W. Bateson Co. v. United States ex rel. Bd. of Trustees, </em>434 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 873, 55 L.Ed.2d 50 (1978); <em>Clifford F. MacEvoy Co. v. United States, </em>322 U.S. 102, 64 S.Ct. 890, 88 L.Ed. 1163 (1944); <em>U.S. for Use of Morris Const. v. Aetna Cas. Ins., </em>908 F.2d 375 (8th Cir. 1990); <em>United States v. Blount Brothers Construction Co., </em>168 F.Supp. 407 (D.Md.1958). We conclude that the Maryland Legislature, when it patterned the Maryland Little Miller Act after the federal Miller Act in 1959, intended to import the federal judicial interpretation that this provision restricts the class of persons who may claim under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>When the Little Miller Act was adopted in Maryland, it contained the following explanatory preamble:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-4\">\u201cThis Bill is recommended by the Budget and Finance Committee of the Legislative Council following a study of Senate Bill No. 91 which was introduced in 1958 by Senator George B. Rasin. The main purpose of the Bill is to provide greater protection to sub-contractors on contracts awarded by the State____ The present law on this subject, it is pointed out, does not adequately cover sub-sub-contractors. The Bill ... is patterned after the Miller Act which has been enacted by the Congress for the Federal Government and is frequently referred to as a \u2018Little Miller Act.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Legislative Council of Maryland, Report to the General Assembly of 1959, at 17 (1959). We presume the Maryland Legislature was aware that, in the years between 1935 when the federal Miller Act was passed and 1959 when it adopted the Maryland Little Miller Act, the federal Act was the subject of judicial interpretation in the federal courts. <em>See Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Schlossberg, </em>306 Md. 48, 60, 507 A.2d 172, 178 (1986). Certainly, if the Maryland Little Miller Act was \u201cpatterned after\u201d the federal Miller Act, federal authority that existed at the time it was enacted should be persuasive in interpreting the statute. <em>Faulk v. State\u2019s Attorney for Harford Co., </em>299 Md. 493, 506, 474 A.2d 880, 887 (1984). Our conclusion that the last clause is a limitation \u2014 not a notice requirement \u2014 is further bolstered by the fact that in 1988, when the Little Miller Act was last revised, subsection 17-108(a), which grants power to claim under the statute, is expressly made \u201csubject to\u201d subsection 17-108(b)(1), which is the provision we now construe as a limitation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">In order to determine the scope of protection afforded by the Maryland Little Miller Act to those who supply labor or materials to public construction projects, we must resolve two issues. We have resolved the first issue by determin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ing that the Legislature, when it enacted the Little Miller Act, intended to restrict its coverage to persons who contract directly with the contractor, a subcontractor, or a sub-subcontractor. We must now determine how the Legislature intended that we construe the terms \u201csubcontractor\u201d and \u201csub-subcontractor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">At the outset, we should distinguish between \u201cmaterial-man\u201d and \u201csubcontractor.\u201d A meaningful analysis of the Maryland Little Miller Act requires that we emphasize that these two words are not interchangeable. With regard to the federal Miller Act, \u201cthe Supreme Court indicated that the word \u2018subcontractor\u2019 as used in the Miller Act is to be interpreted in its technical sense and was intended by Congress to distinguish a subcontractor from either a laborer or material supplier.\u201d <em>United States, etc. v. Lane Const. Corp., </em>477 F.Supp. 400, 410 (M.D.Pa.1979) (citing <em>MacEvoy). MacEvoy </em>recognized that the framers of the Act \u201chad in mind a clear distinction between subcontractors and materialmen\u201d when they formulated the Miller Act. 322 U.S. at 109, 64 S.Ct. at 894, 88 L.Ed. at 1168. A materialman is \u201c[a] person who has furnished materials or supplies used in the construction or repair of a building, structure, etc.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>881 (5th ed. 1979). Generally, a person supplying labor or materials does so as a result of some sort of contractual relationship. An evaluation of coverage under the Little Miller Act, however, requires a determination of whether that contractual relationship elevates the materialman to the status of a subcontractor. \u201cWhether a person is a materialman or a subcontractor is determined by the nature of his undertaking.\u201d 13 <em>Couch on Insurance 2d, </em>\u00a7 47:239 (rev. ed. 1982). The precise definition of subcontractor will be explored in depth in this opinion. For clarity\u2019s sake, we stress that the word \u201cmaterialman\u201d is used in this opinion as a term of art to denote one who supplies labor or materials but who does not qualify as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Historically, when interpreting the Maryland Little Miller Act, we have analogized the Act with the Maryland mechan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>ics' lien statute, <em>Williams Constr. v. Constr. Equip., </em>253 Md. 60, 67, 251 A.2d 864, 868 (1969); <em>Peerless v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>248 Md. 439, 441, 237 A.2d 15, 17 (1968); <em>Montgomery County v. Glassman, </em>245 Md. 192, 201, 225 A.2d 448, 453-54 (1967), and we have looked to federal cases interpreting the Miller Act for guidance. <em>Ruberoid v. Glassman, </em>248 Md. 97, 106, 234 A.2d 875, 880 (1967); <em>Montgomery County v. Glassman, </em>245 Md. at 202, 225 A.2d at 454. In this case, an analogy of the Little Miller Act to the mechanics\u2019 lien statute is not helpful.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Maryland case law on the issue of whether one who supplies labor or materials to a materialman would be entitled to a mechanics\u2019 lien is sparse. A majority of the states that have decided the issue have held that a material-man of a materialman is not entitled to a mechanics\u2019 lien.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have found one Maryland Court of Appeals case which involves a seemingly remote supplier of materials, <em>5500 Coastal Hwy. v. Elec. Equip. Co., </em>305 Md. 532, 505 A.2d 533 (1986), but this case is not clearly determinative of the issue before us. In <em>Coastal Hwy., </em>two materialmen sought to place mechanics\u2019 liens against a condominium building in Ocean City, Maryland, based on materials they had supplied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>to a modular home builder who assembled the modular units in Delaware and transported them to Maryland for incorporation into the completed structure. In deciding that the materialmen were entitled to a mechanics\u2019 lien, this Court concluded that the \u201cclaims here were for \u2018materials furnished for or about the building____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 540, 505 A.2d at 537. We determined that it was insignificant that the materials were originally delivered in Delaware as long as those materials were ultimately incorporated into the structure. <em>Id. </em>The decision did not rest on a determination of the status of the modular home builder with whom they had dealt as either a materialman or a subcontractor. That was not an issue in the case, and it is not clear from the facts whether the modular home builder was a subcontractor or merely a materialman.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Although the Court of Special Appeals cites <em>London Etc. Indemnity Co. v. State, </em>153 Md. 308, 138 A. 231 (1927), as a Maryland mechanics\u2019 lien case which is analogous to the case at bar, <em>Atlantic Sea-Con, </em>80 Md.App. at 169, 560 A.2d at 596, we do not find <em>London </em>authoritative. The <em>London </em>Court ruled that a hauler of sand and gravel was entitled to sue for services rendered under the general contractor\u2019s bond pursuant to the Maryland Highway Construction Act, but the hauler of sand and gravel in <em>London </em>had a direct contractual relationship with the principal contractor and delivered the material directly to the job site. The relationship was not remote.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">While the public policies underlying the Little Miller Act and the mechanics\u2019 lien statute coincide, the scope of our review must center not on policymaking but on statutory construction of the particular act under consideration. The language of the mechanics\u2019 lien statute differs significantly from the Little Miller Act. As illustrated by <em>Coastal Hwy., </em>a materialman need only show that the materials were supplied \u201cfor or about the building\u201d to secure a mechanics\u2019 lien. Although the Maryland Little Miller Act provides coverage to those who supply labor or materials \u201cin the prosecution of the work,\u201d it contains additional language, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>absent from the mechanics\u2019 lien statute, which had been interpreted at the time the Little Miller Act was enacted to restrict the class of persons eligible for its protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Whereas Maryland mechanics\u2019 lien law is unenlightening in this case, federal authority interpreting the federal Miller Act is not only instructive, it is persuasive. The class of persons protected by the federal Miller Act has been well settled since 1944, long before the Maryland Legislature modeled the Little Miller Act after it. In <em>MacEvoy, </em>the Supreme Court held that, under the Miller Act, a person supplying materials to a materialman or a government contractor cannot recover on the payment bond executed by the contractor. The Court stated that, although \u201c[ostensibly the payment bond is for the protection of \u2018all persons supplying labor and material in the prosecution of the work\u2019 and \u2018every person who has furnished labor or material in the prosecution of the work\u2019 is given the right to sue on such payment bond,\u201d it could not disregard the limitations imposed by section 270b(a) (which is analogous to our section 17-108(b)(l)). <em>MacEvoy, </em>322 U.S. at 107, 64 S.Ct. at 893, 88 L.Ed. at 1167. Writing for the Court, Justice Murphy stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\">\u201cThe proviso of [\u00a7 270b(a) of the Miller Act], ... makes clear that the right to bring suit on a payment bond is limited to (1) those materialmen, laborers and subcontractors who deal directly with the prime contractor and (2) those materialmen, laborers and subcontractors who, lacking express or implied contractual relationship with the prime contractor, have direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor and who give the statutory notice of their claims to the prime contractor. To allow those in more remote relationships to recover on the bond would be contrary to the clear language of the proviso and to the expressed will of the framers of the Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 64 S.Ct. at 894, 88 L.Ed. at 1168; <em>see also Morris Const., </em>908 F.2d at 377. The <em>MacEvoy </em>Court was persuaded by its recognition that any other interpretation \u201cwould lead to the absurd result of requiring notice from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>persons in direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor but not from more remote claimants.\u201d 322 U.S. at 108, 64 S.Ct. at 894, 88 L.Ed. at 1168.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">In interpreting the reach of the statute, <em>MacEvoy </em>defined \u201csubcontractor\u201d based upon the \u201cmore technical meaning, as established by usage in the building trades,\u201d as \u201cone who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract, thus excluding ordinary laborers and material-men.\u201d 322 U.S. at 108-09, 64 S.Ct. at 894, 88 L.Ed. at 1168. The Supreme Court declined to apply the \u201cbroad, generic\u201d definition that \u201ca subcontractor includes anyone who has a contract to furnish labor or material to the prime contractor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d was further clarified by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Morris Const.:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">\u201cWhen considered together, <em>Bateson, MacEvoy, </em>and <em>[F.D. Rich Co. v. United States ex rel. Industrial Lumber Co., </em>417 U.S. 116, 94 S.Ct. 2157, 40 L.Ed.2d 703 (1974)] stand for the proposition that a company is a subcontractor if: (1) it has contracted to supply labor or material to the prime contractor; and (2) it plays a sufficiently substantial role in the construction project that the general contractor could have negotiated to have the subcontractor assume the risk of the subcontractor\u2019s default.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Morris Const., </em>908 F.2d at 377. According to this refinement \u201cone who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract,\u201d as described in <em>MacEvoy, </em>must play a \u201csubstantial role\u201d in the construction project to qualify as a subcontractor.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u201cPractical considerations\u201d also concerned the Supreme Court in <em>MacEvoy, </em>which found that many \u201cordinary\u201d materialmen, including retailers, wholesalers or manufacturers, are involved in large projects, and thus they in turn deal with innumerable sub-materialmen. \u201cTo impose unlimited liability under the payment bond to those sub-materialmen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>and laborers is to create a precarious and perilous risk on the prime contractor and his surety. To sanction such a risk requires clear language in the statute and in the bond so as to leave no alternative.\u201d 322 U.S. at 111, 64 S.Ct. at 895, 88 L.Ed. at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">Other federal cases applying the <em>MacEvoy </em>rationale include <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Company v. United States, </em>382 F.2d 615 (5th Cir.1967) (supplier of materialman had no standing to sue on Miller Act payment bond); <em>United States v. Lembke Construction Company, </em>370 F.2d 293 (10th Cir.1966) (supplier of materialman could not recover under prime contractor\u2019s bond); <em>Eastern Indus. Marketing v. Desco Elec.

Wright Contracting Company, </em>194 F.Supp. 444 (D.Md.1961) (trucking company that delivered concrete to job site for concrete supplier could not recover under Miller Act payment bond). <em>See also </em>10 Appleman, <em>Insurance Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 5877 (rev. ed. 1981); 13 <em>Couch on Insurance 2d </em>\u00a7 47:251 (rev. ed. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">In reviewing the history and legislative intent of the Maryland Little Miller Act, the Court of Special Appeals traced the history of Maryland\u2019s public works statute which required contractors on public works projects to post a bond and bind themselves to pay all just debts for labor and materials incurred in the construction. <em>Atlantic Sea-Con, </em>80 Md.App. at 168, 560 A.2d at 595. The court concluded that the legislative purpose of this requirement was to secure laborers and materialmen on public projects who otherwise were not protected against insolvent contractors under the lien laws. <em>Id. </em>at 169, 560 A.2d at 596. While we agree that the object of the Maryland Little Miller Act and its predecessors is to protect laborers and materialmen on public projects, that protection is not without limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>We recognize that the Maryland Little Miller Act was designed to afford greater protection to sub-subcontractors, who were not covered at the time either under the prevailing Maryland bond statute or under the federal Miller Act. Indeed, the only significant deviation of the Maryland statute from the federal Miller Act was the addition of the words \u201cor with any sub-subcontractor of the contractor\u201d in Md.Code (1985), State Fin. &amp; Proc. Art, \u00a7 13-501(c). We are not convinced, however, that this extension of the Little Miller Act\u2019s protection to persons contracting with \u201csub-subcontractors\u201d indicates a legislative scheme to expand its scope by redefining subcontractors in the \u201cbroad, generic sense\u201d rejected by the Supreme Court in <em>MacEvoy. </em>In the words of the statute, a \u201cdirect contractual relationship with a subcontractor of the contractor, or with any sub-subcontractor of the contractor\u201d is required. Md.Code (1985), State Fin. &amp; Proc. Art., \u00a7 13-501(c). To apply a broad, generic definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d or \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d would render the words \u201cdirect contractual relationship\u201d nugatory. We also do not believe that the wording of the preamble, that the \u201cmain purpose of the Bill is to provide greater protection to sub-contractors on contracts awarded by the State,\u201d is intended by the Legislature to broaden its protection to cover remote suppliers of labor and materials to materialmen. The next sentence specifically states, \u201cThe present law on this subject, it is pointed out, does not adequately cover sub-sub-contractors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\">There are several reasons why we think it would be inappropriate to utilize the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d contained in the mechanics\u2019 lien statute in interpreting the Little Miller Act. The Legislature, when it enacted the Little Miller Act, did not express an intent that it should coincide exactly with the mechanics\u2019 lien statute. While we recognize that both statutes have a similar purpose, their wording significantly differs. When the Little Miller Act was adopted in 1959, the mechanics\u2019 lien statute did not define \u201csubcontractor.\u201d Nor was there a definitive body of law that would permit one who supplies labor or materials <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>to a mere materialman to recover under the Maryland mechanics\u2019 lien statute. There was at the time authoritative case law defining \u201csubcontractor\u201d in the context of the federal Miller Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">In declaring that the Little Miller Act was patterned after the federal Miller Act, we believe the Legislature acknowledged the intent of Congress to distinguish between subcontractors and materialmen. We decline to apply the broad definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d contemplated by the mechanics\u2019 lien statute because that definition precludes this distinction. We note that, in 1958, the United States District Court for the District of Maryland decided <em>Blount Brothers, </em>which held that \u201cThe relationship between a <em>sub-sub-</em>subcontractor and a swAsubcontractor is one of the 'more remote relationships\u2019 referred to by the House Committee and by the Supreme Court in <em>MacEvoy </em>as not coming within the coverage of the bond.\u201d 168 F.Supp. at 410 (emphasis in original). The Maryland Legislature apparently sought to give additional protection to sub-subcontractors in response to this decision. We believe that they were equally aware that the Supreme Court\u2019s prior decisions interpreting the language analogous to that used in the Maryland Act did not give protection to \u201csub-materialmen\u201d who supply labor or materials to materialmen.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">There are practical reasons why the Legislature might want to give protection to those who furnish labor or materials to a subcontractor or a sub-subcontractor but not to those who furnish labor or materials to a materialman. The general contractor has more control over subcontractors and sub-subcontractors who perform a specific portion of the original contract than over mere materialmen. It also would be easier for the contractor to secure a bond from a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor than it would be to secure a bond from a materialman to assure that all suppliers of labor and materials have been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">If the legislators\u2019 purpose was to eliminate the distinction between subcontractors and materialmen recognized in <em>MacEvoy, </em>it could have been so stated. Instead, the Legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>lature\u2019s only modification of the law was to specifically extend its protection to sub-subcontractors and those who contract with sub-subcontractors. We note that in 1976, when the definition of \u201csubcontractor\u201d was added to the mechanics\u2019 lien statute, the Legislature rejected the restrictive definition of \u201csubcontractors\u201d as those who contract with \u201ca contractor or with another subcontractor\u201d in favor of the more expansive definition as those who contract with \u201canyone except the owner or his agent.\u201d Chapter 349, \u00a7 3 of the Laws of 1976. When the Little Miller Act was revised in 1988, no substantive change was made with regard to the class of persons entitled to its protection. Md.Code (1985, 1988 Repl.Vol.), State Fin. &amp; Proc. Art., \u00a7 17-108, Revisor\u2019s Note. Although language was added in 1988 defining the term \u201csupplier,\u201d the terms \u201csubcontractor\u201d and \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d remain undefined. Ch. 48, \u00a7 2 of the Laws of 1988. We do not believe that the Legislature intended that \u201csupplier\u201d and \u201csubcontractor\u201d and \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d be synonymous.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">In the context of the federal Miller Act, the Supreme Court defined \u201csubcontractor\u201d as \u201cone who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract.\u201d <em>MacEvoy, </em>322 U.S. at 109, 64 S.Ct. at 894, 88 L.Ed. at 1168. As previously discussed, this definition prevailed in the case law existing at the time our Legislature patterned the Maryland Little Miller Act after the federal Act. We think it likely that, in adding the words \u201cor with any sub-subcontractor of the contractor,\u201d the Legislature intended that the terms \u201csubcontractor\u201d and \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d be defined consistently, the distinction being the prefix. The prefix \u201csub\u201d is defined as \u201cunder, beneath, below ... lower in rank, position, or importance than; inferior or subordinate to ... so as to form a division into smaller or less important parts____\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s New World Dictionary </em>1416 (2d ed. 1974). Thus, if a \u201csubcontractor\u201d is \u201cone who performs for and takes from the prime contractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the original contract,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>then a \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d is one who performs for and takes from the subcontractor a specific part of the labor or material requirements of the subcontract.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Our interpretation expands the scope of the Little Miller Act protection beyond that of the federal Miller Act as the Legislature intended but still excludes remote relationships. A contractual lineage to the owner must be demonstrated, that is, a subcontractor or sub-subcontractor must fall within the contractual chain directly leading to the owner. Under the federal Miller Act, the chain extends from the owner to the primary contractor to the subcontractor. Under the Maryland Little Miller Act, a link has been added so that the chain consists of the owner, the primary contractor, the subcontractor, and the sub-subcontractor. Protection is provided only to those who supply labor or materials directly to a link in the chain, <em>i.e., </em>to a contractor, subcontractor or sub-subcontractor. Those who supply labor or materials to a mere materialman are not protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">To further extend the protection of the Maryland Little Miller Act to those who supply materials or labor to mere materialmen could broaden the reach of the statute <em>ad infinitum. </em>For example, suppose that a primary contractor purchases materials for use in a public project from a hardware store and the hardware store later files a petition for bankruptcy: The broad interpretation of the Little Miller Act urged by Dann might allow manufacturers, wholesalers, or other intermediary suppliers to claim under the payment bond if they furnished inventory to the hardware store and if they could trace that inventory to the public project. Further, a common carrier who delivered the materials to the hardware store might be covered. We do not believe the Legislature intended that the Little Miller Act should have so broad a sweep.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">To summarize, we presume that the Legislature was cognizant, when it enacted and later revised the Maryland Little Miller Act, of the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the Miller Act in <em>MacEvoy </em>to protect only persons dealing directly with the primary contractor or its subcontractors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>defined in the technical sense and not in the broad, generic sense. We find no evidence of intent either in Maryland legislative history or in prior Maryland case law to deviate from the federal interpretation of this definition. We further believe that the term \u201csub-subcontractor\u201d should be defined consistently with this definition of \u201csubcontractor.\u201d For these reasons, in construing the Maryland Little Miller Act in this case, we will look to the federal Miller Act decisions for guidance.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We hold that the portion of the Maryland Little Miller Act which states, \u201cthat any person having direct contractual relationship with a subcontractor of the contractor, or with any sub-subcontractor of the contractor but no contractual relationship express or implied with the contractor ... shall have a right of action upon the payment bond,\u201d is a standing requirement that restricts the protection of the payment bond to those who supply materials or labor to the primary contractor, its subcontractor, or its sub-subcontractor. The relationship of a supplier of labor or materials to a mere materialman is too remote to collect under the principal contractor\u2019s bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">MSA\u2019s status as a subcontractor or a materialman is dispositive of this case. <em>United States v. Wright Contracting Company, supra, </em>is persuasive on the issue of MSA\u2019s status as either a subcontractor or materialman. In <em>Wright, </em>the United States District Court for the District of Maryland addressed the issue of whether a trucking company that delivered concrete products to a job site on behalf of a materialman was entitled to protection under the contractor\u2019s Miller Act bond. The court held that \u201cthe critical point to be decided is whether, in all the circumstances of the case, the Prestressed Company [the concrete supplier] can properly be considered as a subcontractor or was only a supplier of materials.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>194 F.Supp. at 446. In determining that Prestressed Company (Prestressed) was not a subcontractor, the court considered a number of factors: (1) the amount paid to Prestressed was small in relation to the total amount paid for the entire project; (2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>Prestressed was paid in full long before the end of the project (unlike subcontractors from whom a portion is usually withheld until the completion of the job); (3) Prestressed was not asked to supply a payment bond; .(4) Prestressed was not designated as a subcontractor in accordance with the terms of the prime contractor\u2019s contract with the state; (5) neither Prestressed nor the trucking company seeking to claim under the bond performed any work on the job or at the job site; (6) certified copies of payrolls were not submitted as generally required of subcontractors on government projects; (7) sales tax was paid on the materials supplied; (8) the purchase order was not in the form generally used for a subcontract; (9) payment was required on the basis of monthly requisitions for materials delivered. With regard to the contention that Prestressed was a subcontractor because it was required to conform the materials supplied to the specifications of the government project, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">\u201cin orders for material required by Government specifications it is necessary that the materials incorporated into the job by the prime contractor must, of course, conform to the specifications and therefore the reference to the specifications in the proposal and purchase order is merely descriptive of what is to be furnished. Such a description is necessary whether the supplier is a subcontractor or only a material supplier. It does not of itself make the supplier a subcontractor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">As stated at the outset, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 determination that no disputed issues of material fact existed regarding MSA\u2019s status as a material supplier. Where the facts are not in dispute, as is the case here, the court must engage in a legal analysis in reaching a conclusion as to whether a party is a subcontractor or a materialman under the Little Miller Act. <em>See Morris Const., </em>908 F.2d at 378. Testimony adduced at trial indicates that MSA did nothing other than furnish Atlantic with the riprap necessary for the project. The fact that it may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>have expended labor in obtaining rock which met certain specifications and delivering it to the destination point is not sufficient to distinguish it as a subcontractor under the technical definition propounded in <em>MacEvoy. Wright, </em>194 F.Supp. at 447. MSA\u2019s relationship with the prime contractor arose from a purchase order. It did not perform any work at the job site. MSA charged sales tax on the price of the riprap. Although MSA billed Atlantic separately for the \u201cfreight and unloading,\u201d testimony adduced at trial indicates that this separate billing for services was done not because MSA was a subcontractor but merely to avoid paying sales tax on that portion of the cost. We note the charge for freight and unloading is based on tonnage and not on time expended, which is the customary method of billing for services. MSA did not furnish a subcontractor\u2019s performance bond or file certified copies of its payroll as required of subcontractors by the terms of the contract. Nor was MSA included in Atlantic\u2019s list of subcontractors as required by the State; although, Jarmon\u2019s Construction, which transported the rock from the delivery point and placed it at the job site, was identified as a subcontractor. For these reasons, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals that this issue should not have been submitted to a jury and that MSA was a materialman. <em>See also Lembke Construction Company, </em>370 F.2d at 295-96 (\u201cAll Adams did was deliver concrete. Admittedly, he was to deliver all the concrete needed for the job and the concrete had to conform to the specifications in the prime contract. This does not, however, change Adams\u2019 status from a material-man to a subcontractor\u201d); <em>Brown &amp; Root, Inc. v. Gifford-Hill &amp; Company, </em>319 F.2d 65, 66 (5th Cir.1963) (company that, under agreement to supply sand and gravel needs on public project, purchased sand and gravel from third party and delivered it to job site was \u201cno more than a material-man ... as distinguished from a subcontractor, and that the benefits of the Miller Act were unavailable\u201d to it); <em>Northwest Roads Co. v. Clyde Equipment Co., </em>79 F.2d 771 (9th Cir.1935) (where \u201ccontractors entered into agreements with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>third persons requiring the latter to furnish the gravel, but to take no other part in the construction,\u201d the third persons were mere materialmen and not subcontractors).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">We hold that because Dann merely furnished labor to a materialman, it is not entitled to the protection of the Little Miller Act for the reasons stated in this opinion. A surety should not be held liable to one who merely provides a materialman\u2019s mode of delivery. Such a remote relationship is precisely what <em>MacEvoy </em>refused to sanction as a \u201cprecarious and perilous risk on the prime contractor and his surety.\u201d 322 U.S. at 111, 64 S.Ct. at 895, 88 L.Ed. at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
