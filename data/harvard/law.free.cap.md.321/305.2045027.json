Resolution of the issue controls which of two compensation insurers is on the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The claimant, Janet Guy (Guy), was employed by Lettering Unlimited. She was awarded temporary total disability for the period October 31, 1987, to January 14, 1988, by the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Commission (the Commission). The Commission found that Guy sustained an occupational disease, that the date of last injurious exposure was October 30, 1987, and the first date of disablement was October 31,1987. West American Insurance Company (West American) ceased being Lettering Unlimited\u2019s compensation insurer on October 27, 1987, and Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>Co. (Hartford) went on the risk on October 28. Accordingly, the Commission dismissed Guy\u2019s claim against West American and entered the award against Lettering Unlimited and Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">The employer and Hartford appealed to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that Guy had suffered an accidental injury or, if the condition was an occupational disease, that the date of last injurious exposure was prior to October 28. Were Hartford successful on either contention, West American would be responsible for' Guy\u2019s benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The action was tried without a jury. At the close of Hartford\u2019s case, West American moved for judgment which the circuit court granted. It acted pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-519(b): \u201cWhen a defendant moves for judgment at the close of the evidence offered by the plaintiff in an action tried by the court, the court may proceed, as the trier of fact, to determine the facts and to render judgment against the plaintiff____\u201d In so ruling the court observed that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s testimony from Ms. Guy that she had this [painful condition] ... she was suffering with it before. This wasn\u2019t some unexpected result out of her normal employment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The employer and Hartford appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. We issued the writ of certiorari on our own motion prior to consideration of the case by that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Hartford\u2019s principal contention is that Guy\u2019s disability was produced by her performing intensively, over a period of two weeks, a silk screening process. Hartford submits that this period of work was so unusual that the disability should be classified as an accidental injury. West American contends that, throughout Guy\u2019s employment at Lettering Unlimited, silk screening had been a task which Guy was called upon periodically to perform so that the injury was not \u201caccidental.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">Our task is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings were clearly erroneous. Inasmuch as judgment was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>tered pursuant to the above-quoted provisions of Rule 2-519(b), \u201cthe trial judge was allowed to evaluate the evidence, <em>as though he were the jury, </em>and to draw his own conclusions as to the evidence presented, the inferences arising therefrom, and the credibility of the witnesses testifying.\u201d <em>Pahanish v. Western Trails, Inc., </em>69 Md.App. 342, 353, 517 A.2d 1122, 1127 (1986). The fact-finding aspect of Rule 2-519(b) applied here is derived from Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b). In reviewing judgments entered under that aspect of Rule 41(b) federal appellate courts apply the clearly erroneous standard. <em>See Wilson v. United States, </em>645 F.2d 728 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Shull v. Dain, Kalman &amp; Quail, Inc., </em>561 F.2d 152 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 1086, 98 S.Ct. 1281, 55 L.Ed.2d 792 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Three witnesses, Guy, her attending physician, and Hartford\u2019s examining physician testified in the circuit court. We summarize the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Guy, then age twenty, began work for Lettering Unlimited in 1980. After the first year or two her primary duties were to do personalized machine embroidery on jackets and silk screening on tee shirts. She was an \u201call-round person\u201d capable of doing any of the tasks in the shop. Because embroidering required more skill, that was Guy\u2019s predominant task.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">The silk screening process, as described by Guy, involves applying ink through a screen onto a shirt. The shirt is first held in place on a flat surface by \u201ca metal thing\u201d and a screen is pulled down on top of that. \u201cYou put ink at the top of the screen with a spatula, and you take both hands and you have to push down and pull back as hard as you can at the same time to make the squeegee flex and pull the ink through the screen to go onto the shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Silk screening was something which Guy was asked to do on an ongoing, although somewhat unpredictable, basis. She would do \u201ca job here and a job there in [her] spare time,\u201d or when there was a great demand for silk screening, or when the shop was short staffed.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Beginning several years before 1987, Guy had had problems with her left hand, consisting of soreness in the fingers and \u201ca little bit of discomfort and pain up into [her] elbow.\u201d The condition only arose when she worked <em>\u201ca </em>lot.\u201d It would go away after resting, for example, after resting over the weekend.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">In August 1987, Guy returned to work following a three month maternity leave. Lettering Unlimited had insufficient personnel to perform silk screening, and Guy was exclusively assigned to silk screening for two consecutive weeks. She had never before done so much silk screening on a continuous basis. Following that stint she experienced extreme pain and swelling in her right hand and soreness and pain in her left hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">On October 12, 1987, Guy saw her family physician, Dr. Robert P. Kroopnick. He suspected bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, but his working diagnosis was sprain of the right wrist. He recommended that Guy discontinue working, take an anti-inflammatory medicine and return in two weeks if the condition were not improved.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Guy nevertheless continued working through October 30, 1987. On October 26 she again saw Dr. Kroopnick. From various tests he concluded that surgery was probably required. He apparently embodied that opinion in a note dated October 30 explaining why Guy would thereafter be absent from work. Guy underwent a right carpal tunnel release in November 1987. A similar operation was performed on her left hand in October 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">\u201cIn this State ... the failure of some essential function of the body[] is held to be accidental injury only when it results from some unusual strain or exertion of the employee or some unusual condition in the employment.\u201d <em>Kelly-Springfield Tire Co. v. Daniels, </em>199 Md. 156, 161, 85 A.2d 795, 797-98 (1952). And <em>see Courtney v. Board of Trustees, </em>285 Md. 356, 363, 402 A.2d 885, 889 (1979) (analogizing statutes authorizing payment of accidental disability retirement benefits to accidental injury under workers\u2019 com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>pensation statute). \u201c[I]n Maryland the term \u2018accidental injury\u2019 does not include unexpected results not produced by accidental causes____\u201d <em>Bethlehem Steel Co. v. Golombieski, </em>231 Md. 124, 129, 188 A.2d 923, 926 (1963). In the case at hand silk screening was part of Guy\u2019s regular duties, not simply as a matter of job description, but by actual performance. Although the two week stint in August was the longest continuous time during which Guy performed that task, the circuit court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the disability was the result of an occupational disease as opposed to an accidental injury.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Hartford emphasizes <em>Foble v. Knefely, </em>176 Md. 474, 6 A.2d 48 (1939) and <em>Holbrook v. GM Assembly Division, General Motors Corp., </em>15 Md.App. 425, 291 A.2d 171 (1972). In <em>Foble </em>the claimant was a sewing machine operator in a shirt factory. The needle on the sewing machine typically was raised and lowered by a lever controlled by pressure applied by the operator\u2019s knee. The lever on the machine operated by the claimant was defective. Among other defects a plate, adjustable on the lever rod to the height of the operator\u2019s knee, had turned so that the claimant was pressing her knee against the set screw. This Court affirmed a circuit court judgment holding that the claimant had suffered an accidental injury. R. Gilbert &amp; R. Humphreys, Jr., <em>Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation Handbook </em>\u00a7 5.1, at 84-85 (1988) have commented on <em>Foble.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\u201cIt appears that some students of the [Maryland Workers\u2019 Compensation] Act accept the above facts as standing for the proposition that injury caused by repetitive trauma constitutes a compensable claim. This notion is mistaken and subverts the actual basis of the decision by the Court of Appeals. A thorough review of <em>Foble </em>dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>closes that the knee lever which caused the injury was defective____ It was the <em>additional </em>trauma created by the machine\u2019s fault which made the injury an accidental one. Nowhere within the opinion did the Court of Appeals hold that injury caused by repetitive but ordinary, usual or expectable trauma could provide the basis for a compensable accidental injury. While ordinary or usual job-related repetitive trauma cannot predicate a claim for accidental injury, it might form the basis for an occupational disease claim.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">(Footnotes omitted). We agree with the authors\u2019 analysis of <em>Foble.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\"><em>Holbrook v. GM Assembly Division </em>involved an automobile assembly line worker, the circumstances of whose job had changed. For some years the worker had performed his task seated on a stool. Apparently in order to expedite the performance, the employer directed the claimant to work in a kneeling position. Knee pads were provided which bit into the claimant\u2019s legs when his knees were bent and the skin on the claimant\u2019s knees was irritated from friction with the pad. Guy\u2019s claim does not involve any change of circumstances in the silk screening technique.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Hartford also argues that the day of last injurious exposure, by which Hartford means of silk screening by Guy, must be earlier than October 28 because Dr. Kroopnick recommended on October 12 that Guy not work. But there is testimony by Guy as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">\u201cQ. Well, specifically on that date, October 28, 1987, if you recall doing any silk screening on that date[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-10\">\u201cA. Maybe forty-five minutes for each job.\u201d Decisions of the Commission are prima facie correct, and the burden of proof is upon the party attacking the Commission\u2019s decision. Md.Gode (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol.), Art. 101, \u00a7 56(c). To the extent that Guy\u2019s testimony was ambiguous, it was Hartford\u2019s obligation to clarify the same. The circuit court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the last day of injurious exposure was the last day of work by Guy at Lettering Unlimited.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\">. Carpal tunnel syndrome has been recognized as an occupational disease in other contexts in recent Maryland case law. <em>See Miller v. Western Elec. Co., </em>310 Md. 173, 528 A.2d 486 (1987); <em>James v. General Motors Corp., </em>74 Md.App. 479, 538 A.2d 782 (1988). At no point did appellants argue that Guy\u2019s medical difficulties were neither an accidental injury nor an occupational disease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
