Judgments were entered on the convictions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>merits. <em>Browne v. State, </em>No. 951, September Term, 1989, filed 15 February 1990, unreported. We granted Browne\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. The question presented is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-W\">Can a conviction for involuntary manslaughter support a conviction under Article 27, \u00a7 36B(d) for use of a handgun \u201cin the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">The answer is \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">Md.Code (1957, 1987 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d) declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">Any person who shall use a handgun or an antique firearm capable of being concealed on the person in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article, shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor and on conviction thereof shall, in addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">Art. 27, \u00a7 441(e), defining the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d expressly excludes involuntary manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">Browne concedes that involuntary manslaughter is a felony but argues that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-10\">the Legislature, by incorporating the specific statutory language of \u00a7 441 into \u00a7 36B(d), intended to exclude \u201cinvoluntary manslaughter\u201d as a predicate \u201ccrime\u201d under \u00a7 36B(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-11\"><em>State v. Vincent, </em>321 Md. 313, 582 A.2d 1220 (1990) is dispositive. We found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-12\">The language of [\u00a7 36B(d)] and the legislative intent reflected therein, are clear. <em>Any </em>felony, without excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>tion, qualifies as a predicate crime for purposes of the \u00a7 36B(d) handgun offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-4\"><em>Vincent, </em>at 321, 582 A.2d at 1224. Judge Eldridge, speaking for the Court, reviewed our opinion in <em>Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 416 A.2d 265 (1980), <em>cert. denied and appeal dismissed, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981). He declared:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">In sum, when one uses a handgun in the commission of an offense which is a felony under Maryland law, that person has also violated Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), regardless of whether the underlying offense is also a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 441. As the statutory language and the <em>Whack </em>case make clear, \u00a7 36B(d)\u2019s reference to \u201ccrimefs] of violence as defined in \u00a7 441\u201d was solely for the purpose of indicating which misdemeanors should also be encompassed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\"><em>Vincent, </em>at 323, 582 A.2d at 1225.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED;</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b646-14\">. Indictment no. 87-2082, filed 8 December 1987, charged Browne with murder in the first degree by the 1st count and with the use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence by the 2nd count. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>On 14 September 1988 another indictment, no. 88-1811, was filed charging him with the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The predicate crime with respect to each handgun offense was the homicide charged in the first indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-14\">The jury found Browne guilty of involuntary manslaughter under the 1st count of indictment no. 87-2082, not guilty of the handgun offense charged in the 2nd count of that indictment, and guilty of the handgun offense charged in indictment no. 88-1811.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
