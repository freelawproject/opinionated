Miller, <em>Ghost Hunting: Finding Legislative Intent in Maryland, A Check List of Sources </em>(October 1984) (unpublished manuscript available in the Maryland State Law Library). The guidelines for statutory construction were set out by Judge Adkins speaking for the Court in <em>Morris v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>319 Md. 597, 573 A.2d 1346 (1990):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">There is no doubt that the beginning point of statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. Obviously, \u201c \u2018what the legislature has written in an effort to achieve a goal is a natural ingredient of analysis to determine that goal.\u2019 \u201d When we look at the statutory language, we attempt to give effect to all the words in the statute. And sometimes it may not be necessary to go further than the scrutiny of statutory language, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>the language itself may be sufficiently expressive of the legislative purpose or goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b536-5\">But our endeavor is always to seek out the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished, the evils to be redressed by a particular enactment. In the conduct of that enterprise, we are not limited to study of the statutory language. The plain meaning rule \u201c \u2018is not a complete, all-sufficient rule for ascertaining a legislative intention____\u2019\u201d The \u201cmeaning of the plainest language\u201d is controlled by the context in which it appears. Thus, we always are free to look at the context within which statutory language appears. Even when the words of a statute carry a definite meaning, we are not \u201cprecluded from consulting legislative history as part of the process of determining the legislative purpose or goal\u201d of the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 603-604, 573 A.2d 1346 (citations and footnote omitted). <em>See Franklin Square Hosp. v. Laubach, </em>318 Md. 615, 619-620, 569 A.2d 693 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\n<em>The Construction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">When the statutes are considered in the light of the guidelines, the legislative scheme shines bright and clear. Governmental rights and obligations in juvenile causes are rationed between the Judiciary Department and the Executive Department. When a juvenile petition filed by a State\u2019s Attorney alleges that a child has committed a delinquent act, the court must determine whether the allegation has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. CJ \u00a7 3 \u2014 819(b)(1); Md.Rule 914(e)(1). If the allegation has been duly proved, the court may commit the child to the custody of DJS, and, in doing so, may designate the type of facility where the child is to be accommodated. The court may not, however, designate a specific facility; such designation is the prerogative of DJS.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">This view is entirely consistent with the rights and obligations of DJS and its Secretary. It is difficult to perceive how the functions of DJS could be properly fulfilled if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>could not control the monies appropriated to it or which otherwise came into its hands. The 3-year Plan which the Secretary was required to develop, revise, and submit to the Legislature each calendar year would be thrown into utter disarray if the Secretary were obliged to spend the Department\u2019s funds as dictated by a court. The estimate of the needs of the various areas of services would be meaningless, and establishment of priorities for the different services needed would be futile if the funds allocated for such needs were expended without the Secretary\u2019s control. We take into account that it is DJS, not the court, which is charged with administration of the State juvenile, diagnostic, training, detention, and rehabilitation institutions. DJS could not properly administer these institutions if it could not control the monies to be spent on them, nor could it adequately fulfill the other obligations assigned to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Whether DJS has funds available to support a child in a private facility or could tap some source to obtain such funds, begs the question. It may well determine that the monies would be better spent elsewhere to serve the purposes clearly announced by the legislature. It is evident on the face of the statutes that such a determination rests with DJS. As we have seen, it is the DJS which is authorized by the Legislature to designate \u201cany public or private agency or organization in this State\u201d and to spend funds \u201c[t]o aid that agency or to buy services from it ...\u201d or, \u201c[i]f adequate services are not available in this State, to buy services from any agency or organization outside this State.\u201d Code, Art. 83C \u00a7 2-114. The plain language of the statute places these matters within the sound discretion of DJS. There is no indication, expressed or implied, that the discretion may be exercised by a court or any other agency, entity, or person.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">The Juvenile Causes Act authorizes the court to commit a delinquent child to the custody of DJS and permits it, upon such commitment, to designate \u201cthe type of facility where the child is to be accommodated.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-820(c)(l)(ii). But <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>it does not go so far as to permit the court to designate the specific facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The short of it is that the language of the statutes in the context in which it appears, considered with the legislative purpose, the general aim or policy, the ends to be accomplished and the evils to be redressed by the enactments, lead inevitably to the conclusion that the Legislature intended that the particular facility in which a delinquent child may be placed is within the exclusive discretion of DJS.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The history of what is now CJ \u00a7 3-820(c) supports this view. Prior to 1986, the court was empowered under then \u00a7 3-820(b)(2) to</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">[c]ommit the child to the custody or under the guardianship of the Juvenile Services Administration [now DJS], a local department of social services, the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, or a public or licensed private agency____</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In the wake of a decision of this Court, <em>In re Appeal No. 653, Term 1975, </em>277 Md. 212, 352 A.2d 845 (1976), and two decisions of the Court of Special Appeals, <em>Dep\u2019t of Health v. Prince George\u2019s Co., </em>47 Md.App. 436, 423 A.2d 589 (1980), <em>cert. denied sub nom. Tom and June G. v. Dept. of Health, </em>290 Md. 714 (1981), and <em>In re George G., </em>64 Md.App. 70, 494 A.2d 247 (1985), which indicated that the court was not authorized under the statute to mandate the terms of a child\u2019s commitment to DJS, a spate of bills was introduced in the 1986 General Assembly. The question concerning the authority to designate a specific facility resulted in a compromise reflected in the present statute. The statute, as we have seen, permits the court to name the type of facility but generally bestows no authority on the court to specify a particular facility. The compromise was encouraged in significant part by the hope that it would avoid constitutional considerations. <em>See </em>SB 348, SB 661, HB 500, HB 635, all 1986. <em>See also </em>the fiscal note and the revised fiscal note of the Division of Fiscal Research to SB 348; the position memoranda of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene regarding SB 348, HB 500, and HB 635 presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the respective Senate and House Committees; the position statement from the Baltimore County Department of Fiscal Services to. the Baltimore County Legislative Liaison Office dated 11 February 1986; position statement from the Baltimore County Office of Law dated 27 February 1986; letter from the Attorney General to the Executive Assistant to the Governor dated 21 January 1986 regarding HB 500; letter from the Attorney General to the Governor dated 23 May 1986 regarding HB 635 and SB 348.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">STATEMENT OF THE CASES SUB JUDICE</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The three cases before us traveled the same path to this Court. In each of them, upon petition of the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City, the court adjudicated the named child to be delinquent. Upon a disposition hearing in each case, the court, by means of an identically-worded printed form entitled \u201cOrder for Commitment of Juvenile,\u201d committed the child over the signature of the presiding judge, \u201cto the care and custody of the Maryland Department of Juvenile Services.\u201d It further ordered that the child \u201cbe delivered to the appropriate Maryland Department of Juvenile Services facility.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> At the bottom of each form, however, there appeared in handwriting over the signature of the judge, the flat command, \u201cRespondent to be placed at the Glen Mills School.\u201d Glen Mills School is a private facility located in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">\n<em>Demetrius</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The inception of the command of the court to place Demetrius in the Glen Mills School occurred when the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>master who conducted the child\u2019s adjudication hearing ordered DJS to make an investigation and render a report for the disposition of the child. Specifically, DJS was ordered to refer Demetrius for possible placement in Glen Mills or in the Department\u2019s Youth Centers.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The indicated referrals were made by a juvenile counselor,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and Demetrius was accepted by both facilities. At the disposition hearing, however, a juvenile counselor informed the court that DJS could not place Demetrius in Glen Mills because of a lack of funds. Despite requests by an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney and Demetrius\u2019 counsel to place the child in Glen Mills, the master recommended that he be placed in the Youth Centers. Demetrius filed an exception and requested a hearing. At the hearing, counsel for Demetrius told the court that although DJS had first planned to place the child in Glen Mills, because of a lack of funds DJS now recommended that he be placed in the Youth Centers. After hearing from an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney, the court ordered placement in Glen Mills. DJS promptly petitioned the court to vacate or modify the order. The petition was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">\n<em>Darvanion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">At the time of the disposition hearing of Darvanion, DJS had been ordered by the court to refer him to Glen Mills and had been further ordered to send him to the school for a \u201cdiagnostic evaluation\u201d upon Glen Mills\u2019 offer to perform the evaluation without payment. The juvenile counselor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>submitted a memorandum recommending placement in the Youth Centers. The counselor averred in the memorandum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACU1\">If I genuinely believed that Glen Mills was the only program to meet this young man\u2019s needs, I would not hesitate to recommend it, and I would do so, even in the face of the extant budget crunch, with all the persuasive power I could muster. However, I do not believe this is true in this case and I frankly think it would be cavalier and fiscally irresponsible in light of present economic realities, to make such a recommendation when a perfectly acceptable program, already budgeted for, exists. Nevertheless, after a hearing at which no testimony was</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHV\">taken, the court committed Darvanion to the DJS with the command that he be placed in Glen Mills. The petition of DJS to modify or vacate the order was denied upon hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\n<em>Shawn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Shawn\u2019s placement in Glen Mills came about in this manner. After he was adjudicated delinquent, there were negotiations in which DJS played no part. As a result of the negotiation, Shawn was referred to Glen Mills. The juvenile counselor informed the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney that a placement for Shawn had been secured in the Youth Centers. At no time did DJS refer Shawn to Glen Mills or recommend that he be placed in that facility. The court committed Shawn to DJS and sent him to Glen Mills for \u201cdiagnostic evaluation,\u201d which Glen Mills agreed to perform without payment. At the review proceeding which followed, the request of counsel for DJS to participate in the proceedings was denied. The juvenile counselor, however, informed the court that placement for Shawn in the Youth Centers had been obtained. The court continued the commitment to DJS and ordered the Department to place Shawn in Glen Mills, which had agreed to accept him. It was stipulated that DJS never recommended placement in Glen Mills and that the Department had secured an alternative placement for Shawn. The court refused to vacate or modify its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>DJS noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in each case from the respective orders denying the petitions to vacate or modify the orders of commitment. Upon petition of DJS in each case we granted certiorari before decision of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">In the light of our interpretation of the statutes with regard to the placement of a delinquent child, we conclude that the court\u2019s commands to place the children in Glen Mills were improper. We observe that the comments made by the presiding judges regarding the placements do not persuade us to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">As to Demetrius the court recognized that it did not have the authority to designate placement in a specific facility. The court attempted to avoid this restriction by reasoning that it was not really directing DJS to place the child in a particular facility. Rather, the court asserted, it used the phrase \u201cthe Glen Mills School\u201d merely to describe the characteristics of the \u201ctype of facility\u201d where Demetrius was to be placed. The court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">[I]t\u2019s always been my understanding as a juvenile judge and as the administrative judge of this court that I had the authority to designate the type of institution that a juvenile was to be committed to and the statute confirmed that and that\u2019s all I have done here. By using the key words, Glen Mills, I have designated a bundle of characteristics of an institution, which I felt, after everyone agreed, had the appropriate characteristics for Demetrius, for his well-being, his best interest, for society\u2019s best interest, for Juvenile Services\u2019 best interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-9\">As DJS points out, \u201c[t]he court, however, neither described nor made any findings of fact as to this \u2018bundle of characteristics.\u2019 \u201d We think that the court gave DJS no choice as to the facility. We are not in accord within the judge\u2019s rationale for his action.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>As to Darvanion, the court at first relied on the fact that DJS had initially recommended placement in either Glen Mills or the Youth Centers. The court said that it was \u201caccepting that and taking the alternative recommendation and placing [Darvanion] in the Glen Mills program.\u201d But this was in the face of a memorandum submitted shortly before the hearing in which the juvenile counselor urged that the child be placed in the Youth Centers and not in Glen Mills. At the hearing on the petition to vacate or modify the order, the court said, without amplification, that \u201cunder certain circumstances, the court does under the statute or can under the statute ... make the kind of decision that was made in this case____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">As to Shawn, at the hearing on the petition to vacate or modify the placement order, the judge, who had also presided in the Darvanion case, opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-7\">I still think that this court has as a duty and obligation to do that which is in the best interest of the [child]____ I am under the belief that the statute allows me to do what I did in this case as well based upon a total reading of the statute____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-10\">We note that DJS did not agree to the placement of the children in Glen Mills, nor did it condone or recommend such placement. On the contrary, it was persistent in its assertion of its right to designate the specific facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-11\">DECISION</p>\n<p id=\"b543-12\">The answer to the question is that CJ \u00a7 3-820, considered in the light of other relevant statutes, does not authorize the court, in committing a delinquent child to the custody of the Department of Juvenile Services, to order that the child be placed in a specific private facility at the expense of the Department. Therefore, the orders of the court placing the children in the Glen Mills School were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-13\">In each case, the judgment of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City denying the petition of the Department of Juvenile Services to vacate or modify the Order of Commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>ment is affirmed with respect to the commitment of the child to the care and custody of the Department of Juvenile Services and reversed with respect to the placement of the child in the Glen Mills School.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">IN EACH CASE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY DENYING THE PETITION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUVENILE SERVICES TO VACATE OR MODIFY THE ORDER OF COMMITMENT IS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART AS SET OUT IN THIS OPINION;</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">EACH CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY WITH DIRECTION TO VACATE THE ORDER PLACING THE CHILD IN THE GLEN MILLS SCHOOL; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE MAYOR AND CITY COUNCIL OF BALTIMORE.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-11\">. \"'Child'means a person under the age of 18 years.\" Md.Code (1973, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 3-801(d) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (CJ).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-12\">. \" \u2018Delinquent child\u2019 is a child who has committed a delinquent act and requires guidance, treatment, or rehabilitation.\u201d CJ \u00a7 3-801 (/).</p>\n<p id=\"ASl\">\" \u2018Delinquent act\u2019 means an act which would be a crime if committed by an adult.\" CJ \u00a7 3-801(k).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-12\">. \u201c \u2018Court\u2019 means the circuit court of a county or Baltimore City sitting as the juvenile court.

The Legislature made clear that \u201d[i]t is the policy of the State that the Department [of Juvenile Services] comply with the provisions of \u00a7 3-802 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum. Supp.), Art. 83C \u00a7 2-101(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b539-9\">. The form gave the DJS the right</p>\n<p id=\"Ajm\">to consent to such medical, surgical, and hospital care and treatment as may from time to time be determined to be in [the child\u2019s] best interest, subject to the further order of this court____</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">The form included an order that reasonable efforts required by 42 United States Code Annotated Section 671(a)(15) concerning preplacement efforts to prevent or eliminate the need for removal from the home have been made and post-placement efforts to enable a return to the home, applicable in the circumstances of the child, will continue to be made.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. The Legislature authorized DJS \u201cmay establish and operate the facilities that are necessary to diagnose, care for, train, educate, and rehabilitate properly children who need these services.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1988 Repl.Vol., 1990 Cum.Supp.), Art. 83C, \u00a7 2-117(a)(1). The facilities set out include \"(t]he youth centers.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 2-117(a)(2)(vi). Each facility named shall operate under the control and general management of DJS. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 2-118.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. A \"Juvenile counselor\u201d is \"the person assigned to the court by the Department of Juvenile Services to provide probation and aftercare services.\u201d COMAR 16.03.01.02(16).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b544-13\">. The writs of certiorari present a second question:</p>\n<p id=\"b544-14\">Whether the separation of powers mandated by Article 8 of the Maryland Constitution, Declaration of Rights prohibits the legislature from authorizing the juvenile courts to commit delinquent children to specific private facilities and to order the Department of Juvenile Services to pay the cost of those placements.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-15\">Because we have concluded on nonconstitutional grounds that the orders of the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to place the children in the Glen Mills School were prejudicially erroneous, we do not reach the constitutional issue presented. <em>Brittingham v. State, </em>306 Md. 654, 660, 511 A.2d 45 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
