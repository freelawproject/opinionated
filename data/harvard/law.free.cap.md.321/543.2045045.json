Powers, </em>314 Md. 484, 551 A.2d 465 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-17\">The Petitioner subsequently petitioned for readmission and, after an evidentiary hearing on the petition in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County followed by argument before this Court, this Court denied the petition on September 10, 1990 without prejudice to the right of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>Petitioner to file another petition for termination of his indefinite suspension not earlier than ninety (90) days after September 10, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">On December 13,1990, the Petitioner again petitioned the Court for reinstatement.
