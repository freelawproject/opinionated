At the time of the decision and adoption of this opinion, he had been commissioned and had qualified as a judge of this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b636-5\">CHARLES E. ORTH, Jr., Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Abu3\">Specially Assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">Judgment was entered in the Circuit Court for Washington County against Leslie Allen Binnie upon his conviction by a jury of the misdemeanor of theft of property having a value of less than $300. Maryland Code (1957, 1987 Repl. Vol.), Art. 27, \u00a7 342(a) and (f)(2). In fact, the value of the property was eleven dollars. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment in an unreported opinion. We granted Binnie\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari and denied the State\u2019s conditional cross-petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Binnie does not now challenge the proof of either the corpus delicti of the offense or his criminal agency. He seeks, however, a reversal of the judgment by reason of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury as he requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-8\">The way the State said the incident happened was adduced through the testimony of James Tosadori, a security officer employed by J.C. Penney Co., Inc., at its store in Hagerstown, Maryland. \u201cSecurity windows\u201d (two-way mirrors) were located in strategic areas high up along the walls inside the store, enabling a clandestine observation of the sales floor. According to Tosadori, he was behind one of the windows, looking down on the \u201cmen\u2019s area\u201d when he saw Binnie at a rack on which hats were displayed. Binnie took a black hat from the rack and hid it inside his jacket \u201cunder his left arm pit, put his hand in his pocket, stood there for a while,\u201d then walked through the store, \u201cstopping along the way to browse at stuff but nothing really like he was going to buy, just stopping to look.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>Tosadori observed Binnie\u2019s movements by means of the mirrors and ultimately by direct contact on the sales floor. Tosadori tailed Binnie through the store to the outside. Binnie did not speak to anyone before he took the hat or to anyone after he placed the hat under his jacket. He did not converse at any time with a person in the store, employee, or customer \u2014 \u201c[h]e walked straight out.\u201d Although there was a cash register near the hat rack, and cash registers along the route Binnie followed in leaving the store, Binnie made no effort to contact the employees who manned them.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">After Binnie left the store, Tosadori stopped him. Tosadori recounted what then ensued.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-6\">I explained to him that I was Officer Tosadori. I was with J.C. Penney\u2019s security. I introduced Officer Mayer as the security manager. I said, \u201cWe have a problem. We\u2019re missing a hat.\u201d I asked ... he looked at my i.d. I handed him my i.d. and he looked at it and handed it back to me. I asked him if he would help me find it and he agreed. I said, \u201cOkay let\u2019s start looking here.\u201d And I reached inside his jacket and from under his underarm I pulled out the black hat.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">* ^ * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-9\">We said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you leave the store without paying for this?\u201d And he said, \u201cYes.\u201d I said, \u201cWell let\u2019s go upstairs to our operations manager\u2019s office and we have to fill out forms we\u2019re going to bar you from the store.\u201d He said okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-10\">We went upstairs and filled out the forms that we fill out on shoplifters. He admitting to the theft and he said was dumb by doing it but he had done it anyway.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b637-11\">The form was an acknowledgement that a person \u201chas stolen something from our store,\u201d that \u201cthey know what they stole and they know it was wrong.\u201d Binnie \u201crefused to sign it thinking that he would be giving up his rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AQXd\">Tosadori identified the hat from a photograph and the photograph was admitted in evidence without objection. A price tag containing J.C. Penney\u2019s name was prominently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>attached to the hat. Tosadori pointed out that the tag was \u201cabout three inches long and you have your plastic thing\u201d attaching it to the hat. The plastic \u201cgismo\u201d was \u201cabout two inches so it\u2019s going to hang down so the customer can find the price tag.\u201d Tosadori avowed that the hat was never on the floor beneath the rack and that he did not see Binnie \u201clean down and pick up anything off the floor\u201d near the hat rack. The officer iterated that when apprehended, Binnie admitted he stole the hat and did not indicate in any way that he believed it to be lost or abandoned property. The only explanation Binnie gave for stealing the hat was that \u201cit was dumb, he just wanted the hat and didn\u2019t feel like paying for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">Binnie\u2019s version as to how he came into possession of the hat may in no wise be reconciled with that of Tosadori. Binnie testified that he was in the store to buy some jackets and shirts. He met a friend and chatted with him. Something unusual occurred; he found a hat. His good fortune came about in this manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">While I was talking to my friend we were looking through a round rack similar to the one that was already testified, the round rack with the glass plate on top. I believe there was a sale sign sitting on top of it. That particular rack had clothes on it that were for sale and I believe one half had shirts on it and the other half had some jackets on it also for sale.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">He found the hat underneath the rack while he was \u201cleafing through.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">I spread the shirts far enough apart that I was leafing through them like one would on a straight rack and I looked down and right at the base of the leg where it comes down in where the wheels were there was a hat laying on the ground.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">The hat was dirty.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-9\">It looked like it might have been stepped on once or twice____ [I]t was crushed a little bit, the top of it. Usually when they\u2019re new they\u2019re you know nice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>formed and nice and flat. And the top of it was crushed in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Binnie said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-5\">I made a comment to my friend that was standing there about I found a hat. I straightened the dent out and brushed the dirt off and I folded it around a little bit and I tried it on. And I said, \u201cWell even it fits.\u201d And I looked for a price tag and there was no price tag visible at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">He admitted that he was familiar with Penney\u2019s price tags, and he looked for a tag on the hat but did not see any.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Au9\">I looked over the hat and there was no price tag on it. So I was sort of interested you know in why exactly the hat was underneath there. And at the time I was standing about fifteen feet from the sales clerk [manning a cash register] so I turned around and asked her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">He made no effort to conceal the hat. He walked over to the sales clerk and \u201casked her if this was a J.C. Penney hat.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-8\">She said she did not know. I then asked her if ... if they sold such hats. She said she did not know but the hat rack was on the other side of the men\u2019s department in the corner I was free to go look.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">So Binnie went over to the rack to look \u201cfor similar hats or anything identifiable that would slightly relate to the hat [he] had found on the floor to the hats on the rack.\u201d Binnie claimed that there were \u201cno hats on the rack that even come close to ... like the one [he] had in his hand. They all had price tags on their hats.\u201d So Binnie went back over to the salesperson, \u201ca tall lady,\u201d he had just talked to.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-10\">At that time I says, \u201cThere was no hats ... there was no price tag on the hat.\u201d I explained to her exactly that I had found it on the floor, there was no price tags on it. I went over and looked at the rack. There was no hats like it on the rack and at that point she said, \u201cWell I guess it\u2019s yours\u201d very jokingly and she laughed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>At that point, Binnie said nothing further; \u201c[he] walked out of the store.\u201d Binnie\u2019s friend had already left Binnie\u2019s presence. Binnie was carrying the hat \u201csomewhat folded and just bent up a little bit ... just ... had a good grip on it.\u201d \u201c[M]ost definitely,\u201d it was visible in his hand. When he was about 15 feet from the exit door of the store, he folded the cap up and stuck it in his pocket. When he reached the sidewalk outside the store, he was stopped by two men who proved to be Tosadori and Mayer, the security manager. They \u201cgrabbed\u201d him and \u201cspun [him] around.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Afe\">And there wasn\u2019t very much communication other than they did identify themselves and there was hardly any conversation. I believe it was Mr. Tosadori was on my left. They spun me around. He had one ... one hand here and the other hand he reached in at my coat and said, \u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d And at which time I think the older gentleman said, \u201cYou can come on with us.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Binnie did not resist or try to run; he \u201cwas completely cooperative as much as possible.\u201d He was taken to the office.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">Once we were inside the office they accused me of stealing the hat. I tried to explain exactly what happened. And the older gentleman was some ... some very much badgering in my opinion that he kept on cutting me off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">Binnie did not admit stealing the hat and refused to sign the form acknowledging that he stole it. He claimed that he did not see the price tag on the cap until he was in the office. He explained to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-8\">\u201cThe tag apparently was inside of the lip [the sweatband of the cap].\u201d I don\u2019t know if anybody has ever worn a baseball cap or had a chance to take a look at one of their son\u2019s or whatever. But they have a sweatband like on the inside. Now this particular tag was apparently on the inside of the hat and the tag was on the inside of the lip and therefore it was not visible when you would pick the hat up and look at it. The tag was not visible whatsoever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>He claimed that the lip or sweatband was wider than the price tag. Binnie avowed that if he had seen the price tag, he would have turned the cap over to the sales clerk. A hat, not exactly like the cap found on Binnie, but \u201ccomparable\u201d was admitted in evidence on proffer by the defense for the edification of the jury. Binnie described the clerk to whom he said he talked only as a \u201ctall lady,\u201d and, although she wore a name tag, he did not recall her name. He had not seen her or talked to her since that day. His explanation for not attempting to ascertain her identity was that he had been \u201cbanned\u201d from the store premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">The State is satisfied that \u201c[t]he real issue in this case is whether Binnie was entitled to an instruction under [Code, Art. 27,] \u00a7 343(c)(2), providing that it shall be a defense to theft if \u2018[t]he defendant acted in the honest belief that he had the right to obtain or exert control over the property as he did.\u2019 \u201d In <em>Sibert v. State, </em>301 Md. 141, 145-148, 482 A.2d 483 (1984), we traced the history of this affirmative defense fashioned by the Legislature. We observed that the Legislature apparently viewed it as a \u201cclaim of right\u201d defense. <em>Id. </em>at 147, 482 A.2d 483. We referred to the Revision of Maryland Theft Laws and Bad Check Laws, 53, ch. 849 of Acts of 1978, Md.Spec.Rpts. (Joint Subcommittee on Theft Related Offenses, Oct. 1978). In <em>Sibert, </em>at 147, 482 A.2d 483, we quoted the observation of the Joint Subcommittee in its elaboration at 53-54 of the claim of right defense:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-6\">The claim of right defense springs from the notion that in cases of common law larceny the defendant must have had an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property____ [I]f the defendant can produce evidence that he was acting under an honest belief he had a \u201cclaim of right\u201d, <em>this will be weighed by the trier of the facts in resolving the issue of whether the defendant possessed the requisite mens rea to commit the offense of theft </em>[emphasis in <em>Sibert </em>].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">We pointed out in <em>Sibert </em>that \u201c[n]either the theft statute nor the accompanying legislative history defines the phrase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>\u2018honest belief.\u2019 \u201d 301 Md. at 149, 482 A.2d 483. Nevertheless, we found it \u201cclear that this defense operates to negate the <em>mens rea </em>for the offense of theft, thereby providing a total defense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We looked to the commentary to the Model Penal Code (Official Draft and Revised Comments, 1980) which served as a model for portions of the Maryland theft statute, and opined that it was \u201cparticularly instructive as to the purpose for the inclusion of the honest belief defense in its draft.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b642-5\">First, the commentary notes that \u201cit seems important to make it clear beyond doubt that an honest belief that the property does not belong to another should be a defense to theft.\u201d ... Second, the commentary states that recklessness or negligence should not serve as a basis for theft liability.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><em>Sibert, </em>301 Md. at 149, 482 A.2d 483, citing to and quoting from the Model Penal Code and Commentaries \u00a7 223.1 at 153-154.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">We first must determine if the evidence adduced at the trial generated a jury issue as to whether Binnie \u201cacted in the honest belief that he had the right to obtain or exert control over the property as he did.\u201d It is axiomatic that the weight of the evidence and the credibility of witnesses are always matters for the jury to determine when it is the trier of facts. <em>Perry v. State, </em>234 Md. 48, 51, 197 A.2d 833 (1964); <em>Duffin v. State, </em>229 Md. 434, 436, 184 A.2d 624 (1962); <em>Reynolds v. State, </em>219 Md. 319, 326, 149 A.2d 774 (1959). <em>Cf. Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gilbert, </em>307 Md. 481, 490, 515 A.2d 454 (1986). In our view, Binnie\u2019s testimony was sufficient to support fairly the issue whether he acted in an honest belief within the contemplation of Art. 27, \u00a7 343(c)(2). Whether the jury sitting as a trier of fact would lend any credence to Binnie or give any weight to his testimony was for the jury\u2019s determination, not that of the trial judge. The contradictions between Binnie\u2019s evidence and that of Tosadori went only to the weight of the evidence, not to its sufficiency. <em>Sibert, </em>301 Md. at 152, 482 A.2d 483. <em>Compare Kucharczyk v. State, </em>235 Md. 334, 201 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>A.2d 683 (1964). Simply put, the jury was free to discount or disregard totally Binnie\u2019s account of the incident and believe Tosadori\u2019s version. It was equally free, however, to discount or totally disregard Tosadori\u2019s account and believe Binnie\u2019s version. If the jury believed Binnie, the honest belief defense was generated by his testimony and operated as a total defense to the charge. We observe that such an issue may be generated by the testimony of the defendant alone; it is not necessary that his testimony be corroborated. <em>Smith, </em>302 Md. 175, 180-181, 486 A.2d 196 (1985). We cautioned, quoting <em>Hudson v. State, </em>381 So.2d 344, 346 (Fla. App.1980),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">A defendant\u2019s testimony may not be totally disregarded merely because he is the defendant. His testimony must be weighed just as that of any other witness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Smith, </em>302 Md. at 181, 486 A.2d 196.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">As the trial judge observed, Binnie\u2019s acquisition of the hat \u201ceither happened the way the State said or it happened the way [Binnie] said.\u201d But the choice of which saga to believe lay with the jury, not the court. In short, under the circumstances and the factual situation presented by Binnie, it was within the province of the jury, not of the court, to determine whether Binnie should benefit from the honest belief defense, regardless of how dubious, suspect, farfetched, and incredible Binnie\u2019s account may have appeared to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Given that the honest belief defense was generated, the next question is whether Binnie was entitled to an instruction on that defense. We are satisfied that the requested instructions covered the honest belief defense. Binnie\u2019s counsel argued that defense to the jury. He declaimed that the decisive consideration was how Binnie viewed the situation. He emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-9\">If [Binnie] acted in good faith and honestly believed that he was entitled to do what he did then I would ask ... I would urge you to find him not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-10\">Md.Rule 4-325(c) provides:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>The court may, and at the request of any party shall, instruct the jury as to the applicable law....[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">This Court has held that the word \u201cshall,\u201d as employed in the rule, renders the rule mandatory. <em>Smith v. State, </em>302 Md. 175, 180, 486 A.2d 196 (1985). We noted in <em>Smith </em>at 179, 486 A.2d 196, quoting <em>Bruce v. State, </em>218 Md. 87, 97, 145 A.2d 428 (1958), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-7\">\u201cit is encumbent upon the court, ... when requested in a criminal case, to give an ... instruction on every essential question or point of law supported by evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">In <em>Sims v. State, </em>319 Md. 540, 550, 573 A.2d 1317 (1990), we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-9\">a defendant is entitled to have the jury instructed on any theory of defense that is fairly supported by the evidence, even if several theories offered are inconsistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-10\">We pointed out that this holding was not only consistent with the requirement of Rule 4-325(c) but also \u201cwith the general proposition that a defendant is entitled to an instruction on every essential question or point of law supported by evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 550, 573 A.2d 1317. Judge Wilner, now Chief Judge of the Court of Special Appeals, speaking for a panel of that court, put it this way:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-11\">The \u201cbottom line\u201d is that, if a <em>prima facie </em>case is generated on a particular point of law, the defendant is entitled to a jury instruction on that point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-12\"><em>Wright v. State, </em>70 Md.App. 616, 620, 522 A.2d 401 (1987). It follows that once the honest belief defense is fairly generated by the evidence, the trial court may not refuse the defendant\u2019s request to instruct the jury regarding it. We asserted in <em>Sibert, </em>301 Md. at 154, 482 A.2d 483:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aik\">[W]hen the legislature explicitly enumerated four defenses to the crime of theft [the honest belief defense was one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of them] it intended a defendant to be entitled to a jury instruction on any defense generated by the evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">We hold that the trial judge erred in his failure to give an instruction on the honest belief defense. The judgment of the Court of Special Appeals is reversed. Binnie is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED;</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTION TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WASHINGTON COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL;</p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY WASHINGTON COUNTY.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-13\">. Md.Rule 4-325(c) further provides that \u201c[t]he court need not grant a requested instruction if the matter is fairly covered by instructions actually given.\" There is no suggestion that the instructions actually given here fairly covered the defense of honest belief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
