The Court of Special Appeals overturned the \u00a7 36B(d) handgun conviction on the ground that the \u00a7 386 offense did not qualify as a predicate crime for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>purposes of \u00a7 36B(d). <em>Vincent v. State, </em>82 Md.App. 344, 571 A.2d 874 (1990). The State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari challenging that decision, and, at our request, the defendant filed a response to the petition. We have granted the State\u2019s petition, and we shall summarily reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 decision and order that the trial court\u2019s judgment be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">A five-count indictment was filed in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on May 20, 1987, charging Kevin Vincent with various offenses based upon his allegedly shooting Joe Louis Reltherford. According to Mr. Reltherford, on March 23, 1986, Vincent shot Reltherford in one arm and in both sides with a handgun. Messrs. Vincent and Reltherford were allegedly pimps, and the shooting apparently grew out of a dispute between them over a prostitute.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">Count one of the indictment charged that Vincent \u201cunlawfully and feloniously did make an assault upon Joe Louis Reltherford\u201d with intent to murder Reltherford, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 12. Count two charged that Vincent \u201cdid unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously assault Joe Louis Reltherford, with the intent to disable\u201d Reltherford, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 386. The third count alleged that Vincent \u201cdid unlawfully, feloniously and maliciously shoot Joe Louis Reltherford, with the intent to disable said\u201d Reltherford, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 386.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Count five of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>the indictment accused Vincent of common law assault upon Reltherford.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">The fourth count of the indictment gave rise to the conviction which was reversed by the Court of Special Appeals and which is the object of the State\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari. Count four charged that Vincent \u201cdid unlawfully use a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence, in violation of Article 27, Section 36B(d)____\u201d While a better description of the offense, in light of the statutory language, would have been to charge that Vincent used \u201ca handgun in the commission of a felony or crime of violence, in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d),\u201d count four of the charging document left out the word \u201cfelony.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there has never in this case been any contention or even any intimation by the defendant that the absence of the word \u201cfelony\u201d in count four narrowed the scope of the charge or in any way misled the defendant. Both at the trial and on appeal, the parties have sometimes referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>count four as charging the use of a handgun in the commission of a \u201cfelony.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Counts one, two and three of the indictment described the offenses charged therein as felonies, and the defendant, throughout the trial, took the position that those offenses were eligible predicate offenses for the handgun charge in count four.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">The only pre-trial matter raised by the defendant was that the case should be dismissed on speedy trial grounds, and his motion to this effect was denied by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">During the trial, at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal, arguing only that there was insufficient evidence of assault with intent to murder. Also at the close of the prosecution\u2019s case, the State nol prossed count two charging malicious assault with intent to disable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">After deciding not to present any evidence, the defendant renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal, arguing that the evidence under counts one and three was insufficient, as the State had shown neither an intent to kill (count one) nor an intent to disable (count three). Defense counsel, agreeing that either the offense charged in count one or the offense charged in count three was a sufficient predicate for the handgun offense charged in count four, argued that if the Court were to accept his insufficiency argument and grant judgments of acquittal as to both \u201ccounts one and three at this time, then count four would have to fall as well____\u201d Defense counsel made no argument with regard to the assault charged in count five.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">In his instructions, the trial judge told the jury that either the offense charged in count one or the offense charged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>count three qualified as an underlying crime for purposes of the handgun offense charged in count four. The jurors were instructed that if they found that the defendant committed either an assault with intent to murder or a malicious shooting with an intent to disable, and if he used a handgun in doing so, then they should find the defendant guilty under the fourth count. After delivering the jury instructions, the trial judge asked counsel whether they had any objections. While raising a question concerning the instructions under count one, defense counsel had no objection to the instructions regarding the handgun charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The jury found the defendant not guilty of the assault with intent to murder charged in count one and guilty of the offenses charged in counts three, four and five. The trial judge thereafter merged the assault conviction under count five into the unlawful shooting with intent to disable conviction under count three.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">At the sentencing hearing, the defendant again seemed to acknowledge that the conviction for shooting with intent to disable furnished a sufficient basis for the handgun conviction. Defense counsel urged that the minimum five-year mandatory sentence be imposed for the handgun conviction, and that it not be without eligibility for parole.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant was given a ten-year prison sentence for unlawful shooting with intent to disable, and a concurrent twenty-year sentence, with all but thirteen years suspended, for the handgun offense. Both sentences were made consecutive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>to a sentence which the defendant was then serving in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">The defendant appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, raising an evidentiary issue which related to all counts on which he was convicted. The Court of Special Appeals ruled against him on this issue and affirmed the conviction and sentence for unlawfully shooting with intent to disable. <em>Vincent v. State, supra, </em>82 Md.App. at 346-347, 351, 571 A.2d at <em>875-877.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In addition, for the first time in the case, the defendant in his brief in the Court of Special Appeals contended that the unlawful shooting with intent to disable offense under Art. 27, \u00a7 386, did not qualify as an underlying crime for purposes of the Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), handgun offense. The reason for this, according to the defendant, was because the \u00a7 386 offense \u201cis not one of the crimes of violence listed in section 441\u201d (defendant\u2019s brief in the Court of Special Appeals, p. 6). The defendant couched his argument in two ways. First, he claimed that the evidence was insufficient to sustain the handgun conviction because there was no evidence that he used the handgun in the commission of a crime of violence within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 441. Second, the defendant argued that the trial judge committed \u201cplain error\u201d by instructing the jury that the unlawful shooting offense charged in count three qualified as an underlying crime for purposes of the handgun offense charged in count four.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">The State in its Court of Special Appeals brief made three alternative arguments in response to the defendant\u2019s attack upon the handgun conviction. First, the State pointed out that the matter had not been raised in the trial court and thus was not preserved for appellate review. Second, the State maintained that unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a crime of violence within the meaning of Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>\u00a7 441. Third, the State argued that, regardless of whether unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a crime of violence, it is a felony and any felony qualifies as a predicate crime for purposes of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, treating the defendant\u2019s challenge to the handgun conviction as involving two separate issues, declined to review the matter as a sufficiency of the evidence question on the ground that it was not preserved for appellate review, citing <em>State v. Lyles, </em>308 Md. 129, 517 A.2d 761 (1986). <em>See Vincent v. State, supra, </em>82 Md.App. at 347-348, 571 A.2d at 876. On the other hand, the intermediate appellate court exercised its discretion to review the jury instruction even though there was no objection to the instruction in the trial court. The Court of Special Appeals held that the offense of unlawful shooting with intent to disable, under Art. 27, \u00a7 386, was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 441, and, consequently, could not qualify as a predicate offense for the handgun conviction under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d). Accordingly, the court held that the jury instruction was erroneous, and it reversed the handgun conviction, although without remanding for a new trial. <em>Vincent v. State, supra, </em>82 Md.App. at 348-351, 571 A.2d at 876-877. The intermediate appellate court totally ignored the State\u2019s alternative argument that unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a felony and that any felony qualifies as an underlying crime for purposes of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>The defendant <em>pro se </em>filed a petition for a writ of certiorari. In addition, the State filed a petition for a writ of certiorari, challenging on two grounds the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 reversal of the handgun conviction. The State repeated its arguments in the Court of Special Appeals that unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a crime of violence within the meaning of Art. 27, \u00a7 441, and that, alternatively, unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a felony and therefore qualifies as a predicate crime under Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d). As previously indicated, at the Court\u2019s request defense counsel filed an answer to the State\u2019s certiorari petition. The answer, like the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion, was entirely silent regarding the State\u2019s alternative argument that unlawful shooting with intent to disable qualifies as a predicate crime for purposes of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), because the offense is a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">We have denied the defendant\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari, and, as pointed out in the beginning of this opinion, we have granted the State\u2019s petition and shall reverse the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 judgment on the handgun count. The State\u2019s alternative argument, that unlawful shooting with intent to disable qualifies as a predicate crime under \u00a7 36B(d) because the unlawful shooting offense is a felony, is obviously correct and dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Art. 27, \u00a7 386, provides that \u201c[i]f any person shall unlawfully shoot at any person ... with intent to maim, disfigure or disable such person, ... every such offender ... shall be guilty of a felony____\u201d Thus, the basic offense charged in count three, under which the defendant Vincent was convicted, constituted a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The handgun statute, in Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), states that \u201c[a]ny person who shall use a handgun ... in the commission of <em>any felony or </em>any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441 of this article\u201d shall be guilty of a separate crime and shall be given a sentence which is \u201cin addition to any other sentence imposed by virtue of commission of said felony or misdemeanor____\u201d (Emphasis added). The language of the statute, and the legislative intent reflected therein, are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>clear. <em>Any </em>felony, without exception, qualifies as a predicate crime for purposes of the \u00a7 36B(d) handgun offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">This Court has previously held that the use of a handgun in <em>any </em>felony, including felonies not expressly listed as \u201ccrimes of violence\u201d in Art. 27, \u00a7 441, constitutes an offense under the handgun statute, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d). In <em>Whack v. State, </em>288 Md. 137, 416 A.2d 265 (1980), <em>cert. denied and appeal dismissed, </em>450 U.S. 990, 101 S.Ct. 1688, 68 L.Ed.2d 189 (1981), the defendant was convicted and sentenced for robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon. The dangerous or deadly weapon was a handgun. In addition, based upon the same act, the defendant was convicted and given a separate sentence under \u00a7 36B(d) for using \u201ca handgun in the commission of any felony or any crime of violence as defined in \u00a7 441____\u201d Whack argued, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Legislature did not intend that separate convictions and sentences be imposed based on a single act of armed robbery with a handgun. The <em>Whack </em>opinion observed that \u201c[i]n this connection, the petitioner notes the reference to \u00a7 441 of Art. 27, and points out that \u00a7 441(e), in defining \u2018crime of violence,\u2019 lists \u2018robbery\u2019 but not \u2018robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon.\u2019 \u201d 288 Md. at 148 n. 4, 416 A.2d at 270 n. 4. This Court, in answering the defendant Whack\u2019s legislative intent argument, stated (288 Md. at 148, 416 A.2d at 270):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">\u201cThe language imposes the penalty under the section for use of a handgun in the commission of \u2018any felony.\u2019 As robbery with a dangerous or deadly weapon is within \u2018any felony,\u2019 the statutory language unambiguously imposes the penalty set forth in \u00a7 36B(d) if one uses a handgun in the armed robbery.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">As to Whack\u2019s reliance on what was included as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in \u00a7 441, we further noted, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201c[t]he reference to \u00a7 441 was simply for the purpose of indicating which misdemeanors should also be encompassed.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>n. 4. We elsewhere pointed out that \u00a7 36B(d) punishes \u201cthe use of a handgun in the commission of any felony and in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>commission of certain violent misdemeanors,\u201d <em>Whack v. State, supra, </em>288 Md. at 141, 416 A.2d at 267.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">In sum, when one uses a handgun in the commission of an offense which is a felony under Maryland law, that person has also violated Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), regardless of whether the underlying offense is also a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under Art. 27, \u00a7 441. As the statutory language and the <em>Whack </em>case make clear, \u00a7 36B(d)\u2019s reference to \u201ccrime[s] of violence as defined in \u00a7 441\u201d was solely for the purpose of indicating which misdemeanors should also be encompassed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Whether unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 441 may well be a very important issue when dealing with certain statutes other than Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d). Nevertheless, for purposes of Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(d), it is irrelevant whether unlawful shooting with intent to disable is a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d It is a felony, and, as such, it is a qualifying offense under the language of \u00a7 36B(d). Consequently, it was error for the Court of Special Appeals in this case to have even reached the question of whether unlawful shooting with intent to disable constituted a \u201ccrime of violence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH REGARD TO COUNT FOUR REVERSED.

The State also indicated that it intended to nol pros count five, charging common law assault, but defense counsel objected, relying on <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 553 A.2d 233 (1989). The State thereupon agreed not to nol pros count five.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b380-7\">.

Defense counsel argued that, as the offense in this case was committed prior to 1988, the ex post facto prohibition would not allow the sentence to be without eligibility for parole. The prosecuting attorney made a contrary argument. The trial court, citing <em>Gluckstern v. Sutton, </em>319 Md. 634, 574 A.2d 898, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 111 S.Ct. 369, 112 L.Ed.2d 331 (1990), agreed with defense counsel\u2019s ex post facto argument and refused to add language to his sentence indicating no eligibility for parole for five years.
