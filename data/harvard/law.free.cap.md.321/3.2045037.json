(CSL), a Maryland chartered, capital stock savings and loan corporation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The action seeks money damages for breaches of the duties of loyalty and care owed to CSL, one of a galaxy of corporations and limited partnerships associated with Equity Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>grams Investment Corporation (EPIC). As this case comes to us, the roster of defendants contesting MDIF\u2019s claims has been reduced to the respondents, Tom J. Billman (Bill-man) and Crysopt Corporation (Crysopt). Billman was the founder of EPIC and a controlling principal in the EPIC group. Crysopt is a holding company wholly owned by Billman.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">MDIF obtained a judgment on a jury verdict against Billman in excess of $112 million in compensatory damages. The jury found Crysopt jointly and severally liable with Billman for approximately $94 million of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">This case was tried for sixty-nine days between May 18, 1988, when the jury was sworn, and October 6, 1988, when the jury returned its verdict on the sixth day of its deliberations. On October 5, after the jury had separated for the evening, a courtroom clerk found a box containing eighty-seven unadmitted documents in the jury room. Prior to trial these documents, along with all other potential documentary evidence, had been listed as possible exhibits by one or more parties and had been prenumbered with exhibit sticker labels. The vast majority of the eighty-seven unadmitted documents had been identified at trial, but had not been formally admitted into evidence. This was either because counsel did not formally offer an identified document or because an objection was sustained at the stage of the trial when the document was offered. Of these eighty-seven documents, twenty had been prenumbered by MDIF and sixty-seven by defendants. When the jury commenced deliberations these eighty-seven documents had been delivered into the jury room along with the 1,138 exhibits which had been admitted into evidence. The trial court denied respondents\u2019 motions for a mistrial and received the jury\u2019s verdict on compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">On December 21, 1988, a United States magistrate in the District of Maryland, acting on the sworn complaint of a United States postal inspector, issued a warrant for Bill-man\u2019s arrest on mail fraud and related charges pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1341, 1343 (1984 &amp; Supp.1990) and 2314 (1970 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>&amp; Supp.1990), all arising out of Billman\u2019s activities in connection with the EPIC group. Issuance of that warrant, however, was kept secret until June 23, 1989. The Government has never been able to serve the warrant. Information obtained by the Government, including that derived from telephone wiretaps, demonstrated that Billman was no longer in the United States. On December 1, 1989, respondents, among others, were federally indicted on the same charges. Crysopt appeared through counsel. Billman has not appeared.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Shortly after return of the verdict, MDIF began efforts to collect the \u201cjudgment,\u201d and, continuously thereafter, it has vigorously pursued that objective. These efforts included court orders, served on Billman\u2019s counsel, for Bill-man\u2019s appearance on at least two separate occasions for examination in aid of execution. Billman never appeared, and the circuit court twice found respondents in contempt. Through their counsel respondents have countered MDIF\u2019s collection efforts with motions, appeals and successful applications for stays pending appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Eventually, final judgment was entered in this case, and an appeal was perfected to the Court of Special Appeals. That court reversed and remanded for a new trial. <em>Billman v. State of Maryland Deposit Ins. Fund Corp., </em>80 Md.App. 333, 563 A.2d 1110 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">MDIF moved that respondents\u2019 appeals be dismissed, contending that the intermediate appellate court should not entertain a fugitive\u2019s appeal from a civil judgment which was based upon the same course of conduct that had given rise to the criminal charges. The Court of Special Appeals acknowledged that it had applied this \u201c \u2018Fugitive Appeal Doctrine\u2019 \u201d in some unreported decisions dismissing appeals in criminal cases, <em>id. </em>at 345, 563 A.2d at 1116, but the court declined, absent any decision from this Court, to extend the doctrine to the facts here. MDIF also argued that respondents\u2019 appeal should be dismissed because of their repeated failure to comply with direct orders of the circuit court relating to discovery in aid of execution. Viewing the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>contention as one addressed to its discretion, and noting the lack of personal service on Billman, the Court of Special Appeals declined to dismiss. <em>Id. </em>at 346, 563 A.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Respondents raised multiple issues in the Court of Special Appeals, but that court found it necessary to address only the trial court\u2019s denial of respondents\u2019 motion for mistrial. The Court of Special Appeals held \u201cthat whenever materials, documents, or matters not in evidence are, nevertheless, present in the jury room and examined by the jury, prejudice to the parties is presumed. The failure of the trial judge to declare a mistrial in the instant case constitutes reversible error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 345, 563 A.2d at 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">On MDIF\u2019s petition we issued the writ of certiorari to review the intermediate appellate court\u2019s denial of MDIF\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal and the reversal of the circuit court\u2019s denial of respondents\u2019 motion for mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We shall state additional facts throughout this opinion to the extent necessary to explain the resolution of the issue under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Although this Court has never previously had occasion to consider the \u201cFugitive Appeal Doctrine,\u201d it is widely recognized that an appellate court may dismiss the direct appeal from a criminal conviction brought on behalf of one who is a fugitive at the time of dismissal. At one time the Supreme Court of the United States removed fugitive cases from its active docket, and they remained in a procedural limbo until further order. <em>See Eisler v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 189, 69 S.Ct. 1453, 93 L.Ed. 1897 (1949); <em>Bonahan v. Nebraska, </em>125 U.S. 692, 8 S.Ct. 1390, 31 L.Ed. 854 (1887); <em>Smith v. United States, </em>94 U.S. 97, 24 L.Ed. 32 (1876). Now the Court dismisses cases involving fugitive parties. <em>See Molinaro v. New Jersey, </em>396 U.S. 365, 90 S.Ct. 498, 24 L.Ed.2d 586 (1970); <em>Eisler v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 883, 70 S.Ct. 181, 94 L.Ed. 542 (1949) (per curiam) (memorandum decision). The Court has also sustained, against an equal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>protection challenge, the dismissal, authorized by a Texas statute, of the direct criminal appeal of a prisoner who had escaped but who was reapprehended two days later. <em>See Estelle v. Dorrough, </em>420 U.S. 534, 95 S.Ct. 1173, 43 L.Ed.2d 377 (per curiam), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>421 U.S. 921, 95 S.Ct. 1589, 43 L.Ed.2d 790 (1975).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">There is considerable state authority supporting dismissal of a direct criminal appeal brought on behalf of a fugitive. <em>See Ex parte Subel, </em>541 So.2d 15, 16 (Ala.1989); <em>People v.

Bono, </em>103 Wis.2d 654, 655, 309 N.W.2d 400, 400 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>There have been dismissals of direct criminal appeals by persons who had escaped, and been recaptured before final judgment was entered, and thus were in custody throughout the pendency of their appeals. <em>See United States v. London, </em>723 F.2d 1538 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>467 U.S. 1228, 104 S.Ct. 2684, 81 L.Ed.2d 878 (1984) (escape and recapture during trial); <em>United States v. Holmes, </em>680 F.2d 1372 (11th Cir.1982) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>460 U.S. 1015, 103 S.Ct. 1259, 75 L.Ed.2d 486 (1983) (escape and recapture after finding of guilty and before sentence). On the other hand, direct criminal appeals have been allowed where the convicted person who fled after verdict and before sentence had been a fugitive for an extended period. See <em>United States v. Tunnell, </em>650 F.2d 1124 (9th Cir.1981) (twelve years); <em>United States v. Tapia-Lopez, </em>521 F.2d 582 (9th Cir.1975) (five years).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">With respect to appeals in civil cases there is no decision of the United States Supreme Court supporting dismissal because the party invoking the court\u2019s jurisdiction is a fugitive. Arguably, the rationale applied by the Court would not support extension of the doctrine to civil cases. In <em>United States v. Sharp, </em>470 U.S. 675, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1984), the respondents had become fugitives after the Court had granted the Government\u2019s petition for certiorari to review an appellate reversal of convictions of the respondents. In rejecting a dissenting opinion\u2019s position that the judgment under review should be vacated and the appeal dismissed, the Court distinguished the case before it from those in which \u201ca fugitive defendant is the party seeking review[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 681 n. 2, 105 S.Ct. at 1573 n. 2, 84 L.Ed.2d at 612 n. 2. \u201cIn those very different cases, dismissal of the petition or appeal is based on the equitable principle that a fugitive from justice is \u2018disentitled\u2019 to call upon this Court for a review of his conviction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The disentitlement referred to traces back to <em>Smith v. United States, </em>94 U.S. at 97, where the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">\u201cIf we affirm the judgment, [the fugitive] is not likely to appear to submit to his sentence. If we reverse it and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>order a new trial, he will appear or not, as he may consider most for his interest. Under such circumstances, we are not inclined to hear and decide what may prove to be only a moot case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">In the civil case now before us the judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County will or will not be effective based upon the merits of the appeal. Neither its effectiveness nor its direct enforcement turns on whether or not Billman remains a fugitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Some lower federal courts, however, have applied the doctrine to civil cases brought by fugitive plaintiffs whose guilt of some criminal offense had been determined. When plaintiffs in this class of cases fled, they were either under judgment of conviction, whether or not physically confined, or they had been found, or had pleaded, guilty. The dismissed civil cases usually, but not always, arose out of the same conduct underlying the criminal case. <em>See Ali v. Sims, </em>788 F.2d 954 (3rd Cir.1986) (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1981) action challenging prison discipline); <em>United States v. $129,-374 in U.S. Currency, </em>769 F.2d 583 (9th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 1086, 106 S.Ct. 863, 88 L.Ed.2d 901 (1986); <em>Conforte v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>692 F.2d 587 (9th Cir.1982), <em>stay denied, </em>459 U.S. 1309, 103 S.Ct. 663, 74 L.Ed.2d 558 (1983) (Rehnquist, J., opinion in chambers); <em>Arana v. United States Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv., </em>673 F.2d 75 (3rd Cir.1982) (denial of habeas corpus affirmed where applicant fled and became object of bench warrant after deportation order had been issued in administrative proceeding); <em>Doyle v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>668 F.2d 1365 (D.C.Cir.1981), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1002, 102 S.Ct. 1636, 71 L.Ed.2d 870 (1982) (affirming dismissal of action to obtain documents under Freedom of Information Act); <em>Shaw v. Estelle, </em>542 F.2d 954 (5th Cir. 1976) (affirming dismissal of civil rights action regarding prison discipline); <em>Broadway v. City of Montgomery, Alabama, </em>530 F.2d 657 (5th Cir.1976) (civil rights action alleging fourth amendment violation leading to subject\u2019s arrest and conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>A few civil cases have also been dismissed at the trial or appellate level when brought by fugitives who have been criminally charged but whose guilt has never been established in a criminal proceeding. Among these are cases involving claims to property subject to forfeiture to the sovereign because of the claimant\u2019s alleged criminal conduct. <em>See United States v. One Parcel of Real Estate at 7707 S. W 74th Lane, Miami, Dade County, Fla., </em>868 F.2d 1214 (11th Cir.1989); <em>United States v. $45,940 in U.S. Currency, </em>739 F.2d 792 (2d Cir.1984); <em>United States v. Certain Real Property Located at 760 Southwest 1st Street, Miami, Fla., </em>702 F.Supp. 575 (W.D.N.C.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">Other civil cases dealing with unconvicted fugitives are not forfeiture offshoots of criminal prosecutions. In <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Tome, </em>833 F.2d 1086, 1087 n. 1 (2d Cir.1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>486 U.S. 1014, 108 S.Ct. 1751, 100 L.Ed.2d 213 (1988), the court dismissed Tome\u2019s appeal from a civil judgment, based on insider trading, where Tome had fled the United States three years before he was indicted on related charges and five years before the civil judgment was entered. See also <em>Securities &amp; Exch. Comm\u2019n v. Tome, </em>638 F.Supp. 596, 620 n. 44 (S.D.N.Y. 1986). And <em>see Schuster v. United States, </em>765 F.2d 1047 (11th Cir.1985) (affirming dismissal of fugitive indictee\u2019s challenge to jeopardy income tax assessment); <em>United States v. U.S. Commanding Officer of the Office of the Provost Marshal, U.S. Army, </em>496 F.2d 324 (1st Cir.1974) (habeas corpus denied where applicant fled after court-martial charges brought); <em>Dawkins v. Mitchell, </em>437 F.2d 646 (D.C.Cir.1970) (affirming refusal to enjoin execution of warrant under Fugitive Felon Act); <em>Brin v. Marsh, </em>596 F.Supp. 1007 (D.D.C.1984) (mandamus to compel petitioner\u2019s discharge from U.S. Army denied where petitioner fled while freedom of movement restricted during criminal investigation).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">We shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that a Maryland appellate court has the power to dismiss Billman\u2019s appeal under the facts of this case. It does not follow, however, that we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>are compelled to do so. Exercise of the power is discretionary. <em>See Clark v. Dalsheim, </em>663 F.Supp. 1095, 1097 (S.D. N.Y.1987); <em>United States v. Veliotis, </em>586 F.Supp. 1512, 1514 (S.D.N.Y.1984); <em>State v. Byrd, </em>448 N.W.2d 29, 32 (Iowa 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">In the exercise of our discretion, we deny dismissal under the fugitive doctrine. Here the Court of Special Appeals proceeded to examine the merits of the appeal and concluded that there was error which required reversal. It is not in the interest of justice to order the appeal dismissed and the judgment of the circuit court reinstated, without any review of the merits by this Court, when a reported opinion by the Court of Special Appeals concludes that the circuit court judgment must be reversed. Further, as we shall demonstrate in Part III, the Court of Special Appeals did not apply the proper standard in its error review. Consequently, we should address the merits under the proper standard in a certiorari review.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">MDIF\u2019s argument for dismissing the appeals based on respondents\u2019 non-compliance with circuit court orders is unpersuasive, both legally and factually.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">For the argument\u2019s foundation in Maryland law MDIF relies upon a general rule, described in <em>Gilbert v. Arnold, </em>30 Md. 29, 35 (1869), as laid down by Lord Chief Baron Gilbert, which this Court last applied in unmodified form in <em>Skirven v. Skirven, </em>154 Md. 267, 140 A. 205 (1928). <em>Skirven </em>dismissed the appeal by a husband from the trial court\u2019s refusal to consider a reduction in alimony <em>pendente lite, </em>a refusal based on the husband\u2019s being in contempt for failure to pay at the prescribed rate. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A3\">\u201c[H]ere the rule is that, while one adjudged guilty of contempt may attack the finding directly, he cannot, so long as it stands unimpeached, be permitted as a matter of right to make any motion, file any petition, or assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>any claim for relief, in the particular suit in which the contempt has been adjudicated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 271, 140 A. at 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\"><em>Skirven </em>was distinguished in <em>Gunter v. Gunter, </em>187 Md. 228, 49 A.2d 454 (1946). An absolute divorce had converted the parties\u2019 realty into a tenancy in common, but the trial court had dismissed a bill for partition sought by the former husband because he was in default on alimony payments. We reversed, pointing out that in <em>Skirven </em>\u201cthe trial court did not undertake to finally dispose of any right, but merely required the petitioner to purge his adjudicated contempt, as a condition to granting him relief in the same proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234, 140 A. at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>Skirven </em>was argued in support of dismissing the appeal in <em>Rethorst v. Rethorst, </em>214 Md. 1, 133 A.2d 101 (1957), which had been brought by a divorced father who sought the custody of his children and who, argued his former wife, was in contempt of court. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, writing for the Court, noted the <em>Gunter </em>distinction, but went on, in reliance on decisions from other jurisdictions, to conclude that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-7\">\u201c[t]he general rule which now seems well established is that the fact that the husband is in contempt will not prevent his litigating his substantial rights in connection with which the contempt was committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 10, 133 A.2d at 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">Most recently, in an interstate custody dispute we said, citing only to <em>Rethorst, </em>that \u201cthe fact that the mother had been adjudged in contempt [did not] bar her from taking an appeal and litigating her substantial rights in connection with which the contempt was committed.\u201d <em>Miller v. Miller, </em>247 Md. 358, 362, 231 A.2d 27, 30 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Under these principles, we could not properly dismiss respondents' appeals. Respondents did not comply with circuit court orders to appear and be examined in aid of execution. Those orders led to contempt findings and orders that the respondents pay to MDIF specified sums of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>money, each day, until respondents purged themselves of the contempt. But MDIF\u2019s right to asset discovery under Maryland Rule 2-633 is dependent upon MDIF\u2019s being a judgment creditor holding a money judgment. The substance of respondents\u2019 position is that the judgment should be reversed on the merits, a position with which the Court of Special Appeals agreed. Nor are the respondents in continuing contempt by the failure to pay to MDIF the daily penalties assessed by the circuit court. Enforcement of those contempt sanctions was stayed by orders of appellate courts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under these circumstances it is not appropriate to dismiss the appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed and remanded for a new trial because the unadmitted documents were available to the jury during its deliberations. Because the unadmitted documents formed part of the mass of materials which bore plaintiff\u2019s or defendants\u2019 exhibit stickers, we shall assume that the jury did not distinguish between the documents properly in evidence and those which were not formally admitted. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 analysis, however, was that \u201cprejudice to the parties is presumed.\u201d <em>Billman, </em>80 Md.App. at 345, 563 A.2d at 1116. Thus the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>intermediate appellate court immediately concluded that the trial court committed reversible error in denying respondents\u2019 motion for a mistrial. To support its conclusion, the court principally relied upon two New York decisions, <em>Public Operating Corp. v. Weingart, </em>257 A.D. 379, 13 N.Y.S.2d 182 (1939) (new trial awarded where jury considered unadmitted list of replevied property bearing valuations determined in a manner contrary to court\u2019s instructions); and <em>Aiken v. Dunn, </em>1 Misc.2d 215, 147 N.Y.S.2d 450 (St. Lawrence Co.1955) (denying new trial in personal injury case where juror brought into jury room book entitled, <em>How to Serve on a Jury).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The approach used by the Court of Special Appeals in this case is contrary to well established Maryland law. The standard for evaluating whether a new trial should be granted under the circumstances here, where the jury deliberations included unadmitted documents, does not differ from a situation where the jury considers evidence admitted by the trial court which is later determined to have been erroneously admitted. <em>Beahm v. Shortall, </em>279 Md. 321, 368 A.2d 1005 (1977), is a case of the latter type. There Judge Orth, writing for the Court, extensively reviewed our cases.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">\u201cPrecise standards for the degree of prejudice required for reversal, have not been, and perhaps cannot be, established.

Basically its business, headquartered in Northern Virginia, was selling tax shelters in real estate. EPIC\u2019s success depended on a continuing upward spiral of real estate values throughout the country, and particularly in Texas where EPIC invested heavily. Since early 1982 one or more holding companies controlled by Billman (collectively, EPIC Holdings), held, directly or indirectly, all of the capital stock of CSL. EPIC Holdings was 80% owned by Billman, until February 1985, and 20% owned by a co-defendant, Clayton A. McCuistion (McCuistion). In March 1988, EPIC merged into CSL\u2019s direct subsidiary, service company which changed its name to EPIC. Thereafter, organizationally, though not in practice, EPIC was a subsidiary of CSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Billman utilized the deposits in CSL for EPIC\u2019s cash requirements. As EPIC\u2019s business slowed in 1984 and 1985, its cash requirements became greater. In a February 1985 reorganization Billman sold his 80% interest in EPIC Holdings to McCuistion for $14 million in cash and for other considerations valued in excess of $16 million, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>realty on Maryland\u2019s Eastern Shore. CSL was placed in conservatorship in early September 1985 and eventually was liquidated in receivership.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">In its tax shelter business EPIC sold participations in limited partnerships of which it was the sole general partner, usually holding a 1% interest. Initially EPIC partnerships invested in model homes purchased from builders of tract housing. Later the partnerships also bought production houses and condominiums from builders. The parties, as shall we, at times have called the investments in the partnerships and the residences owned by the partnerships the \u201cEPIC product.\u201d EPIC partnerships financed their real estate acquisitions with mortgage loans from EPIC Mortgage, Inc. (EMI), another CSL subsidiary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These residences were then rented by the partnerships to tenants. In theory residences would be held for no more than four or possibly five years and then sold, at which time the partnerships\u2019 creditors, including the holders of the first mortgages, would be paid, the capital contributions of the limited partners returned, and any profit distributed to EPIC and the limited partners per the partnership agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">A unique feature of the EPIC concept was that the builder who sold a residence agreed to pay the buying EPIC partnership a rebate, called a rental deficit contribution (RDC). An RDC theoretically represented the present value of the monies required every month to meet the difference between the estimated carrying costs of the property and the total of (1) net rentals realized and (2) limited partners\u2019 monthly capital contributions to the partnership.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>The dominant policy of the EPIC group was to avoid default by any EPIC partnership in order to maintain investor confidence. Particularly in 1984 and 1985, rents, RDCs and limited partner contributions from the various partnerships were commingled and the funds were used where most urgently needed. Another CSL subsidiary, EPIC Residential Network, Inc. (ERNI), sought to sell, through a national network of real estate brokers, a growing inventory of non-owner occupied or vacant residences owned by matured partnerships. New EPIC partnerships (resyndications) were formed to buy from matured partnerships homes which had not been resold to independent buyers. Cash obtained from these new, limited partnerships was used for the cash requirements of matured partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">The ultimate source of funds was CSL. Its deposits were advanced directly to EPIC partnerships and indirectly to them through EPIC, EMI, and ERNI in order to satisfy the cash needs of the partnerships. These loans were essentially unsecured. Where security by means of a second mortgage on a house was attempted, the second mortgages were unrecorded. By September 5, 1985, the date of the court ordered conservatorship of CSL, there were 357 outside investor, limited partnerships. Those partnerships, EPIC, EMI, and ERNI owed CSL $82.3 million in loans and loan interest as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">The theory of count I of MDIF\u2019s complaint was that these loans violated state regulations and that the defendants violated their duty of care applicable to the circumstances. MDIF requested a verdict of $49,255,381 on count I. The jury returned a verdict against the respondents and others for $49,255,381 on count I. Those damages represent the projected net loss to CSL on the loans to EPIC entities, after credit is given to the defendants for the value of the consideration received by CSL in the sale of its assets in the receivership \u201cworkout.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>There were also three EPIC limited partnerships in which the limited partners were persons who were fiduciaries of CSL. As of August 31,1985, the advances by CSL to these insider partnerships totaled $8,364,827. Count II of the complaint was predicated on this violation of the duty of loyalty and on Md.Code (1980,1986 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 9-307(c) of the Financial Institutions Article (FI) which prohibits a savings and loan association from making a loan to any partnership in which an interest of 10% or more is owned by controlling persons, directors, officers or employees of the association. The jury returned a verdict against the respondents and others in the amount of $8,364,827 on count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">On February 21, 1984, CSL paid a dividend of $6,373,331 for the year 1983 to EPIC Holdings and thus, ultimately, 80% to Billman and 20% to McCuistion. On February 7, 1985, CSL again paid a dividend of $7,999,998 for the year 1984. MDIF contended in count III of its complaint that these dividends were unlawful. Although CSL\u2019s financial statements for those years reported a net worth which would have permitted payment of these dividends, MDIF\u2019s position was that CSL\u2019s assets were overstated and should have been reduced. For example, as of year end 1984, CSL reported a net worth of $26.8 million whereas MDIF contended that CSL had a negative net worth of $25.6 million. On count III MDIF sought to recover the $14,373,329 of dividends paid. The jury returned a verdict against Billman and others on count III for $14,373,329.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">The defendants also required CSL and its subsidiaries, by an agreement with EPIC Holdings of March 1, 1983, to prepay their taxes to EPIC Holdings for the purported purpose of insuring that cash would be available to pay tax obligations. Count IV of MDIF\u2019s complaint challenged this arrangement as an unsafe business practice and as a violation of the duty of loyalty. One consequence of the arrangement was that CSL could not enjoy the tax advantages of the losses being incurred by EPIC. In the period 1983 through 1985 CSL and its subsidiaries paid to EPIC Holdings $32 million under the tax allocation agreement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>During that same period EPIC Holdings paid no federal taxes, paid $1 million in state taxes, and retained $31 million of the tax payments. Utilizing these funds EPIC Holdings on January 9, 1985, paid a $14 million dividend, $11.2 million to Billman and $2.8 million to McCuistion. In count IV, MDIF claimed the total of the \u201cprepaid\u201d taxes remitted in both years, $31,036,470. The jury returned a verdict against the respondents and others for $31,036,470 on count IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Count V of MDIF\u2019s complaint involved three types of transactions which MDIF loosely classifies as unlawful fees. The principal component of the claim, $4,754,023, consists of management fees paid by CSL and three of its subsidiaries to EPIC Holdings for the three years ending December 31, 1985. MDIF proved that no meaningful services were rendered by EPIC Holdings and that the management, accounting and legal services performed for CSL and its subsidiaries were rendered by their own employees or by independent contractors. A second component of count V involved two other subsidiaries of EPIC Holdings from which CSL and its subsidiaries were required to lease furniture and equipment. CSL was also required to pay the tax liabilities of those leasing companies. They were ultimately sold to CSL. MDIF\u2019s claim of $812,394 represents the profit made by EPIC Holdings through those two leasing corporations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The third component of the claim is $200,000 paid to EPIC Holdings by CSL on a transaction known as Plaza East. The ostensible reason for that payment has never been determined. MDIF sought $5,766,417 on these three components of count V. The jury returned a verdict of $5,766,417 against respondents and others on count V.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Count VI of the complaint alleged breaches of duty on the part of certain non-corporate defendants in the payment of excessive salaries, bonuses, and perquisites during the three years ending December 31, 1985. Eliminating duplication with the other counts, MDIF sought from Billman and certain other defendants, $3,401,400 on count VI. The jury returned a verdict against Billman and others for $3,401,400 on count VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">A central theme of MDIF\u2019s presentation of its case was that Billman used CSL to \u201cfeed the EPIC machine.\u201d The quoted language is set forth verbatim in the minutes of a special meeting of the CSL Operations Committee of April 15, 1985. Those minutes refer to an October 1984 meeting of the presidents of seven EPIC group companies and of CSL at which goals were set for all. Those minutes state that \u201c[CSL\u2019s] # 1 goal as the deposit center is to attract deposits to feed the EPIC machine____\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Collectability of the $82.3 million in advances by CSL to or for the benefit of the EPIC partnerships depended almost entirely on appreciation of the homes owned by the partnerships. These advances by CSL were junior to the first liens of the purchase money mortgages which had been sold to entities outside the EPIC group. In the matured partnerships the RDCs were exhausted and the limited partners had no further obligation to contribute capital. CSL theoretically had recourse against the unlimited liability of the general partner, but the general partner, EPIC, directly owed to CSL $14.7 million of the $82.3 million in advances involved in count I. Income of the matured partnerships was limited to whatever net rent the properties could produce. The structure of the transactions, however, had never anticipated that the net rents would carry the property, as evidenced by the need for RDCs.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Against this background, a major portion of MDIF\u2019s case was devoted to establishing that the CSL fiduciaries could not reasonably have expected to recover from equity in the partnerships\u2019 realty the advances which CSL continued to make. Insufficient equity in the EPIC product was relevant to count I where MDIF sought CSL\u2019s net loss on the loans to EPIC partnerships and entities. Insufficient equity in the EPIC product was also relevant to count III where the issue was basically whether the need for reasonable reserves for bad debts under the circumstances of this case made it unlawful to take dividends out of CSL.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The witness whom MDIF used to present its case as a cohesive whole was David A. Carpenter (Carpenter), the national director of litigation services for Coopers &amp; Lybrand, an international accounting and consulting firm. Carpenter\u2019s firm was engaged by MDIF to assist in day-to-day operations of the conservatorship and receivership and also to do a comprehensive analysis of the EPIC group transactions. That study involved approximately seventy EPIC related entities as well as approximately 360 EPIC partnerships. The study required examining documents which filled 2,000 transfiles. Over 100 different people expended over 20,000 hours of effort in the study.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">In Carpenter\u2019s opinion the CSL loans to EPIC entities ' were \u201cgrossly imprudent,\u201d for many reasons. They were used to fund negative cash flows, <em>i.e., </em>\u201creal money [with] [n]o depreciation included____\u201d The EPIC partnerships\u2019 negative cash flow for 1982 was $25 million. In a February 21, 1983, memorandum to Billman from a co-defendant, the combined cash flow deficit for that year was predicted to be $38.3 million. In fact it was $38.6 million, cumulatively, at the end of that year. By the end of 1984 the cash flow deficit was $51 million. When the conservator took possession in 1985 the cumulative, negative cash flow of the partnerships was $113 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">CSL had no lien on its only source of repayment, the EPIC product. CSL was a general, unsecured creditor, junior to the holders of the first liens. Carpenter testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>that the partnerships were highly leveraged. EMI purportedly made the first mortgage loans at 95% of value. Moreover, payment by the seller to EPIC of the RDCs meant that the partnerships were borrowing over 100%, and up to 120%, of value. Thus there was no equity from which CSL could be repaid. From an income standpoint the vacancy rate for EPIC product in January 1984 was 19.4%.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The fact that the ultimate repayment depended on rental housing as opposed to owner occupied dwellings increased the risk. To limit that risk a Maryland Department of Savings and Loan (DSL) regulation required associations to maintain a minimum of 50% of total assets invested in owner occupied dwellings. CSL\u2019s percentage was below 10% in 1983 and 1984 and below 20% in 1985. Indeed, a February 27, 1984, memorandum from CSL\u2019s president to Billman advised that CSL was $120 million short of the 50% minimum. In Carpenter\u2019s opinion risk was also increased by the geographical distance between CSL and the EPIC product. Of 18,084 houses owned by the partnerships as of January 1985, 58.19% were in Texas, 8.38% in California, 6.37% in Florida, and 5.28% in Arizona. This geographical concentration, particularly in Texas where real estate values were declining, also increased the risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Carpenter emphasized the poor resale record of EPIC product. EPIC internally projected sales of 693 homes in 1983, but 174 were sold. Of these, 161 were sold to resyndicated EPIC partnerships and only thirteen to independent third parties. For 1984 sales of 1,316 houses were projected, but 324 were actually sold. Of these, 301 were sold to resyndicated partnerships and only twenty-three to independent third parties. Eleven of those twenty-three sales included either ERNI\u2019s guarantee that a specified amount of rent would be paid by the tenant or ERNI\u2019s payment of a rental subsidy. For 1985 EPIC projected sales of over 10,000 homes. One hundred twenty-five were sold. One hundred seventeen of these sales included a rental guarantee or subsidy, six included no guarantee or subsidy, and two were sold to resyndicated partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>In May 1984 a financial services corporation, Private Ledger, rendered a due diligence report on one of the partnerships, EPIC Associates 84 VI. The defendants came into possession of a copy of the report and responded to it. EPIC\u2019s offering, the report said, \u201cis identical to buying a single house that is substantially (59%) over priced and rents for half of what it costs to carry.\u201d The report pointed out that EPIC\u2019s fees were \u201cVERY HIGH ... at least ... [50%] of the capital raised.\u201d It warned that the offering would probably be judged a \u201c \u2018Tax Abuse\u2019 \u201d because the venture lacked economic viability. It said \u201c[tjhere is no equity, to provide investors with an incentive to pay nonrecourse debt[.J\u201d Private Ledger thought that \u201c[t]he properties are so over financed and under rented that no amount of inflation can bail out the program.\u201d With respect to EPIC\u2019s projections the financial service said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AE\">\u201cThe sponsor\u2019s sales projections are erroneously based on appreciation from a false basis of value. Appreciation must be calculated from the properties\u2019 value which is the amount the seller netted from the sale ($3,003,000). The arbitrarily construed \u2018cost\u2019 ($3,701,875) is unrealistic and falsely over states value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">MDIF also produced evidence concerning the experiences which some mortgage insurers had with EPIC. Commonwealth Mortgage Insurance Company (Commonwealth) began insuring a small quantity of the EPIC product in early 1984. Dissatisfied with the results of spot check appraisals, that insurer ceased insuring the EPIC product in early December 1984. After receiving certain assurances from EPIC, the insurer resumed the relationship but terminated it again in August 1985. Commonwealth would not insure mortgages which exceeded 95% of market value. Commonwealth\u2019s president believed that EPIC \u201cvery knowingly\u201d loaned in excess of 95% of market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">General Electric Mortgage Insurance Company refused to insure mortgages on the EPIC product because, in essence, there was only one borrower, namely, EPIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Another insurer, Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation (MGIC), insured EPIC product mortgages as early as 1981. It refused to accept any more EPIC product in August 1983. Spot check appraisals by MGIC in June 1982 indicated that EPIC\u2019s appraisals contained inflated property values. In an internal report of June 1983 MGIC concluded that further spot check appraisals supported a theory that \u201cEPIC\u2019s value was artificially derived by adding builder fees/contributions in any given transaction to the true market value of the property.\u201d MGIC\u2019s vice president for residential underwriting at the time believed that the overvaluation may have been \u201cdue to a need to sell the property at a price that would make the partnership work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">Particularly noteworthy for present purposes is that these insurers were concerned about first liens which enjoyed priority over the unsecured advances by CSL involved in MDIF\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Emergency legislation addressing the May 1985 savings and loan crisis in Maryland included the merger of the private insurer of savings and loan accounts, Maryland Savings Share Insurance Corporation (MSSIC), into MDIF and the elimination of any deposit insurance by the State. As a result CSL and its related companies were examined by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (FHLBB) for possible insurance on accounts by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC). The examination was as of May 24, 1985. On June 21 Joseph Hilliard (Hilliard), the examiner in charge, preliminarily reported to C. Lamar Heath (Heath), the district director, that, in the opinion of the FHLBB\u2019s District Appraiser, \u201call of the appraisal reports [on the EPIC product] are overinflated from 20% to 25%, in effect[,] by the amount of the discounts given the purchaser by the builder/seller.\u201d In a cover memorandum dated August 21, 1985, transmitting the final report of examination on CSL, Hilliard advised Heath that CSL had substandard assets carried on the books at $107.8 million, representing 23.7% of CSL\u2019s assets, with potential indicated losses totaling $98.2 million. Substandard assets included <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>$52.1 million invested by CSL in EPIC partnership loans. Hilliard reported that \u201c[tjhese losses are the result of the properties being overvalued. The appraisal reports prepared on these security properties were found to be unacceptable for FHLB purposes and should be discounted a minimum of 25%.\u201d It was reported that CSL had $26.4 million of unrecorded second mortgage loans which \u201care a total loss\u201d and that EPIC corporations received $40.9 million of unsecured advances which \u201care total losses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">The FHLBB report was in part based on sample testing of the EPIC appraisals by Richard Hewitt (Hewitt), who had formerly been the chief appraiser for the FHLBB\u2019s Fourth District, headquartered in Atlanta. At the time he took the sampling, Hewitt was a private consultant. Appraisals for the first mortgage loans originated by CSL were arranged through Continental Appraisal Group (CAG), a company in which Billman and McCuistion held minority interests. Hewitt said that the appraisal guidelines of CAG did not require cash equivalency, that is, adjustment of the selling prices of comparable properties to typical market financing. Indeed, Hewitt found use of the EPIC product as the norm or market to which comparables were adjusted, rather than to a third party lender\u2019s financial norm.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In addition, Hewitt testified that RDCs ranged from 20% to 25% of the purported purchase price. In each of the ten or fifteen appraisals which Hewitt reviewed there was a \u201ccarry through\u201d from the RDCs. To illustrate, Hewitt used a hypothetical transaction in which the purchase price is $100,000, real estate commission is $6,800 (paid to EPIC), and RDC is $24,000, so that the net purchase price is $69,200. With a $95,000 mortgage (95% of $100,000, assuming $100,000 is the value of the property), EPIC walked away from settlement with $25,800.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">Hewitt then explained the effect on his opinion of the scale of EPIC\u2019s operations.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-7\">\u201cAgain, if the value of the home was $100,000, that is one thing. If that is the market value of the home, and certainly if for whatever reason you are able to go to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>market where homes similar to this property are worth $100,000, but through your superior negotiating ability or what have you you find a good deal, quote unquote, and that happens from time to time. You are able to get a good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-4\">\u201cI think every purchaser in the market is looking for the good deal. You may be able to buy at less than the true market value of a piece of property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">\u201cQ Okay, so this is a good deal, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-6\"><em>\u201cA </em>In its classic sense, that would be a good deal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-7\">\u201cQ There is nothing wrong with getting a good deal, is there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-8\"><em>\u201cA </em>Oh, absolutely not. It makes the whole system work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-9\">\u201cQ Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-10\"><em>\u201cA </em>However, and what hit me, quite frankly, was the scale of the operation where we were dealing with approximately 20,000 homes, it seemed very questionable to me that anyone would be able to go across the country and routinely be able to buy homes for 25 percent less than the market value of those homes. That just sounded absurd on its face.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">Further, Hewitt was very familiar with the Texas real estate market which was \u201cin horrible shape\u201d in the summer of 1985. For these reasons Hewitt recommended to FHLBB that the real purchase value of the EPIC product be reduced by 25% to 40% of the purported purchase prices paid, depending on the market in which a particular property was located. Relying to a large degree on Hewitt\u2019s opinion, FHLBB wrote down CSL\u2019s assets by $77.1 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">Prior to trial of this case Hewitt and his staff studied a larger sample of the EPIC product. That study included on site inspections in various states. At trial Hewitt opined that the appraisal and loan underwriting practices at CSL with respect to its advances to EPIC and the EPIC partnerships were \u201cvery reckless.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The conservator appointed for CSL was Bruce McPherson who was accepted as an expert in lending practices. In his view CSL\u2019s loans to the EPIC partnerships and entities were \u201cgrossly imprudent and recklessly endangered the life of the institution.\u201d There were 3,176 loans to EPIC partnerships, totalling $27.7 million. These loans were documented as second trusts on 3,100 houses, but the instruments were not recorded so that the loans were unsecured.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> By the time of trial 2,225 of these houses had been sold. Approximately 2% of the houses, that is, fifty-four of them, had sufficient equity to repay the CSL loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">On the valuation issue, MDIF\u2019s case did not lack confirmation from within EPIC. A CPA, Linda Smith (Smith), was controller and, later, vice president for asset management at EPIC. She served on the Disposition Committee, one of the tasks of which was to identify particular houses to be sold at arms length or included in a resyndication. As an aid for that analysis, Smith did a computer run on data as of September 5, 1984, involving certain EPIC partnerships which owned a total of 1,141 housing units. Smith projected the effect of liquidating each unit, and she aggregated the results to simulate a total liquidation of each partnership involved. In the principal projection Smith assumed selling costs of 4% of the selling price. She used the highest currently available appraisal as the selling price. The results were presented to the Disposition Committee in a blue covered, spiral bound book (the Blue Book). The Blue Book revealed that so many of the partnerships, if liquidated, would be unable fully to return capital to limited partners after payment of the partnership debts that one of Billman\u2019s co-defendants ordered Smith to destroy all copies of the Blue Book. Smith, however, did not destroy all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>copies. She retained one for herself, which became an exhibit at trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">Smith also analyzed the data by classifying the 1,141 properties into four categories. Class A assumed selling costs of 12%, representing a 6% real estate sales commission, four points paid by the seller, and seller\u2019s closing costs equal to 2%. On that assumption, which the jury could have found to be reasonable, only ninety-five properties would sell at prices which would net an amount sufficient to pay the first mortgage, all advances, and all capital contributions by limited partners. That is to say, only ninety-five properties would fulfill the EPIC concept. If selling costs were assumed to be 4% of the selling price, 522 properties (Class B) would produce a small, partial return on capital to limited partners. If the properties could be sold without any selling costs, that is, resyndicated, six properties (Class C) could repay all advances but would not return any capital. Even on the assumption that there would be no costs of sale, 518 properties, or 45.4% of all properties in the study, would not pay back the advances, much less return any capital to the partners (Class D).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">An attorney, Mark Moorstein (Moorstein), worked for EPIC from May 1983 to July 1984. He was hired as special assistant to the president of EPIC, Leonard Meltz, one of the defendants. By early September of 1983 Moorstein became director of EPIC\u2019s Offerings Department and in January 1984 a vice president of EPIC. His concerns about the EPIC concept caused him to make a number of studies. He found that the vacancy rates and length of vacancies in the EPIC product were higher than represented in the private placement memoranda used to sell participations in the partnerships. He studied the ratio of houses acquired to houses sold and found that there was a \u201ctremendous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>accumulation of unsold houses[.]\u201d From mid-1982 to mid-1983 the ratio of houses acquired to houses sold was 1.1 to one. From mid-1983 to mid-1984 the ratio was four to one. This meant that the cost of maintaining those houses was continually escalating. This confirmed in Moorstein\u2019s mind \u201cthat the entire structure was, in effect, a house of cards.\u201d Moorstein sent the results of his studies to the \u201cmajor players,\u201d including Billman. Moorstein was fired for causing \u201c \u2018too much disruption in the company.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">It was also essential to the continued marketing of participations in EPIC\u2019s tax shelters that EPIC be able to include in its private placement offering memoranda an unqualified opinion by independent auditors, and it was highly desirable that the auditing firm have a national reputation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> From the inception of all of the companies in the EPIC group their auditor was a firm local to northern Virginia, James C. Jones &amp; Co. (Jones). In the financials on which Jones had opined, EPIC presented the RDCs as income to EPIC upon EPIC\u2019s receipt of an RDC from a builder.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">In the fall of 1979 EPIC engaged Arthur Andersen to audit that year\u2019s statements. The fees paid back by the builders to EPIC at that time were 5% to 7% of the selling price. Arthur Andersen concluded that builders\u2019 fees could not be treated as income until realized by syndication to third parties of the limited partnership. The auditors so advised EPIC. At a meeting on April 15, 1980, between the auditors, Billman and others, Billman dismissed Arthur Andersen and advised that Jones would complete the audit for 1979.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">In June 1982 officials of EPIC approached Price Water-house to become the corporate auditors. Price Waterhouse took the position that an RDC could be treated as income only to the extent that it offset direct costs incurred in the acquisition of the property. The balance of an RDC would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>have to be deferred until the house was sold because it was that event which demonstrated whether a profit had actually been made. James F. Chadbourne, III (Chadbourne) of Price Waterhouse testified that this proposed accounting change would have caused EPIC to report losses rather than profits and would have wiped out EPIC\u2019s net worth. Price Waterhouse was not hired. Chadbourne was later told by an EPIC official that Fox &amp; Co. (Fox) had been engaged and that Fox did not have any problem with EPIC\u2019s accounting policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">Fox prepared EPIC\u2019s financial statements for the year ending December 31, 1982, in which RDCs were treated consistently with the manner in which Jones had presented the financials. Fox audited CSL and EPIC for 1983 but changed the method of accounting for RDCs. Instead of recognizing income upon closing of the purchase from the selling builder, the fee income was deferred until the limited partnership participations were sold. On January 1, 1985, Fox combined with the national accounting firm, Alexander Grant (Grant), which audited CSL and EPIC for the year ending December 31, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">The partner at Fox, and later at Grant, who directed these audits was Stephen Leser (Leser), a witness called by Billman. Leser had not established any significant reserve for bad debts on CSL\u2019s loans to, and accounts receivable from, EPIC partnerships and related entities. On direct examination Leser testified that he had assessed the reasonableness of the collectability of the advances by annually appreciating the EPIC product at rates which balanced with certain federally collected statistics for rates of appreciation on houses nationally for the years involved. On cross-examination Leser acknowledged that he also relied on the \u201cclient rep letter,\u201d in which the audited corporation\u2019s management represented to the auditors that all books and records had been made available to the auditors, that management had made adequate provisions for uncollectable accounts, and that there had been no event subsequent to the end of the audit year which would significantly affect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>the financial condition of the company. In the course of his cross-examination Leser acknowledged that, as auditor, he had not been advised of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-4\">\u2014letters from DSL identifying regulatory violations concerning investment portfolio requirements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-5\">\u2014the reorganization of February 28, 1985, (in which Billman cashed out) that was reflected in three volumes of documents, including a consolidated financial statement presenting the effect of the reorganization as a $9 million negative net worth for EPIC Holdings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-6\">\u2014that various mortgage insurers had refused to insure, or to continue to insure, first mortgages on the EPIC product;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-7\">\u2014that the Blue Book had been prepared and its destruction ordered; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-8\">\u2014that certain housing units had been classified A through D or that there was a negative significance for the \u201cD\u201d classification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Leser agreed that he would have wanted to know these, and other facts not enumerated above, when evaluating the extent to which reserves should have been established for uncollectable accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">Against the foregoing review of some of the relevant evidence, we address the unadmitted documents. Of these, we need only consider eleven, because in their brief to this Court respondents have attempted to demonstrate prejudice from only eleven of the documents. Inasmuch as prejudice is not presumed, it is incumbent upon the movant for a mistrial to persuade the reviewing court that the movant has probably been prejudiced. Using an erroneous standard of presumed prejudice, the Court of Special Appeals essentially rested its reversal on an enumeration of proposed, but unadmitted, exhibits identified by MDIF. Respondents have not attempted to explain how probable prejudice arose from many of the documents identified by the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Nor do we accept respondents\u2019 attempt to enlarge beyond their argument the number of unadmitted documents to be reviewed. Respondents say that \u201cspace limitations permitted a discussion of only representative documents.\u201d Respondents Brief at 42. This Court fairly assumes that experienced counsel, who were also respondents\u2019 counsel at trial, have selected those documents on which the strongest arguments of prejudice can be made. In any event, Maryland Rule 8-503(d) permits enlargement of the length of a brief with permission of this Court, but respondents did not seek permission to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">At oral argument, in response to a question from this Court as to what was the most prejudicial of the unadmitted documents, respondents pinpointed a copy of an article from <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>of September 5, 1985. It is headed, \u201cCommunity S &amp; L\u2019s Accounting for 1984 Stirs Wide Debate,\u201d and it is subheaded, \u201cBooking of Certain Items As Profit Is Questioned By Several in Profession.\u201d The lead sentence reads: \u201cAccounting practices that permitted [CSL] to shore up its profit and net worth for 1984 are the subject of intense debate in the accounting profession.\u201d The next three paragraphs give background which the jury had available to it in excruciatingly detailed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The next paragraph quotes an accounting professor in the business school at Dartmouth College as asserting that \u201c[CSL] is using the most liberal accounting treatments available and playing the kind of games that have gotten many thrifts into trouble over the past few years.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> After a balancing paragraph quoting the president of EPIC as saying that EPIC followed generally accepted accounting practices, the article went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>\u201cBut Prof. Shank and other accountants believe that [EPIC] should have booked only as much as 25% of the $67 million in builders\u2019 loan origination and partnership organization fees that it credited totally to 1984 revenue. \u2018Basic accounting principles say that you can\u2019t take fees into profit until you have a bona fide arm\u2019s length buyer for the homes,\u2019 Prof. Shank maintained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Assuming that the builders\u2019 loan origination fees referred to are the RDCs, the jury had already heard that accountants held differing opinions, with Jones at one end of the spectrum, with Arthur Andersen and Price Waterhouse maintaining another position, and with Fox/Grant having shifted position between 1982 and 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\"><em>The Wall Street Journal </em>article then quoted an unidentified accountant at a major firm who viewed CSL\u2019s receivables as \u201c \u2018very dubious.\u2019 \u201d The jury had been inundated with evidence to that effect. The article then referred to the concern of regulators that accounting treatments in thrifts which were too conservative could sink the institutions. The article again quoted the professor (\u201c \u2018[M]ost of the rule makers and regulators seem to be convinced that the health of the nation and the economy requires such a charade.\u2019 \u201d), referred to the engagement of Jones (who declined comment), quoted Grant\u2019s Washington, D.C. managing partner (\u201c \u2018[W]e feel we were right in issuing a clean opinion.\u2019 \u201d), and referred to Arthur Andersen\u2019s declining, in 1979, to accept engagement from EPIC.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">Respondents emphasize the lead sentence of the last paragraph in the article reading: \u201cDenver-based Fox &amp; Co., Inc., an accounting firm that had problems with federal regulators over several of its audits, became [EPIC\u2019s] auditor in 1982.\u201d The jury in the case before us had already heard that federal regulators had \u201cproblems\u201d with Fox/Grant over the results of its audit of CSL. In considering CSL for insurance, the FHLBB examiners wiped from CSL\u2019s balance sheet $77.1 million in assets which Fox/Grant had, by their unqualified opinion, implicitly opined to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>reasonably collectable. There is no probable prejudice in <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>article.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">Respondents assert that two of the unadmitted documents \u201cwere extremely prejudicial because they supported MDIF\u2019s claims that defendants had arranged inflated appraisals.\u201d Respondents Brief at 41. One document is a thirty-eight page listing of appraisers, arranged by states. The list was shown to Hewitt on cross-examination by respondents\u2019 counsel, but was not offered into evidence. Hewitt testified that he had seen lists of appraisers on which some of the names were marked \u201cdo not use.\u201d Hewitt knew one of the appraisers whose name was so, marked, telephoned him, and was told that the appraiser had not given EPIC what it wanted. Respondents\u2019 counsel showed Hewitt the entire list and developed that it contained 353 names, that only twenty-two names were crossed off, and that some of the notations read \u201cslow,\u201d \u201climited\u201d or \u201cslow on volume deals.\u201d Cross-examination also developed that Hewitt had telephoned only one of the twenty-two persons whose names had been deleted. During Hewitt\u2019s cross respondents\u2019 counsel saw no outweighing prejudice in injecting the entire list into the case. That is not a basis for a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">The other document which is said to support MDIF\u2019s claims of inflated appraisals is a sheet of paper, one-half of which contained longhand notes with no identification of the author. The notes in part read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">\u201cGE Mtg Ins\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">1) Concerns \u2014 valuations\u2014our property is over appraised</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">* coverage would indemnify premium\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">From the context, the first line necessarily is the abbreviation of \u201cGeneral Electric Mortgage Insurance.\u201d The jury had already repeatedly heard that private mortgage insurers were concerned that the partnership houses were over appraised.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Respondents also have cited an August 1,1985, memorandum by Heath to his file, describing a meeting held on July 24, 1985, which was attended by officials of FHLBB, MDIF and CSL, including CSL\u2019s outside counsel. The memorandum records the points made by the examiners in explaining why their report would recommend against FSLIC insurance for CSL. All of those reasons were fully covered in the evidence. The trial court had refused to admit Heath\u2019s memorandum when it was offered on direct examination of an FHLBB examiner who had attended the meeting.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Respondents quote a sentence from the memorandum in which Heath considers it \u201capparent\u201d from outside counsel\u2019s remarks that counsel and CSL \u201c \u2018will attempt to convince Supervision/FHLBB officials that Community be allowed to continue the EPIC game with insurance of accounts.\u2019 \u201d Respondents Brief at 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In referring on August 1, 1985, to the EPIC \u201cgame,\u201d Heath was encapsulating what the examiners had already discovered about the relationship of CSL to EPIC. In a June 21 memorandum to Heath from Hilliard, which is in evidence, Hilliard described the \u201cgame\u201d more elegantly, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-5\">\u201cCommunity/EPIC is a real estate syndication operation on a nationwide scale with over 300 tax shelter partnerships currently active involving probably one to two billion dollars. <em>Community\u2019s primary role in this operation is to provide funds to finance the operation. </em>The success of the partnership concept is predicated on appre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ciation in the marketplace. In the past several years, residential rental property of the type securing these partnerships has not had a history of appreciation. The complexity of this organization continues to defy description. <em>However, it can unequivocally be stated that Community\u2019s primary function is to serve EPIC, rather than to provide savings/loans to a local market. </em>The risk in this type of operation is not in any way reasonable or appropriate for FSLIC to assume.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">(Emphasis added). Heath\u2019s August 1, 1985, memorandum is cumulative.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Another of the documents which was not formally marked into evidence was a copy of an article entitled, <em>Creative Finance and the Review Appraiser, </em>reproduced from the fall 1981 issue of <em>Appraisal Review Journal, </em>published by the National Association of Review Appraisers. During MDIF\u2019s cross-examination of the defendants\u2019 real estate expert, Robert Stehm (Stehm), the witness was shown a copy of this article which was marked for identification. Without objection, MDIF\u2019s counsel read to Stehm a paragraph from the article quoting a savings and loan executive as saying that appraisals were currently being adjusted for builder concessions, that the adjustments are required by FHLBB regulations, and that the current frequency of creative financing should \u201ccause lenders to request adjustments for financing terms on residential appraisals.\u201d The witness agreed that the paragraph was \u201cexactly\u201d what MDIF\u2019s real estate expert, Hewitt, had told the jury. MDIF\u2019s counsel then moved on to another point. Now respondents argue that their expert was contradicted by the last sentence of the article (\u201cReview Appraisers should make adjustments for financing terms on residential appraisals the rule rather than the exception\u201d). We find no substantial difference between Hewitt\u2019s testimony, the last sentence and the paragraph read to the jury, without objec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>tion, in the question to Stehm.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Another unadmitted document which was also marked for identification on MDIF\u2019s cross-examination of Stehm, consists of certain pages from a book entitled, <em>Harrison\u2019s Illustrated Guide, How to Fill Out a Freddie Mac-Fannie Mae Residential Appraisal Report. </em>Again MDIF\u2019s counsel read a paragraph from the work while propounding a question to Stehm. That paragraph stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that builder concessions must be reported for the subject property and the comparables, and the value adjusted accordingly. McCuistion\u2019s counsel objected, and the objection was overruled, but MDIF\u2019s counsel did not pursue the line further.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">Now respondents complain that a different portion of the document contradicted Stehm\u2019s testimony. One of the reproduced pages describes the income approach to valuation. In their case the defendants took the position that one of Hewitt\u2019s conclusions was that the income approach should have been used in valuing the EPIC product. This characterization of Hewitt\u2019s testimony was one with which the jury might, or might not, have agreed. Stehm testified that \u201c[t]he income approach is not normally utilized in valuing a single-family home, because single-family homes are built in this country, substantially, for the most part, to be owner-occupied.\u201d He said that \u201c[y]ou don\u2019t build 1,500 homes in a subdivision, and say 1496 are for owners, and four are for tenants.\u201d In <em>Harrison\u2019s Illustrated Guide, </em>the discussion of the income approach for valuing residential property is introduced by the following statement: \u201cIf the subject property is located in a neighborhood where rentals predominant and rental data is readily available together with sales, then this [income] approach to value should be used prior to final reconciliation.\u201d We find no prejudice. Indeed, to the extent that the jury thought that Hewitt had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>advocated across the board use of the income approach on the EPIC product, the material complained of in <em>Harrison\u2019s Illustrated Guide </em>benefitted the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">Excerpts from the depositions of three individuals were also in the box found in the jury room. Maryland Rule 2-521(a) provides that \u201ca deposition may not be taken into the jury room without the agreement of all parties and consent of the court.\u201d The purpose of the rule is to prevent a jury from giving undue weight to the testimony of a witness which is preserved in written form, as contrasted with testimony from live witnesses which jurors must ordinarily recall without the aid of a transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">One of the excerpts is from the deposition of a defendant, Barbara A. McKinney (McKinney). The excerpt consists of four and one-half pages from the deposition transcript, with twenty documents attached. The excerpt deals with an airplane race for female pilots and co-pilots held in June 1984 between termini in Georgia and the State of Washington. Billman\u2019s secretary, who owned the plane, and McKinney participated as pilot and co-pilot respectively. CSL was charged with the expenses of their participation. The documents attached to the deposition excerpt are copies of vouchers and other charges itemizing costs to CSL which totaled over $5,000. The basic facts set forth above were testified to by Elaine Dudash (Dudash), a vice president and member of the board of directors of CSL whose employment there antedated CSL\u2019s acquisition by Billman. Other copies of the exact same vouchers and charges were received into evidence under another premarked exhibit number during the direct examination of Dudash. The excerpts from McKinney\u2019s deposition were read to the jury in the course of Dudash\u2019s redirect. The description of the airplane race expenses was a very small part of the evidence of waste, which was part of the proof on count VI, claiming excessive compensation. Under these circumstances the error was not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>The other two deposition excerpts were pre-marked as potential exhibits for the defendant Billman. One excerpt is from the deposition of Ejaner J. Johnson (Johnson) which was taken in this case. Johnson was chief of staff to the Governor of Maryland in 1985 and was active in the State\u2019s response to the Maryland savings and loan crisis. He was unavailable to testify at trial due to illness. The defendants sought to prove through the excerpts that the collapse of a private insurer of savings and loan accounts in Ohio in early 1985 had been caused by the run on a single association in that state and that, in Johnson\u2019s opinion, the crisis in Maryland similarly had been caused by the run on Old Court Savings &amp; Loan Association. The circuit court would not accept Johnson as an expert on these broad issues of economic causation. Thus the defense case was actually benefitted by the availability to the jury of the Johnson deposition excerpts.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">The parties are under the impression that the entire Johnson deposition was available to the jury. They have included all seventy-eight pages of deposition transcript in the 10,679 page joint record extract. The unadmitted document, which was identified as \u201cDefendant\u2019s Exhibit Bill-man 958,\u201d however, is an excerpt of twenty-three pages, limited to Johnson\u2019s background and to the \u201ccausation\u201d testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Respondents assert that the Johnson deposition contains repeated references to the \u201cSpecial Counsel\u201d and the \u201cPreston Report.\u201d The Special Counsel was a private attorney selected by the Governor and paid by the State who investigated, and rendered a factual report to the Governor on, the background of the savings and loan crisis in Maryland. In the background portion of the excerpt Johnson simply says that the only relevant document he still possesses is a copy of the Report of Special Counsel, known as the Preston Report.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In the same vein respondents also now complain of an excerpt from a deposition of E. Scott Moore, Esq. (Moore) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>who from 1976 to 1979 had been a director of MSSIC.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Respondents have no quarrel with the content of the Moore excerpts, but they say that the title page reflects that the deposition was taken by Special Counsel and the matter is captioned, \u201cIn re: Special Counsel, Savings and Loan Investigation.\u201d Moore was not identified to the jury. He had no connection with CSL. Nevertheless, respondents argue that the jury might have inferred that Special Counsel\u2019s role was to conduct a criminal investigation of CSL. That argument is fanciful. It is also contrary to the evaluation by defense counsel who sought to introduce the excerpt from the Johnson deposition even though it does not expressly negate the possibility that Special Counsel was a criminal prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">Another unadmitted document deemed prejudicial by respondents is a civil action complaint by MDIF in another action, <em>State v. Hogg.</em><footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On the fifty-fifth trial day the circuit court quashed a defense subpoena for a Deputy Attorney General of Maryland who had been counsel for MDIF in <em>Hogg, </em>an action brought by MDIF, as successor to MSSIC, against former officers and directors of MSSIC. The defendants in the instant action sought to show through the subpoenaed witness that MDIF had taken the position that the proximate cause of the collapse of CSL was the failure of MSSIC to enforce its own regulations. As part of that showing the present defendants intended to introduce the first amended complaint filed in the <em>Hogg </em>action. The trial judge refused to require the Deputy Attorney General to appear. The first amended complaint was then marked for identification, essentially as part of the defendants\u2019 proffer. Respondents took no exception to, and did not disassociate themselves from, the proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>In their brief respondents select certain allegations in the <em>Hogg </em>complaint as demonstrating prejudice. For example, the complaint alleged \u201c[CSL] aggressively pursued deposits which were used by its management to prop up EPIC\u2019s faltering tax shelter empire and to divert extraordinary amounts of fees to [CSL] Insiders.\u201d Despite that, and similar allegations, defense counsel sought to introduce the <em>Hogg </em>complaint because of other allegations. For example, it alleged that the breaches of fiduciary duty on the part of MSSIC\u2019s former officers and directors \u201cwere the proximate cause of losses and damage to MDIF, as successor in interest to MSSIC[.]\u201d We find no prejudice, particularly since the allegedly prejudicial allegations were the subject of MDIF\u2019s proof in the instant matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">The final unadmitted document which respondents select for argument was premarked as a potential plaintiffs\u2019 exhibit. It consists of three pages containing longhand notes, all of which appear to be in the same handwriting. From its content one might infer that the document was prepared in 1982. Page one itemizes four advances to \u201cTJB\u201d between September 1980 and April 1981. Pages two and three are a list of things \u201cTo Do\u201d relating to one of the insider partnerships known as 100A. One of these tasks was to prepare an analysis on the assumption that there was, or would be, a sale on June 30, 1982, of all properties owned by 100A. Immediately below we reproduce the third page of the memo. All parties agree that the abbreviation \u201cEA,\u201d for EPIC Associates, can be read as referring to the limited partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">Respondents\u2019 sole point requires reading the three letter initials above as \u201cTJB.\u201d That position is untenable, particularly when the letters are compared to the initials \u201cTJB\u201d as set forth on page one of the same document. MDIF submits that the initials are \u201cJCJ\u201d and refer to James C. Jones, the outside auditor. While that is a more reasonable reading of the initials themselves, we need not so decide. It is a sufficient disposition of respondents\u2019 contention that the letters are not \u201cTJB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">For all of the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying respondents\u2019 motion for a mistrial. Nor is the denial of the motion a denial of due process as respondents argue. Consequently, this appeal must be remanded to the Court of Special Appeals for consideration of the other arguments raised by the respondents which were not addressed by the intermediate appellate court and which form no part of the issues raised in MDIF\u2019s petition for certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS VACATED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY TOM J. BILLMAN AND CRYSOPT CORPORATION. COSTS IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO ABIDE THE RESULT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-12\">. The complaint is brought by MDIF as receiver and by CSL. For brevity\u2019s sake we shall refer only to MDIF, as if it were the sole plaintiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b71-6\">. In <em>Allen v. Georgia, </em>166 U.S. 138, 17 S.Ct. 525, 41 L.Ed. 949 (1897), the Court found no denial of due process in the dismissal by the Supreme Court of Georgia of the appeal in a capital punishment case where the prisoner had fled but had been recaptured.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b77-6\">. In addition, the first order directing respondents to give discovery in aid of enforcement of a money judgment, and the contempt order enforcing that discovery order, were entered before there was a final judgment. MDIF had sought punitive damages on its claims. The punitive damages issue was submitted to the jury after its verdict on compensatory damages, but, before any verdict on punitive damages was rendered, the circuit court declared a mistrial. No party argues that the grounds for that mistrial are relevant to the issues before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The circuit court certified, under Maryland Rule 2-602, the judgments entered on the verdicts for compensatory damages. That certification was ineffective because MDIF's claims were not wholly terminated due to the outstanding request for punitive damages on the same claims. Final judgment was not entered as to respondents until MDIF had voluntarily dismissed its request for punitive damages and until a bankruptcy judge in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia had signed an order dismissing Billman from federal bankruptcy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b80-10\">. Respondents made no argument in the Court of Special Appeals that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts on any of MDIF\u2019s claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b81-6\">. Essentially, the funds advanced by CSL through EMI on the purchase money, first lien mortgages are not involved in the case before us. EMI either sold those mortgages to other lenders or sold interests in pools of those mortgages to other lenders, as evidenced by mortgage pass through certificates. These purchase money mortgages and pass through certificates were privately insured. The efforts of the private insurers to rescind their coverage for alleged fraud are recounted in <em>Foremost Guaranty Corp. v. Meritor Savings Bank, </em>910 F.2d 118 (4th Cir.1990), <em>aff\u2019g in part and rev\u2019g in part In re Epic Mortgage Ins. Litigation, </em>701 F.Supp. 1192 (E.D.Va.1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b84-5\">. Specifically, MDIF claimed the total of the purchase prices, $417,-340, and the total of the tax payments, $397,054, less the investment by EPIC Holdings in the two leasing corporations, namely, $1,000 each.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b92-5\">. The difference of seventy-six between the number of loans and the number of houses apparently reflects instances where the same house was offered as collateral twice so that, if all recordings had been accomplished, seventy-six of the loans would have been \"secured\" by a third lien.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\">. Billman was a member of the Disposition Committee and a copy of the Blue Book was prepared for him. Smith could not recall whether Billman was present at the meeting at which the instructions to destroy the Blue Book were given. Billman\u2019s handwriting does appear on one ancillary analysis derived from the Blue Book data.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b94-7\">. One result of the March 1983 merger of EPIC and the service company was to place both EPIC and CSL on a calendar year basis for financial statements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">. <em>The Wall Street Journal </em>article was identified during MDIF\u2019s cross-examination of defense witness, Buckford Wallingford, an economist whose general thesis was that CSL\u2019s failure was caused by economic forces above and beyond the control of the defendants. The witness attended Dartmouth business school but did not know the professor who was quoted in the article.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. McCuistion\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the document was not contemporaneous with the meeting. The trial court did not agree. The trial court then focused on one sentence in which Heath says that CSL\u2019s outside counsel \"made some asinine remarks about operating a \u2018vanilla association\u2019 so it could lose money.\" The trial court's view was that this type of \"pejorative\" comment was not appropriate to minutes of a meeting so that the memorandum was not a business record. We need not review that analysis of business record admissibility because respondents\u2019 claim of prejudice does not rest on the sentence in the memorandum singled out by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. Stehm disagreed with Hewitt that the RDC should reduce the market value of the houses because, in Stehm\u2019s words, \u201d[t]hat\u2019s a business deal that's been established between \u2014 a business consideration between the buyer and the seller.
