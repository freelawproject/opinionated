The circuit court reversed approvals of the developer\u2019s project plan and preliminary plan after concluding that certain features of the county\u2019s sector plan were invalid. Because the questioned provisions of the sector plan, even if invalid, do not affect the validity of the granted approvals, we shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>Part of the Montgomery County planning process has focused on a sector consisting of the Silver Spring central business district (the CBD) and vicinity. This sector plan has been in effect since at least 1975. The CBD includes the major intersection of Georgia Avenue and Colesville Road and, at Colesville Road and Wayne Avenue, the Silver Spring Station of the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area rail rapid transit system (the Metro).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Much of the land in the CBD is zoned for business use as CBD-2 and CBD-3.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">For approximately twelve years following adoption of the 1975 plan, there had not been any new residential construction in the CBD. The area had also suffered a decline in retail facilities, including loss of a department store. On the other hand, over two million square feet of new office space had been built during that period in the CBD along the roads leading to the Metro station.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">In November 1987 the County Council of Montgomery County, sitting as a district council, adopted an amendment to the sector plan for the CBD. See Md.Code (1957, 1990 Repl.Vol.), Art. 28, \u00a7\u00a7 7-108 and 8-101. Among the amendment\u2019s objectives were \u201cto remove outdated staging provisions related to sewage capacity limitations, to include provisions related to allocating most transportation capacity to the core area, [and] to restrict major new development to an area that best serves public policy and design guidelines____\u201d The amendment defined the core area.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It embraces the Metro station and the quadrants of the Coles<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>ville Road-Georgia Avenue intersection. Excluded from the core is that part of the CBD farthest from the Metro station. Land zoned CBD-2 and CBD-3 lies both within and without the core.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">The sector plan amendment also set forth certain development guidelines \u201c[i]n order to achieve the retail and residential goals of the 1975 Sector Plan which [have] been lacking____\u201d These development guidelines operated only during development Stage II, a period which began with the November 10,1987, approval of the amendment and expired December 31, 1989. Two of these interim development guidelines are in issue in the present case. One in part provides that \u201c[o]ptional method projects for non-residential development may be approved only for properties within the Stage II Core Area____\u201d The other in part provides that \u201c[o]ptional method projects for residential development may not have more than 12.5% of the floor area in commercial use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b568-9\">Montgomery County adopted an adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) in 1973. The APFO is in practice implemented by an annual growth policy (AGP) adopted by the County Council. A substantial factor in an AGP is the prevention or reduction of unacceptable motor vehicle traffic congestion. For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, performance evaluation criteria were in effect for the CBD for reviewing the adequacy of that local area\u2019s transportation under the AGP (the LATR Guidelines). Review for preliminary subdivision approval considers compliance with the LATR Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-10\">Over the five year period preceding May 1988, approximately 8.2 acres of land (the Silver Triangle) in the Stage II core area of the CBD had been assembled by interests which we shall call, collectively, Moore &amp; Associates, Inc. (Moore). The Silver Triangle lies along the southeast side of Colesville Road and is bisected from northwest to southeast by Georgia Avenue. The southwest point of the Silver Triangle is across Wayne Avenue from the Metro station. The Silver Triangle is zoned CBD-3. Under \u00a7 59-C-6.215 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>of the Montgomery County Zoning Ordinance (the Ordinance or Ord.), properties in CBD-2 and CBD-3 zones may be developed either under the standard method or under the optional method (OMD). Under OMD \u201cgreater densities may be permitted and there are fewer specific standards [than under the standard method], but certain public facilities and amenities must be provided by the developer.\u201d Ord. \u00a7 59-C-6.215(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In May 1988 Moore applied to the Montgomery County Planning Board (the Board)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for its approval, known as project plan approval, of an OMD for the Silver Triangle. Moore proposed to develop 2,031,113 square feet in retail, hotel, office and parking uses, including two full service department stores. The project contemplated using air rights over, and subsurface rights beneath, Georgia Avenue. The Board found that the proposal complied with the Ordinance, the sector plan, the APFO and the LATR Guidelines. In October 1988 the Board approved the project plan. At that time the Board also approved Moore\u2019s preliminary plan under the subdivision regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The instant appellees, Patricia F. Singer et al. (Appellees), thereafter brought this administrative appeal, challenging both Board approvals. The circuit court, in July 1989, reversed the Board\u2019s approval of the project plan and, \u201cinsofar as it depends upon\u201d the project plan, the Board\u2019s approval of the preliminary plan. That court viewed the two development guidelines that restricted OMD uses outside of the core area to be zoning prohibitions which had not been adopted by amendment of the Ordinance and its accompanying maps so that those guidelines were invalid under the rule of <em>West Montgomery County Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 183, 522 A.2d 1328 (1987). For reasons to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>described more fully below, the circuit court concluded that the invalidity of the development guidelines voided the Board\u2019s approvals of the Silver Triangle project.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Moore and, later, the Board moved to alter or amend the judgment. By a supplemental order in November 1989 the circuit court stated that the Board\u2019s approval of the project plan was reversed \u201cbecause of the reliance ... on the 1987 Sector Plan Amendment ..., provisions] of which are, in light of applicable zoning, ineffective ... and because the rights of [the Appellees in this Court] may have been prejudiced by such reliance____\u201d The court further \u201cORDERED, that in no other respect has the Court made any determination concerning the validity or invalidity of the 1987 Amendment to the Sector Plan____\u201d Thus, the court did not invalidate the amended sector plan in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-8\">Moore, Montgomery County and the Board appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. Each appellant then separately petitioned this Court to issue the writ of certiorari. We did so in advance of consideration of the matter by the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b570-10\">Appellees have moved to dismiss the appeal as moot and have furnished supplemental material to support that motion. It is the Appellees\u2019 position that the case has become moot,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\">\u201cnot from the passage of time, but from the conscious and deliberate decision of all appellants to acquiesce in the Circuit Court\u2019s decision: the County by amending the Sector Plan to eliminate the problematic provisions; Moore by seeking new approvals in place of the ones that were reversed; and the Planning Board by approving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>those applications on the basis of the newly amended Sector Plan.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">Appellees Brief at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It appears that in July 1989 Moore submitted new applications for project plan and preliminary plan approvals to the Board. The plans submitted were identical to those previously approved in all presently relevant aspects. Between late October 1989 and January 26, 1990, the CBD sector plan was amended to delete the two development guidelines found to be \u201cineffective\u201d by the circuit court.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On January 26,1990, the Board approved the project plan as conforming with the sector plan \u201cand the recent amendment,\u201d and the Board also approved the preliminary plan. No one appealed these approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">In its January 1990 approval of the project plan, however, the Board added as a condition that Moore must enter into an agreement with the Board under which Moore will provide to the Board \u201con or before June 29,1990, acceptable documentation demonstrating a commitment by two acceptable anchor stores to be located in the retail mall.\u201d The condition recites that the parties to the agreement \u201ccan mutually agree to extend the date by which such commitments must be provided if events related to the Board\u2019s approval, and which are beyond the control of [Moore], so warrant.\u201d But, \u201c[fjailure to produce the two commitments within any time frame then agreed to shall constitute noncompliance with this condition.\u201d In the October 1988 Board approvals there had been a requirement for documentation demonstrating the commitment of two acceptable anchor stores for the Silver Triangle project, but that requirement operated as a condition of site approval, not of OMD project plan approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Representations of even later facts, made to this Court by counsel at oral argument in October 1990, reveal that the difference in the two approvals has ongoing, substantial, legal significance. It appears that Moore obtained \u201cacceptable documentation\u201d for one anchor tenant by June 29, 1990, and that the Board agreed to an extension of time for obtaining a second anchor tenant\u2019s commitment. Further, an action was brought challenging this extension of time.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> That action was pending and undecided at the time of oral argument. Whether Moore timely will obtain \u201cacceptable documentation\u201d from a second anchor tenant remains to be seen.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">Of course, if, as Moore contends, the circuit court erred in this action by invalidating the Board\u2019s October 1988 approvals, Moore would have at least cleared the hurdles of project plan and preliminary plan approvals. Under those circumstances the failure, if any, by Moore timely to document a second anchor tenant\u2019s commitment would not affect the approvals already granted. Thus, there continues to be an actual controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">Nor has Moore acquiesced in the circuit court\u2019s decision by applying for the approvals which were granted after the \u201cineffective\u201d development guidelines were deleted from the CBD sector plan. Moore has timely appealed from the circuit court judgment and has prosecuted fully that appeal. It is simply good lawyering, and not acquiescence, for Moore to establish a backup position under the CBD sector plan as further amended. The motion to dismiss is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">On the merits of this controversy the circuit court held that two of the CBD sector plan development guidelines amounted to zoning, but were not adopted by the procedure required for zoning regulations so that those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>guidelines were ineffective. The objective of the Board in adopting the questioned guidelines was to direct commercial development in the CBD to the area nearest the Metro station, <em>i.e., </em>the core area, during Stage II. The guidelines\u2019 technique was to limit approval of OMD, non-residential projects to the core area. As a consequence properties zoned CBD-2 and CBD-3 within the CBD, but outside of the core, could not use OMD for non-residential projects during Stage II. Further, OMD projects for residential use in the CBD outside of the core were restricted to no more than 12.5% of the floor area for commercial use.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">Appellees argued that those features of the 1987 amendments to the sector plan were zoning actions, governed by <em>West Montgomery County Citizens Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 183, 522 A.2d 1328. Moore, Montgomery County and the Board argued that the challenged guidelines were proper exercises of the planning function. They relied principally on <em>Coffey v. Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>293 Md. 24, 441 A.2d 1041 (1982) and <em>Board of County Comm\u2019rs of Cecil County v. Gaster, </em>285 Md. 233, 401 A.2d 666 (1979). The circuit court agreed with the Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We shall assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that the circuit court was correct in the above-described aspect of its holding. We shall also assume that, were the Silver Triangle project to proceed, at least one Appellee is sufficiently aggrieved to have standing to invoke judicial review of the Board\u2019s administrative grant of the project and preliminary plan approvals.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Moore, however, argues that there is no legal nexus between the \u201cineffective\u201d adoption of the two challenged developmental guidelines and the circuit court\u2019s reversal of the Board\u2019s 1988 approvals. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The Board found, and the circuit court affirmed, that Moore had complied with all legal requirements for issuance of the project and preliminary plan approvals. The Silver Triangle project lies wholly within the Stage II core area of the CBD. The restrictions in the development guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>that the circuit court ruled to be ineffective apply only to properties outside of the Stage II core area. The approvals granted by the Board to the Silver Triangle project did not depend on the \u201cineffective\u201d guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">It is not too simplistic to state that any invalidity of the two guidelines is irrelevant to the Board\u2019s 1988 approvals. When the circuit court filed its initial opinion and order, the motions to revise filed by Moore, and particularly by the Board, sought to clarify whether the circuit court was holding that the entire 1987 amendment to the CBD sector plan was invalid. The court\u2019s supplemental order, after reiterating the invalidity of the two development guidelines, clarified \u201cthat in no other respect has the Court made any determination concerning the validity or invalidity of the 1987 Amendment to the Sector Plan____\u201d In essence, the circuit court made a severability determination. Even though the circuit court viewed the two guidelines to be invalid, it was not predicating reversal of the Silver Triangle approvals on a conclusion that the 1987 amendments to the sector plan would not have been adopted, or that the sector plan itself would not have been continued in effect, absent the two questioned guidelines. Appellees never sought a declaration from the circuit court that the 1987 amendments were invalid in their entirety, and Appellees have not sought in this Court alternatively to support the circuit court judgment on that ground. Thus, there was no holding by the circuit court that, because provisions in the 1987 amendments to the sector plan were invalid, the Silver Triangle approvals had fallen by virtue of having been tied, as a matter of legislative intent, to the \u201cineffective guidelines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">In this respect the instant matter is similar to <em>Martin and Burch v. Mayor and Aldermen of Annapolis, </em>248 Md. 551, 237 A.2d 728 (1968). That case involved the challenge on a number of grounds to the construction on the Annapolis waterfront of a hotel. After a building permit had been issued for a hotel with 137 rental units on a site in a maritime zone under the Annapolis zoning ordinance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>protestants questioned whether a hotel was a permitted use in that zone. Annapolis then amended its ordinance expressly to permit hotels in excess of 100 rooms in maritime zones. A circuit court held that the 100 room minimum requirement was invalid, that it was not severable from the balance of the amendment, and that the entire express permission amendment was invalid. Nevertheless, because the circuit court also concluded that hotels were permitted uses in maritime zones prior to the amendment, the building permit was validly issued. This Court agreed that hotels were permitted uses in maritime zones prior to the amendment and, therefore, did not consider the validity of the amendment. In the instant matter Moore has complied with the requirements applicable to the Silver Triangle project and, therefore, we have no need to consider whether development guidelines applicable to other properties are valid. Those guidelines have no bearing on the approvals of the project and preliminary plans which are the subjects of this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">In its supplemental order the circuit court in essence reaffirmed its conclusion of a nexus between the \u201cineffective\u201d guidelines and reversal of the approvals \u201cbecause the rights of [the instant Appellees] may have been prejudiced by [the] reliance\u201d of the Board \u201con the 1987 Sector Plan Amendment ..., provision^] of which are, in light of applicable zoning, ineffective____\u201d In its original opinion the circuit court had elaborated that \u201cthis \u2018error of law\u2019 may have prejudiced substantial rights of [the instant Appellees], particularly those [Appellees] who have been denied the right to pursue the OMD in parts of the CBD outside the Stage II core area____\u201d A principal deficiency in that analysis is that there is no evidence that any Appellee applied for project approval of an OMD, non-residential project to be developed on a CBD-2 or CBD-3 site in the CBD outside of the Stage II core area. Nor is there any evidence that any Appellee was deterred from so applying by the questioned guidelines. There is no evidence that any Appellee sought project plan approval for OMD develop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>ment of a residential project outside of the core area in the CBD for which that Appellee sought more than 12.5% of the floor area in commercial use. Nor is there any evidence that any Appellee was deterred from so applying.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Appellees are attempting to challenge guidelines which were not applied in approving the Silver Triangle project and which have not affected anything that any Appellee seeks to do with that party\u2019s own property.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Further, even if an Appellee had been obstructed in a proposed development of that Appellee\u2019s property by one or both of the \u201cineffective\u201d guidelines, the remedy, given the circuit court\u2019s unchallenged severability conclusion, would have been to permit that Appellee to proceed under the sector plan, as amended in 1987, without applying the invalid guideline. We do not see how invalidating an approval, granted independently of the \u201cineffective\u201d guideline to another property owner for a different site, cures any injury sustained by our hypothetical Appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Appellees also refer to the Administrative Procedure Act, Md.Code (1984), \u00a7 10-215(g)(3) of the State Government Article under which a reviewing court may \u201creverse or modify the decision [of an agency] if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced\u201d because of certain errors.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Appellees contend that use of the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tense of the potential subjunctive mood (\u201cmay have been prejudiced\u201d) shows that no actual injury is required. We need not determine in this case, however, the degree of prejudice which the statute contemplates. This is because the ground for reversal of the Board\u2019s decision relied upon here, in terms of \u00a7 10-215(g), is that of subparagraph (3)(iv), namely, that the decision was \u201caffected by any other error of law____\u201d As we have shown above, the Board\u2019s decision was not affected in any recognized legal sense by the assumed invalidity of the guidelines. We hold simply that the Appellees are not prejudiced by that claimed error.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-16\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY REVERSED.
