The real estate market for the subject property was escalating during the potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>relevant period. Purchasers sought specific performance or damages. Specific performance became unavailable when the vendors rejected the contract in bankruptcy. We shall hold that the purchasers\u2019 damages are not limited to certain out-of-pocket losses, as held by the courts below, but that the purchasers may also recover damages for loss of the benefit of their bargain. In computing damages the property may be valued as if improved as promised, and it may be valued as of the date when specific performance became unavailable, in contrast with valuation as of an earlier date when the vendors anticipatorially repudiated the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">The purchasers are the petitioners, DeLawrence and Lillian M. Beard (the Beards), who were plaintiffs in the circuit court. The vendors, respondents here and defendants in the circuit court, are Diana C. Etheridge (Etheridge) and Gene Stull (Stull), joint venturers in S/E Joint Venture. Etheridge is a licensed real estate agent and Stull is a home builder. S/E Joint Venture had acquired an unimproved lot in Piney Glen Farms subdivision in the Potomac section of Montgomery County for the purpose of building a home for speculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Protracted negotiations between the Beards and S/E Joint Venture led to a contract formed on March 17, 1986, under which S/E Joint Venture would construct a house on the lot and convey the improved premises to the Beards for $785,000. The contract in part provided \u201cthat the PURCHASER is purchasing a completed dwelling [and] that the SELLER is not acting as a contractor for the PURCHASER in the construction of the dwelling[.]\u201d The contract recited that \u201cthe approximate date of completion of the improvements now scheduled by the SELLER is November 30, 1986.\u201d For a period of ninety days the contract was contingent on the sale of two residences, one the then residence of the Beards and the other that of Mrs. Beard\u2019s mother, who also was to occupy the home to be built.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Matters did not proceed smoothly. On March 16, 1987, the vendors, through counsel, terminated the contract. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>letter declaring the contract terminated invoked a provision under which</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-4\">\u201cthe SELLER shall have the right to return the PURCHASER\u2019S deposit and to declare this Contract null and void if, in the SELLER\u2019S sole discretion, it determines that ... performance within 365 days from the date hereof will not be possible.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In May 1987 the Beards filed a two count complaint against respondents. It sought specific performance under count I and, in the alternative, damages for breach of contract in count II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">During the pendency of the action by the Beards, S/E Joint Venture sought the protection of Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Bankruptcy Court on April 8, 1988, ruled that it would approve rejection by S/E Joint Venture of its contract with the Beards. The order of the Bankruptcy Court that effected that ruling, was passed on June 17, 1988, the last business day prior to the commencement of the nonjury trial of the subject action in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">In a written opinion the circuit judge found, on conflicting evidence, that the vendors had breached the contract by the purported termination of March 16, 1987. The trial judge concluded</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">\u201cthat it is implicit that before the right of termination can be exercised the defendants must have acted in good faith to try to complete construction of the house within the stated time period; this, in the court\u2019s judgment, they did not do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">The circuit court found that Stull \u201cknew some two months after the inception of the contract that he would be unable to meet the time deadline.\u201d This was found to be \u201csignificant because defendants were aware that the plaintiffs and [Mrs. Beard\u2019s mother] had to sell their homes in order to meet their financial commitment[.]\u201d The trial court also found undue delay in the performance of plumbing work, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>which \u201chad a ripple effect on the subsequent course of construction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The trial judge did not address the specific performance claim, saying in a footnote: \u201cAs to count one Plaintiffs make no argument in their written argument, or otherwise, and the court treats the count as abandoned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Itemizing claimed damages in their post trial memorandum, the Beards included $100,000 for \u201closs of bargain.\u201d Factually, the $100,000 figure is said to represent the excess of the value of the property, with the home completed in accordance with the contract, as of March 16, 1987, over the contract price. The plaintiffs undertook to prove the value of the property by calling Etheridge as their own witness. Plaintiffs\u2019 conclusion that $100,000 represents the difference between market value and contract price requires interpreting Etheridge\u2019s testimony. At times she seems to refer to the value of the house which S/E Joint Venture originally planned, and at times to the value of the house called for by the Beards\u2019 contract. The circuit court never reached this issue because it disposed of the Beards\u2019 contention on legal grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Legally to support their loss of the bargain claim, the plaintiffs relied on <em>Horner v. Beasley, </em>105 Md. 193, 65 A. 820 (1907). <em>Horner </em>was a purchaser\u2019s action against a vendor for breach of a contract to convey, for $1,200, improved realty worth $1,800. The vendor\u2019s defense was that title to the property was involved in litigation. Judgment for the plaintiff was reversed because of an error in the admission of evidence of value. This Court, however, approved a jury instruction that if</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AY7\">\u201cthe defendant acted in good faith in failing to perform the contract of sale, the plaintiff was entitled to recover only the amount of his deposit with interest and the expense if any incurred in the investigation of the title; but if they found that the defendant did not act in good faith then in addition to the amounts aforesaid the plaintiff could recover the excess, if any, of the market value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>of the property, at the time of the sale, over the contract price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 198, 65 A. at 822.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">The Beards, also citing <em>Charles County Broadcasting Co. v. Meares, </em>270 Md. 321, 311 A.2d 27 (1973), argued that, because the respondents were able to perform, their breach was in \u201cbad faith,\u201d so that benefit of the bargain damages should be awarded. The trial court did not accept this contention, explaining that it did \u201cnot award any damages for loss of the benefit of the bargain[,] finding no evidence of bad faith in the sense that the termination was activated by malice, fraud or the like.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">The circuit court awarded the plaintiffs $124,594 in damages, representing the deposit on the property ($75,000), a deposit for a security system ($2,000), a deposit for telephones and intercoms ($1,000), rental payments for substitute housing ($32,000), mortgage commitment fee ($4,250) and storage costs ($10,344).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">All parties appealed to the Court of Special Appeals which, in an unreported opinion, modified the judgment and affirmed it as modified.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The intermediate appellate court, approving the trial court\u2019s analysis of the loss of bargain claim, reasoned that \u201c[o]nce [the trial judge] found a breach on the Sellers\u2019 part but failed to find any evidence of fraud, malice or the like, [the trial judge] could not award damages in accordance with <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>based on either good faith or bad faith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">We granted certiorari as to the following questions from the Beards\u2019 petition.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201c1. Whether a seller of real estate who fails to exercise good faith in the performance of the sales contract is liable for the purchasers\u2019 loss of bargain?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>\u201c2. </em>Whether the measure of damages for loss of bargain is based on the value of the property at the time the seller improperly gave notice of termination or at the time it precluded specific performance of the contract by rejecting it in bankruptcy?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Damages for breach of a contract ordinarily are that sum which would place the plaintiff in as good a position as that in which the plaintiff would have been, had the contract been performed. These expectation interest damages embrace both losses incurred and gains prevented. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \u00a7 347 (1981); Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 329 (1932). Here the circuit court undertook to apply an exception to the ordinary rule. The exception traces to <em>Flureau v. Thornhill, 2 </em>W. Black. 1078, 96 Eng.Rep. 635 (K.B.1776). In England, and in the diminishing number of American states that recognize <em>Flureau, </em>the exception applies only where, due to no fault on the part of the seller, there is an inability to convey good title. In the case at hand respondents\u2019 breach had nothing to do with title to the property. Further, under the trial court\u2019s findings, the inability timely to deliver a completed house, which motivated the wrongful termination of March 16, 1987, is not a \u201cgood faith\u201d failure to perform within the meaning of the <em>Flureau </em>exception. In any event, \u201cgood faith,\u201d per the <em>Flureau </em>rule, is not so all inclusive as to embrace any breach which was not \u201cactivated by malice, fraud or the like,\u201d as the trial judge said. Thus, the trial court applied an erroneous legal standard when it refused to consider benefit of the bargain damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">In <em>Flureau, </em>the plaintiff had purchased at auction a property that paid an advantageous rent in relation to the purchase price. The seller, however, could not produce good title. In the ensuing suit the court\u2019s instructions limited the jury to awarding the return of the deposit paid, plus interest; but the jury allowed an additional twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>pounds. A new trial was ordered. The report of the judgment of De Grey, C.J., reads in full:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\">\u201cI think the verdict wrong in point of law. Upon a contract for a purchase, if the title proves bad, and the vendor is (without fraud) incapable of making a good one, I do not think that the purchaser can be entitled to any damages for the fancied goodness of the bargain, which he supposes he has lost.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-5\"><em>Flureau, </em>2 W. Black. 1078, 96 Eng.Rep. 635. The judgment of Blackstone, J., explained that \u201c[t]hese contracts are merely upon condition, frequently expressed, but always implied, that the vendor has a good title.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1078-79, 96 Eng.Rep. at 635.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">It has been recognized in England that the <em>Flureau </em>exception was an \u201canomalous rule\u201d brought about by the difficulties in that country, as late as 1899 (if not later), \u201cin shewing a good title to real property\u201d and that the exception \u201cought not be extended to cases in which the reasons on which it is based do not apply.\u201d <em>Day v. Singleton, </em>[1899] 2 Ch. 320, 329 (C.A.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Although English courts have struggled over the scope of the <em>Flureau </em>exception, the English cases considering <em>Flureau </em>have all concerned some aspect of title. <em>See Hopkins v. Grazebrook, </em>6 B. &amp; C. 31 (K.B.1826) (vendor who knows he has no title, but expects to be able to procure it prior to sale cannot rely on <em>Flureau </em>exception); <em>Engell v. Fitch, </em>[1869] L.R. 4 Q.B. 659 (Ex.Ch.) <em>(Flureau </em>limitation on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>damages not available where failure to convey results from vendor\u2019s refusal to oust a tenant); <em>Bain v. Fothergill, </em>[1874] L.R. 7 H.L. 158 (1873-74) (overruling <em>Hopkins v. Grazebrook; Flureau </em>applies when inability to convey interest in mining royalty results from inability to get permission from lessor); <em>Day v. Singleton, </em>[1899] 2 Ch. 320 (C.A.) <em>(Flureau </em>limitation on damages unavailable in sale of leasehold, where vendor fails to use best efforts to obtain lessor\u2019s consent to sale); <em>In re Daniel, </em>[1917] 2 Ch. 405 <em>(Flureau </em>not applicable where difficulty in conveyance results from inability to obtain partial release of mortgage); <em>Braybrooks v. Whaley, </em>[1919] 1 K.B. 435 <em>(Flureau </em>not applicable where failure to convey relates to noncompliance with Emergency Powers Act, rather than title defect).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">More recently, <em>Flureau </em>has been given a very narrow reading in England. In <em>Malhotra v. Choudhury, </em>[1979] 1 All E.R. 186 (C.A.), a partner in a medical practice, Malhotra, conveyed the medical office to the junior partner, Choudhury, and the latter\u2019s wife. The partnership agreement provided that, if Choudhury left the practice, Malhotra would have the option to buy back the property at fair market value. The next year Malhotra gave notice of dissolution of the partnership, exercised the option, and later brought an action for specific performance, which was denied. Two years later Malhotra sought damages. The trial court found that Choudhury could not convey good title because of his wife\u2019s refusal to join and, applying <em>Flureau, </em>limited the recovery to reliance damages. The Court of Appeal reversed, holding that the <em>Flureau </em>rule was an exception to be applied only where the vendor showed best efforts to make a good title. <em>Id. </em>at 199-201. The court reasoned that the origin of the exception virtually required that bad faith be defined as a failure to make best efforts, with no requirement for fraud, and that failure of the vendor to demonstrate good faith precluded the <em>Flureau </em>exception. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">With respect to this country, Professor Corbin summarizes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number><em>\u201cA </em>great many courts in the United States have not been inclined to follow the English courts or to differentiate land contracts from other contracts. The rule they adopt is that, if the seller fails to convey the title that he contracted to convey, the buyer has a right to damages measured by the value of the land at the time it should have been conveyed, less the contract price as yet unpaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">5 A. Corbin, <em>Corbin on Contracts </em>\u00a7 1098, at 525 (1964) (footnote omitted). \u201cSome of the courts, however, have recognized the English rule____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525-28 (footnote omitted). But even among American courts applying <em>Flureau, </em>\u201c[i]f the seller in fact has title and refuses to perform his contract without excuse, the buyer has a right to damages.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 529 (footnote omitted). Other treatises and commentators agree. <em>See </em>3 American Law of Property \u00a7 11.67.a, at 168-69 (1952); J. Calamari &amp; J. Perillo, <em>The Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 14-30 (2d ed. 1977); D. Dobbs, <em>Law of Remedies </em>\u00a7 12.8 (1973); M. Friedman, <em>Contracts &amp; Conveyances of Real Property </em>\u00a7 12.2(a)2 (4th ed. 1984); 8A G. Thompson, <em>Real Property </em>\u00a7 4478, at 451-52 (1963); 11 S. Williston, <em>Law of Contracts </em>\u00a7 1399 (Jaeger 3d ed. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">The first mention of <em>Flureau </em>in the reports of this Court is in <em>Baltimore Permanent Bldg. &amp; Land Soc\u2019y v. Smith, </em>54 Md. 187 (1880).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The land was Solomon\u2019s Island, de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>scribed in the contract as about \u201csixty-five acres.\u201d The vendor\u2019s retained land, however, surveyed at thirty-six acres. In the purchaser\u2019s damage action the trial court instructed that return of the deposit plus interest and expenses of title examination could be awarded together with benefit of the bargain damages. This Court reversed and remanded for a new trial. The \u201cdifferent rule\u201d in England under <em>Flureau </em>was noted. <em>Id. </em>at 206. This Court traced the rule through commentators and noted that it had been followed in a great number of cases in England. Citing 2 Addison on Contracts \u00a7 529, the rule limiting recovery to reliance damages was said to apply where the vendor had \u201c \u2018reasonable ground for believing that he was the owner of the property, and had the right to sell at the time he agreed to sell, but is prevented by an unexpected defect of title____\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 207. The opinion by Judge Cooley in <em>Hammond v. Hannin, </em>21 Mich. 374 (1870), citing many cases in this country applying the English rule, was reviewed. This Court held that the jury should have been instructed that damages were limited to return of the deposit, interest and cost of investigating the title if the jury found</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u201cthat after [the vendor] had entered into said contract, the said defendant discovered that there was a large deficiency in the quantity of land ... and shall further believe that the non-execution [i.e. non-performance] of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>said agreement on the part of the defendant, was occasioned simply by its honest inability to make title to about sixty-five acres of land____\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">54 Md. at 209 (referring to passage, quoted here, at 193).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\"><em>Hartsock v. Mort, </em>76 Md. 281, 25 A. 303 (1892), and <em>Horner v. Beasley, </em>105 Md. 193, 65 A. 820 (1907), both involving vendor\u2019s breaches, recognized that expectation interest damages were appropriate and the <em>Flureau </em>exception was not applied. In the former action the vendor refused to accept a take back purchase money mortgage that conformed to the contract. In the latter case the jury apparently rejected the vendor\u2019s explanation that the title was in litigation, where the contract price at the time of contracting was about two-thirds of the value. Thereafter this Court did not have occasion again to consider <em>Flureau </em>until the 1973 decision in <em>Charles County Broadcasting, </em>270 Md. 321, 311 A.2d 27, discussed, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">The Court of Special Appeals has approved expectation interest damages for the vendor\u2019s breach of a contract to build a home and then to convey the improved premises. <em>See Fran Realty, Inc. v. Thomas, </em>30 Md.App. 362, 354 A.2d 196 (1976) (holding vendor breached by attempted, unilateral rescission based on previously discoverable, subsurface conditions).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">Respondents have no basis for invoking the <em>Flureau </em>exception because they do not even assert that inability to convey title produced their breach of the contract to convey. Respondents deny, however, that the <em>Flureau </em>rule applies so narrowly, and they cite <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>in support. That case involved breach \u00f3f a contract to sell the license of an FM radio station, subject to Federal Communication Commission (FCC) approval of the transfer of ownership and of a relocation of the transmitter. The subjects of the sale were the stock of a subsidiary corporation of the seller, certain equipment, goodwill, contracts and insurance policies, and a lease of realty to be assumed by the buyer. <em>See </em>Appellant Charles County Broadcasting Co.\u2019s Record Extract at 62-69. The seller agreed to cooperate fully in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>obtaining all needed approvals from the FCC, and it is that covenant which the seller breached. The buyer initially sought specific performance, to require the seller to sign a document needed for FCC approval, but, by the time of trial, the buyer elected damages under the prayer for further relief. The trial court awarded benefit of the bargain damages. On appeal the seller challenged that award, advancing a variety of reasons, none of which was that <em>Flureau </em>applied. This Court affirmed loss of the bargain damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The opinion in <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>opened with a general discussion of specific performance law and of the award of damages in equity. It quoted <em>Hartsock v. Mort, </em>76 Md. at 288-89, 25 A. 303, in turn quoting <em>Hammond v. Hannin, </em>21 Mich. at 387, for the rule as to the measure of damages:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\">\u201c \u2018If the vendor acts in bad faith, \u2014 as, if having title he refuses to convey, or disables himself from conveying,\u2014 the proper measure of damages is the value of the land at the time of the breach; the rule, in such case, being the same in relation to real as to personal property. But, on the other hand, if the contract of sale was made in good faith, and the vendor for any reason is unable to perform it, and is guilty of no fraud, the clear weight of authority is that the vendee is limited in his recovery to the consideration money (paid) and interest, with perhaps in addition, the costs of investigating the title.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">270 Md. at 326, 311 A.2d at 31. After concluding that there was sufficient evidence of value to support loss of the bargain damages, the Court said that \u201cin breach of a contract to sell, damages are based on value at the time the transfer was to be made, and not on contract price____\u201d 270 Md. at 332, 311 A.2d at 34. <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>concluded by saying: \u201cAs we pointed out earlier, loss of bargain damages are available when a vendor acts in bad faith, <em>Hartsock v. Mort, supra, </em>and may be recovered in a specific performance suit under a prayer for general relief....\u201d 270 Md. at 334, 311 A.2d at 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>Respondents\u2019 position necessarily has two steps, (1) that <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>expands <em>Flureau </em>beyond problems of title, and (2) that respondents breached the subject contract in good faith. But we do not read <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>to hold that loss of the bargain damages are not recoverable for a good faith breach of contract, other than where the breach results from certain problems involving title to realty. No party in <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>argued that realty was involved there. This Court\u2019s quote of the damage rule from <em>Hart-sock v. Mort </em>was appropriate. Part of that rule is that damages for breach of a contract to sell personalty are the same as those for a \u201cbad faith\u201d breach of a contract to convey realty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">But, even if respondents were correct in their first step, <em>Charles County Broadcasting </em>refutes their second step. If the sellers\u2019 refusal to execute a document needed for FCC approval was \u201cbad faith\u201d in <em>Charles County Broadcasting, </em>then respondents\u2019 termination of the instant contract similarly is \u201cbad faith\u201d under the rule. <em>Charles County Broadcasting, </em>as well as all of the other authorities reviewed above, make clear that bad faith is not limited to \u201cmalice, fraud or the like.\u201d The standard applied by the trial court in the present case is not the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Thus, the trial court erred in failing to consider breach of the bargain damages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">As of what date should the premises be valued to determine any excess of value over the contract price? The answer turns on whether petitioners\u2019 claim for loss of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>bargain damages is viewed as asserted by count I or by count II of their complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Count II asserts a cause of action at law for breach of contract and seeks money damages. As we have seen, the ordinary rule for computing loss of the bargain damages is to value the property at the time of breach. Breach by failure to perform usually occurs when the promised performance is due. Here we need not be concerned with the effect on damages of respondents\u2019 anticipatory repudiation. The outside date for substantial completion by respondents was 365 days from contract formation on March 17, 1986. The contract provision that permitted termination by the respondents if they were unable to perform within 365 days, assuming a good faith effort at performance in the interim, essentially limited the date for scheduling settlement. Consequently, the swing in the instant matter of a few days between the anticipatory repudiation and the time for conveyance is immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">Etheridge valued a house on the site as of March 16, 1987, at $100,000 in excess of the Beards\u2019 contract price. Her testimony permits different inferences, as to whether she was referring to the house to be built for the Beards or to a house built to the specifications originally contemplated by the respondents, with only some of the Beards\u2019 modifications. As a result, even if valuation were as of March 1987, a remand would be required in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Petitioners submit, however, that the property should be valued as of June 17, 1988, because, in effect, their claim for damages is asserted under count I of their complaint, and the award would be an exercise of equity power. Petitioners\u2019 theory is that damages are to be awarded in substitution for specific performance which became unavailable when the Bankruptcy Court approved rejection of the contract. That rejection eviscerated petitioners\u2019 then pending claim for specific performance. Respondents reply that damages in substitution for specific performance were abandoned at trial. Further, respondents deny that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>facts at hand, even absent rejection, present an appropriate case for specific performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">The effect of rejection of the contract in bankruptcy was presented to the circuit court in memoranda that the parties apparently prepared over the weekend between the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s order and the start of trial. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants, by rejecting, admitted that the vendors\u2019 performance was not excused by any breach attributed to the purchasers. The vendors argued that their only breach of contract was the rejection and that, should the purchasers claim on that breach, either the claim would have to be asserted in the Bankruptcy Court, or the order modifying the bankruptcy stay to permit the instant action would have to be modified. These contentions were mooted by the trial court\u2019s finding that it was the respondents who breached the contract by the March 16, 1987, attempted termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">At trial five days after the rejection, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel sought to read into evidence from Etheridge\u2019s January 1988 deposition a valuation as of the time of the deposition. Defendants objected, specifying lack of relevancy. Plaintiffs argued that the court would have to determine the date of breach, and that, despite the March 16, 1987, termination letter, there was \u201cevidence that the parties continued after that time ... to treat the contract as if it were still alive.\u201d Referring to the bankruptcy rejection counsel said: \u201cMy clients have sued for specific performance, and that was a viable claim in this suit until last Friday.\u201d Counsel submitted that a January 1988 valuation was not so remote as to lack any relevance in the fact-finding process. The court sustained the objection to the deposition excerpt. Plaintiffs then called Etheridge as an adverse witness. In the course of that examination Etheridge was asked to value the house on. that date, June 22, 1988. The court, stating that it would be consistent in its rulings, sustained an objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>Petitioners\u2019 claim for specific performance was not abandoned; it was federally preempted. Petitioners\u2019 attempt to prove damages in substitution for specific performance was not abandoned; it was blocked by an evidentiary ruling. That ruling accorded no validity to the theory that, because specific performance became unavailable contemporaneously with the start of trial, the property could be valued as of the time of trial for loss of the bargain damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">Respondents say that a court would not grant specific performance of this contract because supervision of construction, which was far from completed, would be too burdensome and complex, particularly in view of disputes over whether the house was or was not to contain certain features. One who promises to build a house and then to convey the improved premises cannot defeat specific performance by breaching the contract before construction is completed. Even if specific performance of the promise to build the building is not awarded, a court may order specific performance of the promise to convey the premises and enter a monetary decree for the cost of completion of the improvements in accordance with the contract. <em>See Burns v. Garey, </em>101 Conn. 323, 125 A. 467 (1924); <em>Yonan v. Oak Park Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>27 Ill.App.3d 967, 326 N.E.2d 773 (1975); <em>Billy Williams Builders &amp; Developers, Inc. v. Hillerich, </em>446 S.W.2d 280 (Ky.1969); <em>Dixon v.

Brosius, </em>241 Md. 612, 652-54, 217 A.2d 531, 554-55 (1966) (purchaser awarded specific performance and damages for improper clearing of temporary haul road); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>Miller v. Talbott, </em>239 Md. 382, 391-94, 211 A.2d 741, 747-48 (1965) (purchaser awarded specific performance and damages for delay); <em>Walzl v. King, </em>113 Md. 550, 556, 77 A. 1117, 1119 (1910) (purchaser awarded specific performance and, because rents received by vendor after breach were recoverable in equity, purchaser\u2019s later law action for collection of rents barred by <em>res </em>judicata); <em>Archway Motors v. Herman, </em>37 Md.App. 674, 687-88, 378 A.2d 720, 727-28 (1977) (vendor awarded specific performance and damages for betterments made to comply with housing code where violation notices issued after time set for closing of transaction).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">It is also clear that equity may award loss of the bargain damages in substitution for specific performance when that remedy becomes unavailable after equity jurisdiction has been properly invoked. <em>See Charles County Broadcasting.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Where, as here, the purchaser sues for specific performance upon breach of a contract to convey realty, and specific performance becomes unavailable during the pend-ency of the action, the loss of the bargain damages, awarded in substitution for specific performance, may properly be computed by valuing the property at the time specific performance becomes unavailable. The rule for which petitioners contend is the rule in England and in those states in this country in which the issue appears to have been raised. Respondents have not referred us to any authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">In <em>Johnson v. Agnew, </em>[1979] 1 All E.R. 883 (H.L.), vendors sought specific performance of a contract that would have furnished funds sufficient to pay the indebtedness secured by liens on their property. That equitable relief became unavailable when the lienholders sold the property. The House of Lords held that if \u201cthe vendors acted reasonably in pursuing the remedy of specific performance, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>date on which that remedy became aborted (not by the vendors\u2019 fault) should logically be fixed as the date on which damages should be assessed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">A full statement of the rationale for fixing damages later than the date of the breach is found in <em>Wroth v. Tyler, </em>[1973] 1 All E.R. 897 (Ch. D.), in which the court reasoned from the principle that damages should place the plaintiff in the same situation as if the contract had been performed.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">\u201c[I]f the contract had been performed, the plaintiffs would at the date fixed for completion have had the house, then worth \u00a37,500, in return for the contractual price of \u00a36,000. If in lieu of the house they had been paid \u00a31,500 damages at that date, they could, with the addition of the \u00a36,000 that they commanded, have forthwith bought an equivalent house. I am satisfied on the evidence that the plaintiffs had no financial resources of any substance beyond the \u00a36,000 that they could have put together for the purchase of the defendant\u2019s bungalow, and that the defendant knew this when the contract was made. The plaintiffs were therefore, to the defendant\u2019s knowledge, unable at the time of the breach to raise a further \u00a31,500 in order to purchase an equivalent house forthwith, and so, as events have turned out, mitigate their loss. Today, to purchase an equivalent house they need \u00a35,500 in addition to their \u00a36,000. How, then, it may be asked, would the award today of \u00a31,500 damages place them in the same situation as if the contract had been performed? The result that would have been produced by paying \u00a31,500 damages at the date of the breach can today be produced only by paying \u00a35,500 damages, with in each case the return of the deposit. On facts such as these, the general rule of assessing damages as at the date of the breach seems to defeat the general principle, rather than carry it out.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 919. The court further said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b207-6\">\u201c[I]f ... damages are awarded in substitution for specific performance, the court has jurisdiction to award such damages as will put the plaintiffs into as good a position <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>as if the contract had been performed, even if to do so means awarding damages assessed by reference to a period subsequent to the date of the breach. This seems to me to be consonant with the nature of specific performance, which is a continuing remedy, designed to secure, inter alia, that the purchaser receives in fact what is his in equity as soon as the contract is made, subject to the vendor\u2019s right to the money, and so on. On the one hand, a decree may be sought before any breach of contract has occurred, and so before any action lies for common law damages; and on the other hand the right to a decree may continue long after the breach has occurred. On the facts of this case, the damages that may be awarded are not limited to the \u00a31,500 that is appropriate to the date of the breach, but extend to the \u00a35,500 that is appropriate at the present day, when they are being awarded in substitution for specific performance.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 921-22.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Measuring damages later than the date of breach of the contract to convey is the rule in Missouri, where the courts look to value at the time of trial or judgment. <em>See Senn v. Manchester Bank of St. Louis, </em>583 S.W.2d 119, 135 (Mo. 1979) (\u201cBecause [specific performance] is not available, the court alternatively must grant plaintiffs the value of the land at the moment they would have received it, that is, the time of trial---- [T]he trial court merely substituted money for the land itself as a means of making plaintiffs whole.\u201d); <em>Kay v. Vatterott, </em>657 S.W.2d 80 (Mo.App.1983); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number><em>Dunning v. Alfred H. Mayer Co., </em>483 S.W.2d 423 (Mo.App. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">In <em>Cameron v. Benson, </em>295 Or. 98, 664 P.2d 412 (1983), a trial court awarded specific performance to purchasers and, in the event the vendor did not specifically perform, a money judgment. This judgment valued the property in 1980, thereby producing a damage figure $5,000 higher than produced by a valuation as of the breach in 1978. The Supreme Court of Oregon affirmed, holding that \u201c[a]s with the value received when the court grants specific performance alone ... this alternative money judgment should be measured as of the time of the directed performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 105, 664 P.2d at 416.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Whether benefit of the bargain damages are available at all where there is a failure of title, and what valuation date should be used, were issues in <em>Donovan v. Bachstadt, </em>91 N.J. 434, 453 A.2d 160 (1982). Vendors contracted to sell their home for $58,900 and to take back a $44,000 purchase money mortgage with interest at 10V2% per year for thirty years. But the vendors could not produce good title, the purchasers obtained a specific performance decree, and, when title still could not be cured, the purchasers sued for damages. The purchasers had acquired a substitute home by a mortgage bearing <em>lZh% </em>interest. The Supreme Court of New Jersey departed from its prior adherence to <em>Flureau </em>and allowed benefit of the bargain damages for the good faith failure of title. In measuring damages, the court structured a rule which included as a factor the value of a house that could be purchased with the promised financing, and in which \u201c[t]he valuation should be at the time the defendant failed to comply with the judgment of specific performance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 446-48, 453 A.2d at 166-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The reasoning of these cases is persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">On remand the Beards will be entitled to show the value of the property, improved by a house conforming to the plans and specifications of their contract, as of the date of rejection in bankruptcy of the contract with the Beards. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>On remand the court may award under count I, in its discretion and in lieu of specific performance, benefit of the bargain damages as of June 17, 1988. Otherwise, the court shall proceed under count II and value the property for benefit of the bargain damages as of March 16, 1987. In other words, valuation as of the date of breach is a legal right. Valuation as of the date specific performance became unavailable is discretionary, but only to the extent that a denial of all equitable relief to the purchasers would be a proper exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Respondents assert that if benefit of the bargain damages are permitted then the damages which had been awarded by the trial court cannot also be awarded. Benefit of the bargain damages will be the amount by which the value of the premises on the appropriate valuation date exceeds the purchase price. The Beards\u2019 down payment on the house forms part of the price and is not represented in loss of the bargain compensation. Payments by way of rental for substitute housing were recognized as proper consequential damages, ancillary to the award of specific performance, in <em>Miller v. Talbott, </em>239 Md. 382, 391-92, 211 A.2d 741, and are not inconsistent with benefit of the bargain damages.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The mortgage placement fee and the deposits for electronic systems are out of pocket expenditures by the Beards that apparently are lost, in that the trial court neither treated them as part of the contract price nor as subject to the doctrine of avoidable consequences. On this record they are recoverable. But, those expenditures also represent part of what the cost of the finished home would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>be in addition to the contract price. The expenditures should be added to the contract price, and that total subtracted from the value, as of the appropriate date, in determining the loss of the bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS ON THE APPEAL OF DeLAWRENCE AND LILLIAN M.

The early Maryland decisions involving purchaser's actions for breach of a contract to convey realty do not mention the <em>Flureau </em>rule. In <em>Cannell v.

The trial court\u2019s instruction limited the jury to awarding the deposit paid, with or without interest, in the jury\u2019s discretion. Judgment on verdict for the deposit, without interest, was reversed. This Court held that \u201cthe purchaser is entitled to the thing contracted for, at the price agreed upon, and consequently to the benefit of any increased value; which would be lost to him if the damages were restricted to the price or value at the time of making the contract.\" <em>Id. </em>at 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\"><em>Dyer v.

The condition of the bond was that the vendor would obtain a deed to the purchaser from the vendor\u2019s predecessors in title. It was held that the purchaser could not both retain the land and recover the full penal sum of the bond, which seems to have been equated with the value of the land. A judgment for the costs of curing the title was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\"><em>Marshall v.
