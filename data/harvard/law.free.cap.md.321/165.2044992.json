The Lanes had an automobile liability insurance policy with Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., which was in effect at the time of the accident. The accident occurred when a vehicle, driven by Guy Callaway, attempted to pass the Lanes on the left and was forced off the road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>by an oncoming vehicle, owned by Michael McKenna and driven by Joseph Warren. The oncoming vehicle driven by Joseph Warren collided with the Lanes\u2019 vehicle. The Lanes notified their insurer Nationwide shortly after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">The Lanes filed a tort action against Warren, McKenna and Callaway in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on December 14, 1982. Sometime before the tort action was filed, the Lanes had learned that Warren and McKenna were uninsured. On December 17, 1982, Nationwide was notified of the suit when the Lanes\u2019 attorney sent copies of the complaint to Nationwide\u2019s claims adjuster handling the case and to Nationwide\u2019s district office in Annapolis, Maryland. In the December 17, 1982, letter to Nationwide, which accompanied the copies of the tort complaint, the Lanes\u2019 attorney informed Nationwide that Warren and McKenna were uninsured.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nevertheless, Nationwide made no effort to intervene in the tort suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">On April 17, 1986, while the tort action was still pending and untried, the Lanes instituted the present action by filing a complaint in the Circuit Court for Wicomico County against Nationwide for breach of contract, seeking recovery of uninsured motorist benefits under their policy with Nationwide. The Lanes\u2019 complaint alleged that their injuries \u201cwere the direct and proximate result of the negligence of\u201d McKenna and Warren, that McKenna and Warren were uninsured, that the Lanes had previously demanded that Nationwide pay for their injuries pursuant to the uninsured motorist provisions of their insurance policy, and that Nationwide had breached the insurance contract by its failure to compensate the Lanes for their injuries. Nationwide filed a motion for summary judgment, asserting that the action was barred by the three-year statute of limitations, Maryland Code (1974, 1989 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-101 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Nationwide argued that the three-year statute of limitations began to run when the plaintiffs learned that Warren and McKenna were unin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>sured, and that the plaintiffs admitted that they had this knowledge prior to April 1983. The circuit court, agreeing with Nationwide that the statute of limitations began to run when the Lanes learned that Warren and McKenna were uninsured, granted Nationwide\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">The Lanes appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which affirmed in an unreported opinion. The intermediate appellate court concurred with the circuit court\u2019s view that a cause of action by an insured against his or her insurer for uninsured motorist benefits accrues when the insured learns that the tortfeasors are uninsured. The Court of Special Appeals held that the statute of limitations began to run against the Lanes when they learned that Warren and McKenna were uninsured, despite the pendency of a tort suit against Warren and McKenna.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The Lanes thereafter filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Maryland\u2019s Insurance Code, Art. 48A, \u00a7 541, requires that every motor vehicle liability insurance policy \u201cissued, sold, or delivered in this State ... shall contain\u201d uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have dealt with this statutorily mandated' uninsured motorist coverage in several recent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>cases, pointing out that it embodies a public policy \u201c \u2018to assure financial compensation to the innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents who are unable to recover from financially irresponsible uninsured motorists.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lee v. Wheeler, </em>310 Md. 233, 238, 528 A.2d 912, 915 (1987), quoting from <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 157, 416 A.2d 734, 737 (1980). <em>See also, e.g., Hoffman v. United Services Auto. Ass\u2019n, </em>309 Md. 167, 522 A.2d 1320 (1987); <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465 (1981); <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto.

State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>285 Md. at 553, 403 A.2d at 1232. In addition, under Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), an insured has the option of initially bringing a contract action against his uninsured motorist carrier or of initially bringing a tort action against the uninsured tortfeasor and thereafter bringing a contract action against the uninsured motorist carrier. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 736, 436 A.2d at 474; <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>285 Md. at 554, 403 A.2d at 1233.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Turning to the present case, the decisions below cannot be squared either with general contract principles or with this Court\u2019s opinions. By holding that the statute of limitations began to run as soon as the Lanes learned that the tortfeasors were uninsured, the Court of Special Appeals in effect held that limitations in a contract action begin to run before there is a breach of contract. Moreover, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding is inconsistent with the insured\u2019s statutory options.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">In holding that the Lanes\u2019 action was barred by limitations, the Court of Special Appeals chiefly relied upon its earlier opinion in <em>Yingling v. Phillips, </em>65 Md.App. 451, 501 A.2d 87 (1985). Consequently, an examination of the <em>Yingling </em>case is appropriate. The relevant facts of that case were as follows. On December 17,1978, John Yingling was driving an automobile, owned by Joseph Phillips and insured by Prudential Property and Casualty Company, when two tires on the vehicle went flat. While Yingling was changing the tires on the shoulder of the road, a vehicle driven by Linda Miller and owned by National Car Rental Systems struck Yingling, causing serious personal injuries. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>Yingling, on May 2, 1979, filed a tort action against Miller and National Car Rental. The insurer of National Car Rental\u2019s vehicle refused to provide a defense to Miller on the ground that she was driving the vehicle without permission and thus was not an insured under the policy. Apparently there was no other automobile liability insurance covering Miller. Prudential, the insurer of the vehicle driven by Yingling, was notified of the tort suit but did not intervene. On September 5, 1980, while the tort action was pending, Prudential filed an action against Yingling and others for a declaratory judgment that Prudential had no liability under the uninsured motorist provision of the policy; this action was subsequently dismissed without prejudice. In the tort action, summary judgment was granted in favor of National on the ground that Miller did not have permission to use the vehicle. Yingling obtained a judgment against the uninsured motorist Miller for $99,240.15, on June 8, 1983. After Prudential refused to pay this judgment, Yingling on July 25, 1984, brought a declaratory judgment action against Prudential and others, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaration that Prudential was liable for the tort judgment under the uninsured motorist coverage of its policy. The trial court dismissed Yingling\u2019s declaratory judgment action on the ground that it was barred by limitations, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed on the same ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">In <em>Yingling, </em>the Court of Special Appeals rejected the contention that the three-year statute of limitations did not begin to run against Prudential until Yingling recovered a judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor. Instead, the intermediate appellate court held that Yingling\u2019s cause of action against Prudential for uninsured motorist benefits accrued, and the statute of limitations began to run, when the insurance companies \u201cmade it clear that they rejected any possibility of coverage.\u201d 65 Md.App. at 458, 501 A.2d at 90. The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Yingling, </em>as it did later in the case at bar, relied upon language from this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>supra, </em>285 Md. at 554, 403 A.2d at 1233, \u201c \u2018that an insured need not, as a condition for recovery against his insurer under an uninsured motorist\u2019s endorsement, sue and obtain a judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor.\u2019 \u201d 65 Md. App. at 457, 501 A.2d at 90. The Court of Special Appeals itself then stated: \u201cIn other words, the insured\u2019s breach of contract action against his insurer accrued when it denied coverage, not when the insured recovered judgment against the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>According to the Court of Special Appeals, when the liability insurer of the vehicle driven by the tortfeasor disclaimed coverage, and when thereafter Prudential disclaimed coverage by bringing a declaratory judgment action on September 5, 1980, there was \u201ca breach or at least an anticipatory breach of the contract,\u201d and \u201c[b]y then [Yingling\u2019s] cause of action against the insurers clearly had accrued.\u201d 65 Md.App. at 460, 461, 501 A.2d at 92.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">While <em>Yingling </em>appeared to hold that the insured\u2019s cause of action for uninsured motorist benefits accrued when the insured learned that the tortfeasor was uninsured <em>and </em>when the uninsured motorist carrier disclaimed coverage, in the present case the Court of Special Appeals seemed to go one step farther. The court held that the Lanes\u2019 cause of action for uninsured motorist benefits accrued when they learned that the tortfeasors were uninsured, apparently without regard to any disclaimer by their uninsured motorist carrier. The record in the present case does not disclose that Nationwide disclaimed coverage more than three years prior to the Lanes\u2019 breach of contract action against Nationwide, and the Court of Special Appeals did not rely upon any purported disclaimer by Nationwide. Nonetheless, both the <em>Yingling </em>holding and the holding in the present case are inconsistent with <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>the case relied upon in both Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">In the <em>Reese </em>case, the insured Bill Reese was operating his own vehicle when he was injured in an accident caused by the negligence of the driver of an uninsured vehicle. Instead of filing a tort action against the uninsured tort<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>feasor, Mr. Reese claimed damages from his own insurer under the uninsured motorist provision of his policy. Upon the denial of this claim, Reese brought a breach of contract action against his insurer. The insurer argued, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthat, as a condition precedent for suing State Farm under the uninsured motorist endorsement, the plaintiff Reese was first required to recover a judgment against [the uninsured tortfeasor].\u201d <em>Reese v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., supra, </em>285 Md. at 550, 403 A.2d at 1230. The trial court, agreeing with the insurer\u2019s argument, entered judgment in favor of the insurer. This Court reversed, stating (as pointed out by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Yingling) </em>that \u201can insured need not, as a condition for recovery against his insurer under the uninsured motorist endorsement, sue and obtain a judgment against the uninsured tortfeasor.\u201d <em>Reese, </em>285 Md. at 554, 403 A.2d at 1233. What the Court of Special Appeals has overlooked, however, is our further statement in <em>Reese </em>that, under the language of Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c), an insured \u201chas the <em>option </em>of bringing a contract action against his insurer <em>or a tort action against the uninsured </em>motorist.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>emphasis added.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">Thus, under the statute as construed in <em>Reese, </em>an insured is entitled to bring a tort action against the uninsured motorist and have the damages determined in that tort action. He is not required initially to seek compensation from his own insurer under the uninsured motorist policy provision. In light of the insured\u2019s statutory option, the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position concerning the running of limitations is inconsistent with basic contract principles. As long as the insured does not demand compensation under his own insurance policy, the uninsured motorist carrier is not called upon to pay under the contract, and, therefore, there can be no breach of contract causing the statute of limitations to begin running.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Benefits under the uninsured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>motorist endorsement may never be demanded, as the insured may lose the tort action or the uninsured tortfeasor defendant may be able to pay a tort judgment rendered against him. The uninsured motorist insurance carrier is protected in this situation by the requirement that it be notified of the tort action and by its ability to intervene in the tort action if it so desires. <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. at 732, 738-743, 436 A.2d at 472, 475-478.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Furthermore, the \u201canticipatory breach\u201d theory suggested in the <em>Yingling </em>case, based on the uninsured motorist carrier\u2019s disclaimer of liability prior to a demand upon it by the insured, does not call for a different result. Under circumstances like those in <em>Yingling </em>and the present case, an anticipatory repudiation by the insurer does not cause the statute of limitations to begin running against the insured. As explained in 4 <em>Corbin On Contracts, </em>\u00a7 989 (1951):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-5\">\u201cThere is no necessity for making the statutory period of limitation begin to run against the plaintiff until the day fixed by the contract for the rendition of performance, at least unless the plaintiff definitely elects to regard the anticipatory repudiation as a final breach. It is generally said that he need not so elect and that he may properly wait until the time that performance was due, before regarding the contract as broken. He is not justified in forbearing to take steps that will mitigate his injury; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>the defendant ought not to be allowed to complain at the delay in bringing action against him. For the purpose of determining when the period of limitation begins to run, the defendant\u2019s non-performance at the day specified may be regarded as a breach of duty as well as the anticipatory repudiation. The plaintiff should not be penalized for leaving to the defendant an opportunity to retract his wrongful repudiation; and he would be so penalized if the statutory period of limitation is held to begin to run against him immediately.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\"><em>See, e.g., Hall v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>880 F.2d 394, 399 (11th Cir.1989); <em>Gold v. Killeen, </em>44 Ariz. 29, 34-35, 33 P.2d 595, 597, 94 A.L.R. 448 (1934); <em>Napa Ass\u2019n, Etc. v. County of Napa, </em>98 Cal.App.3d 263, 270 n. 5, 159 Cal.Rptr. 522, 526 n.5 (1979); <em>Annon v. Lucas, </em>155 W.Va. 368, 378-380, 185 S.E.2d 343, 351 (1971); <em>Restatement of Contracts, </em>\u00a7 322 (1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">A case which is very analogous to the one before us is <em>Nationwide Mutual Ins. v. Webb, supra, </em>291 Md. 721, 436 A.2d 465. The <em>Webb </em>opinion involved two separate cases. In one of them, the insured, Mr. Franz, was injured in an automobile collision caused by the negligence of an uninsured motorist. Mr. Franz\u2019s insurer was the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (MAIF). Instead of bringing a contract action against his insurer as was done in <em>Reese, </em>Mr. Franz brought a tort action against the uninsured motorist, notifying MAIF of the tort action. MAIF, however, did not intervene in the tort suit. Franz recovered a judgment in the tort suit against the uninsured tortfeasor. Thereafter, Franz demanded that MAIF pay the judgment, but MAIF refused, relying on a \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clause contained in the uninsured motorist endorsement. Under a consent to sue clause, an insured is required to obtain the consent of his insurer before prosecuting a tort suit against the uninsured motorist. Franz then brought a contract action against MAIF, claiming entitlement to the amount of damages rendered in the tort suit plus the court costs in the tort suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>This Court held in <em>Webb </em>that, under the circumstances presented, the uninsured motorist carrier MAIF was bound by the judgment in the tort suit and that the insured Franz was entitled to the damages sought. We further held that \u201cconsent to sue\u201d clauses contained in uninsured motorist endorsements were invalid under Art. 48A, \u00a7 541(c). One of the reasons for holding the consent to sue clause invalid was that it interfered with the insured\u2019s statutory option of first bringing a tort action against the uninsured tortfeasor. The Court in <em>Webb </em>thus explained (291 Md. at 736, 436 A.2d at 474):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-4\">\u201cWe stated in <em>Reese </em>that in light of the statutory language, the insured has different options for establishing that he \u2018is entitled to recover\u2019 from the uninsured motorist. \u2018He has the option of bringing a contract action against his insurer or a tort action against the uninsured motorist.\u2019 285 Md. at 554 [403 A.2d 1229]. Under [the insurer\u2019s] argument in the instant case, however, the insured would have no real option. If the \u2018consent to sue\u2019 clause is valid, and if the insurer is not bound by the outcome in the tort case, the insurer can always require that the insured bring a contract action against the insurer in order to establish the tort liability of the uninsured motorist and the amount of tort damages. The insured would have no \u2018option\u2019 to finally establish these tort issues in a tort suit against the uninsured motorist.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZQ\">The same can be said with regard to the insurer\u2019s argument in the present case. If the three-year statute of limitations against the uninsured motorist carrier begins to run as soon as the insured learns that the tortfeasor is uninsured (or as in <em>Yingling </em>when the insured learns that the tortfeasor is uninsured and the uninsured motorist carrier disclaims coverage), the insured\u2019s statutory option of first bringing a tort suit against the uninsured motorist, and thereafter making a claim under his uninsured motorist endorsement, will be frustrated.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">When an insured elects to bring and does bring a timely tort action against the uninsured motorist, having notified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>his uninsured motorist carrier of the tort action, and when the insured thereafter either during the pendency of the tort action or within a reasonable time after judgment in the tort case makes a claim upon his insurer for uninsured motorist benefits, the statute of limitations does not begin running against the insured until the insurer denies that claim, thereby allegedly breaching the contract. Cases in several other jurisdictions appear to be in accord with this view. <em>See, e.g., Allstate Ins. Co. v. Spinelli, </em>443 A.2d 1286, 1291-1292 (Del.1982); <em>Jacobs v. Detroit Auto. Inter-Insurance, </em>107 Mich.App. 424, 430-431, 309 N.W.2d 627, 630 (1981); <em>Safeco Ins. Co. v. Barcom, </em>112 Wash.2d 575, 773 P.2d 56 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">As the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 position adopted in <em>Yingling v. Phillips, supra, </em>and in the present case is inconsistent with the decisions of this Court, the <em>Yingling </em>case is overruled and the present case must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR WICOMICO COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION.
