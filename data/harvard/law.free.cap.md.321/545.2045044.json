These alleged violations focused upon misappropriation, conversion, and commingling of client funds by Kolodner for periods commencing after September, 1987. We referred the matter, pursuant to Md.Rule BV 9b, to Judge James T. Smith, Jr. of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County to make findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">At the time the disciplinary petition was filed, Kolodner was under indefinite suspension from the practice of law for earlier disciplinary infractions which were found to have been causally related to his alcoholism. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>317 Md. 507, 564 A.2d 1180 (1989); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>316 Md. 203, 557 A.2d 1332 (1989). <em>See also Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Kolodner, </em>Misc.Docket (BV) No. 31, September Term, 1988 (unreported), filed February 28, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">Kolodner did not appear at the hearing before Judge Smith. Extensive findings of fact and conclusions of law were filed by Judge Smith; he determined, by clear and convincing evidence, that Kolodner\u2019s misappropriation, conversion and commingling of client funds violated DR 1-102 and 9-102, Rules 1.15, 8.1, and 8.4, and Art. 10, \u00a7 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">According to evidence adduced in earlier cases involving Kolodner\u2019s disciplinary infractions, Kolodner ceased drinking after September, 1987. Judge Smith found that Kolodner\u2019s misconduct occurred after this date, was willful, and that there was no causal relation between the misconduct in the present case and alcoholism.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">By an exception taken by Kolodner to Judge Smith\u2019s findings, he claimed that his misconduct was not willful and was in fact caused by alcoholism. Bar Counsel, in recommending disbarment for Kolodner\u2019s disciplinary infractions, agreed with Judge Smith\u2019s findings. Moreover, he asserts that the evidence does not disclose any extenuating circumstances for Kolodner\u2019s misconduct. We agree and accept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Judge Smith\u2019s findings, as well as Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation for sanction. Accordingly, we forthwith order Kolodner\u2019s disbarment. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Goldberg, </em>307 Md. 546, 515 A.2d 765 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Pattison, </em>292 Md. 599, 608-10, 441 A.2d 328 (1982); <em>Bar Association v. Marshall, </em>269 Md. 510, 518-19, 307 A.2d 677 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE BV15 c FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION AGAINST FRED KOLODNER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-12\">.
