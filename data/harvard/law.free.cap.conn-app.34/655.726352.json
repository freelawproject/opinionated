We affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. After work on April 5, 1988, Maloney arrived at his home in Southington at about 6 p.m. Maloney showered, got dressed and had one or two beers. At <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>approximately 7:30 p.m., Maloney departed for New Haven, where he planned to go to two bars, The Pub Cafe and Partners, both of which he had visited on numerous occasions. When Maloney arrived in New Haven at about 8:30 p.m., he parked his car in a lot across the street from The Pub Cafe, which is located on York Street. He then had dinner alone at the Brass Button, a restaurant also located on York Street, several buildings from The Pub Cafe. While at the Brass Button, Maloney had two or three \u201cWhite Russians.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Maloney intended to become intoxicated that night. After dinner, between 9:30 and 9:45 p.m., Maloney walked to The Pub Cafe, where he leisurely drank two to three more White Russians. He then walked to Partners, a bar located just around the corner from The Pub Cafe. Maloney stayed briefly at Partners and consumed two more White Russians. At approximately 11:30 p.m., in an intoxicated state, Maloney, alone and unassisted, walked back to The Pub Cafe, where he was served one more White Russian. Maloney then lost memory of any further events until those occurring at the Meriden-Wallingford Hospital early in the morning on April 6, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Sometime after leaving The Pub Cafe, Maloney retrieved his car from the parking lot, and drove north toward Hartford. Subsequently reversing his direction, he entered Interstate 91, without having turned on his headlights, and traveled south in one of the northbound lanes. At approximately 1 a.m. on April 6, 1988, Maloney\u2019s vehicle struck the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle, which had been traveling north in one of the northbound lanes, slightly south of exit 18. Both the plaintiff and Maloney suffered injuries as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>State Trooper Edward Roche and an ambulance arrived on the scene at approximately the same time. Because of the injuries suffered by Maloney and the medical treatment given to him at the scene, Roche was unable to conduct many of the standard field tests for sobriety. On the bases of the nature of the accident, Maloney\u2019s actions at the scene, the odor of alcohol on his breath, and Maloney\u2019s statement that he had been drinking, Roche determined that Maloney was intoxicated and that probable cause existed to believe that Maloney was under the influence of intoxicating liquor at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Maloney was transported to Meriden-Wallingford Hospital. Two blood alcohol tests<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> were administered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>at the hospital at approximately 3:05 and 3:39 a.m. The first test revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.14 percent, while the second revealed a blood alcohol content of 0.12 percent. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary for the resolution of the individual claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">Blood Alcohol Tests</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The defendants first contend<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the trial court improperly denied their motion in limine regarding the two blood alcohol tests. Specifically, the defendants claim that the test results should not have been introduced without expert testimony to extrapolate the data back to the time that The Pub Cafe allegedly served Maloney his last drink. The defendants make two arguments regarding this claim. First, they contend that, with regard to the dram shop count, while a blood alcohol level exceeding 0.10 percent is indicative of an individual\u2019s being \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor\u201d while operating a motor vehicle pursuant to \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2), such a reading does not prove that an individual is intoxicated. Second, they allege that, even if the blood alcohol tests do bear some indication of Maloney\u2019s intoxication, without some limit or explanation of the data, the admission of the blood alcohol test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>results severely prejudiced the defendants and constituted harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">\u201cOur standard of review of issues involving evidentiary rulings is that we will set aside on appeal rulings on evidentiary matters only upon a showing of a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>213 Conn. 446, 451, 569 A.2d 10 (1990); <em>Munson </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corporation, </em>28 Conn. App. 184, 189, 609 A.2d 1066 (1992).\u201d <em>Gemme </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>31 Conn. App. 527, 539, 626 A.2d 318 (1993). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court has abused its broad discretion, we will afford every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its ruling. . . . The ultimate issue to be determined in a claim involving an alleged abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion is whether the trial court could reasonably conclude as it did.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 538. In addition, once we determine that an abuse of discretion has occurred, \u201cour next inquiry is whether the court\u2019s evidentiary rulings constituted harmful error. To be reversible, evidentiary error must be both wrong and harmful. <em>Sanderson </em>v. <em>Steve Snyder Enterprises, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 134, 142, 491 A.2d 389 (1985); <em>DeCarufel v. Colonial Trust Co., </em>143 Conn. 18, 21, 118 A.2d 798 (1955). The appellant bears the burden of establishing the specific harmfulness of the error. See <em>Braun </em>v. <em>Edelstein, </em>17 Conn. App. 658, 554 A.2d 1102, cert. denied, 211 Conn. 803, 559 A.2d 1136 (1989).\u201d <em>Sokolowski </em>v. <em>Medi Mart, Inc., </em>24 Conn. App. 276, 282, 587 A.2d 1056 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">In order to prove that a sale of intoxicating liquor was made in a wilful, wanton and reckless manner, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendants acted in a manner that tended to take on the aspect of \u201c \u2018highly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dubay </em>v. <em>Irish, </em>207 Conn. 518, 533, 542 A.2d 711 (1988). Proof of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>certain blood alcohol content is not necessary to establish that the defendant acted in a wilful, wanton and reckless manner in dispensing alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">To establish a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 30-102, three elements must be proven. \u201cIn each case . . . the trier must decide as a question of fact: whether there was (1) a sale of intoxicating liquor (2) to an <em>intoxicated </em>person (3) who, in consequence of such intoxication, causes injury to the person or property of another.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 341, 349, 493 A.2d 184 (1985). Proof of a particular blood alcohol level is not required to establish that Maloney was intoxicated either when served by The Pub Cafe or when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The defendants contend that the results of the blood alcohol tests given over two hours after the accident had occurred and approximately three and one-half to four hours after The Pub Cafe had allegedly served Maloney for the final time should not have been admitted. First, with regard to the dram shop count, the defendants allege that the definition of \u201cintoxication\u201d varies from that of operation of a motor vehicle while \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquor,\u201d which can be established by a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2). The defendants argue, in essence, that, because a blood alcohol test is used to determine whether an individual is \u201cunder the influence\u201d pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a(a) (2), rather than \u201cintoxicated\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 30-102, the blood alcohol tests were improperly admitted on this count because they do not gauge \u201cintoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, 196 Conn. 349-50, our Supreme Court defined intoxication as follows: \u201cTo be intoxicated is something more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>than to be merely under the influence of, or affected to some extent by, liquor. Intoxication means an abnormal mental or physical condition due to the influence of intoxicating liquors, a visible excitation of the passions and impairment of the judgment, or a derangement or impairment of physical functions and energies. When it is apparent that a person is under the influence of liquor, when his manner is unusual or abnormal and is reflected in his walk or conversation, when his ordinary judgment or common sense are disturbed or his usual will power temporarily suspended, when these or similar symptoms result from the use of liquor and are manifest, a person may be found to be intoxicated. He need not be \u2018dead-drunk.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">\u201cThe defendant appears to suggest that the Supreme Court and the legislature have recognized varying states of inebriation, with the state of being \u2018under the influence\u2019 of intoxicating liquor referring to a lesser level than\u2018intoxication.\u2019. . . [W]e note that where the legislature has distinguished between levels of inebriation, it has not distinguished the phrase \u2018under the influence of intoxicating liquor\u2019 from \u2018intoxication.\u2019 See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (distinguishing driving while under the influence [blood alcohol 0.10 percent or greater] from driving while impaired [blood alcohol less than 0.10 percent but more than 0.07 percent]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hancich, </em>200 Conn. 615, 619-21, 513 A.2d 638 (1986). . . . While the Supreme Court in <em>Sanders </em>v. <em>Officers Club of Connecticut, Inc., </em>supra, [196 Conn.] 349, stated that \u2018[t]o be intoxicated is something more than to be merely under the influence of, or affected to some extent by, liquor,\u2019 the court gave no indication that its definition of intoxication was intended as a departure from its previous interpretations of the term \u2018under the influence\u2019 of intoxicating liquor. On the contrary, in the same paragraph, the court stated: \u2018When it is apparent that a person is under the influ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>ence of liquor, when his manner is unusual or abnormal and is reflected in his walk or conversation . . . a person may be found to be intoxicated.\u2019. . . Id., 349-50.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McKenna, </em>11 Conn. App. 122, 130-32, 525 A.2d 1374, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 806, 531 A.2d 939 (1987) (discussing change in language of General Statutes \u00a7 53-56b from \u201cintoxication\u201d to \u201cunder the influence of intoxicating liquors\u201d and propriety of jury instructions invoking language typical of \u201cintoxication\u201d definition).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Although \u00a7 30-102 is not a per se offense that can be proven merely by establishing a blood alcohol level of 0.10 percent or greater at the time the elements of the offense occurred, the results of the blood alcohol tests nonetheless may indicate that a person had imbibed intoxicating liquors, which is a key factor in determining whether an individual is intoxicated. Clearly, then, the results of the blood alcohol tests are relevant to a determination of intoxication for the purposes of \u00a7 30-102. Similarly, proof of common law wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct in the selling of alcohol does not require evidence of a specific blood alcohol level, but such evidence is nonetheless relevant to a determination whether the defendants acted in such a manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">The defendants further contend, however, that the test results could not be introduced properly with regard to either count without expert evidence explaining the test results and extrapolating the results back to the time of the elements of the alleged offense. The defendants correctly assert that in a criminal prosecution for driving under the influence pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2), several procedural requirements must be met before a blood alcohol test can be introduced into evidence. For example, evidence establishing the relationship of the blood alcohol test to the individual\u2019s blood alcohol content at the time of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>the offense must be presented. See General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (c) (6); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>22 Conn. App. 142, 160-62, 576 A.2d 1283, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 819, 576 A.2d 547 (1990), vacated on other grounds, 498 U.S. 1019, 111 S. Ct. 663, 112 L. Ed. 2d 657, aff'd on remand, 25 Conn. App. 282, 594 A.2d 985 (1991), aff'd, 222 Conn. 672, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Section 14-227a (a) (2), unlike \u00a7 30-102 and the common law claim of wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct, is a per se criminal offense, which can be established upon proof of a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent or greater at the time of the alleged offense. The procedural requirements set forth in \u00a7 14-227a (c) for the admissibility of blood alcohol tests have not been extended to actions brought pursuant to other statutes. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Singleton, </em>174 Conn. 112, 115-16, 384 A.2d 334 (1977), cert. denied, 440 U.S. 947, 99 S. Ct. 1425, 59 L. Ed. 2d 635 (1979) (procedural requirements for admission of blood alcohol test in criminal prosecution for driving under influence not extended to prosecution pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 53a-57); <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>DelPonte, </em>27 Conn. App. 346, 353, 606 A.2d 716 (1992) (in administrative license revocation proceeding pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b, standard of reliable and probative evidence does not require extrapolation testimony to establish that blood alcohol content was 0.10 percent or greater at time of offense if other evidence establishes blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent at time of offense); <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>supra, 22 Conn. App. 166 (in conviction for \u00a7 53a-60d, assault in second degree with motor vehicle while under influence of intoxicating liquor, extrapolation of blood alcohol tests to time of offense not required, as defendant\u2019s behavior can corroborate accuracy of results of blood alcohol tests); <em>Futterleib </em>v. <em>Mr. Happy\u2019s, Inc., </em>16 Conn. App. 497, 506-507, 548 A.2d 728 (in general, procedural requirements for admission of blood test pursuant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>to \u00a7 14-227a do not apply to civil actions brought under \u00a7 30-102 and common law wanton and reckless misconduct claim).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In this case, the blood alcohol tests were offered as circumstantial evidence of both Maloney\u2019s intoxication at the time of the accident and Maloney\u2019s intoxication at the time of service. Having established that the results of the blood alcohol tests are relevant to the determinations of whether an individual is intoxicated pursuant to \u00a7 30-102 and whether The Pub Cafe dispensed alcohol in a wilful, wanton and reckless manner, we now examine whether the results of the tests performed on Maloney were sufficiently accurate, without extrapolation testimony, regarding his condition at the time of service and at the time of the accident. We conclude that the accuracy of the blood alcohol test with regard to Maloney\u2019s condition at the time of the accident was corroborated by a variety of other evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>dence presented. Maloney admitted that he intended to become intoxicated that night, related that he had approximately one to two beers and six to nine White Russians prior to his return to The Pub Cafe at approximately 11:30 p.m., stated that he was intoxicated when he returned to The Pub Cafe, and lost his memory of events after being served another White Russian upon his return to The Pub Cafe. Maloney subsequently drove his vehicle south in the northbound lane of Interstate 91 without having turned on his headlights, and collided with the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle. We further note that Maloney did not drink any alcohol or take any drugs between the time of the accident and the time of the blood alcohol tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">With regard to providing circumstantial evidence addressed to the issue of Maloney\u2019s intoxication at the time of service, the test results are more problematic. Maloney\u2019s memory failed after being served at The Pub Cafe at approximately 11:30 p.m. The seventy-five to ninety minutes between Maloney\u2019s consumption of his drink and the accident can be reconstructed only to the extent of determining how he arrived at the accident scene. He had two open bottles of alcohol in his car at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The blood alcohol test results as they related to the time of service may have been affected by other activities during the intervening time.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Although we conclude, for that reason, that the admission of the blood alcohol tests should have been limited to the issue of Maloney\u2019s condition at the time of the accident, the defendants have failed to prove that the unrestricted admission of the evidence was harmful with regard to either the dram shop count or the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct count. The plaintiff provided ample evidence that Maloney was intoxicated at the time of service. Maloney admitted that he intended to become intoxicated, related that he had approximately one to two beers and six to nine White Russians prior to his return to The Pub Cafe, stated that he was intoxicated when he returned to The Pub Cafe, and lost his memory of events subsequent to his return to The Pub Cafe. On the basis of that evidence, the jury reasonably could have concluded, by a preponderance of the evidence, that The Pub Cafe acted in a wilful, wanton and reckless manner in dispensing alcohol to Maloney, that Maloney was intoxicated when served by The Pub Cafe on the second occasion, and that, as a result of such intoxication, Maloney caused the collision on Interstate 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">Police Report</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">The defendants next claim that Roche\u2019s police report, which contained Maloney\u2019s out-of-court statement that he had been \u201cdrinking in New Haven,\u201d should have been suppressed as inadmissible hearsay. The plaintiff contends that the statement is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule either as an admission of a party opponent or as a declaration against penal interest, and, even if not admissible under one of these exceptions, that the admission constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">We first examine the plaintiff\u2019s contention that the statement was properly admitted under a hearsay exception as an admission of a party opponent. Such an \u201cadmission can be used <em>only </em>against the party who made it. <em>Palombizio </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>146 Conn. 352, 355-56, 150 A.2d 825 (1959); C. Tait &amp; J. LaPlante, [Connecticut Evidence (1976)] \u00a7 11.5.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>In re Jason S., </em>9 Conn. App. 98, 104, 516 A.2d 1352 (1986). Unless a limiting instruction is requested, however, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>admission may be used against other parties as well. <em>Pluhowsky </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>151 Conn. 337, 343-44, 197 A.2d 645 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The statement in the report was made by the eodefendant, Maloney. The defendants requested that the use of the report be limited, but the court failed to do so. Although we conclude that the evidence was improperly admitted as an admission of a party opponent with regard to The Pub Cafe, and that this admission constituted an abuse of discretion, the defendants have not established that the introduction of the report constituted harmful error.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">\u201cIt is well recognized that any error in the admission of evidence does not require reversal of the resulting judgment if the improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative of other validly admitted testimony. <em>Emhart Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local Union 376, U. A. W., </em>190 Conn. 371, 391, 461 A.2d 422 (1983).\u201d <em>Kimbrell </em>v. <em>Rossitto, </em>6 Conn. App. 638, 653, 507 A.2d 120 (1986). Maloney had already testified to the substance of the contested statement. In fact, Maloney\u2019s testimony was much more specific than the information contained in the report. While the statement in the report described Maloney\u2019s drinking in \u201cNew Haven,\u201d Maloney testified specifically regarding the establishments where he drank in New Haven. Further, Roche had also testified, without objection, that Maloney had stated that he had been drinking in New Haven. Because the substance of the contested statement in the police report, therefore, already had been admitted, the admission of that portion of the police report was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Directed Verdict</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">The defendants next argue that the trial court improperly failed to grant their motion for a directed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>verdict at the close of the plaintiffs case, as well as the renewal of that motion pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 321 at the close of evidence, with regard to the claim of wilful, wanton and reckless conduct. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">\u201cOur review of the trial court\u2019s refusal to direct a verdict is limited. [W]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. ... A directed verdict is justified if on the evidence the jury could not reasonably and legally reach any other conclusion than that embodied in [a verdict for the defendant] ... or if the evidence is so weak that it would be proper for the court to set aside a verdict rendered for the other party. . . . When a jury has returned a verdict and the trial court has refused to set it aside, [t]he court\u2019s decision will be upheld on appeal if, from the evidence presented, the jury could reasonably have concluded as it did.

The plaintiff\u2019s casein-chief included Maloney\u2019s testimony concerning his intent to become intoxicated, the number of drinks he had consumed, his opinion that he was intoxicated upon his return to The Pub Cafe, and the failure of his memory after having another White Russian at The Pub Cafe. The jury reasonably could have inferred from the evidence set forth that Maloney manifested signs of intoxication and, therefore, concluded that The Pub Cafe engaged in \u201chighly unreasonable conduct, involving an extreme departure from ordinary care, in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">The defendants next contend that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury, pursuant to their request to charge, that wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct is more that gross negligence, that wilful misconduct is intentional misconduct, and that wanton misconduct is reckless misconduct, which is the equivalent of wilful misconduct.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The pertinent section of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>court\u2019s instructions to the jury with regard to the wilful, wanton and reckless misconduct charge are as follows: \u201cRecklessness involves highly unreasonable conduct involving an extreme departure from ordinary care in a situation where a high degree of danger is present. Recklessness requires a conscious choice of a course of action, either with knowledge that it would involve serious injury to other, or with knowledge of facts which would disclose the danger to any reasonable man. Reckless or wanton misconduct is such conduct as indicates a reckless disregard of the just rights or safety of others or of the consequence of actions. Therefore, if you find [that The Pub Cafe] served liquor beyond the point when Mr. Maloney was drunk, and they knew or should have known that Brian Maloney was already intoxicated, you may determine whether or not they did conduct themselves in a reckless, wanton and wilful way.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">\u201cOur Supreme Court, however, has stated the following: Wilful, wanton or reckless conduct tends to take on the aspect of highly unreasonable conduct involving an extreme departure from ordinary care in a situation where a high degree of danger is apparent. Furthermore, the state of mind amounting to recklessness may be inferred from conduct, but in order to infer it there must be something more that a failure to exercise a reasonable degree of watchfulness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">\u201cThe court is under no duty at any time to charge in the exact language requested. . . . Failure to charge precisely as proposed by a defendant is not error where the point is fairly covered in the charge. . . . Instructions are adequate if they give the jury a clear understanding of the issues and proper guidance in determining those issues.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Tomczuk </em>v. <em>Alvarez, </em>184 Conn. 182, 190, 439 A.2d 935 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Commerford, </em>30 Conn.

The plaintiff filed a motion after oral argument, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 4038, seeking permission for a conditional withdrawal of his cross appeal.

In his motion, the plaintiff states that he wants to withdraw the cross appeal if this court affirms the trial court\u2019s judgment.

The judgment on the verdicts against Maloney were not rendered until issues concerning collateral source recovery were determined, which occurred after this appeal by The Pub Cafe had been taken. We conclude, however, that pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 463 A.2d 566 (1983), the judgment rendered against The Pub Cafe is an appealable final judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b688-6\"> We note that this court has in the past examined jury instructions concerning criminal charges other than those brought pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) (2) in which the trial court provided a misplaced emphasis on the nature of the blood alcohol test results in relation to the particular criminal offense charged. <em>See State </em>v. <em>LeRoy, </em>16 Conn. App. 472, 478, 547 A.2d 940 (1988) (trial court, in its instructions on General Statutes [Rev. to 1983] \u00a7 53a-60d [a], assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle while intoxicated, improperly \u201cadded the weight of the statutory presumption to the jury\u2019s determination of whether the defendant was intoxicated\u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>12 Conn.

In this case, the defendants have not challenged the trial court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the tests, but rather, assert that the evidence was not properly admitted. We also note that the trial court, in charging the jury on the counts relating to The Pub Cafe, did not mention the blood alcohol test results. The court did, however, when instructing the jury on the count of negligence against codefendant Maloney, discuss that a violation of \u00a7 14-227a would establish negligence per se. The court explained the presumption concerning a blood alcohol content of 0.10 percent with regard to that offense.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b689-7\"> Maloney and the defendants\u2019 counsel engaged in the following exchange on cross-examination:</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">\u201c[Defense Counsel]: Okay.
