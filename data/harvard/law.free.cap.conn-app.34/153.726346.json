Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the petitioner failed to show that either trial or appellate counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective or outside the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law and that their performance contributed to the convictions orto the affirmance, on appeal, of the judgments of convictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>222 Conn. 469, 477, 610 A.2d 631 (1992); <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner, </em>218 Conn. 403, 424, 589 A.2d 1214 (1991); <em>see Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>29 Conn.

The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>Strickland </em>test \u201crequires a conclusive showing that (1) the attorney\u2019s performance was so deficient and the errors made by counsel were so egregious that the attorney was not functioning as counsel . . . and (2) there exists a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Summer-ville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>supra, 171, quoting <em>Ostolaza </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>26 Conn. App. 758, 761, 603 A.2d 768, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 906, 608 A.2d 692 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Some facts relating to the petitioner\u2019s trial are necessary background to the disposition of this appeal from the habeas court\u2019s judgment of dismissal. The petitioner left a bar with the victim and the petitioner\u2019s cousin after an evening of drinking. The cousin drove them to the victim\u2019s apartment building where the cousin left them at about 2 a.m. The victim\u2019s landlord testified that he heard the victim and another person walking upstairs toward the victim\u2019s apartment at approximately 2 a.m., and that about one-half hour later he heard what sounded like a body falling out of a bed. A babysitter in the victim\u2019s apartment building testified that sometime between 12:30 and 2 a.m., he heard the victim crying and the voice of a \u201csmooth educated man.\u201d The babysitter later identified the petitioner\u2019s voice as one of two possible voices he had heard that night. The victim was stabbed with a barbecue fork and strangled with an antenna wire, and her room was set on fire. The petitioner had blood stains on his shirt inconsistent with his own blood type and consistent with the victim\u2019s blood type. At about 5:15 a.m., some of the contents of the victim\u2019s purse were found strewn along a street located between the victim\u2019s apartment and the petitioner\u2019s house. The barbecue fork and other items from the purse were found in a storm drain located along a path between the victim\u2019s apartment and the petitioner\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The petitioner did not take the stand. According to the testimony of his trial counsel at the habeas hearing, the petitioner\u2019s trial strategy was to emphasize his cooperative attitude with the police to show his lack of guilt and to provide the jury with a reasonable doubt that he had committed the crimes. A police officer testified at trial that during the course of a search of the petitioner\u2019s house, pursuant to a warrant, the two had a conversation. The petitioner had been given the warnings required by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 478-79, 86 S. Ct. 1602, 16 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1966), prior to the conversation, but had not yet been arrested, although he was aware that he was a suspect, and had hired an attorney.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The petitioner said he would like to talk to the officer but the petitioner\u2019s wife entered the room and the conversation stopped. Later, when the officer and the petitioner were alone on the petitioner\u2019s front porch at the invitation of the officer, the officer asked if he would still like to talk, and the petitioner said yes. The officer told him that maybe he should talk to his attorney but the petitioner said that he did not need an attorney and wanted to talk to the officer \u201cman-to-man.\u201d He said that he would call the officer the next day, which he did. During that telephone conversation, he made an appointment to meet the officer but did not keep it. This testimony was given without objection by defense counsel.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The prosecutor reiterated the testimony during closing argument and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>then commented as follows: \u201cNow what is it that he would have said . . . that he hadn\u2019t said in previous statements. Something obviously that he hadn't said back then. And he wanted to talk man-to-man. I would just ask you to consider that in your mind. What additional information he wanted to relay that he had not related previously.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Competency of Trial Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">No expert testimony was proffered in the habeas proceeding as to the trial counsel\u2019s lack of effective assistance. The habeas court concluded that without such testimony, the petitioner could not prevail on the claims relating to that counsel\u2019s alleged incompetency.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Whether expert testimony is required in a particular case is determined on a case-by-case basis and its necessity is dependent on whether the issues are of sufficient complexity to warrant the use of the testimony as assistance to the habeas court. <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>29 Conn. App. 274, 281-82, 613 A.2d 327 (1992). It is the habeas court, therefore, that must initially decide whether, in order to make intelligent findings, it needs expert testimony on the question that it must decide. <em>State </em>v. <em>Vilalastra, 207 </em>Conn. 35, 41, 540 A.2d 42 (1988). A trial court has broad discretion in determining whether expert testimony is needed. See id., 45. In this case, because of the complexity of the issues, the habeas court determined that expert testimony was necessary for a determination of whether the trial counsel\u2019s performance was incompetent, and that, without such expert testimony, no finding as to competency could be made. The habeas court also stated that even if it assumed that the claimed delicts of the trial counsel amounted to incompetency, the alleged incompetency did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s convictions. We conclude that the habeas court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>abuse its discretion in requiring expert testimony in this case. A discussion of the issues will suffice to show that the trial court acted properly in concluding that expert testimony was needed and in concluding, having assumed ineffectiveness of counsel, that that ineffectiveness did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">The petitioner argues that trial couiisel should have moved to strike the testimony of four witnesses and that, if he had, the trial court would have had to grant the motion to strike the testimony in order to avoid reversible error. The petitioner claims that counsel was ineffective in failing to move to strike the testimony and that the failure to so move caused the inclusion of the testimony and establishes a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Some discussion of the direct appeal and the trial are needed to resolve these claims. On the direct appeal from his convictions, the petitioner claimed that the testimony of five witnesses whose tape-recorded statements had been erased should have been stricken. There was an objection at trial to the introduction of one of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, but none as to the four other witnesses. It is the testimony of these four witnesses that is the subject of the petitioner\u2019s habeas claim. The direct appeal determined that because the four tapes were not destroyed in bad faith, there could be no automatic reversal of the petitioner\u2019s convictions because of the destruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The direct appeal also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>determined that the testimony of the fifth witness, which <em>was </em>the subject of a motion to strike by the petitioner, would not require a reversal of the petitioner\u2019s conviction because the state had met its burden of proving that it was more probable than not that the state\u2019s nonproduction of the tape was harmless. <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 571 A.2d 79 (1990). That witness provided the most damaging testimony against the petitioner and, had the claim as to the other four witnesses been preserved by trial counsel, it is unlikely that the result would have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The petitioner also claims as ineffective assistance of trial counsel the failure to object to the comment made during closing argument<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> about the defendant\u2019s failure to keep an appointment at the police station, asking the jury to consider what he wanted to relay \u201cman-to-man\u201d that he had not related to the police previously.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The petitioner did not take the stand and the comment, therefore, could not have been used directly to impeach his credibility by attacking an explanation or defense offered at trial. <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610, established the principle that after <em>Miranda </em>warnings are given the state may not use the silence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>defendant, which is \u201cinsolubly ambiguous,\u201d to impeach the defendant\u2019s testimony. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Apostle, </em>8 Conn. App. 216, 225, 512 A.2d 947 (1986). Nor may the silence be used to imply guilt or to indicate a consciousness of guilt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>227 Conn. 417, 437, 630 A.2d 1043 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The petitioner is not claiming that the testimony of the police officer recounting the petitioner\u2019s expressed desire to talk to the police was a comment on silence. The alleged comment on silence, according to the petitioner, was the asking of the jury what he would have said at trial or at the police station had he broken his silence. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Canty, </em>223 Conn. 703, 613 A.2d 1287 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Esposito, </em>223 Conn. 299, 613 A.2d 242 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Leecan, </em>198 Conn. 517, 504 A.2d 480, cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1184, 106 S. Ct. 2922, 91 L. Ed. 2d 550 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Pellegrino, </em>194 Conn. 279, 480 A.2d 537 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Apostle, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 216.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The strategy of the petitioner was to induce the jury to believe because of his cooperation with the police that someone other than he had committed the crimes. The comment does not attack that strategy but does imply that if the petitioner had kept his appointment with the police officer, he might have corrected his original statement that he had not entered the victim\u2019s apartment on the night of her murder and confessed that he had entered the apartment. Expert opinion would have helped the trial court to determine whether the failure to object to the comment was ineffective assistance of counsel or trial strategy to show the jury the cooperative attitude of the petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The petitioner also claims that trial counsel was ineffective because he failed to object to the comment even though it was impermissible under <em>Griffin </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number><em>California, </em>supra, 380 U.S. 609.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution forbid comment by the prosecution or the court about a defendant\u2019s failure to testify in his own behalf. Id.; <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMartino, </em>7 Conn. App. 292, 508 A.2d 809 (1986); <em>see State v. Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 612 A.2d 755 (1992). The Connecticut legislature has affirmed this constitutional right by mandating that, unless the accused requests otherwise, the court must instruct the jury that it may draw no unfavorable inferences from an accused\u2019s failure to testify. General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">The test to determine whether the comment violated the fourteenth amendment is whether a jury would naturally and necessarily understand the remarks to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify. <em>State </em>v. <em>Correia, </em>33 Conn. App. 457, 636 A.2d 860 (1994). Here, the remarks called on the petitioner for an explanation that only he could provide and implied that he would have expanded his previous statement. It was not, however, a direct comment on his failure to testify but a comment on his failing to speak to the police. Even if the comment was constitutionally impermissible, as a <em>Griffin </em>violation, the final question to be answered is whether the failure of trial counsel to object contributed to the petitioner\u2019s conviction. Presumably, the charge required by \u00a7 54-84 (b) was given. If so, the jury would have had to deal with two conflicting themes, namely, the instruction to draw no unfavorable inferences from the failure of the defendant to testify, and the comment by the state that might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>construed as asking the jury to question why the defendant did not take the stand to explain why he did not keep his appointment with the police. Expert testimony would have assisted the trial court in determining whether the claimed delict was outside of the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill and if there was a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. The court was correct in concluding that the petitioner should not prevail without expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Competency of Appellate Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">The petitioner also argues that appellate counsel improperly failed to claim on appeal that the comment in the state\u2019s closing argument about the testimony of the police officer violated the principles of <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610, and <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 380 U.S. 609, thereby interfering with the petitioner\u2019s right to a fair trial. The petitioner produced an expert witness whose opinion was that the failure to raise these issues on appeal was ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">The test is not whether the issue, had it been raised on direct appeal, <em>might </em>have entitled the defendant to relief but whether the failure to raise the issue resulted in a miscarriage of justice. <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>222 Conn. 444, 461, 610 A.2d 598 (1992). The petitioner\u2019s expert witness as to the ineffectiveness of appellate counsel testified that a reasonably competent appellate counsel would have raised the unpreserved claims that the remarks of the prosecutor improperly commented on both the petitioner\u2019s right to remain silent after receiving <em>Miranda </em>warnings and his decision not to testify at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The comment implicated the petitioner\u2019s right to a <em>Miranda </em>induced silence, and possibly his right not to testify. Any comments about the failure to testify are forbidden because that silence implicates a defendant\u2019s due process as well as fifth and fourteenth amendment rights under the United States constitution. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 380 U.S. 609. The reasons for the petitioner\u2019s failure to testify on his own behalf at trial or his failure to break a post <em>-Miranda </em>silence may have been his guilt, his reliance on the state\u2019s assurance that he could remain silent, his reliance on his own knowledge of his constitutional right not to incriminate himself, his timidity or nervousness, or an instruction from his lawyer. On direct appeal, if the issue had been raised, the comment of the prosecutor might have been deemed violative of <em>Griffin. </em>See <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>supra, 223 Conn. 67; see also <em>Doyle </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 426 U.S. 610. An analysis would have then been undertaken to determine if it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have returned a guilty verdict without the impermissible comment. <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S. Ct. 824, 17 L. Ed. 2d 705 (1967); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Apostle, </em>supra, 8 Conn. App. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">In order to prevail on a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by way of habeas, the petitioner must establish both a deficient performance and actual prejudice. <em>Commissioner of Correction </em>v. <em>Rodriquez, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 477. \u201c[T]o establish prejudice resulting <em>from </em>his appellate counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he must establish that, as a result of that performance, there remains a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict that resulted in his appeal.\u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 454. The petitioner must establish that he would have been entitled to a reversal on appeal and that the deficiency raises a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the verdict. A petitioner must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>establish both and, if either is lacking, the petitioner is not entitled to habeas relief. Id., 454. The test for the first prong \u2014 would a reversal and a new trial have been required on direct appeal \u2014 depends on whether the state could show that the constitutional violation was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The test for the second prong \u2014 whether a petition for habeas requires the petitioner\u2019s conviction to be set aside and a new trial to be awarded \u2014 depends on whether the deficiency in appellate counsel\u2019s performance was so egregious as to have burdened the petitioner by an unreliable determination of guilt. A successful petition for habeas corpus is a \u201cbulwark against convictions that violate fundamental fairness.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1710, 1719, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u201cThe principle that collateral review is different from direct review resounds throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d Id. Different problems prevail when a conviction is set aside on direct appeal than when a conviction is set aside following a habeas writ. \u201cThese considerations counsel strongly in favor of requiring a habeas corpus petitioner who seeks to establish prejudice from his appellate counsel\u2019s performance to show that, as a result of the performance, it is reasonably probable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>that he remains burdened by an unreliable conviction.\u201d <em>Bunkley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 463.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">The validity of the jury verdict here was not undermined due to the failure of appellate counsel to raise a <em>Griffin </em>or <em>Doyle </em>issue. Even if the petitioner could establish that he would have been entitled to a reversal of his conviction had the issue been raised on appeal, he has not shown that the error was egregious enough to warrant the extraordinary remedy of habeas corpus. Thus, he cannot prevail on his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">The judgment of the habeas court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b177-6\"> The facts underlying the convictions are set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>214 Conn. 161, 571 A.2d 79 (1990).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b177-7\"> The petitioner also argues that his trial counsel \u201cacted incompetently in failing to object to testimony of a police officer concerning the petitioner\u2019s exercise of his post <em>-Miranda </em>right of silence.\u201d We do not address this issue because it was not addressed by the habeas court and the petitioner\u2019s expert witness testified that the failure to object to the testimony was not ineffective assistance of trial counsel.

Ed. 1557 (1946), with the burden of proof on the petitioner to show that the error had a substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury verdict. <em>Brecht </em>v. <em>Abrahamson, </em>U.S. , 113 S. Ct. 1710, 123 L. Ed. 2d 353 (1993). Although <em>Brecht </em>concerned a <em>Doyle </em>silence, <em>Brecht </em>applies to all constitutional errors, of the trial type, when reviewed by way of a habeas corpus writ. <em>Brecht </em>does not apply to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel raised by way of habeas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
