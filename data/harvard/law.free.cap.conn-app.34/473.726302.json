We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The jury could reasonably have found the following facts. The defendant first sexually assaulted the victim when she was about three years old. The defendant would come into the bathroom while the victim was bathing, and would \u201cfeel her all over\u201d and try to get <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>on top of her. The defendant in later years reminded the victim that he had been \u201cdoing it to [her] since [she was] three.\u201d When the victim was between five and eight years old, the defendant would come into her bedroom, touch her and try to get on top of her. He also pulled down her clothing and tried to touch her with his penis.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">After the family moved, the victim began to share a room with her younger sister. At that time, the defendant would wait until everyone was asleep, come into the victim\u2019s bedroom, remove her clothing and get on top of her. He began attempting to insert his penis into the victim\u2019s vagina, but he was unable to do so even though he exerted force. Some of these events occurred during the day when the victim\u2019s mother was at work. The defendant would place the victim\u2019s two younger sisters in the bathtub to occupy them while he committed these acts on the victim. These assaults occurred three or four times a week.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">When the victim was about ten years of age, the family moved again. At that time, the victim\u2019s mother worked from 3:30 until 9 p.m. and the victim was responsible for overseeing her sisters. Although the defendant had his own apartment at the time, he also had a key to the apartment occupied by the victim and her family, and usually stayed at that apartment. The defendant followed the practice of putting the younger girls in the bathtub, forcing them to take a nap or sending them outside while he molested the victim. In 1987, the victim told her father\u2019s girlfriend that she was being sexually molested by the defendant. At that time, the victim also spoke with a member of the New Haven police department and stated that she was being sexually abused. About a week later, after being assured by her mother that the defendant would not bother her again, the victim recanted her prior complaint. At the time that she recanted, the defendant had moved out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>of the apartment occupied by the victim and her family. Shortly after she recanted, the defendant moved back in with the victim and her family and resumed his abuse of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">On April 7, 1989, the victim confided in a school friend that she was being sexually assaulted by her mother\u2019s boyfriend. The victim also told this to several adults at school including Gail Guy, a guidance counselor, and Delores Dinnean, a school nurse. Although this misconduct had occurred over a period of years, she spoke out at this time because she was afraid to go home from school. On the previous evening, a male friend, in whom she had also confided, telephoned the victim\u2019s mother and advised her that the defendant had been sexually abusing the victim. When the victim\u2019s mother learned of the misconduct, she appeared to be angry, not only with the defendant, but with the victim as well. The victim\u2019s fear was that her mother would not believe that the sexual abuse had occurred. The defendant had told the victim not to tell her mother because the mother would believe his denials and that the victim would be placed in a home. In addition to telling Guy and Dinnean, the victim also described the defendant\u2019s misconduct to Gloria Jetter, a DCYS investigator, Detective Peter Marone of the New Haven police department, Diane Pelazza, a pediatric social worker at the Yale-New Haven Hospital Sexual Abuse Clinic, and John Leventhal, an associate professor of pediatrics at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the medical director of the Sexual Abuse Clinic and of the Child Abuse Program. Each of these witnesses testified as constancy of accusation witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">The defendant testified in his own behalf denying the charges made against him. He offered testimony concerning his rigorous work schedule over the period of time at issue. His former employer also testified as to his work schedule. The defendant offered character evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>dence concerning his honesty, reliability and trustworthiness. Finally, the defendant offered the testimony of Stephen Herman, a psychiatrist, who had not examined or interviewed the victim, but who testified that some children distort and lie about sexual abuse claims. The jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">The defendant claims that the trial court improperly prohibited him from pursuing certain lines of inquiry when the evidence sought to be adduced was admissible under an exception to General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> thereby denying him his constitutional rights to confrontation and to present a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. Prior to the commencement of the evidence, the state filed a motion in limine seeking, inter alia, to preclude the defendant from introducing any evidence of and from cross-examining the complainant as to her sexual conduct unrelated to conduct with the defendant. In support of the motion, the state invoked the protection of the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f contending that any such evidence would not meet any of the exceptions under the statute by which such evidence would be rendered admissible. At the time the motion was argued, the defendant asserted that he did not intend to cross-examine the victim with respect to any prior sexual conduct, but that he might call other witnesses as to that issue. The motion in limine was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">The victim testified as to acts of sexual misconduct committed against her by the defendant over a period of years. She also testified that, although the defendant had attempted to effect penile penetration, he had not been successful. She was never asked on cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>examination any questions relating to any sexual experience that she may have had other than with the defendant, nor did the defendant attempt to make any offer of proof during the cross-examination as to any other conduct on the part of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">The state called Guy and Dinnean as witnesses in its case-in-chief. At the completion of the testimony of each of these witnesses, the state turned over to the defendant the statements given to the police by each witness. The statements contained evidence that the victim had disclosed concern that she may have been pregnant and had engaged in sexual intercourse with her boyfriend. The state also called Leventhal who testified to the victim\u2019s physical manifestations of sexual abuse. Leventhal testified that the victim\u2019s physical appearance upon examination was consistent with the victim\u2019s statements that the defendant had attempted penetration and had failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">After the completion of the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the defendant requested permission to cross-examine Guy and Dinnean as to the statement by the victim that she expressed concern about being pregnant. The defendant asserted that this evidence was admissible under the exception to the rape shield statute as evidence against Leventhal\u2019s opinion that the physical findings of the victim were consistent with no penetration and as an inconsistent statement by the victim. On appeal, the defendant claims that the evidence was admissible, under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (2) and (4), as evidence to counter Leventhal\u2019s opinion and to show that the victim had an independent basis to describe sexual acts. The defendant also asserts that the trial court improperly ruled on the admissibility of the evidence because it failed to hold a hearing on the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">\u201cStatutes such as General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f, commonly known as rape shield statutes, have been enacted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>specifically to bar or limit the use of prior sexual conduct of an alleged victim of a sexual assault because it is such highly prejudicial material.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>3 Conn. App. 374, 379, 489 A.2d 386, cert. denied, 196 Conn. 803, 492 A.2d 1239 (1985). The statute \"excludes evidence of prior sexual conduct of the victim of a sexual assault, unless one of the statutory exceptions is satisfied.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>228 Conn. 456, 469, 637 A.2d 382 (1994). \"Our legislature has determined that, except in specific instances, and taking the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights into account, evidence of prior sexual conduct is to be excluded for policy purposes. Some of these policies include protecting the victim\u2019s sexual privacy and shielding her from undue harassment, encouraging reports of sexual assault, and enabling the victim to testify in court with less fear of embarrassment .... Other policies promoted by the law include avoiding prejudice to the victim, jury confusion and waste of time on collateral matters. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Cassidy, </em>[supra, 379].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>supra, 469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">\u201cThe determination of whether the state\u2019s interests in excluding evidence must yield to those interests of the defendant is determined by the facts and circumstances of the particular case.\u201d Id., 470. In the case of sexual assault, \u00a7 54-86f provides the factors to be considered in determining the admissibility of evidence of sexual conduct by the victim. See id., 469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence relating to the victim\u2019s fear of pregnancy was admissible under \u00a7 54-86f (2) is unpersuasive. Section 54-86f (2) allows the admission of such evidence when the defendant offers it \u201con the issue of credibility of the victim, provided the victim has testified on direct examination as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>to his or her sexual conduct . . . .\u201d The defendant cannot meet either requirement. The evidence was offered on the issue of Leventhal\u2019s credibility, not the victim\u2019s, and the victim was never asked about and did not testify as to her sexual conduct other than the assaults by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Further, the evidence was not admissible under General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f (4). \u201cSuch evidence is admissible under this statute only if it fulfills the requirements of the statute that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect, within the context of the facts and circumstances of the case in which it arises.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Kindrick, </em>30 Conn. App. 56, 59-60, 619 A.2d 1 (1993). \u201cEvidence should be excluded as unduly prejudicial: (1) where it may unnecessarily arouse the jury\u2019s emotions, hostility or sympathy; (2) where it may create distracting side issues; (3) where the evidence and counterproof will consume an inordinate amount of time; and (4) where one party is unfairly surprised and unprepared to meet it.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Santiago, </em>224 Conn. 325, 340, 618 A.2d 32 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rinaldi, </em>220 Conn. 345, 356, 599 A.2d 1 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Clinkscales, </em>21 Conn. App. 411, 416, 574 A.2d 243, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 815, 576 A.2d 545 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Butler, </em>11 Conn. App. 673, 683, 529 A.2d 219, cert. denied, 205 Conn. 806, 531 A.2d 938 (1987). The evidence here would create distracting side issues of (1) whether Leventhal could determine that no penetration had occurred even though the victim may have had sexual relations and (2) whether the victim had actually had sexual relations with another male. These issues, once brought into the trial, would exhaust an inordinate amount of the jury\u2019s time in collateral issues. Thus, the evidence was properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence was admissible to show that the victim had a separate, independent font of knowledge from which to describe sexual acts was not properly preserved. At trial, the defendant asserted that the evidence was admissible because it was relevant to show a prior inconsistent statement about the occurrence of penetration. Thus, the claim at trial was not consistent with the claim now asserted. \u201cAppellate review of evidentiary rulings is ordinarily limited to the specific legal issue raised by the objection of trial counsel. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rothenberg, </em>195 Conn. 253, 263, 487 A.2d 545 (1985). The purpose of requiring trial counsel to object properly is not merely formal: it serves to alert the trial court to purported error while there is time to correct it without ordering a retrial. Id. By failing to object on [this ground], the defendant has failed to preserve this claim. <em>State </em>v. <em>Cou</em>ture, 194 Conn. 530, 553-54, 482 A.2d 300 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1192, 105 S. Ct. 967, 83 L. Ed. 2d 971 (1985); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 288 and 4185.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Christiano, </em>supra, 228 Conn. 464; <em>State </em>v. <em>Dukes, </em>29 Conn. App. 409, 416-17, 616 A.2d 800 (1992), cert. denied, 224 Conn. 928, 619 A.2d 851 (1993). \u201cWe have not yet reached a jurisprudential stage where we require trial judges to be mentally telepathic. Thus, we have consistently declined to review claims based on a ground different from that raised in the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ulen, </em>31 Conn. App. 20, 29, 623 A.2d 70, cert. denied, 226 Conn. 905, 625 A.2d 1378 (1993). Therefore, we will not review this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly excluded the evidence without a hearing was also not properly preserved. The defendant did not request a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>hearing before the trial court. \u201cThis court will not review issues of law that are raised for the first time on appeal.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Harvey, </em>27 Conn. App. 171, 186, 605 A.2d 563, cert. denied, 222 Conn. 907, 608 A.2d 693 (1992). We will not afford review of this unpreserved claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied him a continuance to prepare his defense after the state filed a substitute information against him substantially changing the allegations against him. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. The state filed a long form information on October 30, 1989. The information stated that the defendant was accused of one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and one count of risk of injury to or impairing the morals of a child for events that occurred in \u201cearly April 1989.\u201d The information also stated that the defendant was accused of one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and one count of risk of injury to or impairing the morals of a child for events that occurred \u201con or about April 26,1989.\u201d On November 15,1990, the defendant filed a notice of intention to offer a defense of alibi that stated he \u201cwas in the Town of Ansonia with Keith Hawkins of 420 Dix-well Avenue, New Haven, CT at about 7:00.\u201d See Practice Book \u00a7 763.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant also filed a notice that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>he would rely on a 1989 desk calendar, on which appointments were noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">On December 13, 1990, the state filed an amended information.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The amended information alleged that one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and one count of risk of injury to a child occurred \u201cbetween August 7, 1984 and November 1986.\u201d The amended information also set forth that the other count of sexual assault in the fourth degree and the other count of risk of injury to a child occurred \u201cbetween November 1986 and April 7, 1989.\u201d On January 3, 1991, the first day of jury selection, the defendant requested a continuance based on the filing of the amended information. The trial court denied the continuance and jury selection commenced. On January 9,1991, the defendant again requested a continuance on the same ground, which the trial court denied. The presentation of evidence began on January 11, 1991. On appeal, the defendant claims that the denial of a continuance denied him due process by failing to give him adequate notice of the contents of the amended information before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether to grant a request for a continuance is within the discretion of the trial court, and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>376 U.S. 575, 589, 84 S. Ct. 841, 11 L. Ed. 2d 921, reh. denied, 377 U.S. 925, 84 S. Ct. 1218, 12 L. Ed. 2d 217 (1964); <em>State </em>v. Williams, 200 Conn. 310, 320, 511 A.2d 1000 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 437-38, 489 A.2d 350 (1985). <em>State </em>v. <em>Aillon, </em>202 Conn. 385, 394, 521 A.2d 555 (1987). It must be shown that the trial [court] acted arbitrarily and substantially impaired [the] defendant\u2019s ability to defend himself, before an appellate court will conclude that the trial [court] abused [its] discretion. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The test is a stringent one. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ellenbogen, </em>365 F.2d 982, 985 (2d Cir. 1966), cert. denied, 386 U.S. 923, 87 S.

The answer must be found in the circumstances present in every case, particularly in the reasons presented to the trial judge at the time the request is denied. <em>Ungar </em>v. <em>Sarafite, </em>supra, 589. <em>[State </em>v. <em>Beckenbach, </em>supra,] 47-48. The right of a defendant to have a continuance is not . . . absolute; <em>State </em>v. <em>Bethea, </em>167 Conn. 80, 83, 355 A.2d 6 (1974); and [e]very reasonable presumption in favor of the proper exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion will be made. <em>Ridgeway </em>v. <em>Ridgeway, </em>180 Conn. 533, 538, 429 A.2d 801 (1980).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>215 Conn. 1, 9-10, 574 A.2d 188 (1990); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Krijger, </em>33 Conn.

This section provides that \u2018[i]f the trial has not commenced, the prosecuting authority may amend the information, or add additional counts, or file a substitute information. Upon motion of the defendant, the judicial authority, <em>in [its] discretion, </em>may strike the amendment or added counts or substitute information, if the trial or the cause would be unduly delayed or the substantive rights of the defendant would be prejudiced.\u2019 (Emphasis added.)

App. 344-47. The trial court acted within its discretion, and we will not substitute our judgment for that of the trial court.

We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this appeal. On January 10, 1991, the defendant filed a motion in limine requesting that the trial court bar any witness from testifying \u201cas to the truthfulness of any witness or party to this matter or to the truthfulness of any class of persons, especially persons alleging sexual abuse, as determining the veracity of witnesses is wholly within the province of the jury.\u201d The defendant claimed in the trial court that the purpose of the motion was to prevent expert witnesses from testifying to the veracity of sexual abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>victims. The trial court denied the motion as premature on the basis of its belief that such a question was evidentiary in nature and should be addressed only when a specific question was asked and objected to. At trial, Leventhal testified, without objection, that the victim had been sexually abused for several years by the defendant. On cross-examination, the defendant elicited from Leventhal that he had not corroborated the victim\u2019s account in any way. On further cross-examination, Leventhal testified in response to a question that he did not corroborate the victim\u2019s account because he believed that the victim was truthful.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Pelazza, the social worker, testified that she recommended that the victim continue counseling \u201cbecause she was concerned about the extent of abuse that had occurred.\u201d The defendant objected and claimed that whether the abuse had occurred is a matter for the jury. The trial court overruled the objection because Pelazza was addressing her recommendation. Further, Guy testified that she decided to call DCYS because she believed the victim\u2019s story. The defendant objected on the ground that the testimony was an opinion of a nonexpert. Dinnean then testified, without objection, that she felt that the victim was abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The defendant failed to interpose an objection to the testimony of Leventhal and Dinnean. A full examination of the record fails to disclose any objection to the testimony or any motion to strike the testimony. The defendant does not seek review of these claims pursuant to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989), nor does he seek review under the plain error doctrine. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. Thus, we decline to afford review of these unpreserved claims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 741, 631 A.2d 288 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">The defendant failed to preserve his claim as to the testimony of Guy by objecting on a ground that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>different from the claim of error. \u201cReview of evidentiaryrulings is made on the specific legal ground asserted at the time of trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Velez, </em>17 Conn. App. 186, 192, 551 A.2d 421 (1988), cert. denied, 210 Conn. 810, 556 A.2d 610, cert. denied, 491 U.S. 906, 109 S. Ct. 3190, 105 L. Ed. 2d 698 (1989). This court is not in any way bound to consider claims of law not properly raised at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>[supra, 227 Conn. 741]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Brice, </em>186 Conn. 449, 457, 442 A.2d 906 (1982).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>34 Conn. App. 58, 73, 640 A.2d 610 (1994). Because the reason now asserted on appeal is different from that asserted before the trial court, we will not afford review of this unpreserved new claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The testimony by Leventhal on cross-examination is invited error. \u201cAction induced by an appellant cannot ordinarily be a ground of error. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>189 Conn. 42, 47, 454 A.2d 266 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Kish, </em>186 Conn. 757, 769, 443 A.2d 1274 (1982); <em>State </em>v. <em>Cobbs, </em>164 Conn. 402, 424, 324 A.2d 234, cert. denied, 414 U.S. 861, 94 S. Ct. 77, 38 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1973).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>202 Conn. 18, 25, 519 A.2d 607 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>28 Conn. App. 771, 776, 612 A.2d 135, cert. denied, 224 Conn. 904, 615 A.2d 1045 (1992). The defendant can claim relief from an induced error only upon a showing that the error violated his constitutional rights. <em>State </em>v. <em>Scognamiglio, </em>supra, 25. When the claimed error is the result of a question posed by the defendant on cross-examination, \u201c \u2018[s]o long as the answer is clearly responsive to the question asked, the questioner may not later secure a reversal on the basis of any invited error.\u2019 \u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>212 Conn. 593, 611, 563 A.2d 671 (1989); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brokaw, </em>183 Conn. 29, 33, 438 A.2d 815 (1981); <em>State </em>v. <em>Polanco, </em>26 Conn. App. 33, 37, 597 A.2d 830, cert. denied, 220 Conn. 926, 598 A.2d 367 (1991). Therefore, the defendant cannot claim error on the basis of the witnesses\u2019 response to his question.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>The testimony by Pelazza was not testimony of the ultimate issue of fact. One of the ultimate issues of fact in this case was the truthfulness of the victim. <em>In re Noel M., </em>23 Conn. App. 410, 422, 580 A.2d 996 (1990). The witness\u2019 testimony did not address the truthfulness of the victim. She testified that she recommended continued counseling because of her concern about the extent of abuse that had occurred. This does not reflect her opinion about the victim\u2019s truthfulness, but reflects her reason for recommending counseling. It did not give any indication to the jury as to whether abuse had in fact occurred because the purpose of the counseling was to determine the extent of any abuse. Therefore, the witness did not testify to the ultimate issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">Even if this evidence can be characterized as relating to the ultimate issue of fact, the testimony was not improper. The trial court has discretion to allow nonexperts to give opinions as to the truthfulness of the victim as long as the witnesses are \u201cthose who have been shown to have had an opportunity to form, and who have formed, an opinion as to the character of the . . . [individual] with respect to the trait or traits in issue.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Spigarolo, </em>210 Conn. 359, 374, 556 A.2d 112, cert. denied, 493 U.S. 933, 110 S. Ct. 322, 10 L. Ed. 2d 312 (1989). The evidence is then admissible as long as the jury needs assistance on the question. Id. Here, the trial court could reasonably have determined that the witness\u2019 opinion was necessary and that she had an opportunity to form an opinion through counseling sessions. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly denied him access to certain DCYS records. The defendant posits that the trial court\u2019s refusal denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>him his rights under the confrontation clause of the United States constitution as stated in <em>Brady </em>v. <em>Maryland, </em>373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215 (1963), and <em>Delaware </em>v. <em>Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 22, 106 S. Ct. 292, 88 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. The defendant cross-examined Jetter and asked her whether she retained a record of her conversation with the victim. The witness stated that she kept a record and that she had the record at the trial. The defendant asked the witness to produce the record. The state objected and the trial court sustained the objection. The defendant never marked the record for identification. Therefore, we do not have the record before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">\u201c \u2018The purpose of marking an exhibit for identification is to preserve it as part of the record and to provide an appellate court with a basis for review.\u2019 <em>Kraus </em>v. <em>Newtown, </em>211 Conn. 191, 194-95, 558 A.2d 240 (1989).\u201d <em>Esaw </em>v. <em>Friedman, </em>217 Conn. 553, 566, 586 A.2d 1164 (1991). Thus, the exhibits are not part of the record before us and we are unable to review the claim properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly failed to dismiss one count of the information that was barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant asserts that the acts underlying the allegations of the first count of sexual assault in the fourth degree had occurred more than one year prior to the issuance of the warrant of arrest, thereby violating General Statutes \u00a7 54-193.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Certain additional facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this issue. On December 13, 1990, the state filed an amended information.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The amended information stated that the first count of sexual assault in the fourth degree occurred \u201cbetween August 7,1984 and November 1986.\u201d On January 10,1991, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss this claim based on a violation of the statute of limitations. The court deferred ruling on the motion until after the state completed its case. The state rested its case on January 17,1991. On January 18,1991, the trial court again deferred its decision until all of the evidence was presented. The presentation of evidence was complete on January 29, 1991. At that time, the trial court deferred ruling on the motion until after the verdict. The defendant did not request a jury charge on the statute of limitations and did not object to the jury charge. After the verdict, the trial court failed to rule on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">The statute of limitations is not a jurisdictional bar to prosecution. <em>State </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>28 Conn. App. 91, 96, 612 A.2d 73, cert. denied, 223 Conn. 920, 614 A.2d 829 (1992). \u201cThe statute of limitations is . . . an affirmative defense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>[202 Conn 86, 90, 519 A.2d 1201 (1987)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>199 Conn. 631, 640, 508 A.2d 1376 (1986). Consequently, the burden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>was on the defendant to prove the elements of that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra [90]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Littlejohn, </em>supra [640]; see General Statutes \u00a7 53a-12 (b); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Karlin, </em>785 F.2d 90, 92 (3d Cir. 1986).\u201d <em>State v. Crawford, </em>202 Conn. 443, 451, 521 A.2d 1034 (1987). \u201cAn affirmative defense is presented in the orderly course of a criminal trial after the prosecution has presented its case-in-chief.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>supra, 91; <em>State </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>supra, 96. Although the defendant raised the defense during the trial, he failed to submit a request to charge thereon. Thus, he failed to preserve the defense. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Parsons, </em>supra, 96-97. Further, the trial court never ruled on the motion. Therefore, we do not have an adequate record to review this claim. <em>See State v. Reddick, </em>33 Conn.
