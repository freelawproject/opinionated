The defendant seeks review of both unpreserved claims under <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). Because the defendant does not satisfy the first prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis with respect to either claim, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">The defendant was charged with assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-59 (a) (l).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury found the defendant not guilty of the charged offense, but found the defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of assault in the second degree. Upon inquiry of the court as to the disposition of the other lesser included offenses, the jury foreperson responded that the defendant was not guilty of the lesser included offenses of assault in the third degree and disorderly conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">To obtain review of these claims the defendant must satisfy all four of the conditions enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. The four conditions are as follows: \u201c(1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id. We conclude that the defendant\u2019s claims fail to meet the first prong of Golding,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Our Supreme Court has stated in <em>Golding </em>that, \u201c[t]he defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d Id., 240. The record in this case does not provide an adequate basis for reviewing either of the defendant\u2019s claims. It is insufficient to determine whether the jury disregarded the trial court\u2019s instructions and continued deliberations after finding the defendant guilty of assault in the second degree, or if the jury foreperson was simply responding to the inquiry of the court regarding the two lesser included offenses with a verdict of not guilty because the jury did not deliberate these charges. The record is insufficient, as well, to determine whether the jury followed or disregarded the \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction. To make such determinations, it would be necessary to remand the case to the trial court for further findings of fact. Because the first prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis was designed to avoid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>just such a situation, a remand would be inappropriate. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>31 Conn.
