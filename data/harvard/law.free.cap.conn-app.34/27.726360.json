The defendant claims that the trial court improperly confirmed the award by failing to apply (1) a de novo standard of review to matters of law, (2) a consent to settle provision, and (3) an offset for uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>another insurer. The plaintiff filed a cross appeal from the court\u2019s denial of her motion for supplemental judgment, claiming that the trial court improperly denied her request for interest from the date of the arbitration award. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The following facts are relevant to the appeal and cross appeal. On June 16,1989, the plaintiff was a passenger on a motorcycle driven by Carmen Gianni. A collision occurred between Gianni\u2019s motorcycle and a motorcycle driven and owned by Julian Albrecht. The plaintiff was injured in the accident and sought to recover various insurance moneys.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">At the time of the accident, the plaintiff\u2019s parents had an insurance policy issued by the defendant that had uninsured-underinsured limits of $50,000 for each of three vehicles; the total available coverage was $150,000. Although the plaintiff was not the policyholder, she was an insured under the policy issued to her parents. Gianni\u2019s policy with Progressive Casualty Insurance Company (Progressive) provided him with liability and uninsured motorist coverage limited to a total of $250,000. Albrecht had no liability insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">The plaintiff sought to recover under Gianni\u2019s policy with Progressive. Progressive, Gianni and the plaintiff settled the claim, whereby the plaintiff collected $20,000 from Gianni\u2019s liability coverage and $230,000 from Gianni\u2019s uninsured-underinsured motorist coverage. The plaintiff, however, neither requested nor received the defendant\u2019s written consent before entering into the settlement with Gianni and Progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">The plaintiff also sought to recoup uninsuredunderinsured motorist coverage from the defendant. On the eve of trial, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an \u201cArbitration Agreement\u201d that provided the following: \u201cClaimant Katherine Maluszewski and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Respondent Allstate Insurance Company hereby agree to submit to arbitration the issues of uninsured/ underinsured motorist coverage and claimant\u2019s right to receive any damages, or the amount of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u201cThe parties agree that the Allstate Insurance Policy AU106-1 and endorsement AU1697-2 are hereby modified by this Agreement to include this arbitration clause pursuant to and in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u201cThe parties, in agreeing to submit this matter to arbitration pursuant to Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 specifically reserve their rights to proceed under Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 52-408 through \u00a7 52-424. The parties also reserve their right to court review of any award pursuant to <em>American Universal Insurance Company </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>205 Conn. 178 [530 A.2d 171] (1987).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">A panel of three arbitrators heard the case, and, by a two-to-one decision, issued the following award: \u201cThe arbitrators award the Claimant the sum of $130,000.00 against Allstate in full and final resolution of all the claims submitted to them.\u201d The $130,000 represented the $150,000 available under the plaintiff\u2019s parents\u2019 policy minus the $20,000 from Gianni\u2019s liability coverage paid by Progressive. The arbitrators found that Albrecht was 100 percent responsible for the accident, and that the plaintiff\u2019s damages totaled $875,000 <em>\u201cnet </em>of all collateral source payments.\u201d (Emphasis added.) At the arbitration proceeding, the defendant attempted to raise the defense that the plaintiff, by failing to obtain the defendant\u2019s written consent to enter a settlement agreement with Gianni and Progressive, had breached a provision of the defendant\u2019s policy. The arbitrators concluded, however, that the defendant had waived this defense because it was not raised in a timely manner.</p>\n<p id=\"AHy\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The plaintiff applied to the Superior Court to confirm the arbitrators\u2019 award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant filed an application seeking that the court vacate, modify, or correct the arbitrators\u2019 award pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-418.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court determined that the parties had voluntarily submitted the issues of coverage and damage to the arbitrators, and, as a result, the court\u2019s review was limited to the question of whether the award conformed to the submission. The court held that the award did conform to the submission, and rendered judgment confirming the award. The defendant now claims that the trial court improperly confirmed the award because the arbitrators\u2019 determination that coverage was available under the defendant\u2019s policy was incorrect.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">The Defendant\u2019s Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">We must first determine the standard of review that the trial court was required to apply in reviewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>decision of the arbitrators. This inquiry hinges on whether the arbitration was voluntary or compulsory, and, if voluntary, whether the submission was restricted or unrestricted.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">If the parties engaged in voluntary arbitration, the trial court\u2019s standard of review, provided that the submission was unrestricted, would be limited to whether the award conformed to the submission. <em>Bridgeport </em>v. <em>Connecticut Police Dept. Employees Local 1159, </em>32 Conn. App. 289, 292-94, 628 A.2d 1336, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 925, 632 A.2d 703 (1993). If the parties engaged in voluntary, but restricted, arbitration, the trial court\u2019s standard of review would be broader depending on the specific restriction. For example, a typical restriction is that the arbitrators\u2019 award must conform to the law. \u201cHad the parties restricted the authority of the arbitrators by including in their arbitration agreement a proviso that the arbitrators\u2019 award must not be contrary to law, the court would have been bound to enforce the restriction. See <em>Board of Trustees </em>v. <em>Federation of Technical College Teachers, </em>[179 Conn. 184, 187, 425 A.2d 1247 (1979)]; <em>Chase Brass &amp; Copper Co. </em>v. <em>Chase Brass &amp; Copper Workers Union, </em>[139 Conn. 591, 594-96, 96 A.2d 209 (1953)].\u201d <em>Bodner </em>v. <em>United Services Automobile Assn., </em>222 Conn. 480, 490, 610 A.2d 1212 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">If the parties engaged in compulsory arbitration, \u201c[u]pon judicial review of compulsory arbitration proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 38a-336 (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2018the reviewing court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>must conduct a de novo review of the interpretation and application of the law by the arbitrators.\u2019 <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>[supra, 205 Conn. 191].\u201d <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>224 Conn. 758, 763, 621 A.2d 258 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The defendant presents two arguments. In its brief and at oral argument, the defendant contended that the arbitration agreement modified the insurance policy to provide for <em>compulsory </em>arbitration. At oral argument, however, the defendant conceded that the parties had <em>voluntarily </em>entered into the arbitration agreement, and suggested that the agreement contained restrictions mandating that the trial court treat the arbitration as compulsory and exercise de novo review of the arbitrators\u2019 conclusions of law. We disagree with both contentions and conclude that the parties submitted their claims to voluntary, unrestricted arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">As set forth above, the arbitration agreement contains three paragraphs. The first paragraph contains the submission, whereby the plaintiff and the defendant framed the issues for arbitration as those of coverage and damages, if any, without explicitly restricting the power of the arbitrator or expanding the review of the award by the court. As such, the first paragraph provides for voluntary, unrestricted arbitration. The defendant argues, however, that the second and third paragraphs either incorporate compulsory arbitration into the policy or restrict the voluntary submission by providing for de novo review of the arbitrators\u2019 conclusions of law. Paragraph two provides that the parties \u201cmodified\u201d the insurance policy to incorporate \u201cthis arbitration clause pursuant to and in accordance with Connecticut General Statutes \u00a7 38a-336 . . . .\u201d Paragraph three states that the parties \u201csubmit this matter to arbitration pursuant to ... \u00a7 38a-336 <em>If</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>We first address the defendant\u2019s argument that the parties modified the insurance policy to provide for compulsory arbitration. We note at the outset that the plaintiff was not a party to the original policy, but rather an insured who benefited under the policy. \u201cThe relations of the parties to an insurance policy are contractual and when the proceeds of the policy are made payable to a third person, it is properly characterized as a third party beneficiary contract. 1 Williston, Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 357, 369.\u201d <em>Shaw </em>v. <em>John Hancock Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>120 Conn. 633, 638, 182 A. 472 (1936). The plaintiff\u2019s parents and the defendant, as parties to the contract, retained the rights to modify the contract. \u201cFor a valid modification, there must be mutual assent to the meaning and conditions of the modification and the <em>parties </em>must assent to the same thing in the same sense . . . if they are to vary the contract in any way. <em>Lar-Rob Bus Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>170 Conn. 397, 402, 365 A.2d 1086 (1976).\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Manzin </em>v. <em>United Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>6 Conn. App. 513, 516, 506 A.2d 169 (1986). Because the plaintiff was not a party to the policy, therefore, she and the defendant lacked the power to modify the policy to incorporate a compulsory arbitration clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">We next address the defendant\u2019s second argument that the second and third paragraphs restricted the submission by providing for de novo review by the trial court. A basic contradiction exists between the voluntary, unrestricted submission in paragraph one, and the statements regarding \u00a7 38a-336 in paragraphs two and three. The defendant concedes that the arbitration agreement was voluntary because the two parties agreed to submit the claim for arbitration, yet it argues that, by invoking \u00a7 38a-336, the arbitration is subject to the standard of review for compulsory arbitration. Section 38a-336 (c) has been characterized as a com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>pulsory arbitration provision; see <em>Chmielewski </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>218 Conn. 646, 657, 591 A.2d 101 (1991); and has been construed to provide a de novo standard of review for questions of law decided in compulsory arbitration proceedings. <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 763. Because we have determined that the parties voluntarily agreed to submit the issues to arbitration, the only issue remaining is whether the submission was restricted to provide for de novo review. The standard of review derived specifically from \u00a7 38a-336 (c) is implicated only where the arbitration was compulsory. We conclude, accordingly, that the second paragraph does not alter the voluntary agreement and unrestricted submission set forth in the first paragraph.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">In paragraph three, the parties reserved their rights pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424, as well as their right to \u201ccourt review\u201d of the award pursuant to <em>American Universal Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>DelGreco, </em>supra, 205 Conn. 191. The defendant again argues that the inclusion of these provisions implies that the standard for reviewing an award obtained in compulsory arbitration must be applied to this case. Section 52-418 (a) (4), the provision at issue, concerns the trial court\u2019s powers to vacate an arbitration award. Because the term \u201ccourt review\u201d referred to in this section applies to both compulsory or voluntary proceedings, the inclusion of that term does not mandate that the trial court exercise de novo review of the arbitrators\u2019 legal conclusions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>184-91, discusses court review of <em>both </em>compulsory and voluntary arbitration. There is no specific language in paragraph three that limits the powers of the arbitrators or expands judicial review of the voluntary, unrestricted submission set forth in paragraph one.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Moreover, the parties easily could have provided that the arbitrators\u2019 conclusions of law would be subject to de novo review. The failure explicitly to do so in this case leaves the submission unrestricted. As a result, the trial court applied the proper standard of review, namely, whether the award conformed to the submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Having determined that the trial court applied the proper standard of review, we must examine the trial court\u2019s determination that the award did conform to the submission. Our Supreme Court recently explained in <em>Garrity </em>v. <em>McCaskey, 223 </em>Conn. 1, 7-11, 612 A.2d 742 (1992), that review of an award pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4) can include an inquiry into whether the arbitrators exhibited a manifest disregard for the law when issuing the award. The court stated that \u201c[i]n order to prevail, the defendant must demonstrate that the award reflects an egregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal principles.\u201d Id., II.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court noted, however, that \u201c[bjecause we do not review an arbitrator\u2019s decision merely for errors of law, in the present case we do not decide the merits of the defendant\u2019s argument .... Even if the arbitrators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>were to have misapplied the law . . . such a misconstruction of the law would not demonstrate the arbitrators\u2019 egregious or patently irrational rejection of clearly controlling legal principles.\u201d Id., 11-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">In its motion to vacate the award, the defendant alleged, pursuant to \u00a7 52-418 (a) (4),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that the arbitrators \u201cexceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award . . . was not made.\u201d On appeal, the defendant contends that the arbitrators exceeded their powers and exhibited a manifest disregard of the law by failing to consider the merits of the defendant\u2019s substantive argument concerning an offset of the insurance. The defendant argues that moneys available under the defendant\u2019s policy should have been offset by $250,000, the amount provided to the plaintiff by Progressive. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contentions, the arbitrators did consider whether an amount, if any, should be offset by the $250,000 settlement with Progressive. The arbitrators concluded that despite the defendant\u2019s waiver of the defense that the plaintiff had breached a consent to settle clause, the defendant still would not be able to recover from Gianni or Progressive because Albrecht was totally at fault for the accident. The arbitrators then determined that the defendant\u2019s $150,000 coverage could be offset by only $20,000, the amount of Progressive\u2019s liability coverage. The arbitrators\u2019 decision to reduce the $150,000 by $20,000 indicates that they considered the matter of offsetting. We conclude that \u00a7 52-418 does not encompass the defendant\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The terms of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>award are clear, and the award conforms to the issues submitted. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court confirming the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">The Plaintiff\u2019s Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The plaintiff has filed a cross appeal in which she claims that the trial court improperly denied her motion for supplemental judgment, in which she requested prejudgment interest from the date of the arbitration award to the date of judgment pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The trial court denied the motion, stating from the bench that it would \u201cgive the insurance company the benefit of the doubt in this matter and accept the claim that [Allstate] had made [its] arguments in good faith, and the court will not award interest in this matter.\u201d The trial court did not file a memorandum of decision on the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">An award of interest is primarily an equitable determination within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 765; <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 701-702, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). \u201cThe salient inquiry is whether the court could have reasonably concluded as it did. ... It goes without saying that the term abuse of discretion does not imply a bad motive or wrong purpose but merely means that the ruling appears to have been made on untenable grounds. . . . <em>[State </em>v. <em>Arbour, </em>29 Conn. App. 744, 748, 618 A.2d 60 (1992)].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>quotation marks <em>omitted.) Halloran </em>v. <em>North Canaan, </em>32 Conn. App. 611, 614, 630 A.2d 145 (1993). \u201cIn determining whether the trial court has abused its discretion, we must make every reasonable presumption in favor of the correctness of its action. <em>E. M. Loew\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. </em>v. <em>Surabian, </em>146 Conn. 608, 612, 153 A.2d 463 (1959).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">The court\u2019s determination regarding the award of interest \u201cshould be made in view of the demands of justice rather than through the application of any arbitrary rule. . . . <em>[Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 218 Conn. 702.] Whether interest may be awarded depends on whether the money involved is payable; General Statutes \u00a7 37-3a; see <em>White Oak Corporation </em>v. <em>Department of Transportation, </em>217 Conn. 281, 302, 585 A.2d 1199 (1991); and whether the detention of the money is or is not wrongful under the circumstances. . . . <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>[supra, 218 Conn. 702].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stephan </em>v. <em>Pennsylvania General Ins. Co., </em>supra, 224 Conn. 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this case, both parties presented arguments to the trial court about the propriety of an award of prejudgment interest. The defendant contended that it had made good faith legal arguments in its motion to vacate, focusing on the point that the trial court should have applied a de novo standard of review to the legal conclusions made by the arbitrators. The court determined that the defendant had made good faith arguments in moving to vacate the arbitration award, implying that the detention of moneys prior to judgment by the defendant was not wrongful. Upon review of the record before us, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to award prejudgment interest to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b53-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-417 provides in pertinent part: \u201cAt any time within one year after an award has been rendered and the parties to the arbitration notified thereof, any party to the arbitration may make application to the superior court ... for an order confirming the award.
