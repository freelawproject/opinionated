On May 31,1990, the commission\u2019s wetlands enforcement officer notified the plaintiffs that they had constructed the berm in a regulated area without a permit. He ordered the plaintiffs \u201cto cease any further work in the regulated area.\u201d Prior to this notice, there had not been a determination by the commission that the area in question was a watercourse nor did the commission\u2019s map of regulated areas designate any wetlands or watercourses on or near the plaintiffs\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">At a meeting of the commission on July 16,1990, the plaintiffs contended that the intermittent watercourse did not appear on the commission\u2019s map of regulated areas and that, therefore, the commission had no jurisdiction over their property. They further contended that the water flow and the resulting channel were caused by the actions of the adjacent property owner. The commission sought opinions from the Connecticut department of environmental protection and the Hartford County soil and water conservation district on whether the plaintiffs had acted in a watercourse. Both agencies concluded that the area was in fact an intermittent watercourse subject to commission regulations. Further, both agencies concluded that the watercourse existed prior to the neighbor\u2019s actions. The commission then issued a cease and desist order and ordered the plaintiffs to remove the fill placed in the intermittent watercourse.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court on November 2, 1990, alleging that the commission had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>violated General Statutes \u00a7 22a-42a by amending the boundaries of inland wetlands without holding a public hearing. After hearing argument, the trial court dismissed the appeal. In its memorandum of decision, the trial court ruled that the commission had not violated \u00a7 22a-42a because the commission\u2019s map depicted regulated areas only generally and the town regulations established that regulated areas also included \u201cthat which actually exists . . . .\u201d Therefore, because the plaintiffs\u2019 land included an existing watercourse, the regulations established that the plaintiffs\u2019 land was a regulated area within the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. The plaintiffs then appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">The plaintiffs claim that the commission\u2019s regulations conflict with \u00a7 22a-42a. The jurisdiction of the commission is limited by the boundaries of wetlands and watercourse areas; <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>192 Conn. 247, 250, 470 A.2d 1214 (1984); also known as the \u201cregulated area.\u201d The commission\u2019s regulations define the regulated areas, and thus the commission\u2019s jurisdiction, as those areas shown on the commission\u2019s map of regulated areas. The South Windsor Inland Wetlands, Watercourses, and Conservation Regulations \u00a7 3.1 (1993)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (hereinafter South Windsor Regulations). The regulations also provide that the regulated area \u201cshall be that which actually exists and will be determined by a declaratory ruling of the [commission]. . . .\u201d South Windsor Regulations \u00a7 3.1. The regulations define the term \u201cregulated area\u201d as all wetlands and watercourses and those areas within forty and eighty feet, respectively. South Windsor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Regulations \u00a7 2.1 (q).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The word \u201cwatercourse\u201d is, in turn, defined as \u201crivers, streams, brooks, waterways, lakes, ponds, marshes, swamps, bogs and all other bodies of water, natural or artificial, public or private, vernal or intermittent . . . .\u201d South Windsor Regulations \u00a7 2.1 (w).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The term \u201cintermittent watercourse\u201d is defined in technical terms of water presence and soil content. South Windsor Regulations \u00a7 2.1 (j).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In sum, the town regulations grant the commission jurisdiction over any area, mapped or unmapped, if by declaratory ruling the commission rules that the area falls within the definition of \u201cregulated area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The plaintiffs allege that these regulations conflict with the Inland Wetlands and Watercourses Act. General Statutes \u00a7 22a-36 et seq.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cUnder the act the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>missioner of environmental protection (commissioner) is charged with the responsibility of protecting inland wetlands and watercourses by, inter alia, regulating activity'which might have an adverse environmental impact on such natural resources. Under \u00a7\u00a7 22a-42<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and 22a-42a, any municipality, acting through its legislative body, may authorize or create a board or commission to regulate activities affecting the wetlands and watercourses located within its territorial limits and any such board or commission is authorized to grant, deny or limit any permit for a regulated activity. . . . The municipal inland wetland agency is authorized to establish the boundaries of inland wetlands and watercourse areas within its jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 249-50. Section 22a-42a (b) provides that the jurisdictional boundaries of the commission may be established and changed only after public notice and a hearing. \u201cOnce such boundaries are established . . . no regulated activity shall be conducted within such boundaries without a permit issued by the local agency.\u201d Id., 250. Thus, the act permits local conservation commissions to act within the areas of actual wetlands and watercourses and restricts the manner in which that jurisdiction may be invoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Since the decision in <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>183 Conn. 532, 538, 441 A.2d 30 (1981), the language of the act has been \u201cinterpreted\u201d according to the underlying legislative policy. That policy is \u201c \u2018to protect the citizens of the state by making provisions for the protection, preservation, maintenance and use of the inland wetlands and water courses by minimizing their disturbance and pollution; [and by] maintaining and improving water quality in accordance with the highest standards set by federal, state or local authority ....\u2019 \u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Our Supreme Court has, over the years, used this policy to add its expansive judicial gloss to the language of the statutes. <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>217 Conn. 164, 180, 585 A.2d 87 (1991) <em>(Covello, J., </em>dissenting). Thus, inland wetland commissions can now exercise jurisdiction outside their jurisdictional boundaries if activities on \u201cunregulated\u201d land would affect wetlands. <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 542-43; see also <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 172; <em>Connecticut Fund for the Environment, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 250-51. Similarly, a commission can impose a condition of off-site compensation of wetlands lost as long as it considers the impact of the application on the subject property. <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>212 Conn. 710, 722-23, 563 A.2d 1339 (1989). A commission can now regulate a zone outside its jurisdictional boundaries without a case-by-case review of the impact on the land within its jurisdiction. <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>216 Conn. 320, 337, 579 A.2d 1044 (1990). Finally, the general purpose of the act has also been found to permit an agency to assert jurisdiction over land use distant from its jurisdictional boundaries. <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 171.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">In all of these cases, the issue was whether the action of the commission pursuant to its regulations was permissible under the language of \u00a7 22a-42a. In each, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>action of the commission was deemed not to conflict with the specific language of the act restricting the jurisdiction of commissions. Our Supreme Court has ruled that commissions can act pursuant to their regulations unless the \u201cordinance permits or licenses that which the statute forbids, or prohibits that which the statute authorizes; if so, there is a conflict. If, however, both the statute and the ordinance are prohibitory and the only difference is that the ordinance goes further in its prohibition than the statute, but not counter to the prohibition in the statute . . . there is no conflict.\u201d <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 544. This test is founded on the principle that \u201c[a] local ordinance, enacted pursuant to the police power, is not necessarily inconsistent with a state law on the same subject just because the ordinance provides higher standards than the statute.\u201d Id., 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">We now must apply the conflict test as enunciated in <em>Aaron </em>using the interpretation of \u00a7 22a-42a established by <em>Aaron </em>and its progeny. The plaintiffs assert that the regulations conflict because they permit the commission to exercise its jurisdiction without mapping and without complying with the notice and hearing provisions of the statute. We agree with the plaintiffs\u2019 reading of the regulations. The commission\u2019s regulations allow the commission to assert jurisdiction over any area, mapped or unmapped, that matches the descriptions provided. Further, the regulations permit the commission to alter its jurisdictional boundaries to include regulated areas that actually exist simply by declaratory ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">We cannot agree, however, with the plaintiffs that this regulatory scheme conflicts with \u00a7 22a-42a. The regulations enlarge the jurisdiction of the commission as granted by the statutes by including within its jurisdiction any area meeting the description of \u201cregulated area.\u201d Thus, any area within the town that meets the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>description in the regulations is a regulated area and has been since adoption of the regulations. The regulations merely require the commission to identify a piece of land as within the definition of a \u201cregulated area\u201d for the commission to assert its authority. It is clear that the regulations simply enlarge on, and do not conflict with, the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Moreover, it is clear that the regulations further the broad legislative purpose of the wetlands act. As <em>Aaron </em>and its progeny establish, regulations that are reasonably designed to effectuate the legislative purpose do not conflict with the statute. See <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 172; <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 336-37; <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 543.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">\u201cAlthough we have recognized that the policy decision to protect wetlands and watercourses must be balanced against the productive use of privately owned land; <em>Red Hill Coalition, Inc. </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>[supra, 212 Conn. 719]; we have also indicated that this balancing process is more appropriately conducted in a legislative rather than a judicial setting. Thus, \u2018[a]n agency which has the authority to enact regulations is vested with a large measure of discretion, and the burden of showing that the agency has acted improperly rests upon the one who asserts it.\u2019 <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, [183 Conn. 537]; <em>see Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>[203 Conn. 14, 23, 523 A.2d 467 (1987)]. \u2018Every intendment is to be made in favor of the validity of the ordinance, and it is the duty of the court to sustain the ordinance unless its invalidity is established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 <em>Connecticut Theatrical Corporation </em>v. <em>New Britain, </em>147 Conn. 546, 553, 163 A.2d 548 (1960); <em>Blue Sky Bar, Inc. </em>v. <em>Stratford, </em>supra [23]; <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra [537].\u201d <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 336-37.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>The similarity between the facts of this case and those in <em>Aaron </em>further undermine the plaintiffs\u2019 argument. In <em>Aaron, </em>the plaintiffs challenged regulations that established the regulated area both by map and by definition. The regulations stated that \u201c[i]n each instance . . . the actual character of the soil shall determine whether land in question is subject to regulations.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Aaron </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 183 Conn. 546. Our Supreme Court upheld the regulations. \u201cBecause the same types of soil are being regulated, and because, in each instance, it is the type of soil which is determinative of whether certain land is a wetland, there is no conflict. This language does not expand the jurisdiction of the commission. While the statute defines \u2018wetlands\u2019 and how it can be determined, the language in \u00a7 1.16 implements the statutory purposes of the act by setting forth permissible standards to assist in determining, informationally, whether a particular location is the situs of a wetland.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">In this case, the regulations establish the jurisdictional boundaries by map and by definition. In each instance, the character of the soil determines whether it falls under the commission\u2019s jurisdiction. Therefore, the language implements the statutory purpose and does not impermissibly expand the commission\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Finally, we note that the plaintiffs argue for a literal reading of the statute. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument is supported forcefully by the dissents in <em>Lizotte </em>v. <em>Conservation Commission, </em>supra, 216 Conn. 340-41 <em>(Covello, J., </em>dissenting) and <em>Mario </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 180 <em>(Covello </em>and <em>Callahan, Js., </em>dissenting). That support, however, comes <em>only </em>in the form of dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In this case, the regulations do not conflict with \u00a7 22a-42a; rather they enlarge on and are more com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>prehensive than the statute. We find that the regulations are not in conflict or in excess of the statutory authority but rather implement the statutory authority to effectuate the legislative purpose of protecting watercourses.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b408-8\"> The plaintiffs are Frank E.
