The defendants assert that the trial court abused its discretion when it refused to admit the deposition pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The defendants purchased commercial property from the plaintiff, Gus Pelarinos, in 1988. The defendants executed two promissory notes in favor of the plaintiff totaling $230,000. In addition to the defendants\u2019 personal obligation, the notes were secured by the commercial property. After the defendants defaulted on the notes in the fall of 1989, the plaintiff commenced suit for breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The defendants filed a special defense, claiming fraudulent misrepresentation. The defendants alleged that they had been induced to sign the notes by the plaintiff\u2019s oral promise that, if they defaulted, he would seek satisfaction solely from the secured commercial property, not their personal guarantee. The plaintiff denied the allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">At trial, Genevieve Henderson testified to the facts contained in the special defense. She also testified that Donald Henderson was incarcerated in federal prison in Pennsylvania. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony contradicted Genevieve Henderson\u2019s assertions and was corroborated by the testimony of an attorney who represented the defendants in the transaction. Although Genevieve Henderson had testified that her daughter and another former attorney could corroborate her claims, the defendants called neither as a witness. The adverse inference permitted to be drawn from these missing witnesses also strengthened the plaintiff\u2019s case. See <em>Secondino </em>v. <em>New Haven Gas Co., </em>147 Conn. 672, 675, 165 A.2d 598 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>On the basis of the uncontroverted evidence that Donald Henderson was in prison, the defendants offered his testimony recorded at a deposition noticed and taken by the plaintiff, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The plaintiff objected that the defendants had not demonstrated sufficient attempts to obtain Donald Henderson\u2019s presence at trial. Further, the plaintiff complained that he had not been notified of the defendants\u2019 intention to offer the deposition until two days before trial. The trial court excluded the deposition testimony on these grounds. Subsequently, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d) (3) permits a party to offer a deposition into evidence if the court finds that the deponent is unable to attend or testify because of imprisonment. Once this requirement is satisfied, the deposition is admissible to the same extent as if the deponent were present and testifying. Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1). Admission of a deposition under this rule does not preclude the opponent from objecting to the deposition or any part thereof on grounds that would require the exclusion of the evidence if the deponent testified in court. Practice Book \u00a7 248 (2); <em>Souper Spud, Inc. </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>5 Conn. App. 579, 582-83, 501 A.2d 1214 (1985), cert. denied, 198 Conn. 803, 503 A.2d 172 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">\u201cThe admissibility of a deposition into evidence under Practice Book \u00a7 248 is permissive in nature, leaving the ultimate determination to the trial judge. ... On appeal, the trial court\u2019s rulings on the admissibility of evidence are accorded great deference . . . [and] will be disturbed only upon a showing of clear abuse of discretion. . . . The party making the claim of error has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>the burden of showing that the court clearly abused its discretion.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cahn v. Cahn, </em>225 Conn. 666, 678, 626 A.2d 296 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">The trial court had evidence before it that Donald Henderson was incarcerated in Pennsylvania. The plaintiff did not contest that Henderson was incarcerated. Notwithstanding this uncontroverted evidence, the trial court refused to receive the deposition under \u00a7 248 (1) (d).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The trial court found that the defendants had not satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 248. The court required the defendants to show that they had attempted to obtain Donald Henderson\u2019s presence at trial. Section 248 requires no such showing. The rule simply states that if the court finds that the witness is unable to attend the trial because of imprisonment, then any party may use the deposition for any purpose. The plaintiff suggests that the text requires the court to find, first, that the witness is imprisoned and, second, that the witness is unable to attend the trial. Such a reading imposes on the offering party a duty to demonstrate good faith efforts to obtain the witness\u2019 presence. We cannot read such a requirement in the phrase \u201cunable to attend.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Where the rules of practice intend that good faith efforts be made before a deposition can be admitted, they expressly require such a showing. Thus, a deposition of an absent witness is admissible in a criminal trial if the proponent of the deposition \u201chas been unable to procure [the witness\u2019] attendance by subpoena or by other reasonable means.\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 803; see also Practice Book \u00a7 793; <em>State </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>25 Conn. App. 21, 24, 592 A.2d 413 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">Section 248 (1) (d) (3) of our Practice Book is almost identical to rule 32 (a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Where a state rule is similar to a federal rule we review the federal case law to assist our interpretation of our rule. <em>Arduini </em>v. <em>Automobile Ins. Co. of Hartford, </em>23 Conn. App. 585, 589, 583 A.2d 152 (1990). In this instance, our review of federal cases supports our conclusion. In <em>In re Moore, </em>39 B.R. 571, 572 (M.D. Fla. 1984), the defendant argued that \u201cin addition to showing the undisputed fact of the witness\u2019 imprisonment at the time of the trial, the defendant must show unavailability on account of imprisonment, i.e., that he tried and failed to produce the witness through use of a habeas corpus proceeding . . . .\u2019\u2019The court characterized this argument as frivolous. Id. \u201cThere is some theoretical means by which virtually any living witness, however restricted in movement, might, with sufficient effort and expense, attend a trial. There is no basis for a belief that the rule requires extraordinary effort to establish unavailability.\u201d Id.; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>M/V Christy Lee, </em>640 F. Sup. 667, 668 (S.D. Fla. 1986) (noting that imprisonment makes deposition admissible without reference to good faith attempts to obtain witness\u2019 presence). Likewise, we conclude that \u00a7 248 (1) (d) (3) does not require a showing of good faith efforts to obtain the witness\u2019 presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Similarly, \u00a7 248 (1) (d) has no notice requirement. To the extent that the trial court based its ruling on Genevieve Henderson\u2019s tardy notice, it imposed a condition not inherent in, or envisioned by, the rule. Thus, the trial court\u2019s ruling contravened the only evidence before it and was based on two conditions not required by the rule. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court abused its discretion when it excluded Donald Henderson\u2019s deposition testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>\u201cWe have often stated [however] that before a party is entitled to a new trial because of an erroneous evidentiary ruling, he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. . . . When determining that issue in a civil case, the standard to be used is whether the erroneous ruling \u2018would likely affect the result. . . . The determination of that question lies in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Swenson </em>v. <em>Sawoska, </em>215 Conn. 148, 153, 575 A.2d 206 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The defendants had the burden of proving their special defense of fraudulent misrepresentation by clear and convincing evidence. Genevieve Henderson testified that the plaintiff had induced the defendants to sign the notes by promising that he would seek satisfaction of the notes solely from the commercial property. Conversely, the plaintiff denied making any such representations. The plaintiff\u2019s testimony was corroborated by testimony of the defendants\u2019 attorney, and the adverse inference permitted to be drawn from the defendants\u2019 failure to produce two potentially corroborating witnesses. Thus, by preventing Donald Henderson from testifying, the trial court prevented the jury from hearing corroborating testimony from one of only three potential sources. In light of these facts, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the deposition was likely to affect the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-7\"> Practice Book \u00a7 248 (1) (d) provides in pertinent part: \u201cThe deposition of a witness . . . whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds ... 3. that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of . . . imprisonment . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b752-6\"> Rule 32 (a) (3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides in part: \u201cThe deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be used by any party for any purpose if the court finds . . .
