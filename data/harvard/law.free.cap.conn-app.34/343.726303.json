The plaintiff is a physician licensed to practice medicine in Connecticut and the defendants are the Connecticut department of health services (department) and the Connecticut medical examining board (board). Both defendants are state agencies within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA). General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s prolonged journey through the legal system commenced in May, 1983, when the board, on motion of the department, brought charges against him and summarily suspended his medical license pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-182 (c) and 19a-17 (c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The charges pertain to the plaintiff\u2019s treatment of a patient for drug addiction. License revocation hearings commenced on June 1, 1983, and continued on June 7, 1983, August 2, 1983,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> August 28, 1984, and culmi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>nated in a board meeting on October 23, 1985, when the board voted to revoke the plaintiff\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">The plaintiff appealed the board\u2019s decision to the Superior Court which reversed the decision and remanded the case to the board for a new hearing. The defendants appealed to this court. We considered the case in <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>24 Conn. App. 662, 591 A.2d 150 (1991), wherein we affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision that the plaintiff had been denied his right to cross-examine the board\u2019s chief witness and had also been denied discovery of witnesses\u2019 prehearing statements. Because we believed those issues dispositive of the appeal, we did not reach the defendants\u2019 remaining appellate claims or the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The Supreme Court granted certification and reversed this court\u2019s decision, concluding that the plaintiff had waived his right of cross-examination as well as his right to challenge the nondisclosure of witnesses\u2019 prior statements. <em>Dragan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Medical Examining Board, </em>223 Conn. 618, 613 A.2d 739 (1992). The Supreme Court remanded the case to this court to consider the sole remaining issue in the defendants\u2019 appeal and the issues in the plaintiff\u2019s cross appeal. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">The defendants claim that the trial court, in remanding the case for a new hearing, improperly held that the board was required to indicate either in its minutes or in its memorandum of decision that voting members who had not heard the case had nonetheless familiarized themselves with the record. We reverse the decision of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">The following facts are necessary for disposition of this issue. The board received evidence at hearings on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>June 1,1983, June 7,1983, and August 28,1984. Sometime after the last hearing, the board referred the matter to Assistant Attorney General Paul J. Lahey to prepare a memorandum of decision. On October 23, 1985, the board met and voted to accept the memorandum of decision that Lahey had prepared.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Only four board members were present and voting at this meeting. Of these four, only the board chairman, Henry J. Mannix, Jr., had attended all four hearings. Shirley Y. Williams missed the August 28,1984 hearing. Joan H. Blakeslee missed the August 2, 1983 hearing<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and Harvey A. Katz missed all three of the 1983 hearings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The record does not indicate whether Williams, Blakeslee and Katz, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u00a7 4-179,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> read the record of the hearings they missed or otherwise familiarized themselves with the evidence that was received in their absence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">Our Supreme Court recently decided <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health Services, </em>228 Conn. 651, 638 A.2d 6 (1994), which involved the identical question of voting by board members who had not attended all of the board hearings. In <em>Pet, </em>the Supreme Court concluded, on facts virtually identical to those of the present case, that the record did not disclose \u201cwhether the board was sufficiently familiar with the record of [the case] to make an informed judgment in compliance with \u00a7 4-179. The trial court, therefore, <em>lacked any basis for determining whether </em>the board had complied with the mandates of the UAPA.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 682. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>Consequently, the Supreme Court remanded <em>Pet </em>to the trial court for supplementation of the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">The trial court record in this case, as in <em>Pet, </em>is silent as to whether the board members properly apprised themselves of the administrative record so as to fulfill their duties under the UAPA. On the basis of the record\u2019s silence, the trial court remanded the case to the board for a new hearing, concluding that the plaintiff was \u201centitled to a clear showing by the board, either in the minutes of the meeting or its memorandum decision that all members voting on the decision . . . had read the record of the case prior to voting on it.\u201d Under the ruling of <em>Pet, </em>the trial court\u2019s remand to the board for a new hearing in this case was premature. <em>Pet </em>instructs that the trial court must first supplement the record in order to provide a basis for determining the issue of whether the board members had sufficiently familiarized themselves with the record. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Cross Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">The plaintiff raises the following issues in his cross appeal: (1) Does the board have the burden of proving that the missing portion of the administrative record was harmless? (2) Should the trial court have permitted the plaintiff to introduce additional evidence? (3) Was the evidence sufficient to find the plaintiff guilty of the charges made against him?</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>The following facts are necessary to the disposition of the first issue. On the plaintiffs appeal from the board\u2019s decision, the board made its return of record to the Superior Court in accordance with General Statutes (Rev. to 1983) \u00a7 4-183 (d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Because the board\u2019s return of record did not contain at least seven exhibits entered into evidence during the license revocation hearing, the plaintiff moved for default. The trial court denied this motion. Thereafter, the board, with the cooperation of plaintiff\u2019s counsel, received copies of six of the seven exhibits missing from the record. The lone missing exhibit, which neither of the parties could find or reconstruct, contained the plaintiff\u2019s handwritten notes relating to his treatment of Collette Conor, the person who provided the basis for the charges brought against the plaintiff. The plaintiff argues that the board has the burden of proving that the missing exhibit did not prejudice his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Pet </em>is helpful in the disposition of this issue. In <em>Pet, </em>the plaintiff alleged that the administrative record on which the board voted was incomplete because of missing exhibits. <em>Pet </em>concluded that without further evidence concerning the missing exhibits, the trial court could not determine their impact on the board\u2019s decision. In this case, the record does not reveal when the exhibit was lost. Accordingly, we do not know whether \u201cthe importance and timing of the loss of the records impacted on the board\u2019s ability to be fully informed of the issues before it . . . .\u201d Id., 682. In light of the exhibit\u2019s potential importance and in the absence of an explicit finding by the trial court that the missing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>exhibit did not impact the board\u2019s decision, we remand the case to the trial court for supplementation of the record on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In his second claim, the plaintiff argues that he should have been allowed to present additional evidence before the trial court concerning a witness\u2019 board certification and two prescriptions written by that witness that might have contradicted the witness\u2019 testimony. We note the holding of <em>Pet </em>that <em>\u201ca </em>license to practice medicine is a recognized property right and may only be revoked under procedures that comport with constitutional due process of law. . . . [Wjhen the government seeks to deprive a person of life, liberty or property, [due process requires] that the thoroughness of the procedure by which the deprivation is effected must be balanced against the gravity of the potential loss and the interests at stake, and . . . that the procedure involved must be appropriate to the nature of the case. ...\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 682-83. We conclude that because of the gravity of the potential loss to the plaintiff in this case, the trial court should have allowed the plaintiff to present his additional evidence. We agree with the reasoning of <em>Pet </em>that \u201cbecause of the potentially crucial impact of the plaintiff\u2019s claims of procedural irregularities on the propriety of the board\u2019s decision, we conclude that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the plaintiff the opportunity to present evidence that would supplement the agency record.\u201d Id., 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Until the trial court has conducted the proceedings required under our remand, it would be premature for us to examine the record in an attempt to determine whether there was a substantial basis to support the defendant\u2019s decision. Accordingly, we do not reach the plaintiff\u2019s third claim on his cross appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>The judgment is reversed on both the appeal and the cross appeal and the case is remanded to the trial court to allow supplementation of the record and for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b367-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 4-182 (c) provides: \u201cNo revocation, suspension, annulment or withdrawal of any license is lawful unless, prior to the institution of agency proceedings, the agency gave notice by mail to the licensee of facts or conduct which warrant the intended action, and the licensee was given an opportunity to show compliance with all lawful requirements for the retention of the license. If the agency finds that public health, safety or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and incorporates a finding to that effect in its order, summary suspension of a license may be ordered pending proceedings for revocation or other action.
