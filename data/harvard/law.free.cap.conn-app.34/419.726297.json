When this matter was first before us we dismissed the appeal, on our own motion, on the ground that the denial of a motion to open a dismissal entered pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 was not a final judgment, relying on <em>Governors Grove Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Hill Development Corp., </em>187 Conn. 509, 446 A.2d 1082 (1982). Upon the granting of certification, the Supreme Court overruled <em>Governors Grove, </em>reversed our decision, and concluded that the denial of a motion to open a dismissal entered pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 was an appealable final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>The facts necessary to the resolution of this appeal were well stated in our previous decision as follows. \u201cThe plaintiff brought this negligence action against the defendant on August 23,1989. The plaintiff claimed that she was injured due to the negligence of a fellow employee while she was employed at Sears, Roebuck and Company. A motion to implead by the defendant, Manpower, Inc., was granted and a third party complaint against Sears, claiming breach of contract and indemnification, was filed. On April 17,1991, the case appeared on the Superior Court dormancy calendar, with a notice that the action would be dismissed on June 28, 1991, if counsel failed to close the pleadings or appear on that date. On June 10, 1991, the plaintiff filed a motion to exempt the action from the dormancy calendar. On June 28, 1991, the action was dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 for the failure of the plaintiff to prosecute with reasonable diligence. Subsequently, the plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment of dismissal, which was denied. This appeal is from that denial.\u201d <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>29 Conn. App. 132, 133, 612 A.2d 818 (1992). We went on to say in a footnote that \u201c[t]he plaintiff claimed that she did not receive notice of the June 28, 1991 dismissal until November 19, 1991. The plaintiffs counsel claimed that he became aware of the judgment of dismissal during a discussion with the defendant\u2019s counsel regarding a pending motion for summary judgment dated July 2, 1991, which was scheduled for hearing on the short calendar of November 25,1991. The plaintiff filed a motion to open the judgment on November 21,1991. A hearing on the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open was scheduled for December 2, 1991, but it was not acted upon on that date. A computer generated notice, dated December 18, 1991, referring to a judgment dated December 5, 1991, was issued by the Superior Court clerk\u2019s office and stated that the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>motion to open the judgment was granted. Thereafter, the motion to open appeared on the December 9,1991 calendar and the trial court, <em>A. Aronson, J., </em>denied the motion to open. Notice of this decision was issued on December 9, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">\u201cThe denial was based on <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Behar, </em>15 Conn. App. 308, 544 A.2d 250 (1988), which held that a trial court has no jurisdiction to open a judgment beyond the four month period described in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326. See also <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 494 A.2d 549 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">\u201cOn January 10,1992, the trial court issued a notice that stated that \u2018[conflicting notices were sent on this motion. Motion to reopen denied 12/9/91 per <em>Aronson, J. . . . </em>Notice granting motion sent in error. This file is dead.\u2019 \u201d <em>Morelli </em>v. <em>Manpower, Inc., </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 133-34 n.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly denied her motion to open the judgment of dismissal on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to open a judgment beyond the four month period described in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326 without first affording her a hearing on her claim that she did not receive notice of the judgment of dismissal until November 19, 1991. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">Submitted along with her motion to open the judgment of dismissal dated November 21, 1991, was an affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The affidavit alleged that the attorney for the plaintiff did not receive notice of the dismissal until he was informed of the dismissal by the attorney for Manpower, Inc., during a telephone conversation on November 19,1991. The conversation was in regard to a motion for summary judgment filed by Manpower, Inc., on July 9,1991, and scheduled for a hearing on November 25, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides in pertinent part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the superior court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed. . . -\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">\u201c[I]t is axiomatic that the right to move to open and vacate a judgment assumes that the party who is to exercise the right be given the opportunity to know that there is a judgment to open.\u201d <em>Noethe </em>v. <em>Noethe, </em>18 Conn. App. 589, 595, 559 A.2d 1149 (1989). The order of the trial court dated December 9,1991, denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion to open the dismissal contains the following notation: \u201cJDNO 12-9-91 KP A/C.\u201d This is a standard notation used to indicate that a judicial notice of a decision or order has been sent by the clerk\u2019s office to all parties of record. Such a notation raises a presumption that notice was sent and received in the absence of a finding to the contrary. <em>Batory </em>v. <em>Bajor, </em>22 Conn. App. 4, 8, 575 A.2d 1042, cert. denied, 215 Conn. 812, 576 A.2d 541 (1990); <em>DiSimone </em>v. <em>Vitello, </em>6 Conn. App. 390, 393, 505 A.2d 745 (1986). Because the presumption is rebuttable, it follows that the plaintiff is entitled to a hearing to have an opportunity to present such rebuttal evidence. When the trial court is required to make a finding that \u201cdepends on issues of fact which are disputed, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>32 Conn. App. 465, 475, 629 A.2d 1160 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">The defendant Manpower urges us to find that, even if the plaintiff did not receive notice of the June 28, 1991 dismissal, she was on notice that the matter was on the dormancy calendar and the calendar itself contained a notation that if certain steps were not taken, the matter would be dismissed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This is an issue more properly reserved for the trial court at a hearing to determine when the plaintiff had notice of the dismissal and, accordingly, when the four month limitation, of General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326 expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">In this opinion Schaller, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"> Practice Book \u00a7 326 provides in pertinent part: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, any civil judgment or decree rendered in the superior court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months succeeding the date on which it was rendered or passed. The parties may waive the provisions of this paragraph or otherwise submit to the jurisdiction of the court. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b446-10\"> We note that the defendant Manpower filed a motion for summary judgment on July 19, 1991, some ten days after the June 28, 1991, dismissal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b446-8\">Landau, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A328\">concurring. Although I concur in the result reached by the majority, I disagree with its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Before proceeding, it is important to point out exactly what is and what is not at issue. This is an appeal from the judgment of the trial court (albeit the second visit to this court) denying a motion to open a judgment of dismissal pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 251 for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute her claim with reasonable diligence. The action was dismissed on June 28,1991. On November 21, 1991, more than four months after the dismissal, the plaintiff filed a motion to open,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> claim<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>ing, inter alia, that she did not receive notice of the dismissal until November 19, 1991. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied by the trial court citing <em>Serrano </em>v. <em>Behar, </em>15 Conn. App. 308, 311, 544 A.2d 250 (1988), stating that \u201ca trial court has no jurisdiction to open a judgment beyond the four month period described in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326. See also <em>Van Mecklenburg </em>v. <em>Pan American World Airways, Inc., </em>196 Conn. 517, 494 A.2d 549 (1985).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The majority, disagreeing with the trial court, concluded that \u201c \u2018[i]t is axiomatic that the right to move to open and vacate a judgment assumes that the party who is to exercise the right be given the opportunity to know that there is a judgment to open.\u2019 <em>Noethe </em>v. <em>Noethe, </em>18 Conn. App. 589, 595, 559 A.2d 1149 (1989).\u201d It ruled that the plaintiff is entitled to a hearing to have an opportunity to present evidence rebutting the trial court\u2019s finding that notice of the dismissal was sent by the court and received by the plaintiff. The majority, quoting <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>32 Conn. App. 465, 475, 629 A.2d 1160 (1993), states: \u201cWhen the trial court is required to make a finding that depends on issues of fact which are disputed, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The majority\u2019s adherence to <em>Roberts </em>as the linchpin of its analysis suggests a precedent based on a discretionary finding of fact, i.e., that the presumption of issuance and receipt of the notice has been met and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>overcome. I am apprehensive and distrustful of that reliance, and the precedential value that necessarily follows it.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The order of the trial court dated December 9,1991, coupled with the affidavit of the plaintiffs attorney, successfully fashions the notice issue. The bar to reaching a decision is General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and Practice Book \u00a7 326.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Both set out a temporal parameter of four months for the filing of a motion to open or set aside succeeding the date on which a judgment was rendered or passed, \u201c[ujnless otherwise provided by law.\u201d Due process is \u201cprovided by law\u201d in any circumstance. \u201cAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.\u201d <em>Mullane </em>v. <em>Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., </em>339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S. Ct. 652, 94 L. Ed. 865 (1950). A dismissal under Practice Book \u00a7 251 certainly has a sense of finality attached,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and \u201cthe exis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>tence of actual or constructive notice is a question of fact properly within the province of the trial court. <em>Middlebury </em>v. <em>Steinmann, </em>189 Conn. 710, 714, 458 A.2d 393 (1983); <em>Mausch </em>v. <em>Hartford, </em>184 Conn. 467, 469, 440 A.2d 157 (1981).\u201d <em>Noethe </em>v. <em>Noethe, </em>supra, 18 Conn. App. 596. On remand, the trial court must hold an evidentiary hearing to determine when the plaintiff received either actual or constructive notice and whether she filed her motion to open within four months succeeding the date on which the judgment was rendered or passed. Id. Thus, rather than base a decision on <em>Roberts </em>with its substructure of a discretionary finding of fact, I would posit that <em>Mullane </em>serves as sounder footing on which to set the cornerstone.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">I would direct the trial court, upon a finding that the plaintiffs motion to open was untimely, to deny the motion; if however, the court concludes that the motion was timely filed, then it must reach the merits of the motion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Accordingly, I concur only in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-11\"> The plaintiff moved the court \u201cto reopen dismissal.\u201d \u201cAlthough the nomenclature is found in the title to General Statutes \u00a7 52-212 and in some decisions of our courts; see, e.g., <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Bartlett, </em>220 Conn. 372, 599 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>A.2d 14 (1991); <em>Sasso </em>v. <em>Aleshin, </em>197 Conn. 87, 495 A.2d 1066 <em>(1985);D\u2019Occhio </em>v. <em>Connecticut Real Estate Commission, </em>189 Conn. 162, 455 A.2d 833 (1983); <em>Northeast Savings, F.A. </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>22 Conn. App. 396, 578 A.2d 136 (1990); <em>Kavarco </em>v. <em>T.J.E., Inc., </em>2 Conn. App. 294, 478 A.2d 257 (1984); unless the judgment has been opened previously, the appropriate appellation is a motion to open. \u2018Reopen\u2019 is defined in Webster\u2019s Third New World Dictionary as \u2018to open <em>again\u2019 </em>or \u2018to take up <em>again.\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Thus, we will treat the motion as a motion to open.\u201d <em>National Iron Bank </em>v. <em>Gelormino, </em>28 Conn. App. 7, 8 n.1, 609 A.2d 666 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b448-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a provides: \u201cUnless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil judgment or decree rendered in the superior court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed.

It then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>embarks on a brief discussion by way of obiter dicta as to when the four month limitation, contained in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a and Practice Book \u00a7 326, expires. While I agree with the majority that the argument is more properly reserved, on remand, for the trial court, the issue of the limitation\u2019s expiration is not before us and is a matter best left to another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
