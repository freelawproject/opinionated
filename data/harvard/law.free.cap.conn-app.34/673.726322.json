After formal hearings, first district commissioner A. Paul Berte issued a finding and decision on June 5,1990, that the condition was not work related. Schick appealed to the compensation review board on June 15, 1990. In July, 1990, while the appeal was pending, Berte resigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">In February, 1991, the plaintiff filed a motion to correct the commissioner\u2019s findings, and, in March, 1991, filed a motion with the board for an order remanding the matter for a hearing de novo; he claimed that Berte was unwilling to act on his motion to correct. The defendants<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> objected and requested the appointment of an alternate commissioner to act on the motion to correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On February 16, 1993, the board ordered the matter remanded to the first district so that the plaintiff could have the option of either a hearing de novo or, if the parties agreed, the submission of evidential transcripts and exhibits of the hearing together with the commissioner\u2019s findings and the plaintiff\u2019s motion to correct to another commissioner for completion. The defendants appealed from that order on March 5, 1993.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>The defendants claim that the board improperly remanded the matter, and improperly refused to designate a substitute commissioner pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1991) \u00a7 31-281.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Before addressing the merits of this claim, we briefly turn our attention to the standard of review. Whether a case should be remanded, and the scope of that remand, presents questions to be determined by the compensation review board in the exercise of its sound discretion. See <em>Tsoukalas </em>v. <em>Bolton Mfg. Co., </em>130 Conn. 658, 663, 37 A.2d 357 (1944). \u201cIn reviewing a claim that this discretion has been abused the unquestioned rule is that great weight is due the action of the [board] and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness. . . . [T]he ultimate issue is whether the [board] could reasonably conclude as it did. . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Rullo </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp., </em>208 Conn. 74, 78-79, 543 A.2d 279 (1988). The action of the board is not to be disturbed unless it has abused its broad discretion. <em>Weldon Business Group </em>v. <em>Schweitzer, </em>22 Conn. App. 552, 554, 577 A.2d 1126 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Our review of the record discloses that the compensation review board, citing its own prior holdings, and <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>29 Conn. App. 378, 615 A.2d 507 (1992), and <em>Kasarauskas </em>v. <em>McLaughlin, </em>25 Conn. Sup. 60, 196 A.2d 118 (1963), concluded that due process required the remand as ordered, as it had no authority pursuant to General <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Statutes \u00a7 31-278<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to compel the retired commissioner to act. The defendants argue, however, that the board had another alternative and abused its discretion by ordering a remand rather than designating a substitute commissioner pursuant to \u00a7 31-281. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The board decided this case by ordering the remand more than one year after the repeal of \u00a7 31-281. The provisions of \u00a7 31-281 were procedural. While we may agree that the repeal of \u00a7 31-281 does not operate retrospectively, it is clear that the repeal of that section occurred prior to the board\u2019s decision and that as of the date of the decision the board could not rely on the procedures as set forth therein. The appeal is from the board\u2019s decision, and not from any action or inaction prior to that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The defendants further argue that, because General Statutes \u00a7 51-183\u00cd<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>permits the designation of a substitute commissioner, the board\u2019s remand constituted an abuse of discretion. Again, we do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">Although there is no requirement that the same judge rule on all matters arising after a judgment; <em>Holcombe </em>v. <em>Holcombe, </em>22 Conn. App. 363, 365, 576 A.2d 1317 (1990); and \u00a7 51-183\u00cd \u201cauthorizes further proceedings before another judge where the original trial judge is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>unable to complete proceedings due to . . . resignation\u201d; <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 384; the general rule is that a party litigant is entitled to a decision on the facts by a judge who heard the matter, and a deprivation of that right may be a denial of due process. Id. Section 51-183\u00cd permits a successor judge to act<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> absent a stipulation by the parties to a decision by a successor judge based on a review of the evidence before the original judge. <em>See Nahas </em>v. <em>Nahas, </em>25 Conn. App. 595, 597 n.1, 595 A.2d 926 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to correct findings is extensive, seeking to delete paragraphs twenty-four through twenty-seven of the findings and to substitute twenty paragraphs of findings. In response to the plaintiffs motion for order to remand for a new hearing, the defendants filed their objection and claimed, inter alia, that \u00a7 31-281 vested the board with authority to designate an alternate commissioner. The objection cites only \u00a7 31-281 and not \u00a7 51-1831<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The motion to cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>rect deals not only with the plaintiffs testimony, but also with the testimony of his attending physician, Robert Silverstein, and that of his evaluating physician, Gordon Kritzer. Additionally, the plaintiff\u2019s motion dealt with the testimony of the defendants\u2019 expert witness, James E. Dougherty, a physician. The board was aware that the commissioner who decided the matter had heard and saw the witnesses, and that the issue of credibility was of great importance in his decision. The board acted to fulfill the due process requirement that \u201c \u2018[t]he one who decides must hear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Trotta </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>32 Conn. App. 395, 401 n.2, 628 A.2d 1343, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 922, 623 A.2d 700 (1993), quoting <em>Morgan v. United States, </em>298 U.S. 468, 481, 56 S. Ct. 906, 86 L. Ed. 1288 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">The defendants have not sustained their burden of demonstrating that the board abused its discretion in ordering a remand<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> under these circumstances for a trial de novo, or \u201cif the parties agree to submit the . . . transcripts and exhibits . . . together with [the] Finding and Award and the . . . motion to correct to . . . another commissioner . . . for completion.\u201d The defendants also did not sustain their burden of demonstrating, absent the agreement of the parties, that the board abused its discretion in failing to designate a substitute commissioner who had not heard the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>evidence, to decide the plaintiffs motion to correct the findings of the commissioner who did hear the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-9\"> The defendants are Windsor Airmotive Division/Barnes Group Inc. (employer), and Travelers Insurance Company (insurer).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\"> The plaintiff moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of a final judgment. The plaintiff\u2019s motion was denied. <em>Schick </em>v. <em>Windsor Airmotive Division/Barnes Group, </em>31 Conn. App. 819, 627 A.2d 478 (1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b697-6\"> Prior to January 1,1992, General Statutes \u00a7 31-281 provided: \u201cThe compensation commissioners for the several districts, acting as a board, may, in the event of the death, illness, resignation or disqualification of a commissioner of any district, designate another commissioner to act in any compensation matter in such district, and any commissioner acting under such designation shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the commissioner for such district.\u201d That section was repealed by Public Acts 1991, No. 91-339, \u00a7 53.
