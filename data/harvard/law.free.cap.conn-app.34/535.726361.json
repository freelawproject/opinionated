At the conclusion of the evidence in the probation revocation hearing, the trial court stated: \u201cI am reasonably satisfied to the standard of the probation violation that the defendant has been shown to be in violation of the conditions of his probation.\u201d The trial court applied a reasonable satisfaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>standard of proof for finding a violation of probation pursuant to this court\u2019s holding in <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>29 Conn. App. 801, 813, 618 A.2d 557 (1993). Our Supreme Court recently reversed <em>Davis, </em>holding that the proper standard of proof for establishing a violation of probation is a fair preponderance of the evidence. <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 295, 641 A.2d 370 (1994). <em>Davis </em>was remanded to this court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court and to remand the case for a new probation revocation hearing. Id., 303. We now treat the present case in a similar manner and remand it for a new probation revocation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">An issue that is likely to arise during the new hearing is the admissibility of a certain drug evaluation report prepared by an agency known as \u201cYouth Evaluation Services\u201d and furnished to the probation department. The trial court admitted the report over the defendant\u2019s objection that the state had not qualified it as a business record under the business records exception to the hearsay rule, General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 (a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Reliance on that statute is not necessary to admit the report as evidence in a probation revocation hearing because a court may consider any relevant, reliable and probative hearsay in such a hearing. <em>State </em>v. <em>White, </em>169 Conn. 223, 239-40, 363 A.2d 143, cert. denied, 423 U.S. 1025, 96 S.
