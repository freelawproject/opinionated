The trial court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s appeal on the sole ground that a Farmington police officer had unlawfully pursued the plaintiff from the town of Farmington into the town of Avon under General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time that the police officer first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>observed the plaintiff, he noted that the plaintiff was operating his motor vehicle at what appeared to be an excessive rate of speed. Thus, at the time that the officer pursued the plaintiff into Avon, he suspected only that the defendant had committed a motor vehicle violation under General Statutes \u00a7 14-219 (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the officer stopped the plaintiffs vehicle in Avon, the investigation that he conducted led him to believe that the plaintiff had been operating his vehicle while under the influence of liquor. The officer thereupon arrested the plaintiff and charged him with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that the officer had unlawfully stopped the plaintiff in Avon for a violation of \u00a7 14-219 (c) and, thus, had unlawfully arrested the plaintiff for operating a vehicle while under the influence of liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). As a result, the trial court found the commissioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>decision clearly erroneous \u201cin view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">This case is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>228 Conn. 758, 638 A.2d 601 (1994). In <em>Harrison, </em>our Supreme Court interpreted the term \u201coffense\u201d as used in General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf to include motor vehicle violations. Id., 765. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Harrison, </em>we concluded that the Farmington officer had lawfully pursued the plaintiff across town lines, had lawfully stopped the vehicle and had lawfully arrested the plaintiff. Thus, the trial court improperly determined that the commissioner\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-8\"> The defendants are Louis Goldberg, commissioner of motor vehicles, and the department of motor vehicles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b224-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f) provides that a hearing to determine the suspension of a driver\u2019s license for driving while under the influence of liquor \u201cshall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle or for assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle or for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis or did such person submit to such test or analysis and the results of such test or analysis indicated that at the time of the alleged offense the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201cMembers of any local police department . . . when in immediate pursuit of one who may be arrested under the provisions of this section, are authorized to pursue the offender outside of their respective precincts into any part of the state in order to effect the arrest. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b225-5\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-219 provides in pertinent part: \u201c(a) No person shall operate any motor vehicle (1) upon any highway ... at such a rate of speed as to endanger the life of any occupant of such motor vehicle, but not the life of any other person than such an occupant; or (2) at a rate of speed greater than fifty five miles per hour upon any highway. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u201c(c) Any person who violates any provision of subdivision (1) of subsection (a) of this section or who operates a motor vehicle (1) on a multiple lane, limited access highway at a rate of speed greater than seventy miles per hour but not greater than eighty-five miles per hour or (2) on any other highway at a rate of speed greater than sixty miles per hour but not greater than eighty-five miles per hour shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one hundred fifty dollars, provided any such person operating a truck, as defined in section 14-260n, shall be fined not less than one hundred fifty dollars nor more than two hundred dollars.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b225-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201coperation while under the influence.
