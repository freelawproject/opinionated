The trial court sustained the plaintiffs appeal on the sole ground that a Wethersfield police officer had unlawfully pursued the plaintiff from the town of Wethersfield into the town of Glastonbury under General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">At the time that the police officer first observed the plaintiff, he noted that the plaintiff was operating his motor vehicle at what appeared to be an excessive rate of speed and unlawfully changing lanes. Thus, at the time that the officer pursued the plaintiff into Glastonbury, he suspected only that the defendant had committed motor vehicle violations under General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 14-218a<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 14-236.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> When the officer stopped the plaintiff\u2019s vehicle in Glastonbury, the investigation that he conducted led him to believe that the plaintiff had been operating his vehicle while under the influence of liquor. The officer thereupon arrested the plaintiff and charged him with a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 14-227a (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found that the officer had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>unlawfully stopped the plaintiff in Glastonbury for violations of \u00a7\u00a7 14-218a and 14-236 and, thus, had unlawfully arrested the plaintiff for operating a vehicle while under the influence of liquor in violation of \u00a7 14-227a (a). As a result, the trial court found the commissioner\u2019s decision clearly erroneous. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">This case is controlled by our Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>228 Conn. 758, 638 A.2d 601 (1994). In <em>Harrison, </em>our Supreme Court interpreted the term \u201coffense\u201d as used in \u00a7 54-If to include motor vehicle violations. Id., 765. Therefore, in accordance with <em>Harrison, </em>we conclude that the Wethersfield officer had lawfully pursued the plaintiff across town lines, had lawfully stopped the vehicle and had lawfully arrested the plaintiff. Thus, the trial court improperly determined that the commissioner\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b211-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-227b (f) provides that a hearing to determine the suspension of a driver\u2019s license for driving while under the influence of liquor \u201cshall be limited to a determination of the following issues: (1) Did the police officer have probable cause to arrest the person for manslaughter in the second degree with a motor vehicle or for assault in the second degree with a motor vehicle or for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or drug or both or while his ability to operate such motor vehicle was impaired by the consumption of intoxicating liquor; (2) was such person placed under arrest; (3) did such person refuse to submit to such test or analysis or did such person submit to such test or analysis and the results of such test or analysis indicated that at the time of the alleged offense the ratio of alcohol in the blood of such person was ten-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight; and (4) was such person operating the motor vehicle. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b212-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 54-lf (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201cMembers of any local police department . . . when in immediate pursuit of one who may be arrested under the provisions of this section, are authorized to pursue the offender outside of their respective precincts into any part of the state in order to effect the arrest. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-218a (a) provides in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall operate a motor vehicle upon any public highway of the state . . . at a rate of speed greater than is reasonable, having regard to the width, traffic and use of highway, road or parking area, the intersection of streets and weather conditions. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b212-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 14-236 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen any highway has been divided into two or more clearly marked lanes for traffic, (1) a vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practicable entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from such lane until the driver has ascertained that such movement can be made with safety ....
