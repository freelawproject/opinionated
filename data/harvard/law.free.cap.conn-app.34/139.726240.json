The dispositive issue is whether this court\u2019s January 27, 1994 dismissal of the defendant\u2019s amended appeal, which raised the issue of counsel fees, precludes the defendant from addressing this same issue in his brief on the main appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The facts in this case are undisputed. The parties\u2019 marriage was dissolved by the trial court on August 26, 1993. On September 14,1993, the defendant appealed to this court from the judgment of dissolution. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for counsel fees in the trial court. During a hearing held on October 21,1993, the trial court granted the plaintiff\u2019s motion for counsel fees in the amount of $5000.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">On November 15, 1993, the defendant filed an amended appeal to include a challenge to the postjudgment award of counsel fees. On November 22, 1993, the plaintiff moved to dismiss the amended appeal as untimely. Practice Book \u00a7 4006 provides in pertinent part: \u201cShould the trial court, subsequent to the filing of the appeal, make a ruling which the appellant desires to have reviewed by this court, the appellant shall file an amended appeal form in the trial court within twenty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>days from the issuance of notice of the ruling. . . .\u201d In this case, the defendant failed to amend his appeal within the twenty day period. Therefore, this court granted the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the amended appeal on January 27, 1994.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">Despite the dismissal of the amended appeal, the defendant\u2019s brief, filed on February 4,1994, addressed the issue of the trial court\u2019s award of counsel fees to the plaintiff. In response, the plaintiff filed a motion to strike that portion of the defendant\u2019s brief as improper in light of the dismissal of the amended appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 4183 provides in part that this court \u201cmay ... on its own motion or upon motion of any party ... (3) order improper matter stricken from . . . a brief . . . .\u201d Because this court\u2019s dismissal of the untimely amended appeal precluded the defendant from raising the issue of counsel fees, the portion of the defendant\u2019s brief addressing this issue is \u201cimproper matter\u201d that should be stricken from his brief. To hold otherwise would be to allow the defendant to circumvent the order of this court dismissing his untimely amended appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s motion to strike is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
