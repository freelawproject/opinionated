We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The following facts are necessary for a proper resolution of this appeal. In the summer of 1992, an addition to the Laurel Ledge School was being constructed in Beacon Falls. On July 22,1992, the defendant began working at the construction site. On July 23,1992, after complaints from the foreman about the defendant\u2019s work production, Claude Boutote, the superintendent of the construction company, laid off the defendant. Boutote told the defendant that the lay off was due to lack of work. The following morning, the defendant returned to the construction site and walked into Bou<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>tote\u2019s trailer office. The defendant was carrying a clorox bleach container. The defendant said to Boutote, \u201cI\u2019m going to work today.\u201d In response, Boutote said: \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You were laid off yesterday and you just go out and go home.\u201d The defendant then punctured the clorox bleach container. It contained kerosene that the defendant began spreading around the trailer, splashing some on Boutote\u2019s pants while stating \u201cif I can\u2019t work, nobody else will.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After spreading the liquid, the defendant attempted to light a match as Boutote exited the trailer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant then followed Boutote out of the trailer and ran away. Immediately following the defendant\u2019s exit from the trailer, Boutote noticed that the trailer was on fire. The fire was extinguished by some construction workers. The fire caused damage to the trailer and to papers that were in the trailer.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The trial court found the defendant guilty. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">The defendant first claims that the trial court improperly rendered a judgment of conviction because the state failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove a violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1). Specifically, the defendant asserts that the state failed to present evidence to satisfy the requirement that the building was occupied or inhabited or that the defendant had reason to believe that the building may have been occupied or inhabited. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>In determining the sufficiency of the evidence in arson cases, we look to the time that the defendant started the fire to ascertain whether the elements of \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1) were met. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Moye, </em>199 Conn. 389, 399, 507 A.2d 1001 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Parmalee, </em>197 Conn. 158, 162, 496 A.2d 186 (1985). \u201cWhen we are called on to review a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we impose a two part analysis. We first construe the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>226 Conn. 20, 31, 627 A.2d 862 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>32 Conn. App. 193, 200-201, 628 A.2d 996, cert. denied, 227 Conn. 920, 632 A.2d 698 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hooks, </em>30 Conn. App. 232, 238, 619 A.2d 1151, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 915, 623 A.2d 1025 (1993). We next determine whether, from that evidence and all the reasonable inferences that flow from the evidence, a trier of fact could reasonably find that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>State </em>v. <em>Salz, </em>supra [31]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra [200-201].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Reddick, </em>33 Conn. App. 311, 332, 635 A.2d 848 (1993), cert. denied, 228 Conn. 924, 638 A.2d 38 (1994). Here, the trial court had before it evidence that Boutote saw the defendant strike the match as Boutote was departing the trailer, that the defendant exited the trailer immediately after Boutote, and that the trailer was on fire immediately after the defendant ran from it. Thus, even though there was no witness to the match igniting while Boutote was in the trailer, the trial court could reasonably infer from this evidence that the match ignited prior to Boutote\u2019s departure. Therefore, there was sufficient evidence for the trial court to find the defendant guilty of arson in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly excluded evidence thereby violating his constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>tional rights to present a defense, to testify and to assistance of counsel. Specifically, the defendant asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by sustaining the state\u2019s objection to defense counsel\u2019s questions about the defendant\u2019s state of mind when he walked into the trailer on the morning of July 24,1992.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant concedes that he did not properly preserve this claim because he failed to articulate properly the constitutional claims. Practice Book \u00a7 4185. The defendant, however, requests review of this claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>under the doctrine of <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 567 A.2d 823 (1989). We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">\u201cUnder <em>Golding, </em>a defendant can prevail on an unpreserved claim of constitutional error \u2018only if all of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Id., 239-40. The first two conditions are determinations of whether a defendant\u2019s claim will be reviewed, and the third condition involves a review of the claim itself.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crosby, </em>34 Conn. App. 261, 264, 641 A.2d 406 (1994). Here, the defendant cannot satisfy the third condition enunciated under <em>Golding </em>that he was clearly deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">\u201cThere is no rule in this jurisdiction which prevents a witness from testifying to relevant facts within his personal knowledge merely because his testimony may be self-serving. Such an extraordinary rule presumably would disqualify as witnesses most parties in civil suits as well as the defendant in a criminal case. General Statutes \u00a7 52-145 (a) expressly provides that a \u2018person shall not be disqualified as a witness in any action because of, (1) his interest in the outcome of the action as a party or otherwise . . . .\u2019We have repeatedly upheld against constitutional challenge an instruction that the jury in weighing the credibility of an accused\u2019s testimony may consider his interest in the outcome of the case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>198 Conn. 273, 280, 502 A.2d 911 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Frazier, </em>194 Conn. 233, 239, 478 A.2d 1013 (1984); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 366-67, 478 A.2d 581 (1984). This instruction is presupposed by our recognition and acceptance of the fact that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>the testimony of an accused may be self-serving. It is the task of the cross-examiner to discredit a witness by exposing his motive or interest in testifying. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ortiz, </em>198 Conn. 220, 502 A.2d 400 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Milum, </em>197 Conn. 602, 608-609, 500 A.2d 555 (1985). The ultimate issue, credibility, is for the [fact finder], not the court, to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\u201cThe governing principle with respect to this issue is that relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded for some reason of policy. \u2018Evidence is admitted, not because it is shown to be competent, but because it is not shown to be incompetent.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Sharpe, </em>[195 Conn. 651, 659, 491 A.2d 345 (1985)]; <em>State </em>v. <em>Schaffer, </em>168 Conn. 309, 317, 362 A.2d 893 (1975).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>198 Conn. 454, 474-75, 503 A.2d 599 (1986). Here, the defendant\u2019s state of mind was relevant to his guilt under \u00a7 53a-lll (a) (1). <em>State </em>v. <em>Ramsundar, </em>204 Conn. 4, 14, 526 A.2d 1311 (1987). \u201cWe have consistently held that mental condition is a fact, and, where relevant to an issue in the case, the witness concerned may testify directly to it. . . . The defendant\u2019s testimony as to his prior mental condition was not hearsay because it concerned a fact within his own personal knowledge. His testimony with regard to this fact was no more and no less self-serving than his testimony with regard to any other fact. The trial court erred by excluding it on the ground that it was self-serving.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>supra, 475-76.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">The determination that the trial court acted improperly does not necessarily require reversal of the judgment. Id., 476. The defendant claims that the erroneous rulings deprived him of his right to testify under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution as well as his federal due process rights to present a defense and assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-7\">\u201cWith respect to the state constitutional right to testify, we recently stated that <em>State </em>v. <em>King, </em>[187 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>292, 303-304, 445 A.2d 901 (1982)], where that right was mentioned, \u2018did not effect any fundamental change in the law.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>[198 Conn. 273, 280, 502 A.2d 911 (1986)]. We therefore consider the harmfulness of the erroneous rulings under the due process clause. Our inquiry, under the due process clause, is whether the erroneous exclusion of evidence \u2018was so prejudicial to the rights of the defendant as to deprive him of a fair trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruth, </em>181 Conn. 187, 196-97, 435 A.2d 3 (1980). Stated another way, the question is \u201cwhether the claimed erroneous action of the court would have been likely to affect the result.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>McClain, </em>171 Conn. 293, 300, 370 A.2d 928 (1976).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Talton, </em>197 Conn. 280, 289, 497 A.2d 35 (1985).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Silveira, </em>supra, 198 Conn. 476-77. Since the excluded evidence reflected the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time that he walked into the trailer, we must look to determine whether the defendant received a fair trial in light of the evidence admitted at trial that related to that issue. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">At trial, the defendant testified that, at the time that he entered the trailer, his state of mind \u201cwas to go back to work.\u201d Further, the defendant testified that his intent was to ruin the blueprints in the office. Thus, given the totality of the evidence, the defendant was able to furnish the fact finder with sufficient evidence of his intent. \u201cIn light of the additional evidence pertaining to the defendant\u2019s state of mind that was placed before the [fact finder], we do not believe that the erroneous exclusions of evidence deprived the defendant of either his state constitutional right to testify or his federal constitutional right to present an effective defense. Because the erroneous exclusions of evidence do not amount to a constitutional violation, it is the defendant\u2019s burden to show that the errors were harmful.\u201d Id., 479. In this case, the defendant has not met his burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The defendant next claims that the trial court improperly rendered its finding prior to the argument of defense counsel. At the conclusion of all the evidence, prior to closing arguments, the trial court found the defendant guilty of arson in the first degree. Defense counsel, surprised at the finding before argument, stated, \u201cI thought there would be an opportunity for argument.\u201d At that point, the trial court reserved its decision until after argument and stated, \u201cI\u2019ll listen to your argument.\u201d After argument, the trial court rendered a finding of guilty. As the defendant conceded at oral argument, he did not properly preserve this claim by objecting at trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>34 Conn. App. 58, 74, 640 A.2d 610 (1994).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal, the defendant, in his brief, does not request review of the claim understate v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 233. The defendant, however, did request <em>Golding </em>review at oral argument. Even had the defendant properly requested review under <em>Golding, </em>he could not prevail since he cannot satisfy the third requirement that he was clearly deprived of a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">\u201cBoth the Connecticut and the United States constitutions protect a defendant\u2019s right to voice closing arguments before the trier of fact. The sixth amendment guarantee in the federal constitution of the right to assistance of counsel has been held to include the right to present closing arguments. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>422 U.S. 853, 95 S. Ct. 2550, 45 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1975). Also, article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution, which provides that \u2018the accused shall have a right to be heard by himself and by counsel,\u2019 has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"832\">*832</page-number>held to guarantee a right to present a closing argument. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>47 Conn. 518, 534-37 (1880). The defendant enjoys the same right whether the trial is to a jury or to the bench. <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 859-60. If the trial court denies the defendant an opportunity to give closing arguments, the reviewing court should grant a new trial. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>supra, 536; see also <em>Herring </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra [859-60].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Plaskonka, </em>22 Conn. App. 207, 210-11, 577 A.2d 729, cert. denied, 216 Conn. 812, 580 A.2d 65 (1990). In the present case, as in <em>Plaskonka, </em>the defendant was given an opportunity to present a closing argument but claims that the trial court\u2019s announcement of the guilty finding unduly prejudiced him and made the trial unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The <em>Plaskonka </em>court stated that since the trial court announced a finding at the close of the evidence, agreed to listen to the oral argument and reduced the penalty after argument, that the defendant received fair consideration. Id., 212. Here, the trial court announced the finding after the defendant rested and then agreed to listen to oral argument. \u201c[W]e presume that it listened with impartiality, and our review of the record discloses nothing to the contrary.\u201d Id. Contrary to <em>Plaskonka, </em>the trial court here did not change its finding after argument. The fact that the trial court did not change its finding does not, however, dissuade us from concluding that the defendant received a fair trial. The <em>Plaskonka </em>court viewed the reduction in penalty as additional evidence to support its conclusion that the defendant received a fair trial. It would be unreasonable for us to require the trial court to change its decision for us to conclude that the defendant received a fair trial. The fact that the trial court did not announce its finding until after all the evidence was presented and also agreed to listen to oral argument is ample evidence to indicate that the defendant received a fair trial. The defendant requests that we adopt a rule that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"833\">*833</page-number>will result in a finding of a per se constitutional violation under the facts of this case. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b846-6\"> This appeal was taken originally to the Supreme Court.
