J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFox\">Title XIX of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq.; provides that a determination of eligibility for medicaid benefits may be based on \u201conly such income and resources as are . . . available <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>to the applicant . . . -\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In 1990, the plaintiff, Mildred F. Ahem, established and funded a trust. The sole issue in this administrative appeal is whether the principal of that trust is a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff for purposes of determining her eligibility to receive benefits under the medicaid program. We conclude that it is not available to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. The plaintiff, a ninety-two year old woman, has resided at St. Mary Home (home), a nursing facility located in West Hartford, since January, 1990. On October 6, 1990, she established and funded a trust. The trust instrument directs, inter alia, that the trustees<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201cshall pay or apply the net income of the trust estate to or for the benefit of the [plaintiff] during [her] lifetime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">From the time of her admission to the home until November, 1994, to pay for her care, the plaintiff utilized her income as well as assets that had not been transferred to the trust. Those assets, however, were depleted by November, 1994. Thereafter, the income the plaintiff has received from the trust has been applied toward the cost of her care at the home. The plaintiffs other income, which includes social security and pension benefits, also has been used to pay for that care. The cost of her care, however, exceeds the plaintiffs total income. On November 16, 1994, the plaintiff applied to the department of social services (department) for medicaid benefits<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> seeking financial assis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>tance for the cost of her care in excess of her total income.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">In July, 1995, the department determined that under the terms of the trust instrument, not only the net trust income but also the trust principal, which at that time was $637,937, were \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff for purposes of determining her medicaid eligibility. Consequently, the department concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cavailable\u201d resources exceeded the $1600 resource limit for medicaid eligibility set forth in Connecticut\u2019s state medicaid plan; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-264 and 17b-80 (c);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> see also Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual (1993) \u00a7 4005.10 (Uniform Policy Manual); and, on that basis, denied her application.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">The plaintiff then exercised her right to an administrative appeal before a fair hearing officer. See General Statutes \u00a7 17b-66.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The hearing officer also concluded that the plaintiffs \u201cavailable\u201d resources exceeded the $1600 eligibility limit and denied her medicaid application. Thereafter, the plaintiff appealed from the hearing officer\u2019s decision to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-65 and 4-183.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On appeal to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>court, the plaintiff maintained that the hearing officer improperly had included the trust principal in the calculation of her \u201cavailable\u201d resources. The trial court agreed and reversed the fair hearing officer\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The defendant, Joyce Thomas, the commissioner of the department, appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment to the Appellate Court. We transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">On appeal, the defendant maintains that the trial court improperly determined that the plaintiffs \u201cavailable\u201d resources did not exceed the $1600 medicaid eligibility limitation. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-264 and 17b-80 (c); Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 4005.10. Specifically, the defendant claims that, pursuant to the medicaid qualifying trust provisions set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1988),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the entire trust principal is an asset \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff, and that the trust principal, therefore, properly should be included in the calculation of the plaintiffs eligibility for medicaid benefits. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Our analysis begins with an overview of the medicaid program. The program, which was established in 1965 as Title XIX of the Social Security Act and is codified at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 et seq. (medicaid act), is a joint federal-state venture providing financial assistance to persons whose income and resources are inadequate to meet the costs of, among other things, medically necessary nursing facility care. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>477 U.S. 154, 156, 106 S. Ct. 2456, 91 L. Ed. 2d 131 (1986); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 65 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tuchman, </em>242 Conn. 345, 347-48, 699 A.2d 952 (1997); <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>240 Conn. 141, 148, 691 A.2d 586 (1997). The federal government shares the costs of medicaid with those states that elect to participate in the program, and, in return, the states are required to comply with requirements imposed by the medicaid act and by the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 156-57. Specifically, participating states are required to \u201c \u2018develop a plan, approved by the secretary of health and human services, containing reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance\u2019 \u201d to be provided. <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, 148; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>237 Conn. 550, 555, 680 A.2d 113 (1996); see also 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">Connecticut has elected to participate in the medicaid program and has assigned to the department the task of administering the program. General Statutes \u00a7 17b-2;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> see <em>Burinskas </em>v. <em>Dept. of Social Services, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>240 Conn. 148; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 555-56. Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-262 and 17b-10,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the department has developed Connecticut\u2019s state medicaid plan and has promulgated regulations that govern its administration. See Uniform Policy Manual, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">The medicaid act requires that a state\u2019s medicaid plan make \u201cmedical assistance\u201d available to qualified individuals. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10). \u201cThe term \u2018medical assistance\u2019 means payment of part or all of the cost of . . . care and services . . . [including] nursing facility services . . . .\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396d (a); see <em>Catanzano </em>v. <em>Wing, </em>103 F.3d 223, 229 (2d Cir. 1996). Participating states are required to provide coverage to certain groups and are given the option to extend coverage to various other groups. The line between mandatory and optional coverage primarily is drawn in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) (A): mandatory coverage is specified in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (10) (A) (i); and optional coverage is set forth in subsection (a) (10) (A) (ii). In medicaid parlance, individuals who qualify for medicaid benefits pursuant to those subsections are referred to as the \u201ccategorically needy\u201d because, in general, they are eligible for financial assistance under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>Titles IV-A (Aid to Families with Dependent Children)<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> or XVI (Supplemental Security Income for the Aged, Blind, and Disabled)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> of the Social Security Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-6\">Under the medicaid act, states have an additional option of providing medical assistance to the \u201cmedically needy\u201d \u2014 persons who, like the plaintiff, lack the ability to pay for their medical expenses but do not qualify as \u201ccategorically needy\u201d solely because their income exceeds the income eligibility requirements of the applicable categorical assistance program.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 477 U.S. 157-58; <em>Schweikerv. Gray Panthers, </em>453 U.S. 34, 37, 101 S. Ct. 2633, 69 L. Ed. 2d 460 (1981); <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 824, 629 A.2d 379 (1993); <em>Matarazzo </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>225 Conn. 314, 319, 623 A.2d 470 (1993). The \u201cmedically needy\u201d become eligible for medicaid, if the state elects to cover them, by incurring medical expenses in an amount sufficient to reduce their incomes below the income eligibility level set by the state in its medicaid plan. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (in determining eligibility, state must take \u201ccosts . . . incurred for medical care\u201d into account); see also 42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.301. \u201cOnly when they \u2018spend down\u2019 the amount by which their income exceeds that level, are [medically needy persons] in roughly the same position as [categorically needy] persons . . . [because then] any further expenditures for medical expenses . . . would have to come from funds required for basic necessities.\u201d <em>Atkins </em>v. <em>Rivera, </em>supra, 158. Connecticut has chosen to cover the medically needy. <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 824.</p>\n<p id=\"b733-7\">The medicaid act, furthermore, requires participating states to set reasonable standards for assessing an individual\u2019s income and resources in determining eligibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>for, and the extent of, medical assistance under the program. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17); see also <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 824. The resources standard set forth in Connecticut\u2019s state medicaid plan for categorically needy and medically needy individuals is $1600. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-264 and 17b-80 (c); Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 4005.10; see also <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 824. Consequently, a person who has \u201cavailable\u201d resources; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B); in excess of $1600 is not eligible to receive benefits under the Connecticut medicaid program even though the person\u2019s medical expenses cause his or her income to fall below the income eligibility standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">Prior to 1986, however, the \u201cavailability\u201d requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B) provided a loophole by which individuals anticipating the need for expensive long-term nursing facility care could impoverish themselves and qualify for medicaid assistance while preserving their resources for their heirs. An individual could establish an irrevocable trust that permitted, but did not require, the trustee to disburse the income, but not the principal, of the trust to the individual. The trustee would pay the income from the trust to the grantor until the medicaid transfer \u201clook back period\u201d had expired and the grantor\u2019s transfer of assets to the trust, therefore, would no longer affect his eligibility for medicaid benefits. Thereafter, the trustee would exercise his discretion to withhold payments of trust income from the grantor. As a result, neither the trust principal nor the trust income would be resources \u201cavailable\u201d to the grantor within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B), and the grantor would qualify for medicaid assistance. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, pp. 71-72 (1985); see also <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 829.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">Congress, however, tightened the \u201cavailability\u201d loophole provided by \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B) of the medicaid act by enacting the medicaid qualifying trust provisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1988). See H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, pp. 71-72 (1985); see also <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 226 Conn. 829. \u201c[A] \u2018medicaid qualifying trust\u2019 is a trust . . . established (other than by will) by an individual . . . under which the individual may be the <em>beneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust </em>and the distribution of such payments is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the <em>distribution to the </em>individual.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (2) (1988). The amount of a medicaid qualifying trust considered \u201cavailable\u201d to an applicant for purposes of determining eligibility for medicaid benefits \u201cis the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be <em>distributed to the grantor, </em>assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount <em>to the grantor. </em>...\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) (1988); see <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>supra, 825. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), all possible distributions that a medicaid applicant is capable of receiving from a trust (i.e., trust assets that actually are distributed to the grantor and trust assets that could be, but are not, distributed to the grantor) are considered in determining eligibility for medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Before turning our attention to the provisions of the plaintiffs trust instrument that, in the defendant\u2019s view, grant the trustees discretion to distribute trust principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), we note that the analytical framework for construction of federal statutes set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chevron U S. A., Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 843-45, 104 S. Ct. 2778, 81 L. Ed. 2d 694 (1984) <em>(Chevron), </em>is applicable to the medicaid act. See <em>Sullivan </em>v. <em>Everhart, </em>494 U.S. 83, 89, 110 S. Ct. 960, 108 L. Ed. 2d 72 (1990); <em>Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance </em>v. <em>Heckler, </em>471 U.S. 524, 530-31 n.16, 532, 105 S. Ct. 2210, 85 L. Ed. 2d 577 (1985). Under the <em>Chevron </em>analysis, we first must determine \u201cwhether the intent of Congress is clear as to the precise question at issue. ... If, by employing traditional tools of statutory construction . . . we determine that Congress\u2019 intent is clear, that is the end of the matter . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Regions Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>522 U.S. 448, 457, 118 S.

If the agency\u2019s reading fills a gap or <em>defines a term in a reasonable way in light of [Congressional] design, </em>we give that reading controlling weight, even if it is not the answer the court would have reached if the question initially had arisen in a judicial proceeding.\u201d (Citation omitted; emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Regions Hospital </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>supra, 522 U.S. 457; <em>Chevron U.

Deference, moreover, is particularly warranted in cases in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>we are required to interpret the medicaid act, a statutory scheme that \u201cis among the most intricate ever drafted by Congress.\u201d <em>Schweiker </em>v. <em>Gray Panthers, </em>supra, 453 U.S. 43; <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 564. \u201cIn a statutory area as complicated as this one, the administrative authorities are far more able than [the courts] to determine congressional intent in the light of experience in the field.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Giardi, </em>supra, 564; <em>Lukhard </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>481 U.S. 368, 383-84, 107 S.

It does not involve the construction or application of the trust treatment provisions set forth at 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) of the medicaid act. Those provisions were enacted in 1993 in an effort to further tighten the \u201cavailability\u201d loophole of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17).

See State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 3259.2; see also Uniform Policy Manual, supra, \u00a7 4030.80 (C) and (D). Because the medicaid act specifically provides that states may base eligibility determinations <em>only </em>on income and resources that are \u201cavailable\u201d to the applicant within the meaning of the act; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B); and because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>\u00a7 1396p (d) does not apply to the trust at issue in the present case, the regulations and guidelines that implement \u00a7 1396p (d) also are not applicable to the trust at issue in the present case.

The plaintiff argues that the statutory language is clear: in her view, the language \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d must be read to mean only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>distributions of trust assets that may be made directly to the grantor and cannot be read also to mean distributions that may be made to procure a benefit for the grantor. The defendant, however, argues to the contrary that the language \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d in \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) refers not only to payments of trust assets that may be made directly to the grantor but also to payments of trust assets that indirectly benefit the grantor. In our view, the language of \u00a7 1396a (k) does not itself clearly settle the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">The legislative history of \u00a7 1396a (k), moreover, is also inconclusive with respect to congressional intent regarding whether the phrase \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d in \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) was intended to encompass payments of which the grantor is an indirect beneficiary. See H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, p. 72 (1985) (\u201cThe . . . bill provides that for the purposes of determining Medicaid eligibility, the amounts deemed available to a grantor ... is the maximum amount of payments permitted to be distributed ... <em>to the grantor. . . . </em>[W]hat is determinative is the maximum amount that a trustee could . . . distribute <em>to [the] grantor ....'\" </em>[Emphasis added.]); H.R. Rep. No. 99-453, p. 539 (1985) (medicaid qualifying trust is trust \u201cunder which the [grantor] is the <em>beneficiary ... of the payments </em>from the trust\u201d [emphasis added]); H.R. Rep. No. 99-453, p. 539 (1985) (\u201camount deemed available to the beneficiary is the <em>maximum amount of payments </em>that may be permitted under the terms of the trust\u201d [emphasis added]). Although the reference to the grantor as a \u201cbeneficiary . . . of payments\u201d supports a construction of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) that includes payments indirectly benefiting the grantor, because the legislative history of \u00a7 1396a (k) also refers to payments <em>to the grantor, </em>it does not conclusively rule out a construction of \u00a7 1396a (k) as encompassing only payments made directly to the grantor. We conclude, therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>that Congress did not speak precisely, either through the language or legislative history of \u00a7 1396a (k), to the question of whether, in determining the extent to which the assets of a medicaid qualifying trust are \u201cavailable\u201d to a grantor, it intended that \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d encompass not only payments directly to the grantor but also payments of which the grantor is an indirect beneficiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Because Congress has not spoken conclusively on the meaning of the language \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d in \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), we proceed to the second step of the <em>Chevron </em>analytical framework: agency interpretation of \u00a7 1396a (k). Congress has assigned responsibility for administering the eligibility requirements of the medicaid program to the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In particular, Congress has delegated to the secretary the responsibility for prescribing standards for determining an applicant\u2019s \u201cavailable\u201d income and resources. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B). The secretary, in turn, has delegated the responsibility for administration of the medicaid program to the health care financing administration of the Department of Health and Human Services. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1302; <em>Visiting Nurse Assn. of North Shore, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bullen, </em>93 F.3d 997, 999 n.l (1st Cir. 1996), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1114, 117 S. Ct. 955, 136 L. Ed. 2d 842 (1997). Consequently, a determination of whether, and to what extent, a trustee has discretion to distribute trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) is guided by the regulations and interpretive guidelines that have been adopted by that agency. <em>Visiting Nurse Assn. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number><em>of North Shore, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bullen, </em>supra, 1002; <em>Himes </em>v. <em>Shalala, </em>999 F.2d 684, 688-89 (2d Cir. 1993). The task that confronts us is to decide, not whether the agency\u2019s interpretation of the phrase \u201cpayments . . . distributed to the grantor\u201d in \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) represents the best construction of the statute, but whether it represents a reasonable one. See <em>Atlantic Mutual Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue, </em>523 U.S. 382, 389, 118 S. Ct. 1413, 140 L.

See State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 3215 and 3259. Section 3215.1 of the State Medicaid Manual specifically provides that \u201cthe terms of [a medicaid qualifying] trust may be written so that the trustee may make <em>payments directly to the health care provider for medical services. </em>Thus, although payments from the trust are not directly paid to the beneficiary, he is <em>in fact receiving benefits from the payments. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Consequently, \u00a7 3215.1 of the State Medicaid Manual clearly indicates that, in the view of the health care financing administration, in order to constitute a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k), a payment need not be made directly to the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The medicaid act, moreover, generally requires that a \u201cmedically needy\u201d individual\u2019s eligibility for medicaid benefits be determined in accordance with the methodology and financial criteria applicable to the determination of a \u201ccategorically needy\u201d person\u2019s eligibility for benefits under the Supplementary Security Income (SSI) program. 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.401, 435.601, 435.831 and 435.845.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The regulations governing eligibility for SSI benefits provide in relevant part that \u201c[i]ncome is anything you receive in cash or in kind that you can use to meet your needs for food, clothing, and shelter.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">. . . In-kind income is not cash, but is actually food, clothing, or shelter, or something you can use to get one of these.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.1102. Taken together, the relevant regulations governing eligibility for SSI benefits and \u00a7 3215.1 of the State Medicaid Manual therefore indicate that a trustee need not disburse funds directly to a grantor in order for the disbursement to constitute a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1); payments that are made to a third party who then provides equivalent \u201cin kind\u201d income to the grantor \u2014 food, clothing or shelter for the grantor or something that could be used to obtain food, clothing or shelter for the grantor \u2014 also constitute payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">Section 3215.3 of the State Medicaid Manual, moreover, provides that \u201c[t]he amount from the trust that is deemed to be available to the [grantor] is the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>amount that could have been distributed to the [grantor] under the terms of the trust <em>in an applicable budget period,</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>provided the trustee exercised his full discretion under the terms of the trust to distribute the maximum amount to the [grantor]. The maximum distributable amount deemed available includes only amounts <em>which can be but are not distributed </em>from either the income (interest) or principal of the trust. . . . The maximum distributable amount counts as resources. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the State Medicaid Manual directs the states to deem available as a resource any amount that could have been, but was not, distributed during the <em>applicable budgetperiod </em>directly to the grantor, or paid to a third party in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d income to be provided to the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">The health care financing administration\u2019s interpretation of the medicaid qualifying trust provisions of \u00a7 1396a (k) accords with the Congressional purpose of precluding individuals from using discretionary trusts as a mechanism to qualify for medicaid benefits while preserving their assets for their heirs. There is nothing unreasonable about an interpretation of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) that treats trust assets that a trustee could, but does not, distribute either directly or indirectly to a grantor during an applicable benefit period as resources that become \u201cavailable\u201d to the grantor during that period. We conclude, therefore, that in order for trust principal, or a portion thereof, to become a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to a grantor pursuant to \u00a7 1396a (k) (1): (1) the trustee must have authority during an applicable benefit period to disburse trust assets directly to the grantor, or to a third party who provides equivalent \u201cin kind\u201d income <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>to the grantor; and (2) the trustee must decline to exercise that authority.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The defendant maintains that the trust instrument provides the trustees with discretion to make payments of trust principal that, for purposes of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), are payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d and that consequently the entire trust principal properly may be included in the calculation of the plaintiffs eligibility for medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We begin our analysis of the trust instrument by noting that \u201cwe cannot rewrite ... a trust instrument. The expressed intent must control, although this is to be determined from reading the instrument as a whole in the light of the circumstances surrounding the . . . [grantor] when the instrument was executed, including the condition of [her] estate, [her] relations to [her] family and beneficiaries, and their situation and condition. <em>The construing court will put itself as far as possible in the position of the . </em>. . <em>[grantor], in the effort to construe . . .

To support her claim, the defendant relies on the following language in article I of the trust instrument: \u201cUpon the death of the [plaintiff], the [trustees] shall distribute any remaining trust principal to . . . such person or persons . . . upon such conditions and terms, as the [plaintiff] shall direct and appoint by a Will expressly referring to and exercising this power . . . provided, however, that this power shall not be exercisable to any extent for the benefit of the [plaintiff], [her] estate, [her] creditors or the creditors of [her] estate. Any trust principal not effectively so appointed shall be disposed of pursuant to Article II.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">In trusts and estates parlance, the provision of article I on which the defendant relies commonly is referred to as a testamentary power of appointment. The Internal Revenue Code provides that, when a transfer of assets is subject to such a power of appointment, the transfer is an \u201cincomplete\u201d gift and consequently does not subject the transferor to imposition of transfer taxes (i.e., gift taxes) at the time of the transfer. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2501 and 2511; see also 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 25.2511-2 (b).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Instead, even if title to assets has been transferred irrevocably to the trust, the transferred assets still are considered part of the transferor\u2019s gross taxable estate for federal estate tax purposes. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2036 (a) (2). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>Generally, if a grantor reserves a testamentary power of appointment, the transfer of assets to the trust does not become \u201ccomplete\u201d for tax purposes until the death of the transferor and the subsequent distribution of the assets to the remaindermen. At that point, transfer taxes (i.e., estate taxes)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> are levied on the transferor\u2019s gross taxable estate.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Such testamentary powers of appointment commonly are used to preserve trust principal during the lifetime of a grantor and thereby maximize the amount of income the trust provides to the grantor.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Nothing in the language of the trust instrument before us suggests that the testamentary power of appointment contained in article I was intended to serve any purpose other than to forestall the imposition of transfer taxes until after the plaintiffs death. In fact, the trust instrument specifically provides that the power of appointment cannot be exercised by the trustees for the benefit of the plaintiff, her estate, her creditors or the creditors of her estate. That restriction unequivocally demonstrates that the power of appointment was not intended to provide the trustees either with the authority to pay trust principal directly or indirectly to the plaintiff or with discretion to withhold such payments of trust principal.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">The defendant, moreover, does not maintain that the power of appointment provides the trustees with authority or discretion to disburse trust principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>directly or indirectly to the plaintiff during an applicable budget period. Instead, the defendant contends that the power of appointment allows the trustees, on the plaintiffs death, to pay trust principal, not to the plaintiff, but to the remaindermen <em>on behalf of </em>the plaintiff. In the defendant\u2019s view, such a payment to the remain-dermen after the plaintiffs death constitutes a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d under \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) because it indirectly benefits the plaintiff by furthering her estate planning objectives. The defendant apparently asks us to import into \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) the provisions of \u00a7 1396p (d) regarding the existence of \u201cany circumstances\u201d under which payments may be made \u201con behalf of\u201d the grantor.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> This we cannot do. In order for a trustee to have discretion to make a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), the trust instrument must provide the trustee with authority to disburse trust funds during an applicable budget period either directly to the grantor or to a third party in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d income to be provided to the grantor, and the trust instrument must also provide the trustee with discretion to withhold such payments of trust principal. Because any disbursement of trust principal to third party remaindermen pursuant to the power of appointment contained in article I of the trust instrument would not take place in an applicable budget period and would not be made in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d income to be provided to the plaintiff by the remaindermen, such a disbursement cannot constitute a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">Furthermore, if, at the time of her death, the plaintiff has not exercised her power of appointment, article II <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>of the trust instrument directs the trustees to distribute the trust principal to certain named remaindermen. The defendant does not claim that such payment to the designated remaindermen constitutes a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), perhaps because if such disbursements were to constitute payments \u201cto the grantor,\u201d the entire principal of every medicaid qualifying trust would constitute a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the grantor, effectively eliminating the concept of medicaid qualifying trusts altogether. The fact that, subsequent to the enactment of the medicaid qualifying trust provisions of \u00a7 1396a (k), Congress enacted the transfer provisions of \u00a7 1396p (d) of the medicaid act to restrict further the use of trusts as vehicles for qualifying for medicaid benefits while preserving assets for a grantor\u2019s heirs is indisputable evidence that distributions of trust principal to remaindermen after the grantor\u2019s death do not constitute payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). We can discern no reason to distinguish a payment of trust principal that is made upon a grant- or\u2019s death to remaindermen identified in the trust instrument itself and a payment of trust principal that is made upon a grantor\u2019s death to remaindermen identified in the grantor\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the testamentary power of appointment contained in article I of the trust instrument does not provide the trustees with either authority or discretion to distribute trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Consequently, article I of the trust instrument does not provide a basis for treating the trust principal as a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff for purposes of determining her eligibility for medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">The defendant next claims that article VI (B) of the trust instrument provides the trustees discretion to distribute trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the mean<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ing of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Article VI (B) provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]f any income tax or taxes shall be levied, assessed or imposed on the [plaintiff] as a result of any sale by the [trustees] of any principal asset of the trust . . . the [trustees] <em>shall </em>pay to the [plaintiff], out of the trust, such cash sum or sums as [she] shall request in writing for the purpose of paying such tax or taxes ....

The \u201cgrantor trust\u201d provisions of the Internal Revenue Code are found at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 671 through 678. Those provisions enumerate circumstances in which the general rule that a trust is taxed as a separate entity is not followed on the theory that to apply the rule would improperly permit the grantor to escape tax on income that rightfully should be taxed to him. See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 1.671-2 (a) and (d) and 1.671-3 (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">Under the grantor trust provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, a grantor may be liable for income tax not only on the ordinary income of a grantor trust; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 <em>677;</em><footnotemark><em>26</em></footnotemark><em> </em>see also 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.671-3 (b) (1) (ordinary trust income included in grantor\u2019s taxable income by reason of grantor\u2019s interest in such income); but also on capital gains realized by the trust.

In particular, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 674 (a)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code provides that \u201c[t]he grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus <em>... is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) See 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1-674 (a)-l. Thus, pursuant to \u00a7 674 (a), a grantor who retains a power of appointment over trust principal generally is treated as the owner of that principal, and any taxable gain realized by the trust generally is included in the grantor\u2019s taxable income. Section 674 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code, however, further provides in relevant part that \u00a7 674 (a) <em>\u201cshall not apply to .. . [a] power exercisable only by will, </em>other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Because, in the present case, article I of the trust instrument directs the trustees to distribute the net trust income to the plaintiff, the trust is a \u201cgrantor trust\u201d; see 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 677; 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.671-3 (a) (1); and consequently, the trust\u2019s income is subject to taxation pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 671 through 678 of the Internal Revenue Code. Apparently addressing the fact that there are circumstances under which capital gains realized by a grantor trust are included in the grantor\u2019s taxable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>income, article VI (B) of the trust instrument <em>requires </em>that the trustees pay trust principal to the plaintiff to the extent necessary to permit her to satisfy any income tax liability that has accrued to her by virtue of the trust\u2019s realization of capital gains.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">The defendant did not raise the issue of the effect of article VI (B) on the plaintiffs eligibility for medicaid benefits before the fair hearing officer or before the trial court. Nevertheless, the defendant now apparently contends that pursuant to \u00a7 674 (a) of the Internal Revenue Code, capital gains realized by the trust are includable in the plaintiffs taxable income and that, as a result, trust principal is available for distribution to the plaintiff. There is nothing in the record before us, however, to indicate that the trust in fact has realized a capital gain that caused the plaintiff to incur income tax liability during an \u201capplicable budget period.\u201d See State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 3215.3. Moreover, the power of appointment that the plaintiff reserved in article I of the trust instrument only provides her with authority to appoint trust beneficiaries in her will. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the exemption set forth in \u00a7 674 (b) of the Internal Revenue Code for a reservation of a power of appointment by will is not applicable to the trust. Consequently, the record before us does not permit a conclusion that, if the trust were to incur capital gains, the plaintiff would be treated as the owner of trust principal pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 674 (a) for purposes of taxation of the capital gains. Thus, the record also does not permit a conclusion that article VI (B) is capable of providing the trustees either with authority to pay existing trust principal during <em>any applicable budget period </em>whatsoever or with discretion to withhold such payment. Consequently, the record before us also does not permit a conclusion that article VI (B) provides the trustees with authority to pay trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>(k) (1). Article VI (B) of the trust instrument, therefore, does not provide a basis for treating any portion of the trust principal as a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff for purposes of determining her eligibility for medicaid benefits.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that articles VI (A) and VII of the trust agreement provide the trustees with authority to disburse trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Article VI (A) provides in relevant part that \u201call estate, inheritance, transfer, succession, legacy and other similar taxes . . . which shall become payable upon or with respect to . . . property comprising a part of the trust estate . . . and required to be included in the [plaintiffs] taxable estate . . . shall be paid out of the principal of the trust estate ....

This provision shall not give either the [plaintiff] or [her] estate any light or authority over trust property. . . . <em>The [trustees] shall not satisfy any obligation of the [plaintiffs] estate with any property which is exempt from federal or state death taxes.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">We begin with the provision of article VI (A) that directs the trustees to pay \u201call estate, inheritance, transfer, succession, legacy and other similar taxes . . . which shall become payable upon or with respect to . . . property comprising a part of the trust estate . . . .\u201d The defendant maintains that the authorization to pay such \u201cdeath\u201d taxes provides the trustees with discretion to pay trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Payment of such taxes, however, would not be made directly to the plaintiff or to a third party in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d benefits to be provided to the plaintiff.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Nor could such payment possibly take place in an \u201capplicable budget period.\u201d Furthermore, the trust instrument does not provide the trustees with discretion to withhold such payments. Consequently, payment of such taxes is not capable of constituting a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-8\">u</p>\n<p id=\"b755-9\">We next consider the provisions of article VI (A) regarding payment of the estate taxes, funeral expenses and administration expenses of the plaintiffs estate and payment of any preresiduary cash legacies given by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>plaintiffs will. Any such payments similarly would not be made in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d income to be provided to the plaintiff by the recipient of the payment. Moreover, because the plaintiffs death is a condition precedent to the trustees having authority to disburse funds pursuant to these provisions of the trust instrument, such disbursements cannot be made during any \u201capplicable budget period.\u201d Furthermore, the trust instrument also does not provide the trustees with discretion to withhold such payments. Consequently, any amount the trustee might be capable of disbursing pursuant to these provisions of the trust instrument also is not capable of constituting apayment \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">The provision of article VII (F) that authorizes the trustees to use trust principal to purchase property from, and make loans to, the plaintiff\u2019s estate similarly does not permit the trustees to disburse principal either directly to the plaintiff or to a third party in exchange for \u201cin kind\u201d benefits to be provided to the plaintiff. Such transactions would benefit the plaintiffs estate, not the plaintiff, and would take place after the plaintiffs death. Consequently, this provision also does not permit the trustees to disburse trust principal to the plaintiff within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">We turn our attention now to the provisions of articles VI (A) and VII that authorize the trustees to pay the debts of the plaintiffs estate, to guarantee the obligations of the plaintiffs estate and to pledge trust property as security for those obligations. The defendant maintains that those provisions provide the trustees with discretion to disburse the entire trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Specifically, disregarding the fact that such payments only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>may be made after the plaintiffs death and the fact that <em>suchpayments are required rather than discretionary, </em>the defendant claims that these provisions of the trust instrument permit trust principal to be applied to satisfy obligations, such as credit card debt, incurred by the plaintiff during her lifetime.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The defendant impliedly argues that because after-death payments of trust principal could be used to provide the plaintiff \u201cin kind\u201d income during her lifetime, such payments constitute payments of trust principal during an \u201capplicable budget period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Even if we assume, without deciding, however, that such after-death payments constitute payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d within an applicable budget period, this provision of the trust instrument still would not provide a basis for concluding that the entire trust principal is \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff. Articles VI (A) and VII of the trust instrument only permit the trustees to make such after-death payments with trust assets not subject to federal estate tax. Thus, in order to ascertain the extent to which trust principal possibly could be paid \u201cto the grantor\u201d under these provisions, we must determine the amount of trust principal that is subject to federal estate tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">The federal estate tax generally is calculated using a three-step methodology: (1) a tentative estate tax is determined by applying the tax rate schedule set forth at 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2001 (c) to the sum of a decedent\u2019s total lifetime taxable gifts and testamentary transfers; (2) the total gift tax already paid by the decedent on taxable lifetime gifts then is subtracted from the tentative estate tax; and (3) the decedent\u2019s actual estate tax is calculated by then subtracting the lifetime transfer tax credit allowable for the year of the decedent\u2019s death. See 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2001 and 2010; see generally J. Price, Contemporary Estate Planning (1992) \u00a7 2.3. Thus, the effect of the lifetime transfer tax credit is to exempt from federal estate tax a cumulative total of a decedent\u2019s lifetime gifts and testamentary transfers, and the total amount so exempted is dependent upon the year of the decedent\u2019s death. For the years 1998, 1999 and 2000, the federal estate exemptions are $625,000, $650,000 and $675,000, respectively. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">The defendant did not raise before the fair hearing officer or before the trial court the issue of the effect of the provisions of the trust instrument that address payment of the obligations of the plaintiffs estate, and the record before us does not permit a determination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>as to what extent the plaintiff already has made taxable gifts that will fall within her lifetime federal estate tax exemption. Because it is not now possible to determine either what the value of the trust principal will be at the time of the plaintiffs death or to what extent such principal will be exempt from federal estate taxation, we also cannot determine the amount of trust principal, if any, that will become payable under these provisions of the trust instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The medicaid act specifically provides, however, that in determining eligibility for medicaid benefits, states may consider <em>only </em>income and resources that are available to the applicant. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B); see also H.R. Rep. No. 99-453, p. 538 (1985) (\u201c[u]nder [\u00a7 1396a (a) (17)], only income and resources actually available to an individual are considered in determining eligibility\u201d); H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, p. 73 (1985) (\u00a7 1396a [k] does not permit states to \u201c[deem] available to a beneficiary assets that have been irrevocably placed in trust and over which the trustee can exercise no discretion whatsoever\u201d). Thus, even if after-death payment of the obligations of the plaintiffs estate were somehow to constitute, as the defendant maintains, payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d during an applicable budget period, the provisions of the trust instrument that direct the trustees to make such payments would not provide a basis for concluding that the entire trust principal is a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">Furthermore, if the plaintiff actually were to incur debts while receiving medicaid benefits, any benefit she received in exchange for such debt would be treated as income and she would be required to apply that income to her medical expenses, thereby lessening the amount of medicaid assistance she would receive from the medicaid program. More important, Connecticut\u2019s state medicaid plan provides that \u201c[u]pon the death of . . . any person who has at any time been a beneficiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>of [medical assistance], the state shall have a claim against such . . . person\u2019s estate for ah amounts paid on behalf of . . . such person .... Such claims shall have priority over all unsecured claims against such estate,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> except (1) expenses of last sickness not to exceed three hundred seventy-five dollars, (2) funeral and burial expenses in accordance with section 17b-84 and (3) administrative expenses . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 17b-95. Section 17b-95, therefore, requires that the plaintiffs medicaid debt be satisfied prior to the payment of other personal debts, such as credit card debts, that she incurs. Thus, even if we assume, without deciding, that the provisions of the trust instrument that permit trust funds to be used to meet the obligations of the plaintiffs estate are capable of making trust principal \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k), \u00a7 17b-95 restricts the portion of principal that is \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff pursuant to those provisions to only those funds that remain after the plaintiffs medicaid debt has been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Finally, we note that if the trust provisions permitting the payment of trust principal to satisfy the obligations of the plaintiffs estate had been omitted from the trust instrument altogether, no portion of the trust principal would have been capable of becoming available on her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>death to satisfy her medicaid debt. Consequently, construing these provisions as providing the trustees with authority to pay the entire trust principal to the plaintiff within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) would have the effect of discouraging grantors from including such provisions in trust instruments, thereby increasing, rather than decreasing, total medicaid expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the provisions of the trust instrument that address the obligations of the plaintiffs estate do not provide the trustees with either authority or discretion to make payments \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1). Consequently such provisions do not provide a basis for including trust principal in the calculation of the plaintiffs eligibility for medicaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">Because the trust instrument does not provide the trustees with authority or discretion to distribute trust principal \u201cto the grantor\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1396a (k) (1), the principal of the trust is not a resource \u201cavailable\u201d to the plaintiff and it therefore cannot be included in the calculation of her eligibility for medicaid benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-9\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT, KATZ, PALMER and MCDONALD, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b728-8\"> 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (a) (17) (B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b728-9\"> The trust instrument names as trustees the plaintiffs daughter, Carol Ahern, and Connecticut National Bank, now Fleet Bank.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b728-10\"> The plaintiffs application for medicaid benefits was filed more than forty-eight months after she established the trust.

The plaintiff, Mildred F. Ahem, established a trust in 1993 for the obvious purpose of insulating her principal assets \u2014 which exceed $600,000 \u2014 in order to render herself eligible for benefits under the Title XIX Medicaid Program (medicaid), a government program designed to allocate scarce funds among the poor. <em>Harris </em>v. <em>McRae, </em>448 U.S. 297, 301, 100 S. Ct. 2671, 65 L. Ed. 2d 784 (1980) (\u201c[t]he medicaid program was created in 1965 . . . for the purpose of providing federal financial assistance to States that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>choose to reimburse certain costs of medical treatment for needy persons\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">As it exists in Connecticut, medicaid accords certain benefits to indigents with assets of $1600 or less. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17b-264 and 17b-80 (c). So, for example, in order to become eligible, a person with $1700 must \u201cspend down\u201d $100 so that his or her assets do not exceed this limit. The majority\u2019s unusual decision today allows the plaintiff to reap the benefits of medicaid while retaining control over principal assets of more than $637,937. Congress never intended such a result. Indeed, when confronted by the specter of affluent persons exploiting medicaid so that they could insulate their wealth and live off the public fisc, members of Congress have expressed their outrage in no uncertain terms. \u201cThe Committee feels compelled to state the obvious. Medicaid is, and always has been, a program to provide basic health coverage to people who do not have sufficient income or resources to provide for themselves. <em>When affluent individuals use Medicaid qualifying trusts and similar \u2018techniques\u2019 to qualify for the program, they are diverting scarce Federal and State resources from low-income elderly and disabled, individuals, and poor women and children. This is unacceptable to the Committee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) H.R. Rep. No. 99-265, pt. 1, p. 72 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">In 1988, such abuses prompted Congress to enact legislation that provides that the assets of certain trusts are to be considered available to the grantors in determining eligibility for medicaid even if they were not distributed to the grantor/beneficiaxies themselves. Congress has labeled these trusts \u201cmedicaid qualifying trusts\u201d (qualifying trusts). \u201c[A] \u2018medicaid qualifying trust\u2019 is a trust or similar legal device, <em>established . . . by an individual . . . under which the individual may be the beneficiary </em>of all or part of the payments from the trust and the distribution of such payments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>is determined by one or more trustees who are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the distribution to the individual.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (2) (1988). The portion of principal and income from a qualifying trust considered \u201cavailable\u201d to an applicant \u201cis the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming <em>the full exercise of discretion </em>by the trustee or trustees for the distribution <em>of the maximum amount </em>to the grantor. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) (1988). The United States Department of Health and Human Resources, when interpreting these sections, defined \u201cavailability\u201d as \u201cthe maximum amount that could have been distributed to the beneficiary under the terms of the trust in an applicable budget period . . . .\u201d Department of Health and Human Services, Health Care Financing Administration, State Medicaid Manual (January-May, 1998) \u00a7 3215.3 (State Medicaid Manual).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Thus, the 1988 federal legislation and corresponding federal administrative policy and procedure manual did not explicate precisely the test for \u201cavailability.\u201d As a result, in 1993, Congress amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p, providing that the test for availability is whether \u201cthere are <em>any circumstances </em>under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) (3) (B) (i) (1993 amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">The majority concludes that the 1988 qualifying trusts legislation, which was in effect when the plaintiff created the trust at issue, provided that the test for availability should be based on the maximum amount that could have been distributed <em>under the actual circumstances </em>of the applicable budget period. Based upon that assumption, the majority holds that the principal of the trust is not available to the plaintiff. The majority\u2019s predicate assumption is absolutely incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>The majority justifies its conclusion that the test for availability is the maximum amount that could have been distributed under the actual circumstances rather than under any circumstances is based upon provisions of the State Medicaid Manual implementing the 1993 amendments and thereby providing for a test under any circumstances. It is correct that the state and federal administrative policy and procedure manuals interpreting the 1993 amendments to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p explicitly set forth a test for availability that considers potential disbursements under any circumstances for trusts that were established on or after August 11, 1993, the effective date of the 1993 amendment. State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 3259.2; Department of Social Services, Uniform Policy Manual (1993) \u00a7 4030.80 (C) and (D). The majority, however, cites no evidence that Congress intended to change, not merely clarify,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the law when it enacted the 1993 amendment or that the language of the federal or state administrative manuals indicates that trusts established before August 11,1993, should be tested under a different standard than trusts established after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In fact, just the opposite is true; the federal government\u2019s State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 3259.2, interpreting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396p (d) as amended by the 1993 amendment, provides: \u201cFor the period prior to [August 11, 1993], you may use any reasonable interpretations of the statute in dealing with trusts. ...\u201d Moreover, the legislative history of the 1993 amendment does not indicate that it was intended to change the present law. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts agrees that the 1993 amendment sheds no light on the prior intentions of Congress when interpreting a trust established based on pre-August 11, 1993 statutes. <em>Cohen </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>Commissioner <em>of Medical Assistance, </em>423 Mass. 399, 407, 668 N.E.2d 769 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Consequently, we must look to the language of the statute in effect prior to the 1993 amendment, without the benefit of any legislative history, in order to determine whether the 1993 amendment was intended to change or clarify the law. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) (1988) (portion of trust principal and income considered \u201cavailable\u201d to applicant \u201cis the maximum amount of payments that may be permitted under the terms of the trust to be distributed to the grantor, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or trustees for the distribution of the maximum amount to the grantor\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Second, we must read \u00a7 1396a (k) in light of the federal government\u2019s post-August 11,1993 administrative mandate that we \u201cuse any reasonable interpretations of the statute in dealing with\u201d the plaintiffs trust in order to determine the appropriate test for availability. State Medicaid Manual, supra, \u00a7 3259.2. Third, we also must examine \u00a7 3215.3 of the State Medicaid Manual, the section in effect when the plaintiff established the trust at issue. Id., \u00a7 3215.3 (defining availability as \u201cthe maximum amount that could have been distributed to the beneficiary under the terms of the trust in an applicable budget period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">I conclude that the availability test includes possible distributions <em>under any circumstances. </em>The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts came to the same conclusion when it held that \u201c[t]he [pre-1993 amendment] is most naturally read to measure the maximum amount (principal or income) to be deemed available to the grantor, asking what is the greatest amount the trustees <em>in any circumstances </em>have discretion to disburse.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Cohen </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Medical </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number><em>Assistance, </em>supra, 423 Mass. 411. More specifically, an asset should be deemed to be available if the payment of which provides the grantor an indirect benefit during an applicable budget period. To conclude otherwise would allow a medicaid recipient to take advantage of or be benefited indirectly by cash, credit or in kind income in an applicable budget period. The majority\u2019s interpretation to the contrary is not merited by the language of the statute or the medicaid manuals, nor does it result in a workable or fair test.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The correct test is whether the settlor has insulated principal over which the trustee has discretion to distribute under any circumstances; if that is so, the settlor has created a qualifying trust and its principal assets should be included as available income when determining medicaid eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">Accordingly, we must determine whether any or all of the principal of the trust established by the plaintiff is available to the plaintiff under any circumstances. I conclude, based upon any one of the following four provisions of the trust and our common law, that the entire principal is available to her. First, article I of the trust provides that \u201c[u]pon the death of the [plaintiff], the [trustees] shall distribute any remaining trust principal to . . . such person or persons . . . upon such conditions and terms, as the [plaintiff] shall direct and appoint by a Will expressly referring to and exercising this power . . . .\u201d By keeping a general power of appointment over the distribution of the principal the plaintiff potentially benefits during her life in a variety of ways.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For example, by virtue of retaining this power, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>the plaintiffs creditors can avail themselves of the trust principal, and, therefore, the state may consider it to be an asset in calculating the plaintiffs available funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">This reading of the trust comports with our general law of trusts. When the grantor of a trust reserves the income for himself and retains the power to designate in his will the beneficiary of the corpus, as in the present case, the trust principal can be reached by creditors, regardless of whether it was the intention of the grantor to defraud creditors. 1 Restatement (Second), Trusts \u00a7 156, comment (c) (1959) (\u201c[i]f the settlor reserves for his own benefit not only a life interest but also a general power to appoint the remainder by deed or will or by deed alone or by will alone, his creditors can reach the principal of the trust as well as the income\u201d). This has been our established law; see <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>129 Conn. 211, 219, 27 A.2d 166 (1942); which this court set forth as early as 1851. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank, </em>21 Conn. 148, 159 (1851). Furthermore, this construction on the availability of the principal of the trust should come as no surprise to the plaintiff. In a well reasoned Superior Court decision, Judge Satter, applying \u00a7 156 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts under Maryland law, came to the same conclusion that the principal assets of a similar trust had to be considered when determining eligibility for medicaid. <em>Cantor </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>v. <em>Dept. of Income Maintenance, </em>40 Conn. Sup. 554, 558-59, 531 A.2d 608 (1985), affd, 12 Conn. App. 435, 531 A.2d 606 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Second, the income tax provision in article VI (B) of the trust requires the trustee to pay to the plaintiff \u201cany income tax or taxes . . . levied, assessed or imposed on the [plaintiff] as a result of any sale by the [trustees] of any principal asset of the trust . . . .\u201d Accordingly, if the trust realizes a capital gain, the amount the trustee would pay to the plaintiff pursuant to this provision would entail a payment \u201cto the grantor\u201d pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a (k) (1) (1988). Therefore, the largest amount that the trustee possibly could be required to pay to the plaintiff in order to cover such taxes is available to the plaintiff.* ****<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s argument that no principal is available to the plaintiff pursuant to article VI (B) because there is no evidence that there was a capital gain in an \u201capplicable budget period\u201d applies the wrong test for \u201cavailability.\u201d In addition, the majority\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff is not considered to be the owner of the entire principal under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 674 (1994) (capital gains taxes),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> therefore the principal is not available, does not refute the fact that payment by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>the trastee to the plaintiff, if there was a capital gain, would still be a direct distribution to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Such an ability places the trust squarely within \u00a7 156, comment (e), of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts, which provides that, \u201c[w]here by the terms of the trust a trustee is to pay the settlor or apply for his benefit as much of the income or principal as the trustee may in his discretion determine, his transferee or creditors can reach the maximum amount which that trustee could pay to him or apply for his benefit.\u201d This comment would still be applicable even if the settlor did not retain a general power of appointment over the principal. Accordingly, because the plaintiffs creditors could reach the entire principal pursuant to article VI (B) of the trust, it is available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Third, the death tax provision in article VI (A) of the trust allows the trustee to pay out of the trust principal if the plaintiffs assets are insufficient to cover her \u201cdebts, funeral or administrative expenses\u201d and any \u201ccash legacies given by\u201d the plaintiff in her will. (Emphasis added.) It further provides that any amounts paid under this article shall be paid only out of assets that are subject to the federal estate tax on the plaintiffs estate. The fact that the trustee has the authority to pay the plaintiffs debts, regardless of when they were accrued, and cash legacies given in her will, is sufficient to support the state\u2019s determination that the principal is available when determining medicaid eligibility. Accordingly, the entire principal would be considered to be available to the plaintiff because it is not determinable exactly how much of the principal (1) will be subject to the federal estate tax on the plaintiffs estate and (2) will be paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>to satisfy the plaintiffs inter vivos debts. Furthermore, although the actual payments from the trust principal will occur after the plaintiffs death, such distributions fall within the definition of an indirect distribution \u201cto the grantor\u201d because the plaintiff can receive an inter vivos benefit.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Once again, the principal is reachable by creditors based on article VI (A) of the trust, and, therefore, should be considered available to the plaintiff. See Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Fourth and finally, article VII (F) of the trust provides: \u201cUpon the death of the [plaintiff], the [trustees] may . . . make loans to the [plaintiffs] estate, guarantee the obligations of the [plaintiffs] estate and pledge trust property as security therefor . . . .\u201d Again, these activities can only utilize principal that is subject to federal, estate or death taxes. Article VII creates discretionary powers in the trustee that are similar to the powers created by article VI in that they enable the plaintiff to benefit during her life based on the trustees\u2019 powers to distribute trust principal to her estate after her death. As a result, article VII makes the trust principal available to the plaintiff during her life based on the reasons detailed previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">In sum, these provisions confer discretion upon the trustee or require the trustee to distribute principal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>thereby allowing for, at the very least, indirect payments or benefits to the plaintiff during her life, making the principal available to her pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396 (k) (1) (1988). In other words, each of these possible circumstances satisfies the availability test for the principal of the plaintiffs trust. Consequently, the principal of the trust is available to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">This reading comports with our public policy that we will not allow the device of the trust to be used in order to insulate the assets of a person. <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>supra, 129 Conn. 219. In <em>Greenwich Trust Co., </em>we made clear that \u201c[t]he attempt of a man to place his property in trust for his own benefit under limitations similar to those which characterize a spendthrift trust is a departure from the underlying basis for the creation of such trusts. That aside, the public policy which sustains such trusts when created for the benefit of another is, where the settlor is himself the beneficiary, overborne by other considerations. In <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bank, </em>[supra, 21 Conn. 159], where we were considering the right of the creditor of a beneficiary of a trust to secure satisfaction from the latter\u2019s right to the income, we stated: \u2018It is the policy of our law, that <em>all </em>the property of a debtor should be responsible for his debts. And his equitable estate may be taken, as well as his legal, provided it is subject to his controul\u2019; and, subject to definite limitations, that has always been the policy of our law. <em>D\u2019Addario </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>128 Conn. 506, 509, 24 Atl. (2d) 245 [1941]. To admit the validity of such trasts would open too wide an opportunity for a man to evade his just debts to be permissible unless sanctioned by statutory enactment. This is the reason why the overwhelming weight of authority holds ineffective attempts to establish them.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Greenwich Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Tyson, </em>supra, 219. The control of the plaintiff in this case is underscored by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>her right to designate who will obtain the principal upon her death.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The majority of the court allows a wealthy plaintiff\u2014 with assets in excess of $600,000 \u2014 to take advantage of a program established to care for the medical needs of the poor. In the process, this court ignores our recent case in which we recognized \u201cthe legislative concern that the medicaid program not be used as an estate planning tool. The medicaid program would be at fiscal risk if individuals were permitted to preserve assets for their heirs while receiving medicaid benefits from the state. Congress enacted the qualifying trust provision as an addition to the \u2018provisions designed to assure that individuals receiving nursing home and other long-term care services under Medicaid are in fact poor and have not transferred assets that should be used to purchase the needed services before Medicaid benefits are made available.\u2019 H. Rep. No. 99-265, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 71 (1985).\u201d <em>Forsyth </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>226 Conn. 818, 828-29, 629 A.2d 379 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The plaintiffs trust, with the approval of the majority, allows for a form of inverse Robin Hoodism \u2014 robbing from the poor to give to the rich. Because I believe that the construction that the majority places on the trust is unjust and contrary to both our well established law and the United States Code, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b764-7\"> According to the general rules of statutory construction, a clarification of a statute by the legislature is effective retroactively. <em>Toise </em>v. <em>Rowe, </em>243 Conn. 623, 628, 707 A.2d 25 (1998); see, e.g., <em>Lawrence </em>v. <em>Shaw, </em>300 U.S. 245, 249, 57 S.

Ed. 623 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b765-8\"> I agree with the majority that \u201cto the grantor\u201d encompasses distributions made directly to the grantor and those made indirectly for her benefit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b766-7\"> Indeed, the majority is unable to cite to authority from any other jurisdiction to support its novel interpretation that a qualifying trust created in this time period must be measured by the \u201cactual circumstances\u201d rather than \u201cany circumstances.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b766-8\"> This is true despite the fact that article I further provides: \u201c[T]his power [of appointment] shall not be exercisable to any extent for the benefit of the [plaintiff], [her] estate, [her] creditors or the creditors of [her] estate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>...\u201d Such language has no effect because the power to appoint in and of itself is a benefit to the plaintiff. Notwithstanding the majority\u2019s argument to the contrary in footnote 31 of its opinion, \u00a7 11.4 of the Restatement (Second) of Property, regarding general and nongeneral powers of appointment, does not control the tmst in the present case for it refers to trusts created by settlors who are not beneficiaries. Furthermore, the Restatement (Second) of Property was published after the Restatement (Second) of Trusts; \u00a7 156 of the Restatement (Second) of Trusts instead refers to \u00a7 328 of the first Restatement of Property, which states a rule of law that is analogous to \u00a7 156. Lastly, even if General Statutes \u00a7 12-345b could be construed so as to support the majority opinion, which it does not, the statute explicitly limits its definition of \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-345b through 12-345f, which relate to taxation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b768-7\"> Unless this amount is somehow discemable in a hypothetical context, it is fair for the defendant to deem available the entire principal. The majority amazingly reached the opposite conclusion when it found that an amount that determines how much of the principal could be deemed to be available is not determinable at present. For example, the majority concludes that because the amount of trust principal that will be subject to federal estate tax is presently unknown, none of the trust principal should be considered available to the plaintiff. See the subsequent discussion in this dissent regarding articles VI and VII of the trust. Such a reading unjustifiably favors the grantor, who is trying to take advantage of a government program designed to help the needy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b768-12\"> Title 26 of the United States Code, \u00a7 674 (1994), which is a part of the Internal Revenue Code, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) General rule</p>\n<p id=\"b768-13\">\u201cThe grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the income therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor</p>\n<p id=\"Ay_\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>\u201c(b) Exceptions for certain powers</p>\n<p id=\"AZH\">\u201cSubsection (a) shall not apply to . . .</p>\n<p id=\"APZ\">\u201c(3) ... A power exercisable only by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b770-8\"> This is true despite the fact that General Statutes \u00a7 17b-95 creates a claim in the state for all medicaid payments that the state has paid for the individual. General Statutes \u00a7 17b-95 (\u201c[U]pon the death of any person who has at any time been a beneficiary of [medical assistance] . . . the state shall have a claim against such . . . person\u2019s estate for all amounts paid on behalf of . . . such person .... Such claims shall have priority over all unsecured claims against such estate, except (1) expenses of last sickness not to exceed three hundred seventy-five dollars, (2) funeral and burial expenses in accordance with section 17b-84, and (3) administrative expenses . . . .\u201d). Under the statute, this claim has priority over general creditors. Even if the plaintiffs estate reimbursed the state in part or in full from the trust principal, however, that does not vitiate the fact that the plaintiff could have received inter vivos indirect disbursements or payments in kind based on the trust principal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
