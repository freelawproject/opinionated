Although the constitutional challenges to the validity of the statute are grounded in both the contracts clause* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the due process clause of the United States constitution,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> resolution of these challenges turns on one critical issue. That issue is whether, in its initial enactment of the legislation establishing the second injury fund, the legislature entered into a contract with employees, employers and insurers in this state. We conclude that the presence of such a contractual relationship has not been established under the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">The parties submitted a stipulation of facts. The claimant, Joseph Cece, became entitled to workers\u2019 compensation because of an injury to his neck caused by a fall that occurred on January 16,1992, in the course of his employment by the named respondent, Felix <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>Industries, Inc. (employer). Cece\u2019s injury allegedly was exacerbated by a preexisting multi-level degenerative condition.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cece\u2019s employer and the employer\u2019s insurer, CNA Insurance Company (insurer), accepted liability for the injury and entered into a voluntary agreement to pay specified benefits to Cece. Their agreement was approved by the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner on April 27, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Relying on Cece\u2019s preexisting medical condition, the respondents, the employer and the insurer, sought to transfer to the second injury fund, also a respondent, liability for partial payment of Cece\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation benefits. On February 15, 1993, in accordance with the terms of \u00a7 31-349<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> then in effect, the respondents gave proper notice to the second injury fund of the claim to transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">In 1995, the legislature revised \u00a7 31-349 to preclude the transfer to the second injury fund of any claims for new work-related injuries. See General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (d). For injuries previously noticed, the revised statute requires a new notice to the second injury fund \u201cby certified mail prior to October 1, 1995 . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 (e). The respondents failed to re-notify the second injury fund of their claim for transfer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>of the liability for Cece\u2019s injury. They did, however, fulfill their obligation to pay benefits to Cece for 104 weeks antecedent to transfer. Those payments ceased on December 10, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">On these undisputed facts, the workers\u2019 compensation trial commissioner upheld the respondents\u2019 claim that the second injury fund was liable for payment of benefits to Cece. In the commissioner\u2019s view, the initial notice to the second injury fund was sufficient to transfer liability to that fund because the subsequent changes in \u00a7 31-349 had no retroactive effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In response to a petition for review filed by the second injury fund, the compensation review board (board) reversed the decision of the trial commissioner and dismissed the respondents\u2019 claim for transfer. The board observed that the re-notification provision in \u00a7 31-349 (e) as revised could not be construed as having only a prospective effect because, for the future, the revised statute precluded all transfers to the second injury fund. Relying on the analysis in <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 304-305, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997), the board held that the provision for re-notification would be meaningless unless it were held to operate retroactively. The board declined, on jurisdictional grounds, to address the respondents\u2019 claims that the re-notification provision, if applied retroactively, violated the respondents\u2019 constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">In their appeal to this court,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the respondents do not challenge the board\u2019s decision that the revised \u00a7 31-349 (e) applies to their request to transfer liability for Cece\u2019s injury to the second injuiy fund. They represent, however, that transfer requests often are triggered by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>employee claims for farther disability benefits for injuries that occur long after the original notice to the employer, the insurer and the second injury fund. In their view, such legitimate subsequent claims make it impracticable for them to avail themselves of the re-notification requirement of the revised \u00a7 31-349, codified as \u00a7 31-349 (e). In effect, they argue, the revised statute deprives them of the opportunity to transfer legitimate claims for disability benefits to the second injury fund, and thus deprives them of a defense to the payment of disability claims. Consequently, they maintain that the re-notification provision is unconstitutional because it violates both the contract clause and the due process clause of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The second injury fund argues, to the contrary, that the statutory rights created by the terms of \u00a7 31-349 before its 1995 revision <em>do not </em>support any contractual claims against the fund. In the fund\u2019s view, although the workers\u2019 compensation act creates a contract between employees and their employers and the employers\u2019 insurers, the fund is not a party to that contract. According to the fund, because its obligations are statutory rather than contractual, those obligations are merely statements of legislative policy subject to revision by subsequent legislatures. We agree with the fund and, therefore, affirm the decision of the compensation review board.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The second injury fund was established by the legislature in 1945 to encourage employers to hire potential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>employees with preexisting disabilities or injuries. To provide an economic incentive for such employment, the second injury fund provided resources to limit the direct exposure of employers and their insurers to 104 weeks of workers\u2019 compensation payments for injuries exacerbated by the employee\u2019s preexisting condition. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 318-21, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995); <em>Civardi v. Norwich, </em>231 Conn. 287,293-94, 649 A.2d 523 (1994); <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>Gerber Group, </em>222 Conn. 78, 82, 608 A.2d 87 (1992). Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-354,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the operations of the second injury fund always have been underwritten, not by the state, but by annual special assessment premium surcharges paid by employers or their insurance carriers.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">In 1995, a blue ribbon commission, which included both government and industry representatives, reported to the legislature that the second injury fund had not been managed properly and faced substantial unfunded claims for payment. Witnesses testifying at a legislative committee hearing and on the floor of the legislature noted the fact that the problem of employment for the disabled had been attenuated by the enactment of federal and state antidiscrimination statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Concluding that the second injury fund had outlived its usefulness, the legislature adopted P.A. 95-277 to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>revise \u00a7 31-349 in two significant respects. First, the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-349 (d), which closes the fund to any transfer of claims for injuries occurring after July 1,1995. Second, in order to permit a determination of potential fund liability for prior injuries, the legislature enacted \u00a7 31-349 (e), which requires re-notification to the fund by October 1, 1995, of all claims of which the fund already had notice. It is the constitutional validity of this re-notification requirement that the respondents have questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">As the respondents acknowledged at oral argument, their constitutional claims cannot succeed unless they can demonstrate that the legislation establishing the second injury fund in 1945 created a contractual relationship between that fund and employees, employers and insurers. Without a contractual relationship, the legislative requirement of timely re-notification of potential transfer claims does not \u201cimpair the obligation of contracts.\u201d Similarly, without a contractual relationship, that legislative requirement does not deprive the respondents of a vested property interest entitled to due process protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">The respondents claim, for two reasons, that the second injury fund embodies a contract between them and the fund. We find neither argument persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">First, the respondents rely on our case law that, long before the creation of the second injury fund, concluded that the workers\u2019 compensation act created a contract between employees and their employers and insurers. See, e.g., <em>Preveslin </em>v. <em>Derby &amp; Ansonia Developing </em>Co., 112 Conn. 129, 142, 151 A. 518 (1930). That conclusion has not been questioned subsequently because it is inextricably interwoven with the principle that eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation deprives injured employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of access to otherwise available common-law tort remedies. General Statutes \u00a7 31-284 (a); see, e.g., <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnick, </em>244 Conn. 781, 799, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. 542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998); <em>Dodd </em>v. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co., </em>242 Conn. 375, 381, 698 A.2d 859 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The respondents claim that, because the second injury fund was designed to permit the transfer of some workers\u2019 compensation benefit payments, the fund is a party to the underlying contract between the employee and the employer or its insurer. We never have held that the fund is a contracting party for all purposes, and we decline so to hold in the context of this case. It is of paramount significance that the transfer process has no effect on the injured worker\u2019s entitlement to payment of benefits. The only issue raised by a limitation on potential transfers is whether the burden of direct payment falls entirely, or only in part, on employers and their insurers. Access to transfers, therefore, bears no relationship to the underlying workers\u2019 compensation contract. See <em>Everett </em>v. <em>Ingraham, </em>150 Conn. 153, 157, 186 A.2d 798 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Second, the respondents appear to claim, interstitially, that the statutory enactment of the second injury fund itself manifested a legislative intent to impose a contractual obligation on the fund. Perhaps the legislature might have done so, but the respondents have pointed to no textual support for such an inference. As the fund reminds us, we presume that a statute does not create private vested contractual rights \u201cabsent a clear1 showing of legislative intent to the contrary.\u201d <em>Pineman </em>v. <em>Oechslin, </em>195 Conn. 405, 410-11, 488 A.2d 803 (1985); see also <em>Dodge </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>302 U.S. 74, 78-79, 58 S. Ct. 98, 82 L. Ed. 57 (1937). That presumption is rooted in each legislature\u2019s authority to revisit and to alter the policy decisions of its predecessors. For that reason, among others, the respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>have no claim of estoppel arising out of expectations generated by prior legislation<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> unless they can establish a predicate contractual foundation therefor.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> They have been unable to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">In sum, we conclude that the re-notification provision contained in \u00a7 31-349, as revised in 1995, has no constitutional flaw that is cognizable either under the contract clause or the due process clause of the United States constitution. Both constitutional provisions require a showing of a contractual relationship that has not been made under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">The decision of the compensation review board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b476-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349, as it incorporates P.A. 95-277, provides in relevant part: \"(a) The fact that an employee has suffered a previous disability, shall not preclude him from compensation for a second iryury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting from the second injury.
