We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">The Appellate Court\u2019s opinion states the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cBoth the victim and the defendant were students at Enfield High School. The victim was the manager of the school football team, and the defendant was a player on the team.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">\u201cOn September 21,1994, the victim attended football practice and performed her usual duties. The defendant also attended practice, but did not participate because of an injury. At the end of practice, the defendant offered the victim a ride to her home, and she accepted. The defendant also agreed to drive another player on the football team to his home.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">\u201cThe defendant drove toward the home of the other player, who occupied a rear seat of the car, and the victim sat in the front passenger seat. During the ride, the defendant and the other player made some remarks about the victim\u2019s breasts. The defendant also said he intended to have the victim perform oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cAfter leaving the other player at his home, the defendant drove around for a short while and finally entered a cemetery driveway. He drove to the rear of the cemetery and parked the car. He and the victim kissed for a while, and then he unzipped his pants. At trial the victim testified that the defendant forced her to perform fellatio, but the trial court concluded that the state failed to sustain its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt the element of compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">\u201cOn the date of the incident, September 21, 1994, the victim was fourteen years old, her birthday being August 16, 1980. The defendant was sixteen years of age, his birthday being May 9, 1978. The difference between their birthdays is two years, three months and seven days.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason </em>B., 47 Conn. App. 68, 70-71, 702 A.2d 895 (1997). The defendant was charged in an original information with sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (l);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1); see footnote 1 of this opinion; and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The defendant was granted youthful offender status pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-76d,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>and a youthful offender information was filed charging him with the same three offenses. Following a trial to the court, the court found that the state had failed to meet its burden of proof on the element of compulsion or force, and acquitted the defendant of sexual assault in the first degree. The court found the defendant guilty of sexual assault in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), and risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21, and adjudged the defendant to be a youthful offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 70. This certified appeal followed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">The defendant first claims that he was not \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than the victim as is required for a conviction under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). Section 53a-71 (a) provides in pertinent part that \u201c[a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> with another person and: (1) Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age <em>and the actor is more than two years older than such person . . </em>. ,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Relying on what he terms \u201ccommon parlance\u201d and on General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (i), which provides that the \u201cword \u2018month\u2019 shall mean a calendar month, and the word \u2018year-\u2019 a calendar year, unless otherwise expressed,\u201d the defendant argues that, for the purposes of construing \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), \u201ca [sixteen year old] is always within two years of age of a [fourteen year old] . . . .\u201d Therefore, he contends, he did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>violate the statute because he \u201cwas less than two <em>calendar </em>years older [than the victim].\u201d (Emphasis in original.) We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">\u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of this case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply. In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997). Moreover, \u201c[p]enal statutes must be strictly construed . . . but such construction must accord with common sense and commonly approved usage of the language.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Edwards, </em>201 Conn. 125, 132, 513 A.2d 669 (1986); see also General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a) (in interpreting statutes words and phrases are \u201cconstrued according to the commonly approved usage of the language\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">We start with the language of the statute, which must be read contextually. Section 53a-71 (a) (1) criminalizes the conduct of an actor who \u201cengages in sexual intercourse with another person . . . [who] is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age [when] the actor is more than two years older than the [victim] . . . .\u201d Determination of illegality under this statute, therefore, requires a comparison of the relative ages of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">Although in other comparative contexts, for example, a comparison of the increase in population growth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>between two cities, the use of a calendar year may be appropriate, common sense dictates that in comparing the relative ages of individuals, the difference in their ages is determined by reference to their respective birth dates. In other words, although a person, when asked his age, often will respond with a whole number, for example, \u201cI am forty years old,\u201d without specifying how many months have passed since his most recent birthday, it is understood that his exact age actually consists of this abbreviated whole number plus the number of months and days that have passed since the date of his last birthday. This linguistic tendency is best illustrated by the response that ordinarily would be given by one who is asked, not simply how old she is, but how much older she is than someone else. For example, if a woman who was born on January 7,1950, was asked how much older she is than her husband, who was bom on December 7,1950, in all likelihood she would respond that she is \u201cnearly one year older,\u201d or perhaps, \u201celeven months older,\u201d than her husband. She hardly would respond, as the defendant\u2019s argument suggests, that neither is \u201colder\u201d than the other simply because they were both born in the same calendar year. Indeed, even twins know how to respond when asked which of them is \u201colder\u201d than the other; they ordinarily will respond based on their birth order, even though when asked their age they ordinarily will respond with the same whole number of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">Section 53a-71 (a) (1) requires a similar comparison between the ages of the parties involved, and contemplates that in determining whether the actor was \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than the complainant, the parties\u2019 birth dates will be used to calculate the differences in their ages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Application of this basic, commonsense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>principle leads to the conclusion that the defendant, who was bom in May, 1978, was \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than the victim, who was bom in August, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"ajm-dedup-0\">The legislative history supports this commonsense interpretation of determining who is \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than another for the purposes of criminal liability under \u00a7 53a-71. As we have indicated, prior to the amendments to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) by No. 93-340, \u00a7 2, of the 1993 Public Acts, the age difference between the offender and the victim was irrelevant to the determination of liability under the statute. See footnote 8 of this opinion. The legislative history of Public Act 93-340 indicates that the purpose of exempting from liability those actors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>who are not more than two years older than their consenting sexual partners who are more than thirteen, but less than sixteen years old, was to reduce the harsh consequences of the criminal law as applied to consenting, sexually active adolescents who were close in age. Explaining the proposed amendments, Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated: \u201cIt . . . modifies the language of the strictness of our law when the sexual activity is between people within two years age of each other . . . .\u201d 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 29, 1993 Sess., p. 10,450. Similarly, Representative Moira K. Lyons explained: \u201c[W]e deal with one class of sexual activity which is removed from the statutory rape sanctions in our current statutes and that is where children between the ages of 13 and 18 engage in sexual intercourse and they are within two years of each other in age.\u201d Id., p. 10,457. Furthermore, in responding to an inquiry by Senator William A. Aniskovich as to whether the bill \u201cin effect decriminalizes what is now statutory rape so long as both parties are under . . . the statutory rape age . . . under current law\u201d; 36 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1993 Sess., p. 4587; Senator George C. Jepsen replied \u201c[tjhat\u2019s pretty close to it with an additional restriction that the two individuals involved be within two years of one another in age. For example, if you have someone who is just short of 18 having sex with someone who is 13 and a month, that would continue to be a crime.\u201d Id., p. 4588. Although the hypothetical posed by Senator Jepsen involved parties with an age difference greater than two yeai-s, it would have been unnecessary to mention that the younger person was thirteen and one month if, under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the calculation of the differences in age was intended to be measured according to calendar years.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The general purpose of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) is to protect victims who are thirteen, fourteen or fifteen years of age, and thus may not have the full measure of maturity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>to make an intelligent choice regarding sexual intercourse, from being taken advantage of by someone who, because he or she is significantly older, may be able to persuade the victim to engage in physically consensual sexual intercourse. Interpreting \u201cmore than two years older than\u201d the victim by comparing actual birth dates is consistent with that purpose. Looking solely at the calendar years in which the defendant and victim were bom, as the defendant contends, would be inconsistent with that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">The defendant\u2019s attempt to import the statutory definition of \u201cyear\u201d in \u00a7 1-1 (i) as a \u201ccalendar year\u201d into the context of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), would torture the meaning of \u201cmore than two years older\u201d in \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), and would lead to bizarre and absurd results. Under the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation, the sole determinant of the legality of the intercourse would be the <em>calendar years </em>of the victim\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s births. In other words, for the purposes of determining the legality of an incident that took place at some point in 1994, persons bom <em>on any </em>day during 1981 would be considered thirteen years of age, and persons bom on <em>any day </em>during 1979 would be considered fifteen. Consequently, under this inteipretation, only those \u201colder\u201d persons bom <em>before </em>1979, for example, in 1978, would be guilty of violating the statute as a result of having sexual intercourse in 1994 with a victim bom in 1981. Furthermore, the defendant\u2019s proposed interpretation would mean that, with respect to an incident that occurred on September 1, 1994, a victim bom on December 1,1980, would <em>not </em>be protected from a defendant bom on January 1, 1978, \u2014 thirty-five months earlier \u2014 but a victim bom on January 1, 1980, <em>would </em>be protected from a defendant bom on December 1,1977\u2014 twenty-five months earlier. We do not read statutes to create such an anomaly.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Finally, we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s reliance on the rule of lenity. \u201cAs the United States Supreme Court has noted, [t]he touchstone of this rule of lenity is statutory ambiguity. . . . [W]e . . . [reserve] lenity for those situations in which a reasonable doubt persists about a statute\u2019s intended scope even after resort to the language and structure, legislative history, and motivating policies of the statute. . . . <em>Moskal </em>v. <em>United States, </em>498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S. Ct. 461, 112 L. Ed. 2d 449 (1990).\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 317-18, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). This is not such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant next claims that, even if he was two years older than the victim for the purposes of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and violates the equal protection clause of the United States constitution. Relying on his contention that the meaning of \u201ctwo years older\u201d is ambiguous, and on the fact that there are no prior judicial opinions construing this specific phrase, the defendant argues that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) does not provide the fair warning necessaiy to survive a void for vagueness challenge. The defendant also argues that the proper evaluation of a challenge to a statute based upon alleged vagueness requires an examination of the \u201cparticular circumstances\u201d of the case, and that we must consider what \u201cwould be \u2018reasonable\u2019 to [the defendant] in his case.\u201d With regard to the equal protection clause, the defendant argues that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) violates his right to equal protection under the law in that \u201cit treats a single class of individuals, namely [sixteen year old] minors, differently with respect to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>fundamental right to privacy.\u201d We conclude that \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) is not constitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case, and does not violate the defendant\u2019s right to equal protection under the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">\u201cIn our assessment of whether the statute passes constitutional muster, we proceed from the well recognized jurisprudential principle that [t]he party attacking a validly enacted statute . . . bears the heavy burden of proving its unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt and we indulge in every presumption in favor of the statute\u2019s constitutionality. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 236, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1165, 115 S. Ct. 1133, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1095 (1995). The constitutional injunction that is commonly referred to as the void for vagueness doctrine embodies two central precepts: the right to fair warning of the effect of a governing statute or regulation and the guarantee against standardless law enforcement. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Goguen, </em>415 U.S. 566, 572-73, 94 S. Ct. 1242, 39 L. Ed. 2d 605 (1974); <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 142-43, 363 A.2d 68 (1975). <em>State </em>v. <em>Schriver, </em>[207 Conn. 456, 459-60, 542 A.2d 686 (1988)]. Thus, [i]n order to surmount a vagueness challenge, a statute [must] afford a person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is permitted or prohibited.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 777, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). Furthermore, \u201c[i]f the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties. . . . References to judicial opinions involving the statute, the common law, legal dictionaries, or treatises may be necessary to ascertain a statute\u2019s meaning to determine if it gives fair warning.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 778.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>Applying these principles to the facts of the present case, \u201cour fundamental inquiry is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would comprehend that the defendant\u2019s acts were prohibited under [\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1)].\u201d Id. We conclude that a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that a person bom in May, 1978, was more than two years older than a person bom in August, 1980.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The defendant\u2019s contention that our vagueness analysis should focus on the warning provided to the average sixteen year old lacks merit. First, the scope of the statute is not confined to defendants of teenage years. Second, vagueness analysis ordinarily does not depend on the individual or categorical capabilities of the defendant. It focuses on the warning that is afforded by the language and its gloss to persons of ordinary intelligence. Although the knowledge possessed by a particular defendant may <em>undermine </em>a vagueness challenge; see <em>State </em>v. <em>DeFrancesco, </em>235 Conn. 426, 446, 668 A.2d 348 (1995) (defendant\u2019s specific knowledge of dangerous propensities of her felidae contributed to defeat of vagueness challenge); the converse is not true. Lack of knowledge, either by the individual defendant or a person in his particular age category, does not enhance a vagueness challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">The defendant also maintains that \u201c\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) violates [his] right to equal protection under the state<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and federal constitutions in that it treats a single class of individuals, namely [sixteen year old] minors, differently with respect to their fundamental right to privacy. Absent a compelling state interest in such a discriminatory classification, the statute violates the defendant\u2019s (and other similarly situated sixteen year olds\u2019) right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>to equal protection of the law.\u201d In support of his right to assert, as a minor, a fundamental right to engage in consensual sexual relations, the defendant relies on United States Supreme Court precedent in which the right to privacy has been developed, and on his specific claim that \u201cthe constitutional jurisprudence that establishes the right of minors to privacy [has granted] them the right to choose abortions . . . .\u201d According to the defendant, it follows that a fundamental right to privacy with regard \u201cto the activity that necessitated that medical procedure in the first place\u201d should also be recognized. We disagree.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\u201cIn order to analyze the [defendant\u2019s claim], we first must detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>[240 Conn. 727, 738, 694 A.2d 758 (1997)]. First, in general, as in any constitutional challenge to the validity of a statutory scheme, the statutory scheme] is presumed constitutional . . . and [t]he burden is on the one attacking the legislative arrangement to negative every conceivable basis which might support it... . <em>Heller </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320, 113 S. Ct. 2637, 125 L. Ed. 2d 257 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">\u201cMore specifically, [t]o implicate the equal protection [clause] under the . . . federal [constitution] . . . it is necessary that the state statute [or statutory scheme] in question, either on its face or in practice, treat persons standing in the same relation to it differently. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 738-39. Thus, the analytical predicate [of consideration of an equal protection claim] is a determination of who are the persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>similarly situated. <em>Darak </em>v. <em>Darak, </em>210 Conn. 462, 473, 556 A.2d 145 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">\u201cThe equal protection clause does not require absolute equality or precisely equal advantages [between such similarly situated persons] .... <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Moffitt, </em>417 U.S. 600, 612, 94 S. Ct. 2437, 41 L. Ed. 2d 341 (1974); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>[200 Conn. 562, 577-78, 512 A.2d 893 (1986)]. ... To determine whether a particular classification violates the guarantees of equal protection, the court must consider the character of the classification; the individual interests affected by the classification; and the governmental interests asserted in support of the classification. <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Blumstein, </em>405 U.S. 330, 335, 92 S. Ct. 995, 31 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1972). . . . <em>Franklin </em>v. <em>Berger, </em>211 Conn. 591, 595, 560 A.2d 444 (1989).

[I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature. <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 877, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>246 Conn. 132, 138-40, 716 A.2d 870 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">The \u201canalytical predicate\u201d of an equal protection claim is a \u201cdetermination of who are the persons similarly situated.\u201d Id., 141. According to the defendant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>classes of persons similarly situated consist of: (1) those sixteen year olds who engage in sexual intercourse with persons two years or less their junior; and (2) those sixteen year olds who engage in sexual intercourse with persons more than two years their junior. These two groups, however, are not similarly situated for the purposes of equal protection analysis. They have engaged in different conduct: the first, having engaged in sexual intercourse with persons whom the legislature <em>has not </em>deemed to be sufficiently younger than the sixteen year old so as to warrant proscribing such conduct; the second, having engaged in sexual intercourse with persons whom the legislature <em>has </em>deemed to be sufficiently younger than the sixteen year old so as to warrant criminalizing such conduct. Cf. id., 142 (defendants who commit different crimes are not similarly situated for equal protection purposes).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Furthermore, with respect to the defendant\u2019s argument that there is no legally significant difference between a person who is sixteen and a person who is sixteen and three months, we agree with the Appellate Court that \u201cthe same claim can be raised against any statute that draws a precise line based on age. We are not aware of any authority that has invalidated a statute simply because it makes no allowance for persons who exceed the statutory limit by only a few months.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason </em>B., supra, 47 Conn. App. 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Thus, the defendant\u2019s argument \u201cis ill-suited to the framework of equal protection analysis. In our view, as a matter of analytical categorization, it would have been brought more appropriately as a substantive due process claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Matos, </em>[240 Conn. 743, 749, 694 A.2d 775 (1997)] (\u2018[t]he guarantee of substantive due process requires that a law be reasonable, rather than arbitrary or capricious, and that its operation has a real and substantial relation to the object to be obtained\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>(Citation omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">This conclusion requires us to consider the defendant\u2019s claim that he has a fundamental right of privacy to engage in consensual sexual relations. If he is correct, we must apply strict scrutiny analysis to the defendant\u2019s claim; if he is incorrect, his claim must be accorded rational basis review. We conclude that rational basis review applies to the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Initially, we note that the defendant challenges the constitutionality of the statute as applied to him; he does not make a facial claim. See footnote 10 of this opinion. It borders on the frivolous, however, to say that one has a right of privacy to engage in consensual sexual intercourse in a cemetery driveway during the late afternoon or early evening, as occurred in this case. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-186 (statutory provision criminalizing sexual conduct in public places).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Next, it is a dubious assertion at best that the constitution provides sixteen year olds the fundamental right to engage in consensual sexual relations. The defendant offers no authority for this proposition, and it cannot be drawn by analogy to those cases dealing with procreation or abortion. A pregnant minor female\u2019s right to have an abortion, under certain circumstances, is hardly analogous to the purported \u201cright\u201d of a sixteen year old to engage in sexual intercourse.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Furthermore, consensual sexual intercourse, by definition, requires at least two actors. Thus, the proper question in this case is not whether the sixteen year old defendant had a fundamental right to engage in consensual sexual intercourse. The proper question is whether he had a fundamental right to engage in such conduct with the fourteen year old victim. It exceeds the frivolous to suggest that the constitution provides such a right. The proper standard, therefore, is rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">\u201cRational basis review is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification .... [I]t is irrelevant whether the conceivable basis for the challenged distinction actually motivated the legislature.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 139-40. The reasons cited by the Appellate Court, namely, the prevention of teenage pregnancy, and the limitation of the opportunity of the more sexually experienced adolescents to take advantage of those much younger; <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 81; provide a rational basis for a legislative distinction based on whether a person is more or less than two years older than the younger party for the purposes of determining the legality of sexual intercourse under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">The defendant next claims that the state failed to charge him adequately<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and prove him guilty of violating \u00a7 53-21. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The defendant asserts that, as a result of Public Act 93-340; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>footnote 8 of this opinion; \u201cit is no longer enough simply to state that sexual intercourse with a person under [sixteen] conclusively establishes a situation likely to impair morals.\u201d According to the defendant, \u201cthe state was required to allege and prove more in count three than the mere fact that [the victim] was less than [sixteen] years old.\u201d Thus, the defendant contends, because the state failed: (1) to incorporate by reference any of the specific allegations of age contained in the first two counts of the complaint; (2) to meet its burden of proof on the elements of compulsion or force; and (3) to \u201callege physical injury or transmission of a disease or some other harm beyond the mere fact of intercourse\u201d; the defendant was not \u201con notice that he was exposed to a conviction for risk of injury for engaging in consensual intercourse <em>solely </em>because of [the victim\u2019s] status as a minor, without regal'd to [the defendant\u2019s] age.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Furthermore, the defendant claims that because \u201c[t]he state never alleged in the third count that its theory of liability for risk of injury was based upon the fact that [the defendant] was \u2018more than two years older\u2019 than [the victim], nor did it seek, as the basis for criminal liability, to incorporate his birth date from the second count by reference . . . there was insufficient evidence to sustain the conviction . . . .\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">As an initial matter, the state argues that because the defendant did not challenge the validity of the information prior to the trial court\u2019s youthful offender adjudication, we must construe the information favorably to the state. We agree.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>In <em>State </em>v. McMurray, 217 Conn. 243, 250, 585 A.2d 677 (1991), we held that \u201c[w]hen reviewing a claim, not raised prior to the verdict, that an information fails to charge all the essential elements of an offense, we must construe the information liberally in favor of the state.\u201d In the present case, although the defendant did challenge, prior to trial, the validity of the information with regard to the charge under \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1); see footnote 16 of this opinion; he did not challenge, prior to trial, the validity of the information with regard to the charge under \u00a7 53-21.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, a construction of the information in favor of the state is appropriate with respect to the charge under \u00a7 53-21. \u201cUnder the applicable standard of review, a conviction based upon a challenged information is valid unless the information is so obviously defective that by no reasonable construction can it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>McMurray, </em>supra, 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">The defendant claims, in effect, that when the legislature expressly amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) in 1993 to include an exemption from criminal liability for those persons engaging in consensual sexual intercourse with persons not more than two years their junior, it also implicitly modified the activities proscribed by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21. Section 53-21, on its face, is concerned only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>with the age of the victim, and criminalizes certain actions based upon the fact that the victim is under the age of sixteen. See footnote 3 of this opinion. The express language of \u00a7 53-21, therefore, does not require any consideration of the age of the defendant for the purposes of determining criminal liability. The defendant argues, however, that as a result of the 1993 amendments to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) <em>\u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), </em>in order to allege sufficiently and prove guilt under <em>\u00a7 53-21, </em>the language of the statute notwithstanding,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the state must also allege and prove that the defendant was more than two years older than the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">We have characterized legislative actions as implicitly amending a statute only when the legislative history contains a very strong showing of the legislators\u2019 intent to do so. \u201cWhen changes have been introduced by amendment to a statute, the presumed change does not go any further than that which is expressly declared or necessarily implied. . . . We cannot impute to the legislature ... in the absence of an intent clearly expressed in the act, [an intent] to enact [a statute] which involves a departure from existing statutory law.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Iovieno </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>242 Conn. 689, 699-700, 699 A.2d 1003 (1997). There is no indication in the legislative histoiy of Public Act 93-340 that in amending General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71, the legislature also intended to amend the scope or meaning of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">We therefore consider whether the information was \u201cso obviously defective that by no reasonable construction [could] it be said to charge the offense for which conviction was had.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State v. McMurray, </em>supra, 217 Conn. 250. The third <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>count of the information charged that, on the particular date and at the particular place in question, the defendant wilfully and unlawfully committed acts likely to impair the morals of the fourteen year old victim, namely, by engaging in sexual intercourse with her in violation of \u00a7 53-21. This information met the <em>McMurray </em>standard.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that \u00a7 53-21 is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because the statute \u201cand its judicial gloss fail[ed] to provide the defendant with fair warning that his conduct was illegal.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> More specifically, the defendant contends that \u201c[although mistake as to the \u2018victim\u2019s\u2019 age is no defense ... it is reasonable that a [sixteen year old] would believe that he did not impair a [fourteen year old] partner\u2019s morals under \u00a7 53-21 to engage in the sexual conduct at issue here.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Thus, the defendant maintains, in the absence of either plain language or an appropriate judicial gloss on the statute, \u201cthe defendant could not possibly have known that his conduct could lead to criminal liability under \u00a7 53-21.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">The state argues that the Appellate Court properly concluded that \u201cat the time of the offense the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>did have fair notice of the criminality of his conduct from the terms of the statute and from judicial opinions interpreting its terms,\u201d and that, therefore, \u00a7 53-21 is not void for vagueness as applied to the facts of this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 86. We agree with the Appellate Court and the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We reiterate that, \u201c[i]f the meaning of a statute can be fairly ascertained a statute will not be void for vagueness since [m]any statutes will have some inherent vagueness, for [i]n most English words and phrases there lurk uncertainties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>supra, 240 Conn. 778. Moreover, when considering a \u201cvoid for vagueness claim . . . our fundamental inquiry is whether a person of ordinary intelligence would comprehend that the defendant\u2019s acts were prohibited . . . .\u201d Id. As we concluded in part II of this opinion, although a particular defendant\u2019s special knowledge may undermine his or her vagueness challenge, a particular individual or categorical defendant\u2019s lack of knowledge may not be used to enhance such a challenge. Thus, the defendant\u2019s reliance on what a sixteen year old actor would or would not believe is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">It is well settled that \u00a7 53-21 \u201cproscrib[es] two general types of behavior likely to injure physically or impair the morals of a minor under sixteen years of age: (1) deliberate indifference to, acquiescence in, or the creation of situations inimical to the minor\u2019s moral or physical welfare and (2) acts directly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to his moral or physical well-being.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>192 Conn. 154, 159, 471 A.2d 632, appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 801, 105 S. Ct. 55, 83 L. Ed. 2d 6 (1984). We conclude that the defendant had notice that engaging in sexual intercourse with a fourteen year old victim constituted an act \u201cdirectly perpetrated on the person of the minor and injurious to [her] moral or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>physical well-being.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">As the Appellate Court noted, as a result of several Appellate Court decisions construing \u00a7 53-21, \u201cthere existed a significant judicial gloss with respect to \u00a7 53-21, of which the defendant must be presumed to have been aware, to the effect that the act of having sexual intercourse with a child under sixteen years of age was a violation of the statute, regardless of whether there was consent by the child.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 85; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Plude, </em>30 Conn. App. 527, 530, 621 A.2d 1342, cert. denied, 225 Conn. 923, 625 A.2d 824 (1993) (vaginal intercourse and fellatio); <em>In re John C., </em>20 Conn. App. 694, 695, 569 A.2d 1154 (1990) (defendant standing before victim with his hands on her head and his erect penis exposed); <em>State </em>v. Thomas, 19 Conn. App. 44, 46, 560 A.2d 486 (1989) (defendant put his hand under victim\u2019s underwear and fondled her vaginal area).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">We are not persuaded, moreover, by the defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Perruccio </em>for his vagueness challenge to \u00a7 53-21. The flaw in the statutory scheme considered in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 163, was that the age of consent of the victim under General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) conflicted with the age of consent under General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 53-21 and, therefore, \u00a7 53-21 was vague as applied to the facts of that case.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In the present case, however, as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Appellate Court properly concluded: \u201cThe defendant\u2019s reliance on <em>Perruccio </em>is misplaced . . . because in this case there is no conflict between the statutes with respect to the age of consent. Both \u00a7\u00a7 53-21 and 53a-71 (a) (1) apply to the protected class of children under sixteen years. Within that class, the latter statute creates an exemption when the actor is not more than two years older than the person with whom sexual intercourse occurred. The defendant clearly does not qualify for that exemption because he is more than two years older than the victim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason </em>B., supra, 47 Conn. App. 83-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">For the same reasons articulated in part III of this opinion, we similarly are unpersuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim that the 1993 amendments to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) render the activities proscribed under \u00a7 53-21 vague. The defendant argues that, by enacting the 1993 amendments to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71, the legislature categorically reduced the age of consent to sexual intercourse to thirteen, and thereby \u201cin effect, deemed [fourteen year olds] capable of consenting to intercourse . . . .\u2019\u2019As discussed previously, the 1993 amendments to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) did not amend General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21. Rather, the legislative history suggests that the safe harbor exemption was added solely to ameliorate the harsh results of the criminal law as it was being applied to consenting, sexually active adolescents who were close in age. As the Appellate Court correctly pointed out, \u201c[n]o legislator contended that a person qualifying for the exemption would be less likely to impair the morals of a child.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 84. Moreover, unlike the situation presented to this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Perruccio, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 164, where the legislators\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>actions had \u201cclearly indicated [a determination] that a person who had attained the age of fifteen was an adult capable of making an intelligent choice in matters relating to sex,\u201d there is absolutely no indication in the 1993 legislative history that the legislature deemed a person age fourteen categorically capable of consenting to engage in sexual intercourse, irrespective of the age of the partner. Indeed, the legislative history is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

Assuming the state properly charged the defendant with a violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21, did the Appellate Court properly conclude that it was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to the facts of this case?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Jason B., </em>243 Conn. 955, 955-56, 704 A.2d 806 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b567-13\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-65 (2) defines \u201csexual intercourse\u201d as including fellatio.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b567-14\"> Public Acts 1993, No. 93-340, \u00a7 2, amended \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) to exempt from guilt those persons who are not \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than the complainant. Prior to that amendment, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53a-71 provided in pertinent part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and such other person is (1) under sixteen years of age . ...\u201d As a result of the amendment, \u00a7 53a-71 now provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of sexual assault in the second degree when such person engages in sexual intercourse with another person and: (1) <em>Such other person is thirteen years of age or older but under sixteen years of age and the actor is more than two years older than such person </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"AQY\"> This interpretation of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) is consistent with the manner in which other statutes requiring a determination of age are construed. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 30-86, which governs the sale of alcohol to minors, provides in pertinent part: \u201cAny permittee who, by himself, his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>servant or agent, sells or delivers alcoholic liquor to any minor . . . shall be subject to the penalties of section 30-113. Any person who delivers or gives any such liquors to such minor, except on the order of a practicing physician, shall be fined not more than one thousand five hundred dollars or imprisoned not more than eighteen months, or both. . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 30-1 (12) defines \u201cminor\u201d as \u201cany person under twenty-one years of age.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 30-89 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) Any person to whom the sale of alcoholic liquor is by law forbidden who purchases or attempts to purchase such liquor . . . shall be fined not less than two hundred nor more than five hundred dollars. . . .\u201d Together, these statutory mandates prohibit the sale of alcohol to persons in Connecticut who have not celebrated their twenty-first birthday, and make it illegal for a person to attempt to purchase alcohol prior to his or her twenty-first birthday. The calculation of age for the purposes of determining eligibility to purchase alcohol, as all tavern owners and most twenty year olds understand, certainly is not measured according to a calendar year. Rather, a person bom in January will reach the legal age of consumption prior to a person bom in March of the same year, regardless of the fact that they both may have been bom during the same calendar year. This makes sense because, similar to \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1), the provision at issue is dependent upon the person\u2019s age, and age ordinarily is determined according to a person\u2019s date of birth. This principle is evidenced further by the fact that, prior to the changes included in Public Acts 1993, No. 93-139, \u00a7 1, \u201cminor\u201d was defined, for the purposes of the Liquor Control Act, as \u201cany person under twenty-one years of age other than a person who has attained the age of twenty on or before September 1, 1985.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 30-1 (20). This reference to the person\u2019s birth date would be unnecessary if age was determined according to the calendar year.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b573-8\"> The defendant expressly \u201cmakes no facial challenge to the statute here, but instead asserts that, as a [sixteen year old] youth, the statute is unconstitutionally vague <em>as to him </em>under the facts of <em>this case.\" </em>(Emphasis in original.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b575-8\"> The issue certified for appeal addresses the constitutionality of \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1) under the United States constitution.

I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the defendant is \u201cmore than two years older\u201d than the victim in this case. Thus, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction of sexual assault in the second degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-71 (a) (1). However, I agree with the majority that the defendant\u2019s conviction of risk of injury to a child under General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 53-21 must be upheld.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">The legislature has liberalized this state\u2019s statutory rape law by exempting from prosecution those whose age is within two years of the age of the younger victim. In seeking to exempt older teenagers from criminal liability for sexual relations with children from thirteen up to sixteen years of age, the legislature exempted from liability teenagers who are not two years older than their partners. Whether it was wise or unwise to exempt from criminal liability sexual relations with a thirteen year old, that policy determination is made by the legislature as the representative of the people and not by this court. See <em>In re Baby Z., </em>247 Conn. 474, 533, 724 A.2d 1035 (1999) (McDonald, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>The defendant was sixteen years of age at the time of this incident and the victim was fourteen years of age. If one calculates the years, months, weeks and days between their respective birth dates, the defendant has lived more than two years than the victim has lived. If we were to consider the victim fourteen \u201cyears of age\u201d for the entire year that she was fourteen and the defendant sixteen \u201cyears of age\u201d for the entire year that he was sixteen, however, the defendant would not have been more than two years older than the victim at the time of the incident. It is true that there are more than two years between the defendant\u2019s birthday and the victim\u2019s birthday, but most people commonly refer to \u201cyears of age\u201d as just that and do not compute months, weeks, days, hours, minutes and seconds in their age. In discussing the pertinent legislation, in fact, the legislators referred to the parties\u2019 age in terms of \u201cyears in age\u201d or \u201cyears of age.\u201d Representative Richard D. Tulisano stated that the 1993 amendment to the statute \u201cmodifies the language of the strictness of our law when the sexual activity is between people within two years of age of each other . . . .\u201d36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 29, 1993 Sess., p. 10,450. Representative Moira K. Lyons stated that sexual activity in which \u201cchildren between the ages of thirteen and eighteen engage in sexual intercourse and . . . are within two years of each other in age\u201d is \u201cremoved from statutory rape sanctions.\u201d Id., p. 10,457. Senator George C. Jepsen also stated that the exemption applied if \u201cthe two individuals involved [are] within two years of one another in age.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 13, 1993 Sess., p. 4588.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Under the majority\u2019s reading of the exemption, it applies only to those whose birthdays are not more than two years apart chronologically; thus, the hour and perhaps minute or second of one\u2019s birth could result in criminal liability for teenage sex. If the victim and the defendant share the same birth date, two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>apart, but the defendant was bom a few minutes or seconds earlier than the time at which the victim was born, the defendant would be liable under the majority\u2019s analysis. As this case illustrates, some sixteen year olds may be more than two years older than some fourteen year olds but some may not. I can not believe that the legislature intended such an impractical and unrealistic cutoff where the potential for severe criminal penalties is great. I believe that the legislature intended to create a criminal law that could be practically and sensibly applied and obeyed.
