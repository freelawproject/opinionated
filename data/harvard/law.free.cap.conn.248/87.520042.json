The committee moved to dismiss the plaintiffs action, claiming that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>because the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies. The trial court granted the committee\u2019s motion, and the plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which, in a per curiam opinion, affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance </em>Committee, 47 Conn. App. 930, 705 A.2d 569 (1998). We granted the plaintiff\u2019s petition for certification to appeal limited to the following question: \u201cWhether the Appellate Court properly affirmed the Superior Court\u2019s decision granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss when it found that the plaintiff failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and has adequate remedies at law.\u201d <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>244 Conn. 906, 714 A.2d 2 (1998). We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">The facts and procedural history relevant to this appeal are undisputed. The plaintiff represented Joseph Willis in connection with a 1988 real estate transaction. Thereafter, on September 28, 1994, Willis filed a grievance complaint with the committee alleging that the plaintiff had engaged in professional misconduct relating to that transaction. On the same day, an attorney representing Willis filed a second complaint against the plaintiff concerning the same real estate transaction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On September 29,1994, the committee forwarded these complaints to the grievance panel for the judicial district of Hartford-New Britain, geographical areas thirteen and fourteen (local panel).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The local panel found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>that there was insufficient evidence to support a finding of probable cause that the plaintiff had violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Consequently, the two complaints were dismissed on March 16, 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">On August 11, 1995, Willis filed his second grievance complaint against the plaintiff (grievance complaint no. 95-0107), alleging-a violation of rules 1.7 (b)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 1.8 (a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Like the two previous grievance complaints filed against the plaintiff by Willis and his attorney, this complaint alleged misconduct arising out of the plaintiffs representation of Willis in connection with the 1988 real estate transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tion. The local panel, noting that \u201c[t]he current grievance [complaint no. 95-0107] contains much more in the way of evidence [than had Willis\u2019 earlier complaint], including affidavits from several allegedly disinterested persons,\u201d found probable cause that the plaintiff had violated rules 1.7 (b) and 1.8 (a). On November 27,1995, the local panel forwarded its findings to the committee pursuant to what is now Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (i)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 51-90f (d),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the committee, in accordance with what is now Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (a)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (a),<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> referred the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>to a reviewing subcommittee for a hearing pursuant to what is now Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (c)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (a).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The hearing was held on July 11, 1996, at which the plaintiff filed a motion with the reviewing subcommittee seeking dismissal of grievance complaint no. 95-0107 pursuant to what is now Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> on the ground that the complaint was duplicative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>of the two prior complaints that had been dismissed for lack of probable cause. The reviewing subcommittee denied the plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On July 15, 1996, the plaintiff filed a motion with the committee to dismiss grievance complaint no. 95-0107, again claiming that, under Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D), it was duplicative of the two earlier complaints. The committee declined to review the plaintiffs motion.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b111-6\">Before the reviewing subcommittee had conducted the scheduled hearing on the merits of grievance com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>plaint no. 95-0107,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the plaintiff, on August 28, 1996, filed an action in the Superior Court seeking a permanent injunction prohibiting the committee and any of its reviewing subcommittees and local panels from taking any further action on that complaint. The committee moved to dismiss the plaintiffs claim on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. The trial court agreed with the committee and, on November 25, 1996, granted its motion to dismiss. The plaintiff appealed to the Appellate Court, which summarily affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>supra, 47 Conn. App. 930.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">On appeal to this court, the plaintiff claims that he was not required to exhaust his administrative remedies because the exhaustion doctrine is inapplicable to attorney grievance complaints. The plaintiff further claims that, even if the doctrine generally is applicable to such complaints, he has satisfied the exhaustion requirement or, alternatively, that his case falls under an exception to the exhaustion doctrine. We disagree with each of these claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">The plaintiff first claims that because the committee is not an \u201cagency\u201d within the meaning of the Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (UAPA), General Statutes \u00a7 4-166 et seq., the exhaustion doctrine does not apply to complaints filed with the committee.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>committee does not dispute that it is not an \u201cagency\u201d for purposes of UAPA,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> but nevertheless contends that the exhaustion doctrine is applicable to cases pending before it. We agree with the committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is well established in the jurisprudence of administrative law. . . . The doctrine provides that no one is entitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened injury until the prescribed administrative remedy has been exhausted. . . . The doctrine is applied in a number of different situations and is, like most judicial doctrines, subject to . . . exceptions. Application of the doctrine to specific cases requires an understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>395 U.S. 185, 193, 89 S. Ct. 1657, 23 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">\u201cThe doctrine of exhaustion is grounded in a policy of fostering an orderly process of administrative adjudication and judicial review in which a reviewing court will have the benefit of the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions. . . . The doctrine . . . furthers the salutary goals of relieving the courts of the burden of deciding questions entrusted to an agency ... in advance of possible judicial review. . . . Most important, a favorable outcome will render review by the court unnecessary [because] as the United States Supreme Court has noted: A complaining party may be successful in vindicating his rights in the administrative process. If he is required to pursue his administrative remedies, the courts may never have to intervene. <em>McKart </em>v. <em>United States, </em>[supra, 395 U.S. 195] . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Dept. of Health </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number><em>Services, </em>207 Conn. 346, 351-52, 542 A.2d 672 (1988). Thus, \u201c[t]he two part rationale for the exhaustion doctrine is: (1) to effectuate the legislative intent that the issue in question be handled in the first instance by local administrative officials in order to provide aggrieved persons with full and adequate administrative relief, and to give the reviewing court the benefit of the local board\u2019s judgment . . . and (2) to relieve courts of the burden of prematurely deciding questions that may be resolved satisfactorily through the administrative process.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Loulis </em>v. <em>Parrott, </em>241 Conn. 180, 191, 695 A.2d 1040 (1997); see also <em>Connecticut Bank &amp; Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>202 Conn. 150,155, 520 A.2d 186 (1987) (doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is \u201cdesigned to prevent piecemeal appeals of a litigant\u2019s claims before an administrative agency\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, \u201cjudicial review may be hindered by the failure of the litigant to allow the agency to make a factual record, or to exercise discretion or apply its expertise. . . . [N]otions of administrative autonomy require that the agency be given a chance to discover and correct its own errors. . . . [I]t is possible that frequent and deliberate flouting of administrative processes could weaken the effectiveness of an agency by encouraging people to ignore its procedures.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Cannata </em>v. <em>Dept. of Environmental Protection, </em>215 Conn. 616, 625, 577 A.2d 1017 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">\u201cWhere a statutory requirement of exhaustion is not explicit, courts are guided by [legislative] intent in determining whether application of the doctrine would be consistent with the statutory scheme. <em>Patsy </em>v. <em>Florida Board of Regents, </em>457 U.S. 496, 502 n.4 [102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172] (1982).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Coit Independence Joint Venture </em>v. <em>Federal Savings &amp; Loan Ins. Corp., </em>489 U.S. 561, 579-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>80, 109 S. Ct. 1361, 103 L. Ed. 2d 602 (1989). Consequently, \u201c[t]he requirement of exhaustion may arise from explicit statutory language or from an administrative scheme providing for agency relief.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Howell </em>v. <em>Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service, </em>72 F.3d 288, 291 (2d Cir. 1995); accord <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Empire Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield, </em>989 F.2d 588, 592 (2d Cir. 1993). Although the grievance procedures enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 51-90 through 51-94 and Practice Book \u00a7 2-29 et seq. do not expressly require the exhaustion of administrative remedies before a judicial remedy may be sought, we nevertheless conclude that, in light of the comprehensive nature of the administrative scheme, exhaustion of the remedies available thereunder is a jurisdictional prerequisite to judicial relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">A review of the administrative procedures applicable to attorney grievance complaints reflects the intricate nature of the scheme. When a grievant files a complaint alleging attorney misconduct, the complaint is first directed to the statewide bar counsel.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The statewide bar counsel then either forwards the complaint to a local grievance panel for investigation or refers the complaint to the chair of the committee, or an attorney designee of the chair, and to a nonattorney member of the committee. Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a). If the latter action is taken, the statewide bar counsel, in conjunction with the chair or the chair\u2019s attorney designee and the nonattomey member, shall, if deemed appropriate, dismiss the complaint on any one or more of eight enumerated grounds.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If the complaint is not dismissed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the local grievance panel must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the attorney has engaged in professional misconduct. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90f (a); Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (f). The committee itself, or a reviewing subcommittee, then reviews the local grievance panel\u2019s determination. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (a); Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (c). If the reviewing subcommittee agrees with a local grievance panel\u2019s no probable cause determination, the reviewing subcommittee is authorized to dismiss the complaint. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (g); Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">Whenever probable cause for attorney misconduct is found, either the committee or a reviewing subcommittee conducts a public hearing on the complaint. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (a) and (b); Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (c). The complainant and the respondent may be represented by counsel at the hearing and the respondent may present evidence and witnesses. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (b); Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (d). If the reviewing subcommittee has conducted the hearing, it \u201cmay propose in its decision that the complaint be dismissed, that conditions be imposed in accordance with the rules established by the judges of the Superior Court, that the attorney be reprimanded or that the attorney be presented to the Superior Court for reprimand, suspension or disbarment.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-90g (e); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>also Practice Book \u00a7 2-35 (e). The complainant and the respondent may submit a statement to the committee in support of, or in opposition to, the reviewing subcommittee\u2019s proposed decision, and the committee may, in its discretion, request oral argument. General Statutes \u00a7 51-90h (a); see also Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 2-35 (g) and 2-36. Thereafter, the committee must \u201cissue a decision dismissing the complaint, reprimanding the respondent, imposing conditions in accordance with the rules established by the judges of the Superior Court, directing the State-Wide Bar Counsel to file a presentment against the respondent or referring the complaint to the same or a different reviewing subcommittee for further investigation and proposed decision.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 51-90h (b); see also Practice Book \u00a7 2-36.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">These statutory and practice book provisions establish a comprehensive administrative mechanism for the investigation and resolution of attorney grievance complaints. See <em>Massameno </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>234 Conn. 539, 554, 663 A.2d 317 (1995) (General Statutes \u00a7 51-90 et seq. and parallel rules of practice constitute comprehensive disciplinary scheme designed to safeguard administration of justice). Under this approach, fact-finding is undertaken at the administrative level and grievance complaints often are resolved or narrowed at that stage, thereby fostering judicial efficiency by delegating the responsibility for administering the grievance process in the first instance to the committee, and its reviewing subcommittees and local panels.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Allowing parties to circumvent the established grievance procedures, at least in the absence of a compelling justification for doing so, would so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>undermine the process as to render it ineffectual. Such a result reasonably could not have been contemplated by the framers of the administrative scheme, who created the committee and its subcommittees to act as an arm of the court in safeguarding the administration of justice, preserving public confidence in the system, and protecting the public and the court from unfit practitioners. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Further support for the committee\u2019s contention regarding the applicability of the exhaustion doctrine to attorney grievance complaints may be found in the deference accorded committee decisions under the rules governing such complaints. For example, judicial review of a committee decision to reprimand an attorney, like judicial review of an agency determination under UAPA, is limited, both with respect to the committee\u2019s factual findings and its determination regarding the suitability of a reprimand as the sanction to be imposed. See Practice Book \u00a7 2-38 (f);<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> see also <em>Pinsky </em>v. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee, </em>216 Conn. 228, 235, 578 A.2d 1075 (1990) (no reason why attorney\u2019s right to judicial review in disciplinary matter should be different than process accorded other professionals in disciplinary matters before licensing or disciplinary boards). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Such deferential judicial review reflects the view of the rulemaking authorities that the committee and its subcommittees are to play an integral role in the attorney grievance process.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">In sum, the sweeping nature of the grievance procedures adopted by the legislature and the judges of the Superior Court, the sound policy reasons for adopting such procedures, and the deference accorded certain committee determinations, indicate a clear intent on the part of the legislature and the judiciary that attorney grievance complaints shall be adjudicated administratively in advance of any judicial review. We conclude, therefore, that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies is applicable to the attorney grievance process.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">Having determined that the plaintiff was obligated to exhaust the remedies available to him under our statutory and practice book provisions governing attorney grievance complaints, we now turn to the plaintiffs claim that he has satisfied the exhaustion requirement. We conclude that he has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">The plaintiff contends that he had exhausted his administrative remedies because the committee refused to examine the reviewing subcommittee\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>rejecting his motion to dismiss made pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D) on the ground that grievance complaint no. 95-0107 was duplicative of the earlier complaints filed against the plaintiff and later dismissed. Specifically, the plaintiff claims that because the committee characterized the reviewing subcommittee\u2019s determination of that issue as \u201cfinal\u201d; see footnote 15 of this opinion; he had no further administrative remedies available to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">This argument merits little discussion. The reviewing subcommittee never conducted a hearing on the merits of grievance complaint no. 95-0107. If, after such a hearing, the reviewing subcommittee had concluded that, as the plaintiff claims, he did not engage in professional misconduct as alleged in the complaint, the plaintiff will have achieved the result that he seeks, namely, a determination that the charges should be dismissed.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In such circumstances, it cannot be said that the plaintiff has exhausted his administrative remedies. Although the plaintiff might prefer to have had grievance complaint no. 95-0107 dismissed as duplicative rather than defend the complaint on its merits, his preference for a remedy at that earlier stage of the proceedings is of no moment when he has not exhausted other available administrative remedies. See <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>236 Conn. 421, 434, 673 A.2d 514 (1996). Accordingly, we reject the plaintiffs argument that he has satisfied the exhaustion requirement.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that he should be excused from exhausting his administrative remedies because his case falls within several recognized exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">\u201cDespite the important public policy considerations underlying the exhaustion requirement, we have grudgingly carved several exceptions from the exhaustion doctrine. . . . We have recognized such exceptions, however, only infrequently and only for narrowly defined purposes.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 432. \u201cWe have recognized that a party aggrieved by a decision of an administrative agency may be excused from exhaustion of administrative remedies if: recourse to the administrative remedy would be futile or inadequate; <em>Greenwich </em>v. <em>Liquor Control Commission, </em>191 Conn. 528, 541-42, 469 A.2d 382 (1983); the procedures followed by the administrative agency are constitutionally infirm; <em>LaCroix </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>[199 Conn. 70, 79, 505 A.2d 1233 (1986)]; or injunctive relief from an agency decision is necessary to prevent immediate and irreparable harm. <em>Pet </em>v. <em>Department of Health Services, </em>supra, [207 Conn.] 370.\u201d <em>Polymer Resources, Ltd. </em>v. <em>Keeney, </em>227 Conn. 545, 561, 630 A.2d 1304 (1993). The plaintiff asserts that he has satisfied the requirements of each of these three exceptions. We address, and reject, each of these claims in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>The plaintiff first contends that he need not comply with the exhaustion doctrine because both the reviewing subcommittee and the committee rejected his motion to dismiss for duplicative complaints, thereby rendering any further administrative remedies futile or inadequate. As we already have indicated, however, the plaintiff can obtain the remedy he seeks \u2014 dismissal of grievance complaint no. 95-0107 \u2014 if, after a hearing on the merits of the complaint, it is not established, by clear and convincing evidence, that he engaged in professional misconduct in connection with his representation of Willis in 1988. \u201cIt is not the plaintiffs preference for a particular remedy that determines whether the remedy ... is adequate . . . and an administrative remedy, in order to be \u2018adequate,\u2019 need not comport with the plaintiffs opinion of what a perfect remedy would be.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Prior, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 434; see also <em>O &amp; G Industries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>232 Conn. 419, 426, 655 A.2d 1121 (1995) (\u201can administrative remedy is adequate when it could provide the plaintiff with the relief that it seeks and provide a mechanism for judicial review\u201d). Moreover, \u201c[f]utility is more than a mere allegation that the administrative agency might not grant the relief requested. In most instances, [this court has] held that the failure to exhaust an administrative remedy is permissible only when the administrative remedy would be useless.\u201d <em>Concerned Citizens of Sterling </em>v. <em>Sterling, 204 </em>Conn. 551, 560, 529 A.2d 666 (1987).<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In light of the fact that it ultimately may be determined that the allegations of misconduct contained in grievance complaint no. 95-0107 lack merit, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>plaintiff has failed to establish that the administrative remedies still available to him necessarily are futile or inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">The plaintiff next claims that his constitutional due process rights were violated because the statewide bar counsel failed to follow the procedural mies governing attorney grievance complaints. Specifically, the plaintiff alleges that the statewide bar counsel improperly failed to forward the grievance complaint to the chair of the committee, or to an attorney designee of the chair, and to a nonattomey member of the committee for preliminary screening and possible dismissal as provided by Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This claim also is without merit. Under Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a); see footnote 13 of this opinion; the statewide bar counsel has the discretion <em>either </em>to forward the complaint to a local grievance panel for investigation and review; Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (1); <em>or </em>to refer the complaint to the chair of the committee, or to the chair\u2019s attorney designee, and to a nonattorney member of the committee for screening and possible dismissal. Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2). In this case, the statewide bar counsel opted to forward the complaint to the local panel in accordance with the express provisions of the rule. Contraiy to the plaintiffs claim, nothing in Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 mandates that the statewide bar counsel refer an allegedly duplicative complaint for preliminary screening under Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2). Furthermore, an attorney who is the subject of a duplicative complaint does not have an absolute right, under Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D), to dismissal of that complaint. On the contraiy, Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) provides that a complaint shall be dismissed only <em>\u201cif deemed </em>appropriate(emphasis added); by the chair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>of the committee, or the chair\u2019s attorney designee, and the nonattomey member acting in conjunction with the statewide bar counsel. Because the statewide bar counsel acted properly in referring the matter to a grievance panel under what is now Practice Book \u00a7 2-32 (a) (2) (D), the plaintiffs due process claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">Finally, the plaintiff contends that he should be excused from failing to exhaust his administrative remedies because injunctive relief is necessary to avoid immediate and irreparable harm to his practice and reputation.

In such circumstances, the very hearing that the plaintiff seeks to avoid affords him an adequate legal remedy.
