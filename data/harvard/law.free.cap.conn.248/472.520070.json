App. 778, 785, 700 A.2d 1190 (1997). We granted certification limited to the following issue: \u201cDid the Appellate Court properly conclude that, under the evidence in this case, the third and fourth prongs of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588 [427 A.2d 414] (1980), were satisfied, in that the trial court was required to give a charge on the lesser included offense of larceny in the sixth degree?\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>243 Conn. 946, 704 A.2d 800 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The details of the incident that led to the defendant\u2019s conviction are set forth in the opinion of the Appellate Court; <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 779-80; and may be summarized as follows. On March 19,1994, the defendant entered Milk Plus, a convenience store located in Fairfield. A customer of the store noticed the defendant conceal several packs of cigarettes under his shirt. The customer alerted the cashier, Karem Sha-ham, to the defendant\u2019s actions, at which point Shaham also observed the defendant\u2019s conduct. When the defendant then attempted to leave the store without paying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>for the cigarettes, Shaham jumped over the counter and attempted to detain the defendant. A struggle ensued, during which Shaham ripped the defendant\u2019s shirt, and several packs of cigarettes fell to the floor. When he tore the defendant\u2019s shirt, Shaham noticed that the defendant also had three bottles of liquor concealed on his person. Suspecting that the liquor had been taken from an affiliated, neighboring store, Grasmere Liquor Store,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Shaham seized one of the bottles and put it on the counter. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The struggle between Shaham and the defendant continued into the parking lot. In the course of the struggle, Shaham attempted to recover another liquor bottle from the defendant. The defendant, however, wrested the bottle from Shaham and held it over Shaham\u2019s head as if to strike him. The defendant then escaped into a car that was waiting for him in the parking lot. Thereafter, Shaham entered Grasmere Liquor Store and confirmed that three bottles of liquor, identical to those he had observed in the defendant\u2019s possession, were missing from the liquor store.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id., 780.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">At trial, the defendant\u2019s primary theory of defense was that he had not been at Milk Plus when the crime was committed and, thus, was not the perpetrator of the crime. Nevertheless, he requested that the court instruct the jury on the lesser included crimes of robbery in the third degree and larceny in the sixth degree. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>In support of his contention that he was entitled to an instruction on larceny in the sixth degree, the defendant, in his request to charge, maintained for the first time that the jury reasonably could find that \u201cno force was used and that no robbery took place but that items valued less than $100 were taken.\u201d The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s request with respect to robbery in the third degree but denied the defendant\u2019s request for an instruction on larceny in the sixth degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The Appellate Court, however, concluded that the evidence entitled the defendant to an instruction on larceny and, therefore, reversed the trial court\u2019s decision. Id., 785. In this appeal, the state maintains that the Appellate Court improperly reversed the trial court\u2019s decision not to charge on larceny because there was insufficient controverted evidence to support the defendant\u2019s request for that charge. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">We previously have articulated a four-pronged test for determining whether a defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. \u201cA defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if . . . (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>195 Conn. 567, 574, 489 A.2d 1024 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 588.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>\u201cIn considering whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements set forth in <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 260-61, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). \u201c[T]he jury\u2019s role as fact-finder is so central to our jurisprudence that, in close cases, the trial court should generally opt in favor of giving an instruction on a lesser included offense, if it is requested.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 68, 621 A.2d 728 (1993). \u201cOn appeal, an appellate court must reverse a trial court\u2019s failure to give the requested instruction if we cannot as a matter of law exclude [the] possibility that the defendant is guilty only of the lesser offense.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 74, 663 A.2d 972 (1995). \u201cOtherwise the defendant would lose the right to have the jury pass upon every factual issue fairly presented by the evidence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 575; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>185 Conn. 63, 78, 441 A.2d 84 (1981). These principles do not mean, however, that the evidence must be unrealistically parsed in contravention of how it was presented to and reasonably could have been perceived by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">The focal question raised by the defendant\u2019s claim involves the fourth prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test: whether the evidence of the element that differentiated the allegedly included offense of larceny from the greater offense of robbery was \u201csufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>supra, 179 Conn. 588. We previously have stated that \u201c[e]vidence [of the differentiating element] is \u2018 \u201csufficiently in dispute\u201d where it is of such a factual quality that would permit the finder of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>reasonably to find the defendant guilty on the lesser included offense. This requirement serves to prevent a jury from <em>capriciously convicting on the lesser included offense </em>when the evidence requires either conviction on the greater offense or acquittal.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Manley, [supra, 195 Conn. 579], quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Whist-nant, </em>supra [588].\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mon-tanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 23, 592 A.2d 149 (1991). Moreover, \u201cthe trial court, in making its determination whether the proof is \u2018sufficiently in dispute,\u2019 while it must carefully assess all the evidence whatever its source, is \u2018not required to put the case to the jury on a basis [of a lesser included offense] that essentially indulges and even encourages speculations as to [a] bizarre reconstruction [of the evidence].\u2019 <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sinclair, </em>444 F.2d 888, 890 (D.C. Cir. 1971).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 579-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">It is well established that the element differentiating robbery from larceny is the use or threatened immediate use of physical force. <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>181 Conn. 388, 398, 435 A.2d 1002, cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1086, 101 S. Ct. 874, 66 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1981). Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, the statute that defines robbery, proscribes the use of physical force for: \u201c(1) [preventing or overcoming resistance to the taking of the property or to the retention thereof immediately after the taking; or (2) compelling the owner of such property or another person to deliver up the property or to engage in other conduct which aids in the commission of the larceny.\u201d We previously have stated that \u201cunder General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133, if the use of force occurs during the continuous sequence of events surrounding the taking or attempted taking, even though some time immediately before or after, it is considered to be \u2018in the course of the robbery or the attempted robbery within the meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ghere, </em>201 Conn. 289, 297, 513 A.2d 1226 (1986). In the present case, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>undisputed that the defendant used physical force upon Shaham during the continuous sequence of events immediately following his taking of cigarettes from Milk Plus. The defendant, however, argues that the jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant used force upon Shaham without the necessary intent to retain the stolen property because he was no longer in possession of the stolen property, but instead was acting in self-defense or to effectuate escape. Therefore, the dispositive question in this appeal is whether the evidence relating to the defendant\u2019s intent in using force upon Shaham was \u201csufficiently in dispute,\u201d as required by the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">The record reveals the following related to the defendant\u2019s use of force. The defendant entered Milk Plus and concealed several packs of cigarettes in his shirt. He then attempted to leave the store without paying for the cigarettes. Shaham confronted the defendant in front of the exit door, and the two men engaged in a struggle. It is undisputed that, at the time the two men began to struggle, the defendant was in possession of stolen cigarettes. In the course of the straggle, Shaham ripped the defendant\u2019s shirt, causing several packs of cigarettes to fall to the floor. The struggle continued, unbroken, into the parking lot, at which point the men exchanged blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">The defendant maintains, however, that he was entitled to an instruction on larceny in the sixth degree because the jury reasonably could have found that his use of force upon Shaham was not for a puipose proscribed by \u00a7 53a-133. Specifically, the defendant argues that the jury reasonably could have determined that he was no longer in possession of the stolen cigarettes when he used force upon Shaham in the parking lot. Moreover, the defendant contends that, from that determination, the jury reasonably could have drawn the inference that the defendant was aware that he no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>longer retained possession of the stolen cigarettes. Relying upon that inference, the defendant maintains that the jury reasonably could have drawn the further inference that, when the defendant fought with Shaham in the parking lot, the defendant\u2019s sole intent was either to escape or to defend himself, two uses of force not proscribed by \u00a7 53a-133. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Coston, </em>182 Conn. 430, 435-36, 438 A.2d 701 (1980) (defendant not guilty of attempted robbery where he voluntarily relinquished stolen property and then used force solely to effectuate escape).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">We conclude, however, that the evidence presented at trial does not support the inferences suggested by the defendant. Specifically, the defendant concedes that the evidence established that he was in possession of stolen cigarettes when he was initially engaged by Sha-ham, and that at no point did he voluntarily relinquish possession of the stolen cigarettes. His argument, therefore, relies on the premise that the jury reasonably could have determined that he had been <em>completely divested </em>of the stolen cigarettes <em>before </em>he pushed and struck Shaham during the course of the struggle. Even viewed in the light most favorable to the defendant, however, the evidence does not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">At trial, the only testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s possession of stolen cigarettes during the course of the struggle was presented by Shaham. After Shaham unequivocally stated that the defendant was in possession of the stolen cigarettes when the defendant struck him outside the store, the prosecutor asked Shaham to identify several packages of cigarettes that the police had retrieved from the floor of the store, so that they could be admitted into evidence. At that point, the defendant\u2019s attorney conducted a voir dire in order to challenge the admissibility of the cigarettes. During that voir dire, Shaham provided the following testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>\u201c[Defense Counsel:] Where were <em>these </em>cigarettes obtained from \u2014 retrieved from?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-6\">\u201c[Shaham:] From the side of the counter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">\u201cQ. Were they on the counter or on the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-8\">\u201cA. When the police retrieved them or I retrieved them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-9\">\u201cQ. When the police retrieved them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-10\">\u201cA. On the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-11\">\u201cQ. All <em>these </em>packages of cigarettes\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-12\">\u201cA. When I ripped his shirt, everything fell on the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-13\">\u201cQ. All <em>these </em>cigarettes came out \u2014 off the floor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-14\">\u201cA. <em>Plus more cigarettes were in his shirt </em>....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-15\">\u201cQ. All <em>these </em>cigarettes came off the floor; is what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-16\">\u201cA. Yes.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-17\">Significantly, the defendant made no attempt to challenge Shaham\u2019s testimony that additional cigarettes remained in the defendant\u2019s shirt. In the context in which it was elicited, Shaham\u2019s testimony clearly was to the effect that the cigarettes that the state sought to introduce had come from the floor of the store, but that additional cigarettes had remained in the defendant\u2019s possession. Shaham\u2019s testimony on voir dire reasonably could not have been interpreted to mean that, when the defendant\u2019s shirt was ripped, he was completely divested of stolen cigarettes. See <em>Decho </em>v. <em>Shutkin, </em>144 Conn. 102, 106, 127 A.2d 618 (1956) (jury cannot \u201c \u2018cull statements from the testimony . . . which in and of themselves are not complete but are dependent upon other testimony\u2019 \u201d); <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>Pantaleo, </em>143 Conn. 290, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>295, 122 A.2d 21 (1956) (same). Moreover, on cross-examination, Shaham further stated: \u201cI ripped his shirt open, that\u2019s how the cigarettes were all left on the floor. That\u2019s how <em>they all </em>got on the floor. <em>There were more cigarettes in his shirt, plus\u25a0 </em>\u2014 \u25a0\u201d (Emphasis added.) Here, too, the defendant did not challenge Shaham\u2019s testimony that \u201c[t]here were more cigarettes in his shirt Shaham\u2019s testimony, therefore, indicated that the cigarettes that had been introduced into evidence had been recovered from the floor of the store, but that the defendant remained in possession of stolen cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Neither the state nor the defendant introduced any other evidence regarding the cigarettes. Consequently, the jury was not provided with any basis for concluding that the defendant possessed no stolen cigarettes when he fought with Shaham in the parking lot. The testimony that was introduced regarding the cigarettes, therefore, was not reasonably capable of supporting the inference that the defendant\u2019s use of force in the parking lot was intended <em>solely </em>for purposes of escape or self-defense, and not intended, at least in part, for purposes of retaining possession of the stolen cigarettes.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Finally, the defendant argues that, <em>even if he </em>was in possession of stolen cigarettes when he fought with Shaham, the jury reasonably could have found that the defendant\u2019s use of force was intended solely for purposes of escape or self-defense. \u201cWhile this defendant, of course, was under no obligation to present evidence in his own behalf, we recognize as a practical matter that the defendant, for purposes of the <em>Whistnant </em>test, ought, in order to be entitled to a jury instruction on a lesser included offense, to endeavor to place a particular element of the crime \u2018sufficiently in dispute\u2019 under the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant.\u201d State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>In the present case, there was no evidence or testimony of any kind before the jury that indicated that the defendant\u2019s use of force was intended solely for purposes of escape or self-defense. Consequently, the mere unsubstantiated possibility that the defendant\u2019s use of force was intended solely for purposes of escape or self-defense did not entitle the defendant to an instruction on the lesser included offense of larceny in the sixth degree. See, e.g., id., 579; <em>State </em>v. <em>Tinsley, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 398. Although the defendant undoubtedly was attempting to escape when he fought with Shaham in the parking lot, the conclusion that his use of force was motivated solely by that desire would be a mere guess, not a reasonable inference drawn from the evidence presented. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Manley, </em>supra, 195 Conn. 579-80 (trial court not required to put case to jury on basis of lesser included offense that indulges or encourages speculation).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">We conclude, therefore, that the issue of whether the defendant\u2019s use of force was for a purpose proscribed by \u00a7 53a-133 was not \u201csufficiently in dispute,\u201d as required by the fourth prong of <em>Whistnant. </em>As a result, an instruction to the jury on the lesser included offense of larceny in the sixth degree was not justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">In this opinion BORDEN, NORCOTT and PETERS, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b491-8\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) A person is guilty of robbery in the first degree when, in the course of the commission of the crime of robbery as defined in section 53a-133 or of immediate flight therefrom, he or another participant in the crime: (1) Causes serious physical injury to any person who is not a participant in the crime; or (2) is armed with a deadly weapon; or (3) uses or threatens the use of a dangerous instrument; or (4) displays or threatens the use of what he represents by his words or conduct to be a pistol, revolver, rifle, shotgun, machine gun or other firearm . . . .

App. 778, 788, 700 A.2d 1190 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">In order to reach the contrary conclusion, the majority must ignore our well settled law pertaining to the accused\u2019s right to have the jury instructed on a lesser included offense. \u201c[W]e view the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s request for a charge on the lesser included offense. <em>State </em>v. <em>Montanez, </em>219 Conn. 16, 22-23, 592 A.2d 149 (1991); <em>State </em>v. <em>Herring, </em>210 Conn. 78, 106, 554 A.2d 686, cert. denied, 492 U.S. 912,109 S.

Falby, </em>187 Conn. 6, 30, 444 A.2d 213 (1982). <em>State </em>v. <em>Arena, </em>235 Conn. 67, 73-74, 663 A.2d 972 (1995).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Tomasko, </em>238 Conn. 253, 261, 681 A.2d 922 (1996). In short, a conviction that follows a trial court\u2019s failure to deliver a lesser included offense charge must be reversed unless no rational jury, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, reasonably could have found that the defendant committed the lesser offense. This is perhaps the most lenient standard of review that exists in our law, and for good reason: the only consequence of a charge on a lesser included offense is that it permits the jury to resolve a factual issue, subject to all the procedural safeguards associated with verdicts based upon insufficient evidence. Although the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>majority quotes the same words that I have quoted, it does not appear to understand what they mean.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">The dispositive question in this appeal is whether, considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, the jury reasonably could have determined that the defendant neither used nor threatened to use physical force \u201cfor the purpose of . . . overcoming resistance ... to the retention [of stolen property] immediately after the taking . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Appellate Court answered this question in the affirmative. <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 785. When viewed through the lens supplied by our exceedingly lenient standard of review, this conclusion is clearly correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">First of all, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not possess any stolen property at the time that he used force. It is necessary to briefly summarize the relevant facts. The defendant entered a Milk Plus convenience store and stuffed several packs of cigarettes in his shirt. The clerk asked him if he had enough money to pay for the merchandise, and the defendant assured him that he did. Nevertheless, the clerk vaulted over the counter and ripped the defendant\u2019s shirt open, spilling the cigarettes to the floor. Although the clerk claimed that a number of packs of cigarettes remained in the defendant\u2019s shirt, this testimony was contradicted by that of William Revis, the person who drove the defendant to and from the Milk Plus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, no cigarettes were recovered either from Revis\u2019 automobile or from the parking lot outside the Milk Plus, where the altercation relied upon by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>state occurred. It was only <em>after </em>the cigarettes spilled to the floor that the defendant used any force.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant\u2019s proposed jury instruction, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant did not possess any stolen property at the time that he used force. Correlatively, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant did not use force \u201cfor the purpose of . . . overcoming resistance <em>... to the retention [of stolen property] . . . </em>.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-133.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Even if we were to assume arguendo that the defendant retained at least one pack of cigarettes in his shirt, the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant did not use force \u201cfor the purpose of\u2019 overcoming the clerk\u2019s resistance to this hypothetical theft. Significantly, it was the clerk who injected violence into the encounter by vaulting over the counter, attacking the defendant, and ripping open his shirt. Prior to this point, the defendant had employed no force; in fact, he had offered to pay for the cigarettes.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Viewing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>evidence in the light most favorable to the defendant, it is apparent that the jury reasonably could have concluded that the defendant\u2019s use of force was motivated solely by his desire to avoid both physical harm and apprehension by the police.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">The issues in the present case are irreducibly fact-bound. As such, they rest squarely within the province of the jury, the finder of fact in this case. Because I believe that the trial court usurped the role of the jury by refusing to allow it to consider a lesser included offense, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> See footnote 3 of the majority opinion for the text of the relevant larceny statutes at issue in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\"> See footnote 1 of the majority opinion for the complete text of \u00a7 53a-133.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b503-9\"> The defendant claimed mistaken identity, an issue that is not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b503-10\"> Significantly, Revis testified <em>against </em>the defendant\u2019s alibi and \u2014 according to the defendant \u2014 had a motive to harm the defendant through his testimony. More specifically, the defendant testified that Revis was suspicious of the defendant\u2019s relationship with Revis\u2019 girlfriend.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b504-7\"> According to the majority, \u201c[i]t is undisputed that, at the time the two men began to struggle, the defendant was in possession of stolen cigarettes.\u201d This is not a fair characterization of the evidence, let alone one that views the testimony adduced at trial in the light most favorable to the defendant. To begin with, it is undisputed that the two men were not equally culpable for the use of force: the clerk threw the first punch by vaulting over the counter, attacking the defendant, and ripping open his shirt. Moreover, for the reasons explained in the body of this dissent, the jury reasonably could have concluded that all the cigarettes spilled to the floor before the defendant had used any force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\"> The majority makes the curious argument that \u201cthe jury was not provided with any basis for concluding that the defendant possessed <em>no </em>stolen cigarettes when he fought with [the clerk] in the parking lot.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This statement betrays a misunderstanding of our standard of review. In fact, the more appropriate point to make is that the jury reasonably could have declined to credit the self-serving testimony of the clerk that the defendant possessed stolen property at the time that he used force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b504-9\"> According to the majority, \u201cit is undisputed that the defendant used physical force upon [the clerk] during the continuous sequence of events immediately following his taking of cigarettes from Milk Plus.\u201d This is untrue. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>In my view, a jury reasonably could have concluded that the clerk\u2019s intervening acts of violence disrupted the continuity of what was supposed to have been a surreptitious shoplifting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b505-12\"> An eyewitness corroborated this interpretation of the evidence by \u201ctestifying] that she saw [the clerk] grab the defendant and that she thought the defendant pushed [the clerk] away.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Preston, </em>supra, 46 Conn. App. 784. Nevertheless, the majority claims that \u201cthere was no . . . testimony of any kind before the jury that indicated that the defendant\u2019s use of force was intended solely for purposes of escape or self-defense.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
