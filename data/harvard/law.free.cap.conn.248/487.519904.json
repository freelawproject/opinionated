Although the defendant is not the child\u2019s biological father, the trial court estopped him from denying paternity and issued temporary child support orders against him. The issues to be decided in this appeal are whether: (1) the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56/ had jurisdiction to order temporary child support for a child when the defendant in the dissolution action is not the biological father of the child; (2) the trial court acted improperly when it equitably estopped the defendant from denying paternity of the child; and (3) the trial court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> acted improperly in failing to modify an earlier temporary child support order despite its finding of no substantial change in the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The trial court set forth the following relevant facts and underlying procedural history. Soon after the plaintiff and the defendant had begun to have sexual relations, the plaintiff informed the defendant that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>might be pregnant. After the pregnancy was confirmed, but before the birth of the child, both parties recognized that the defendant might not be the child\u2019s biological father. Following the child\u2019s birth on June 15, 1986, the parties agreed that the child should bear the defendant\u2019s last name.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Soon thereafter, the plaintiff moved to Rhode Island to live with the defendant. Following her arrival, the plaintiff applied for public assistance, naming her former boyfriend, D, as the father of the child. Before the plaintiff could complete the documents necessary to institute paternity proceedings, however, the defendant destroyed the documents. The trial court found that the defendant had persuaded the plaintiff not to seek blood tests to determine paternity, and, consequently, to forgo public assistance and child support from D. The trial court found further that the defendant had taken such actions because he did not want D to play any role in the life of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The parties continued to live together for approximately the next three years. On March 11, 1989, they married after the plaintiff had become pregnant with the defendant\u2019s child. Their child, whose paternity the defendant does not challenge, was bom on July 28,1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">On January 21, 1997, the plaintiff commenced the dissolution action underlying the present appeal. The trial court, by agreement of the parties, issued a temporary child support order, which obligated the defendant to pay the plaintiff a total of $175 per week for both children. According to the defendant\u2019s financial affidavit, in March, 1997, the defendant was earning $724 per week in gross income, with a net income of $493 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">One month later the defendant moved to modify the child support order. On May 5, 1997, the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>granted a downward modification, ordering the defendant to pay $150 per week for both children. At that time, the defendant\u2019s affidavit reflected a gross income of $507 per week, with a net income of $349 per week.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Subsequently, the plaintiff moved for an upward modification of the child support order. On September 29, 1997, the court granted the motion, increased the order to $201 per week and $40 per week against the $800 arrearage.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s financial affidavit indicated a net income of $403 per week at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">On November 17, 1997, the defendant moved for a blood test to establish the paternity of the older child, and for a downward modification of the child support order based on an alleged substantial decrease in his income. Prior to filing this motion the plaintiff had, on occasion, suggested paternity testing to establish conclusively the paternity of the older child, but the defendant had consistently refused to submit to such testing because, according to the trial court, he feared it would reveal that he was not the father of the child. Until the time of the motion for the blood test, the defendant consistently had treated the older child as his own daughter, despite her uncertain parentage. On November 17, 1997, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for paternity testing. The test results excluded the defendant as the father of the child.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Despite the paternity test results, the trial court, relying on the doctrine of equitable estoppel, barred the defendant from disclaiming that he is the father of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>older child. The court found that the defendant had acted consistently as the father of the older child, providing emotional and financial support throughout her entire life. The court found further that the parties had raised the child to believe that the defendant is her father, and that indeed, they had never told the child otherwise. Consequently, according to the court, discovering that the defendant is not her biological father as a consequence of this action would have an extremely deleterious emotional effect on her.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Additionally, on a financial level, the court found that the defendant had frustrated the plaintiffs earlier attempts to discern medically who was the child\u2019s biological father as well as her efforts to collect public assistance from Rhode Island, and child support from the child\u2019s natural father. The court found that, as a result, the plaintiff had failed to collect child support from D for nearly twelve years. According to the court\u2019s findings, at the time of the hearing, the whereabouts and wherewithal of D were unknown. Therefore, the plaintiffs current ability to obtain child support from D is uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Finally, the trial court concluded that the defendant had failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his financial circumstances had changed substantially since the issuance of the most recent child support order of September 29, 1997. The trial court, therefore, denied the defendant\u2019s motion for modification. The defendant appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the trial court: (1) did not have jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to order temporary child support for the child in question; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>(2) improperly estopped the defendant from denying paternity of the child; and (3) acted improperly when it refused to modify the child support order pursuant to \u00a7 46b-84.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">As a general matter of jurisprudence, we resolve issues concerning a court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction before turning to the merits of the parties\u2019 claims. See, e.g., <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Gilbert &amp; Bennett Mfg. Co., </em>241 Conn. 282, 289, 695 A.2d 1051 (1997). In the present case, the defendant claims that the child is not a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d because he is not the child\u2019s biological father. On that basis, the defendant contends that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to order temporary child support. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">Although it is well settled that trial courts have broad equitable remedial powers regarding marital dissolu-tions; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>244 Conn. 403, 423, 710 A.2d 1297 (1998); it is also undisputed that the trial court\u2019s power to dissolve a marriage and to order custody, care and education of any minor children of the parties, incidental to the dissolution action, is statutorily based. <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>165 Conn. 665, 668, 345 A.2d 561 (1974); <em>Dunham </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>97 Conn. 440, 443-44, 117 A. 504 (1922); <em>Steele </em>v. <em>Steele, </em>35 Conn. 48, 54 (1868). Consequently, the issue of the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction is one of statutory construction, over which our review is plenary. <em>Morton Buildings, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bannon, </em>222 Conn. 49, 53, 607 A.2d 424 (1992); see <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">An extensive analysis of the pertinent statutes is unnecessary, however, in light of our recent decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>in <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 422, wherein we held that although the concept of a \u201cchild of the marriage\u201d continues to define who is considered legally to be a parent, it no longer creates jurisdictional limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Doe, </em>this court verified a dissolution court\u2019s jurisdiction, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-56, over the issue of the custody and support of a minor child who did not fit the statutory definition of a \u201cchild of the marriage.\u201d Id., 439. Specifically, based upon the statutory scheme governing domestic disputes, this court concluded that, although \u201cthe concept of \u2018child of the marriage,\u2019 and its corresponding definition of parentage, [once] imposed jurisdictional limitations on the trial court\u2019s power to enter custody [and support] orders in dissolution cases,\u201d the definition of parenthood no longer imposes a jurisdictional limitation on a dissolution court with regard to custody and support determinations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Id.; see generally <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>177 Conn. 47, 50, 411 A.2d 25 (1979) (jurisdiction to make and enforce orders for care, custody, and education of minor children is derived from court\u2019s statutory jurisdiction over dissolution of marriage). Therefore, we conclude that, regardless of whether the child at issue in the present case is considered a \u201cchild of the marriage,\u201d the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to order pendente lite child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">The second issue on appeal is whether the trial court acted improperly when it equitably estopped the defendant from denying that he is the father of the plaintiff s older child. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s action was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Before turning to the merits of the parties\u2019 arguments, we first set forth principles that will assist us in resolving this issue. To begin, it is well settled that \u201cjudicial review of a trial court\u2019s exercise of its broad discretion in domestic relations cases is limited to the questions of whether the court correctly applied the law and could reasonably have concluded as it did. E.g., <em>Smith </em>v. Smith, 185 Conn. 491, 494, 441 A.2d 140 (1981); <em>Basile </em>v. <em>Basile, </em>185 Conn. 141, 144, 440 A.2d 876 (1981); <em>McGuinness </em>v. <em>McGuinness, </em>185 Conn. 7, 13, 440 A.2d 804 (1981). \u2018It is the sole province of the trial court to weigh and interpret the evidence before it and to pass upon the credibility of witnesses.\u2019 <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 493.\u201d <em>Beede </em>v. <em>Beede, </em>186 Conn. 191, 194-95, 440 A.2d 283 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">The party claiming estoppel \u2014 in this case, the plaintiff \u2014 has the burden of proof. <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>218 Conn. 681, 699, 590 A.2d 957 (1991). Whether that burden has been met is a question of fact that will not be overturned unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>Dornfried, </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, Inc., </em>230 Conn. 622, 636, 646 A.2d 772 (1994); <em>Middlesex Mutual Assurance Co. </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>supra, 699. A court\u2019s determination is clearly erroneous only in cases in which the record contains no evidence to support it, or in cases in which there <em>is </em>evidence, but the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. <em>Dornfried </em>v. <em>October Twenty-Four, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number><em>Inc., </em>supra, 636; see also <em>Barbara Weisman, Trustee </em>v. <em>Raspar, </em>233 Conn. 531, 541, 661 A.2d 530 (1995). The legal conclusions of the trial court will stand, however, only if they are legally and logically correct and are consistent with the facts of the case. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>supra, 181 Conn. 221-22. Accordingly, we will reverse the trial court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding estoppel only if they involve an erroneous application of the law. See <em>Deer Hill Arms II Ltd. Partnership </em>v. <em>Planning Commission, </em>239 Conn. 617, 628, 686 A.2d 974 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">Strong public policies have long formed the basis of the doctrine of equitable estoppel.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> \u201cThe office of an equitable estoppel is to show what equity and good conscience require, under the particular circumstances of the case, irrespective of what might otherwise be the legal rights of the parties.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State ex rel. DeGregorio </em>v. <em>Woodruff, </em>135 Conn. 31, 36, 60 A.2d 653 (1948). \u201cNo one is ever estopped from asserting what would otherwise be his right, unless to allow its assertion would enable him to do a wrong.\u201d <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Mechanics Savings Bank, </em>79 Conn. 38, 41, 63 A. 658 (1906).</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">\u201cThere are two essential elements to an estoppel: the party must do or say something which is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain facts and to act upon that belief; and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do something to his injury which he otherwise would not have done. Estoppel rests on the misleading conduct of one party to the prejudice of the other. In the absence of prejudice, estoppel does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>exist. <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>153 Conn. 633, 643, 220 A.2d 254 [1966]; <em>Themper v. Themper, </em>132 Conn. 547, 550, 45 A.2d 826 [1946], <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>supra, [165 Conn.] 669.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Remkiewicz </em>v. <em>Remkiewicz, </em>180 Conn. 114, 119, 429 A.2d 833 (1980); see also <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 445 (\u201cestoppel requires proof of two facts: [1] misleading conduct by one party; and [2] detrimental reliance thereon by the other party\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Although this court has considered the doctrine of equitable estoppel in dissolution proceedings, the record in those cases did not support a finding of estop-pel. See, e.g., <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 445 (\u201c[d] espite the plaintiffs claim in her brief that she did not pursue an adoption of the child because of the defendant\u2019s assurance to her that she was the child\u2019s mother, there is no such evidence in this record from which such an inference could be drawn\u201d); <em>Remkiewicz </em>v. <em>Remkiewicz, </em>supra, 180 Conn. 119-20 (\u201c[i]t appears from the evidence that neither the state nor [the child\u2019s] mother changed position to the injury of either one in reliance on the affidavit of parentage\u201d). Consequently, this court has not had the opportunity to explore fully the parameters of the doctrine in the context of a denial of parenthood and appurtenant child support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">To provide the framework necessary for the resolution of the issue, therefore, we now analyze the doctrine and more fully set forth guidelines as to when a court may properly equitably estop a party in cases such as the present one. To begin, it is important to remember that when all of the elements of estoppel are met, its application prevents an injustice. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Mechanics Savings Bank, </em>supra, 79 Conn. 41. In the context of parental responsibilities, the duty to support the child <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>is placed fairly on the nonparental party, not solely because of his voluntary assumption of a parental role, but, also because of the misleading course of conduct that induced the child, and the biological parent as the child\u2019s guardian, to rely detrimentally on the nonparen-tal party\u2019s emotional and financial support of the child. See <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Morrow, </em>supra, 165 Conn. 669; contra <em>Knill </em>v. <em>Knill, </em>306 Md. 527, 554, 510 A.2d 546 (1986) (Murphy, C. J., dissenting) (applying estoppel because stepparent\u2019s \u201cvoluntary assumption of the parental role over such an extended period now precludes him [or her] from disavowing parental responsibility for child support\u201d). Essentially, such a rule is designed, in part, to discourage misrepresentations by the nonbiological parent.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">It should also be remembered that the party against whom the doctrine is invoked has typically benefited from his status as a parent. <em>Clevenger </em>v. <em>Clevenger, </em>189 Cal. App. 2d 658, 671, 11 Cal. Rptr. 707 (1961). Generally, that party has been given the gift of love and affection by a child who considers and treats him as a parent, and has enjoyed the community\u2019s recognition of him as a parent, which often entails prestige and fulfillment.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">Estopping parties from denying parentage under appropriate circumstances promotes our \u201coft-expressed policy of supporting the integrity of the family unit and protecting the best interests of the child . . . [and the] child\u2019s right to family identification . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Doe, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 469 <em>(Katz, J., </em>concurring and dissenting). Similarly, the doctrine furthers our public policy of favoring the establishment of legal parenthood with all of its accompanying responsibilities. Id., 484 <em>(Katz, J., </em>concurring and dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Before we fully delineate the contours of the doctrine of equitable estoppel in Connecticut, we find it instructive to examine how the courts in other jurisdictions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>have treated this issue. Although courts in many jurisdictions have stated theoretically that a trial court may equitably estop a party to a dissolution proceeding from denying parenthood and appurtenant child support obligations, traditionally, they are strict when it comes to enforcing the requirements of the doctrine.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nevertheless, under the appropriate circumstances, several courts have upheld the doctrine\u2019s application to impose a continuing obligation of child support.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Almost four decades ago, in the seminal case of <em>Clev-enger </em>v. <em>Clevenger, </em>supra, 189 Cal. App. 2d 671, the California Court of Appeals created a rule allowing the doctrine to be successfully invoked when the facts showed \u201cthat the husband represented to the boy that he was his [natural] father, that the husband intended that his representation be accepted and acted upon by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the child, that the child relied [detrimentally] upon the representation and treated the husband as his father and gave his love and affection to him, [and] that the child was ignorant of the true facts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">According to <em>Clevenger, </em>the child\u2019s detrimental reliance in such a situation could take many forms: \u201c(1) It would deprive the child of the potential action of the mother, as his guardian, at the time of the child\u2019s birth, to hold the natural father liable for the support of the child. The child thus relies upon the husband\u2019s representation and does not attempt to find the natural father. . . . This reliance works a definite detriment to the child.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (2) It would induce the child to accept the husband as his natural father and render to him the affection and love of a son, with the son\u2019s reasonable expectation of care, support and education until adulthood. The reversal of this representation, through the publication of the illegitimacy of the child, inflicts deep injury upon him. To be designated as an illegitimate child in preadolescence is an emotional trauma of lasting consequence. Having placed the cloak of legitimacy upon the child, having induced the child to rely upon its protection, the husband by abruptly removing it surely harms the child. The child has therefore relied on the conduct of the husband to his injury. (3) It would induce the child to hold himself out to the community as the natural son of the husband . . . only to suffer the abrupt removal of that status, and to undergo the subsequent social injury.\u201d Id., 671-72. The court in <em>Clevenger </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>elaborated that the party\u2019s representation must be of such a lengthy period that it frustrates any realistic opportunity of discovering the child\u2019s natural parent and creating a parent-child relationship. Id., 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Since <em>Clevenger </em>was decided, courts in various jurisdictions have considered the doctrine, differing as to the circumstances under which a trial court may equitably estop a party from denying the legal obligations of a parent. Most significantly, they diverge as to the type of detrimental reliance that should be required, with the majority rule finding emotional detriment alone insufficient grounds for estoppel.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Of the majority of cases imposing financial detriment as a requirement, <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>97 N.J. 154, 167, 478 A.2d 351 (1984), perhaps most succinctly describes the three components to equitable estoppel \u2014 \u201crepresentation, reliance and detriment\u201d \u2014 cloaking all three in financial garb.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">To begin, the New Jersey Supreme Court set forth its standard regarding misrepresentation. The <em>Miller </em>court did not require that the natural parent invoking the doctrine establish that the children believe that the stepparent is their natural parent, because it did not want to limit estoppel to cases in which the stepparent came into the family when the children were infants. Id., 167-68. The stepparent, however, must have made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>some representation of support to either the children or the natural parent. Id., 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Most significantly, the <em>Miller </em>court required that the natural parent invoking the doctrine establish that, if the stepparent is not estopped, the children will suffer <em>future </em>financial detriment as a result of the stepparent\u2019s past active interference with the financial support by the child\u2019s natural parent. Id., 168-69. It is imperative for the stepparent to have taken positive steps of interference with the natural parent\u2019s support obligations in order for the court to bind the stepparent to support the children in the event of a divorce. Id., 170. Future economic detriment is established, for instance, whenever a custodial natural parent proves \u201cthat he or she (1) does not know the whereabouts of the natural parent; (2) cannot locate the other natural parent; or (3) cannot secure jurisdiction over the natural parent for valid legal reasons, <em>and </em>that the natural parent\u2019s unavailability is due to the actions of the stepparent . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 169.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">Persuaded by the reasoning in <em>Miller, </em>we conclude that the equitable estoppel doctrine properly imposes a burden on the party seeking to invoke the doctrine to demonstrate representations of financial as well as emotional support. The concerns about misrepresentation and detrimental reliance are placed more appropriately on any promises of emotional <em>and </em>financial support, not on any misrepresentations and reliance regarding biological parentage. Requiring that children <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>believe that the stepparent is their natural parent unjustly would deny support to some children who, nevertheless, have relied detrimentally on representations of emotional and financial support.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Furthermore, to permit estoppel when there is <em>only </em>emotional detriment would create enormous policy difficulties. Id., 168; see <em>K.A.T. </em>v. <em>C.A.B., </em>645 A.2d 570, 572 (D.C. App. 1994). A requirement of emotional detriment alone would discourage parent-child bonding by rewarding stepparents who do not create a familial bond with their stepchildren, while punishing those who do, by requiring them to be responsible for them as a legal parent in the event of a divorce. <em>K.A.T. </em>v. <em>C.A.B., </em>supra, 572; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 97 N.J. 168. In contrast to financial harm, the emotional harm outlined by the court in <em>Clevenger </em>v. <em>Clevenger, </em>supra, 189 Cal. App. 2d 671-72, while very real, cannot necessarily be prevented by equitable estoppel, which is naturally confined to a party\u2019s legal obligations.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, a rule requiring only emotional detriment could be very difficult for courts to apply. Hence, while emotional detriment should be a factor, it should not be the sole basis upon which to determine whether to apply the equitable estoppel doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">We recognize that, as with other domestic issues, in deciding whether to apply the doctrine of equitable estoppel, courts must act judiciously and with sensitivity to the facts particular to each case. <em>M.H.B. </em>v. <em>H.T.B, </em>100 N.J. 567, 572, 498 A.2d 775 (1985). We are also mindful that equitably estopping parties from denying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>parenthood is an extraordinary measure because it involves a judicially created imposition of parental status and attendant responsibility. <em>K.A. T. </em>v. C.A.B., supra, 645 A.2d 572. It is with such sensitivity and caution that we now turn to the facts of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">Having set forth the doctrine of equitable estoppel in the context of a party attempting to disclaim parenthood and appurtenant child support responsibilities, we turn to the facts of the present case. It is undisputed that the defendant agreed to pay temporary child support as the father of the plaintiffs two children for the first ten months following the institution of the underlying dissolution, and that it was not until November, 1997, that the defendant moved for paternity testing regarding the older child. Subsequently, the trial court estopped the defendant from denying paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">As apart of that determination, the trial court reasonably found that the defendant\u2019s actions had induced the child and her mother, the plaintiff, to believe that the defendant would always emotionally and financially support the child as his own and that the child and her mother had relied on such assurances to their present and future detriment. It is undisputed that the defendant acted as if he were the child\u2019s father throughout the child\u2019s life. Recognizing that the defendant might not be the child\u2019s biological father, the parties nevertheless agreed, immediately after her birth, that the minor child would carry the defendant\u2019s surname. The court found that, throughout the child\u2019s life, the defendant consistently treated her as his daughter and provided her with financial and emotional support. There is little doubt that the child would suffer an enormous emotional trauma if she learned that the defendant is not her father, or that he was no longer responsible for her well-being. The court also concluded that the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>actions helped to prevent the formation of a loving and nurturing relationship with her natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Additionally, the court found abundant evidence of past, present and future financial detriment as a result of the defendant\u2019s conduct. His actions frustrated the creation of the child\u2019s right to any financial support from her natural father. By destroying the plaintiffs unprocessed paternity papers soon after the child\u2019s birth, the defendant impeded the plaintiffs efforts to seek both child support from the biological father and public assistance from the state of Rhode Island. According to the trial court, the defendant purposefully engaged in such acts because he did not want the child\u2019s natural father to play any role in the child\u2019s life. Consequently, the defendant is the only father who has ever supported or nurtured the child. The trial court found that the whereabouts and wherewithal of D, the man it presumed to be the child\u2019s natural father, were unknown at the time of the hearing. We conclude, therefore, on the basis of the facts as found by the trial court, that the court properly estopped the defendant from denying paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">The third and final issue the defendant has raised on appeal is whether the trial court improperly denied his November 17, 1997 motion to modify the temporary child support order. For the reasons set forth hereinafter, we decline to reach this issue. Thus, we affirm the trial court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">It is well established that an appellate court is under no obligation to consider a claim that is not distinctly raised at the trial level. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>Yale University </em>v. <em>Blumenthal, </em>225 Conn. 32, 36 n.4, 621 A.2d 1304 (1993) (issue not reviewed because not raised at trial). This court will review claims not raised at trial only in extraordinary circumstances. See <em>Williamson </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>v. <em>Commissioner of Transportation, </em>209 Conn. 310, 317, 551 A.2d 704 (1988). \u201c[B]ecause our review is limited to matters in the record, we [also] will not address issues not decided by the trial court. Practice Book \u00a7 4185, [now\u00a7 60-5] (\u2018court on appeal shall not be bound to consider a claim unless it was distinctly raised at the trial\u2019); <em>Crest Pontiac Cadillac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hadley, </em>239 Conn. 437, 444 n. 10, 685 A.2d 670 (1996) (claims \u2018neither addressed nor decided\u2019 by court below are not properly before appellate tribunal); <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>186 Conn. 654, 658, 443 A.2d 906 (1982) (\u2018[o]nly in the most exceptional circumstances will this court consider even a constitutional claim not properly raised and decided in the trial court\u2019).\u201d <em>Willow Springs Condominium Assn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Seventh BRT Development Corp., </em>245 Conn. 1, 52, 717 A.2d 77 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">General Statutes \u00a7 46b-86 (a) sets forth the relevant law regarding this claim. That section provides in relevant part that \u201csupport pendente lite may at any time . . . [be] modified . . . upon a showing of a substantial change in the circumstances of either party or upon a showing that the final order for child support substantially deviates from the child support guidelines established pursuant to section 46b-215a, unless there was a specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be inequitable or inappropriate. <em>il</em></p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">In the present case, in his motion to modify the support order, the defendant argued that since the last support order on September 29, 1997, the defendant\u2019s income had substantially decreased and, therefore, the amount that he previously had been ordered to pay <em>now </em>significantly exceeded both his ability to pay and the amounts provided in the child support guidelines. The trial court denied the motion because the defendant had failed to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that his financial circumstances had changed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>substantially since the time of the September, 1997 order.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">On appeal, the defendant does not challenge the trial court\u2019s finding that his financial circumstances had not changed subsequent to the September, 1997 order. Rather, he claims that when the trial court denied his November, 1997 motion to modify the September, 1997 order, it \u201cabused its discretion in deviating from the child support guidelines without having made the necessary predicate findings, and in imputing available overtime work to his earning capacity without additional findings.\u201d Although \u00a7 46b-86 authorizes the trial court to modify the prior order if the moving party proves that the prior order substantially deviated from the guidelines at the time of the prior order, the defendant never alerted the trial court to the issue of whether the September, 1997 order constituted an unjustified deviation from the guidelines. Consequently, the defendant is responsible for a decision that is silent as to whether the other ground authorized by \u00a7 46b-86 as a basis for modification had been satisfied. We decline to review the defendant\u2019s claim regarding an unjustified deviation at the time of the September, 1997 motion as we deem it to have been waived in the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In conclusion, we hold that the trial court had jurisdiction to determine the pendente lite child support order pursuant to this dissolution action. We also conclude that the trial court acted properly when it equitably estopped the defendant from denying his paternity. Finally, we decline to reach the defendant\u2019s claim regarding the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to modify the trial court\u2019s September, 1997 pendente lite child support order.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-10\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b507-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 46b-56 (a) provides: \u201cIn any controversy before the Superior Court as to the custody or care of minor children, and at any time after the return day of any complaint [seeking the dissolution of a marriage], the court may at any time make or modify any proper order regarding the education and support of the children and of care, custody and visitation if it has jurisdiction under the provisions of chapter 815o [the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act]. Subject to the provisions of section 46b-56a, the court may assign the custody of any child to the parents jointly, to either parent or to a third party, according to its best judgment upon the facts of the case and subject to such conditions and limitations as it deems equitable.

A court can order such support if the natural parent demonstrates that the children are not receiving support from the nonparty natural parent and that \u201cthe stepparent\u2019s conduct actively interfered with the children\u2019s support by their [nonparty] natural parent, so that pendente lite support may not be obtained from the natural parent. . . .\u2019\u2019Id.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b521-8\"> Additionally, because such a requirement could encourage bad faith disclosures by the stepparent hoping to avoid any child support obligations, the requirement is to be avoided.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b521-9\"> For example, although a court can estop a party from legally denying paternity, and, therefore, require him to support a child financially, it cannot prevent a party from telling that child that he is not the child\u2019s biological father or from ceasing to emotionally support the child.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
