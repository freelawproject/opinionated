Initially, we must determine whether the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> entered subsequent to the revocation of his probation, renders this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>appeal moot. We conclude that it does not. Additionally, we must determine whether the state, at the probation revocation hearing, had presented sufficient evidence to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation. We conclude that the state satisfied its burden of proof and, therefore, we affirm the judgment of the trial court revoking the defendant\u2019s probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to this appeal. On September 29, 1995, following his conviction for possession of narcotics in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 21a-279 (a),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the defendant was sentenced to three years of incarceration, execution suspended, and placed on probation for three years. One of the conditions of probation required the defendant to obey all \u201ccriminal law[s] of the United States, this state, or any other state or territory.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">On July 15,1996, the defendant was arrested for allegedly breaking into an automobile in a parking lot in downtown Hartford. As a result, he was charged with criminal mischief in the third degree in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>General Statutes \u00a7 53a-117,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> burglary in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-103,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-125b<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and tampering with a motor vehicle in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-119b (c).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">On the basis of this alleged criminal conduct, the state charged the defendant with violation of his probation, under \u00a7 53a-32; see footnote 1 of this opinion; and a probation revocation hearing commenced on June 24, 1997. Testifying at the hearing, Jesus Martinez, the owner of the vehicle, stated that after he and a friend, Denise Ayala, had left a Hartford club, they observed a person inside Martinez\u2019 vehicle as they approached it. Martinez left the scene to summon the police and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>upon his return, found that the defendant had exited his vehicle and was in the middle of the parking lot. After the defendant had fled the scene, Martinez discovered that one of the windows of his vehicle was broken, and a compact disc player and some tapes were missing from the automobile. Shortly thereafter, while riding in a police patrol car, Martinez saw the defendant on the street and identified him as the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">On July 9, 1997, the trial court found that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation and sentenced him to serve thirty-three months of the three year period of incarceration that previously had been imposed and suspended. The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court from the judgment of the trial court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). During the pendency of this appeal, the defendant pleaded guilty to burglary in the third degree under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine in connection with the incident regarding Martinez\u2019 vehicle. See footnote 2 of this opinion. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court: (1) improperly found that the state had proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation; and (2) violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights by admitting into evidence Martinez\u2019 out-of-court identification of the defendant. The state, however, asserts that the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea renders the appeal moot. Alternatively, the state disputes the defendant\u2019s claims, arguing that: (1) the state presented sufficient evidence of the defendant\u2019s probation violation; and (2) the court should not reach the defendant\u2019s unpreserved due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">We conclude that this appeal is not moot. As to the defendant\u2019s first claim, we conclude that the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>properly found that the state had satisfied its burden of proof. We decline to review the defendant\u2019s due process claim, however, because it fails to satisfy the reviewability portion of the four part test for unpreserved claims that we enunciated in <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Before addressing the defendant\u2019s claims on the merits, we must first determine whether the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea, entered subsequent to the probation revocation hearing that underlies this appeal, renders this appeal moot. \u201cMootness implicates [this] court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction and is thus a threshold matter for us to resolve. ... It is a well-settled general rule that the existence of an actual controversy is an essential requisite to appellate jurisdiction; it is not the province of appellate courts to decide moot questions, disconnected from the granting of actual relief or from the determination of which no practical relief can follow. . . . An actual controversy must exist not only at the time the appeal is taken, but also throughout the pendency of the appeal. . . . When, during the pen-dency of an appeal, events have occurred that preclude an appellate court from granting any practical relief through its disposition of the merits, a case has become moot.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ayala </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>236 Conn. 89, 93-94, 671 A.2d 345 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The state contends that the present appeal is moot because the trial court can grant the defendant no practical relief. According to the state, if the court were to agree with the defendant\u2019s claims on appeal, the defendant could be granted a new probation revocation hearing. The state asserts, however, that the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine would estop him from asserting his innocence at the new hearing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Essentially, the state argues that we can provide no practical relief to the defendant because a reversal of the trial court\u2019s finding that the defendant had violated his probation would not improve the defendant\u2019s prospects. Therefore, according to the state, the defendant\u2019s \u201cconviction controls the outcome of any second probation revocation hearing [and, therefore], the defendant\u2019s appeal is moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The defendant argues that the appeal is not moot because a finding that the evidence was insufficient to establish a violation of probation would entitle him to a judgment of acquittal for the violation of probation charge as well as the underlying offenses. Specifically, the defendant argues that if the court were to conclude that \u201cproof of evidence of felonious conduct [was] not sufficient to establish a violation of probation, proof of such evidence [would] certainly not [be] sufficient to sustain a criminal conviction for such felonious conduct,\u201d because the burden of proof in a criminal prosecution presents the state with a significantly higher threshold to meet than does the burden in a violation of probation proceeding.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The defendant asserts, therefore, that because an acquittal on all charges would clearly afford the defendant practical relief, this appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>We agree with the defendant that his appeal is not moot, although we do so for a different reason. Even if we were to agree with the state\u2019s contention that the defendant would be entitled only to a new hearing at which the violation of probation would be predetermined by his conviction pursuant to his <em>Alford </em>plea, we do not agree that holding such a hearing would be a pointless endeavor, because the trial court would have the discretion to impose a different disposition. Therefore, practical relief could await the defendant following a determination that he had violated a condition of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">We have stated: \u201c[A] probation revocation hearing has two distinct components. . . . The trial court must first conduct an adversarial evidentiary hearing to determine whether the defendant has in fact violated a condition of probation. . . . General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (a). If the trial court determines that the evidence has established a violation of a condition of probation, then it proceeds to the second component of probation revocation, the determination of whether the defendant\u2019s probationary status should be revoked. On the basis of its consideration of the whole record, the trial court may continue or revoke the sentence of probation or conditional discharge or modify or enlarge the conditions, and, if such sentence is revoked, require the defendant to serve the sentence imposed or impose any lesser sentence. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 (b).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In making this second determination, the trial court is vested with broad discretion. <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 167, 540 A.2d 679 (1988) . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>229 Conn. 285, 289-90, 641 A.2d 370 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>We recognize that the defendant\u2019s conviction based on his <em>Alford </em>plea would establish a violation of the conditions of the defendant\u2019s probation, thereby significantly lightening the state\u2019s burden under the first component, the evidentiary phase, of a new probation revocation hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It is the second component, the sentencing phase, however, under which the defendant plausibly may find practical relief. Although a criminal conviction \u201c \u2018affords a more than sufficient basis for revocation of probation\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecoraro, </em>196 Conn. 305, 307, 493 A.2d 180 (1985); because \u201cthe trial judge has \u2018an exceptional degree of flexibility\u2019 in determining whether to grant or revoke probation and on what terms\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 207 Conn. 164, quoting <em>Burns </em>v. <em>United States, </em>287 U.S. 216, 220, 53 S. Ct. 154, 77 L. Ed. 266 (1932); it is by no means a foregone conclusion that, at a new hearing, the defendant will receive the same sentence as that imposed upon him at the first hearing, namely, the revocation of his probation and the imposition of thirty-three months of his three year- suspended sentence. The trial court, in its broad discretion, would be free to choose from among a number of statutorily enumerated dispositions, among which revocation and imposition of a portion of the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence is merely one option. Therefore, we conclude that because this court could grant practical relief to the defendant, the defendant\u2019s appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Having concluded that this appeal is not moot, we next consider the defendant\u2019s claim that the trial court improperly found that the state had presented sufficient evidence to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>that he had violated the conditions of his probation. We conclude that the trial court\u2019s finding was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Before turning to the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, it is useful to note that the burden of proof in a probation revocation hearing is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, as in the case of a criminal prosecution. Rather, according to \u00a7 53a-32 (b), \u201crevocation shall [not] be ordered, except upon consideration of the whole record and unless such violation is established by the introduction of rehable and probative evidence and <em>by a preponderance of the </em>evidence.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>supra, 229 Conn. 295 (burden of establishing probation violation is preponderance of evidence standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">At the defendant\u2019s probation revocation hearing, the state presented two witnesses: probation officer Lawrence Reynolds and Martinez. Reynolds\u2019 testimony may be summarized as follows. In October, 1995, Reynolds met with the defendant, read to him the conditions of his probation, and asked if he fully understood them. The defendant answered in the affirmative and signed the conditions in Reynolds\u2019 presence. On the witness stand, Reynolds read the first condition of probation, which prohibited the defendant from violating any law of the United States, this state, or any other state or territory. Reynolds stated that, in addition to the criminal charges pending against the defendant, the defendant \u201cwas not in good standing at the time of the incident offense\u201d because he had missed about six months of probation reporting, \u201chad used drugs and had been dismissed dissatisfactory from drug treatment,\u201d all of which were violations of the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">Martinez\u2019 testimony may be summarized as follows. Martinez and Ayala had left a Hartford club around 1 a.m. and were walking toward his vehicle when Ayala <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>saw someone inside it. The perpetrator \u201cwas half inside of the trunk area of [his] vehicle and backseat . . . .\u201d The car door was open and the interior light was on. The parking lot itself was also well lit. When he saw the person in his car, Martinez yelled at him, which caused the perpetrator to lift his head and look straight at Martinez for about thirty seconds. The perpetrator then leaned back inside the trunk. Martinez ran to summon the police. When he returned, Martinez found the perpetrator outside the vehicle, in the middle of the parking lot. The perpetrator then fled the scene. Martinez found that a small window of his vehicle was broken, there was damage to the dashboard, and a compact disc player and some tapes were missing from the vehicle. The police drove Martinez and Ayala around the area in a patrol car and, two to three minutes later, they came upon the defendant. Martinez stated that he \u201cpointed out to the policeman that he looks just exactly like the person that was inside my vehicle. We got close to him, and \u2018[t]hat\u2019s the guy,\u2019 I said to the policeman.\u201d When asked if the person he saw in his car was present in the courtroom, Martinez pointed to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">On cross-examination, the defendant identified minor discrepancies in Martinez\u2019 testimony.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The defendant emphasized an alleged inconsistency regarding the perpetrator\u2019s appearance. The defendant noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>although the police report indicated that Martinez had described the perpetrator as \u201cbalding,\u201d Martinez testified that the perpetrator had \u201c[r]eally short hair,\u201d and was \u201c[k]ind of bald but with hair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">The defendant argued that Martinez\u2019 identification was not a sufficient basis upon which to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After viewing a mug shot of the defendant that had been admitted into evidence at the court\u2019s request, the court stated that \u201cit\u2019s a very close haircut. And I could see there where that could be interpreted as balding . . . .\u201d The court then found the defendant in violation of the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">On appeal, the defendant again argues that the evidence presented at the hearing, which consisted primarily of Martinez\u2019 testimony, was insufficient for the trial court to find that the defendant had violated his probation. Specifically, the defendant argues that Martinez glimpsed the defendant only briefly in a parking lot at night, and that he showed confusion about the defendant\u2019s appearance while testifying at the revocation hearing. The defendant claims that the reliability of the identification is further undermined by the fact that the police did not apprehend the defendant at the scene of the crime but, rather, arrested him \u201cin another area of the city at a later time.\u201d These arguments essentially mirror those made to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">On the evidence presented and the testimony elicited at the hearing, we cannot say that the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant violated his probation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>reached after careful consideration of the evidence, was clearly erroneous. <em>See Napoletano v. CIGNA Healthcare of Connecticut, Inc., </em>238 Conn. 216, 232, 680 A.2d 127 (1996), cert. denied, 520 U.S. 1103, 117 S. Ct. 1106, 137 L. Ed. 2d 308 (1997) (appellate court\u2019s review of trial court\u2019s findings of fact \u201cis limited to deciding whether such findings were clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>40 Conn. App. 395, 401, 671 A.2d 379, cert. denied, 236 Conn. 918, 673 A.2d 1145 (1996) (appellate court \u201cmay reverse the trial court\u2019s initial factual determination that a condition of probation has been violated only if [it] determine [s] that such a finding was clearly erroneous\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). \u201cThe determination of a witness\u2019 credibility is the special function of the trial court.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Trine, </em>236 Conn. 216, 227, 673 A.2d 1098 (1996). The trial court in the present case noted that \u201c[t]he whole case here is the credibility of [Martinez] . . . .\u201d After seeing a photograph of the defendant with very short hair, the trial court concluded that Martinez\u2019 description of the defendant as \u201cbald but with hair\u201d was not inconsistent. We presume that the trial court considered the other alleged discrepancies in Martinez\u2019 testimony\u2014 such as his mistake as to the location of the arrest, and whether the defendant had looked at Martinez and Ayala before returning to what he was doing \u2014 arid properly performed its role as fact finder in assessing the credibility of the witness testifying before it. Although it made no such express findings, the trial court reasonably could have believed that: the parking lot lights and the dome light inside Martinez\u2019 car provided sufficient illumination for Martinez to see the perpetrator clearly enough to make an accurate identification; a thirty second viewing of the perpetrator was sufficient to make the identification a reliable one; and two or three minutes was not too long a period of time to elapse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>between the peipetrator\u2019s flight from the crime scene and the defendant\u2019s arrest so as to undermine the reliability of the identification. In sum, the trial court was free to consider the facts and Martinez\u2019 credibility, and to attach to them whatever weight the court reasonably deemed appropriate. We conclude, therefore, in light of all the evidence adduced at the hearing, that the trial court\u2019s determination that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The defendant\u2019s second and final claim is that Martinez\u2019 out-of-court identification of him violated his due process rights. Specifically, the defendant argues that the identification was \u201ctoo suggestive and too unreliable and thus violated the defendant\u2019s due process rights under Connecticut case law.\u201d Citing <em>State </em>v. Myers, 193 Conn. 457, 464, 479 A.2d 199 (1984), the defendant notes that the determination of whether a pretrial identification procedure is violative of a defendant\u2019s due process rights requires a two-pronged test. The first prong is whether the identification procedure was unnecessarily suggestive; the second is whether the resulting identification was not reliable in the totality of the circumstances. Id. The defendant claims that the procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>employed in this case was both unnecessarily suggestive and unreliable.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Because the defendant did not raise this claim before the trial court, we must determine whether the defendant can prevail under the four-prong test articulated <em>instate </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 239-40. In <em>Golding, </em>we held \u201cthat a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if <em>all </em>of the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id. \u201cThe first two steps in the <em>Golding </em>analysis address the reviewability of the claim, while the last two steps involve the merits of the claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 275, 717 A.2d 168 (1998). We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>the defendant\u2019s claim fails under the first prong of the <em>Golding </em>test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">In <em>Golding, </em>we stated that \u201c[t]he defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">We conclude that the record in this case is inadequate for review. We have stated that \u201c[a] record is not inadequate for <em>Golding </em>purposes because the trial court has not reached a conclusion of law if the record contains the factual predicates for making such a determination.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>230 Conn. 372, 378-79, 645 A.2d 529 (1994). In other words, in the present case, if all the facts surrounding the identification procedure were brought to light during the hearing, we could conceivably consider the claim even if the trial court had not done so. The factual background necessary for disposition of this claim, however, is deficient. Neither party questioned Martinez specifically regarding the identification procedure employed. Moreover, none of the police officers who conducted the procedure was called to testify. Finally, the trial court did not make any explicit findings as to the suggestiveness of the procedure. The only description of the procedure contained in the record is that of Martinez, in which he states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>he was driven around the streets of Hartford until he saw someone that looked like the perpetrator. Moreover, we do not know whether Martinez was ever face-to-face with the defendant during the identification;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> how many other people were nearby on the street; how many other people they had passed, as they drove through the streets, that Martinez had <em>not </em>identified as the perpetrator; or what, if anything, the police officers said to him during the ride. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that this claim was not developed sufficiently in the trial court for this court to review the identification procedure for constitutional infiimity. Cf. id., 380 (record adequate for review of claim that canine sniff constituted impermissible search, where state trooper\u2019s uncontested testimony resulted in \u201cundisputed facts sufficient to determine that a canine sniff had occurred and the circumstances under which it had occurred\u201d). Consequently, the defendant\u2019s claim fails to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Golding </em>analysis, and we therefore decline to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In summary, we conclude that this appeal was not rendered moot by the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea. We further conclude that the trial court properly found that the state had presented sufficient evidence to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendant had violated the conditions of his probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C. J., and BORDEN, NOR-COTT and PALMER, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-17\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-32 provides: \u201cViolation of probation or conditional discharge.

Disposition, (a) At any time during the period of probation or conditional discharge, the court or any judge thereof may issue a warrant for the arrest of a defendant for violation of any of the conditions of probation or conditional discharge, or may issue a notice to appear to answer to a charge of such violation, which notice shall be personally served upon the defendant. Any such warrant shall authorize all officers named therein to return the defendant to the custody of the court or to any suitable detention facility designated by the court.

Any probation officer may arrest any defendant on probation without a warrant or may deputize any other officer with power to arrest to do so by giving him a written statement setting forth that the defendant has, in the judgment of the probation officer, violated the conditions of his probation.

It is no secret that many criminal defendants perceive that the system is stacked against them.

In the present appeal, the defendant elected to accept a consecutive sentence of fifteen months in order to avoid the threat of greater punishment. In other words, the defendant conducted a cost/ benefit analysis arid determined that he preferred the certainty of \u201conly\u201d fifteen months to the possibility of a substantially longer sentence.

I share Justice McDonald\u2019s view that we have an obligation to inform criminal defendants and their attorneys of the consequences that flow from <em>Alford </em>pleas, which occupy a central role in our system of criminal justice. Accordingly, I do not join footnote 11 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-8\"> <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L.

The majority today declines to decide whether an <em>Alford</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>plea would bar the defendant from asserting his innocence in any subsequent proceeding. See footnote 11 of the majority opinion. In fairness to criminal defendants who, everyday, and in very large numbers, enter <em>Alford </em>pleas to accept plea bargains while not admitting guilt, and for the sake of the criminal justice system, we should address this issue and not leave it in doubt. In this era <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>of too much violent crime and the allocation of too few judicial resources to the criminal justice system, <em>Alford </em>pleas are essential.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The state contends that the defendant\u2019s appeal is moot because the court cannot grant him any practical relief. Essentially, the state argues that the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea would estop him from establishing his innocence at a new hearing. According to the state, therefore, this court can provide no relief to the defendant because a reversal of the trial court\u2019s finding of a violation of probation ultimately could not change the defendant\u2019s status as a probation violator.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Although a conviction is a \u201cmore than sufficient basis for revocation of probation\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Pecoraro, </em>196 Conn. 305, 307, 493 A.2d 180 (1985); I believe that the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea does not estop him from protesting his innocence at a subsequent hearing and thus his appeal is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>196 Conn. 157, 169 n.3, 491 A.2d 1075 (1985), this court observed that a guilty plea under <em>Alford </em>is a \u201cjudicial oxymoron\u201d because a guilty plea is a confession of guilt. We stated that with \u201ca guilty plea under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine . . . the defendant does not admit guilt but acknowledges that the state\u2019s evidence against him is so strong that he is prepared to accept the entry of a guilty plea nevertheless.\u201d Id. We also observed in <em>Palmer </em>that, \u201c[i]n <em>North Carolina, </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), the United States Supreme Court treated [an <em>Alford </em>plea] as the functional equivalent of a plea of nolo contendere.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>supra, 169 n.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\"><em>In Alford, </em>the United States Supreme Court observed that a guilty plea under which the defendant maintains his innocence is the practical equivalent of a plea of nolo contendere: \u201cThe fact that his plea was denominated a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>plea of guilty rather than a plea of nolo contendere is of no constitutional significance with respect to the issue now before us . . . .Nor can we perceive any material difference between a plea that refuses to admit commission of the criminal act [i.e., a nolo contendere plea] and a plea containing a protestation of innocence [i.e., an <em>Alford </em>plea] . . . .\u201d <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>supra, 400 U.S. 37; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Martin, </em>197 Conn. 17, 20 n.7, 495 A.2d 1028 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">It is well established that a plea of nolo contendere does not establish conclusively a defendant\u2019s guilt in subsequent civil or criminal proceedings. See, e.g., annot., 89 A.L.R.2d 540, 600 (1963) (\u201c[t]he fundamental rule, as unanimously accepted by all the courts as a rule expressing the effect of the plea in the case, is that while the plea of nolo contendere may be followed by a sentence, it does not establish the fact of guilt for any other purpose than that of the case to which it applies\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The United States Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that pleas of nolo contendere may not be used to establish guilt conclusively in subsequent civil and criminal proceedings. See, e.g., <em>Doherty </em>v. <em>American Motors Corp., </em>728 F.2d 334, 337 (6th Cir. 1984) (\u201caplea of nolo contendere is a confession only for the purpose of the criminal prosecution and does not bind the defendant in a civil action for the same wrong\u201d); <em>Lipsky </em>v. <em>Commonwealth United Corp., </em>551 F.2d 887, 893-94 (2d Cir. 1976) (consent decrees, like nolo contendere pleas, may not be used in subsequent proceeding for collateral estoppel purposes, since issues sought to be precluded were not actually litigated). The majority of state courts also have so held. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Ruby, </em>650 P.2d 412, 414 (Alaska App. 1982) (\u201c[A] conviction, even though based upon a plea of nolo contendere, is admissible in a subsequent probation revocation proceeding to prove a violation of law. . . . Consistent with general law governing pleas of nolo contendere, such evidence is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>however, not conclusive against [the defendant]. It does not collaterally estop him from protesting his innocence and, consequently, he should be given an opportunity, if he requests it, to put on evidence which would support his contention that he is not guilty . . . .\u201d); <em>Maselli </em>v. <em>State, </em>446 So. 2d 1079, 1080-81 (Fla. 1984) (at probation revocation proceeding, \u201c[t]he judge may rely on [a] conviction even if it was imposed pursuant to a plea of nolo contendere,\u201d but \u201cthe probationer must be provided an opportunity to be heard on . . . whether he is guilty of the charge to which he pleaded no contest\u201d). Connecticut decisions are in accord with this majority view. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bridgett, </em>3 Conn. Cir. Ct. 206, 208-209, 210 A.2d 182 (1965) (\u201c[t]he defendant is not estopped from denying the facts to which he pleaded nolo contendere in a subsequent judicial civil proceeding\u201d). With respect to an <em>Alford </em>plea, the Appellate Court stated in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>36 Conn. App. 695, 706, 652 A.2d 1050, cert. denied, 233 Conn. 912, 659 A.2d 183 (1995), that \u201can <em>Alford </em>plea . . . would have enabled [the defendant] to continue to maintain his innocence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">I conclude that the defendant\u2019s <em>Alford </em>plea may not be used at a subsequent probation revocation hearing as conclusive proof that he violated the conditions of his probation. The state may present evidence of his conviction at the hearing, but the <em>Alford </em>plea is not dispositive of his guilt of the alleged crime for which he previously entered <em>the Alford </em>plea. At any new probation revocation hearing, I believe that the defendant retains the right to contest his guilt, despite the fact that he had pleaded guilty under the <em>Alford </em>doctrine and was thereby convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">It is this court\u2019s responsibility to guide the parlies and the trial courts. Literally thousands of <em>Alford </em>pleas have been made and may be made with the understanding that the defendant is not admitting guilt. If the effect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>of such a plea will be to bar a later contest of guilt in another proceeding, I fail to see why any defendant would enter an <em>Alford </em>plea. As the highest court in this state, we should either give effect to the \u201cprotestation of innocence\u201d; <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>supra, 400 U.S. 37; in an <em>Alford </em>plea or repudiate our past decisions approving its use.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A civilized criminal justice system demands nothing less.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">I do agree that the trial court carefully and thoughtfully considered the ample evidence demonstrating that the defendant did violate the conditions of his probation. Accordingly, I concur in the result.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> In <em>North Carolina </em>v. <em>Alford, </em>400 U.S. 25, 37-38, 91 S. Ct. 160, 27 L. Ed. 2d 162 (1970), the United States Supreme Court upheld the defendant\u2019s guilty plea even though he continued to proclaim his innocence. The court analogized this guilty plea to a plea of nolo contendere, defined as \u201ca plea by which a defendant does not expressly admit his guilt, but nonetheless waives his right to a trial and authorizes the court for purposes of the case to treat him as if he were guilty.\u201d Id., 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b104-7\"> See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Amarillo, </em>198 Conn. 285, 314 n.17, 503 A.2d 146 (1986) (\u201c[u]nder <em>[Alford], </em>a criminal defendant is not required expressly to admit his guilt, but effectively to consent to being punished as if he were guilty\u201d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman, </em>242 Conn. 523, 527, 700 A.2d 14 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Garvin, </em>242 Conn. 296, 299, 699 A.2d 921 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Domian, </em>235 Conn. 679, 683, 668 A.2d 1333 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Blue, </em>230 Conn. 109, 110, 644 A.2d 859 (1994); <em>Commissioner of Corrections.
