We disagree with the defendant and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In June, 1996, Gray Copeland and the defendant\u2019s mother, Geraldine Lemon, resided together in a first floor apartment at Cambridge Apartments (apartment) on Main Street in Bridgeport. At approximately 6:30 p.m. on June 29, 1996, two security officers, Joseph Gadson and Arquellio Caraballo, who were employed by the apartment\u2019s management, observed the defendant trying to enter the building. Because the apartment manager had instructed Gadson and Caraballo not to allow the defendant on the premises, Gadson and Caraballo asked the defendant to leave. When the defendant failed to comply with the security officers\u2019 request, they contacted the police. A Bridgeport police officer arrived at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>the scene and spoke to the defendant, who explained that her mother and son resided in the building. After ascertaining that the defendant\u2019s mother and son were not at home, the officer asked the defendant to leave and to return only when her mother was there. The defendant then left the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Approximately one hour later, the defendant returned and gained entry into her mother\u2019s apartment. Copeland, who was alone in the apartment at the time, left the apartment to contact security. Copeland, along with Gadson and Caraballo, returned to the apartment and observed the defendant cooking pork chops in the kitchen. The security officers, who observed that the defendant appeared to be intoxicated, asked her to leave, but she would not do so. They then advised Copeland to call the police. Copeland called 911, but because he also had been drinking, he had difficulty communicating with the 911 dispatcher. As a result, Gadson took the telephone receiver from Copeland and proceeded to explain the situation to the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">In the meantime, the defendant asked Copeland why he was having her removed from the apartment. Copeland, who was standing in the doorway to the pantry and looking down, did not respond. The defendant then emerged from the kitchen with a knife and, while screaming an obscenity at Copeland, lunged toward him and stabbed him in the neck.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The knife penetrated three inches into Copeland\u2019s neck, severing an artery. Copeland, bleeding profusely, ran out of the apartment and collapsed on the front lawn. Gadson, who was still on the telephone with the 911 dispatcher, reported the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>stabbing and requested an ambulance. Copeland, however, died from the stab wound shortly after the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Meanwhile, the defendant had fled from the apartment, swinging the knife at Gadson and Caraballo as she fled. The police arrived and apprehended the defendant about one and one-half blocks from the apartment. Thereafter, Gadson and Caraballo positively identified the defendant as Copeland\u2019s assailant. The knife that the defendant used to stab Copeland was found in a wooded area behind the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The defendant did not testify at trial, nor did she call any witnesses in her defense. Rather, she relied primarily on the testimony of Gadson and Caraballo to establish that she had been intoxicated at the time of the stabbing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">In the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument to the jury, the prosecutor focused on evidence that, in the state\u2019s view, established that the defendant had stabbed Copeland with the intent to kill him. During the course of the argument, the prosecutor made the following comments that are the subject of this appeal: \u201cYou have seen the defendant. You have a general idea of her size, her height. You have heard a description of . . . Copeland\u2019s height and I would ask you to keep in mind that, basically, we are talking about using a knife at the level of someone\u2019s body where it\u2019s basically the eye level of the defendant. <em>For her to claim, gee, I didn\u2019t know I was hitting him in a vital area of his body is ridiculous. </em>If all she meant to do was to hurt him, you have all the areas that are more like the arms level, which she could have hit. No. She went for the neck. You\u2019ve heard the expression \u2018go for the jugular.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s what she did. She went for his neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">\u201cYou will probably be hearing some argument from defense [counsel] regarding a defense of intoxication <em>and that appears to be the only defense that can be </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>raised here is well, gee, I must have been so drunk I didn't know what I was doing </em>.... I\u2019m going to save some of my argument to counter what I feel [defense counsel\u2019s] argument would be.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant raised no contemporaneous objection to these remarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">In defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, he underscored the evidence of intoxication, arguing to the jury that the defendant \u201cwas incapable of forming any intent to kill based upon the circumstances as the evidence shows what was going on in the apartment at that time or . . . simply put . . . that she was too drunk to know what she was doing.\u201d Defense counsel continued: \u201c[T]he bottom line is that the [defendant] has claimed through state\u2019s witnesses . . . Caraballo and . . . Gadson that she did not have the capacity, the capability or the intention to kill [Copeland]. What ever happened happened, but it was not because she intended to kill him because she was such under the influence of alcohol that she could not formulate that intent. That in a nutshell is the defendant\u2019s case. . . . [Y]ou have our position. Because of her alcohol, because her \u2014 what she did show, not that she intended to hurt anybody or kill anybody, but that she just didn\u2019t know what she was doing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">During the state\u2019s rebuttal argument, the prosecutor urged the jury to focus on the defendant\u2019s conduct before, during and after the stabbing. The prosecutor maintained that the defendant\u2019s conduct strongly supported the state\u2019s contention that she had killed Copeland with the intent to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">At the conclusion of the parties\u2019 closing arguments, the trial court instructed the jury on the crime of murder and on the lesser included offenses of intentional manslaughter in the first degree, reckless manslaughter in the first degree, manslaughter in the second degree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>and criminally negligent homicide. In light of the trial testimony that the defendant appeared to be intoxicated on the evening of the stabbing, the court also instructed the jurors that if they found that the defendant had been under the influence of an intoxicant at that time, they then must determine what effect, if any, her intoxication had on her ability to form the specific intent required to commit murder or, alternatively, one of the lesser included offenses. See General Statutes \u00a7 53a-7.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Finally, the trial court also charged the jury as follows: \u201cThe defendant has not testified in this case. An accused person has an option to testify or not to testily at the trial. She is under no obligation to [testify]. She has a constitutional right not to testify. You may not draw any unfavorable inference from the accused\u2019s election not to testify.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">Four days after the jury had returned its guilty verdict, the defendant filed a motion for a new trial, claiming that the prosecutor\u2019s use of the word \u201cI\u201d when referring to the defendant in closing argument constituted an improper comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testily. The trial court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and, thereafter, rendered judgment sentencing her to a term of imprisonment of thirty years. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">On appeal, the defendant claims that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument improperly focused the jury\u2019s attention on her failure to testily in violation of the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>amendment to the United States constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim is twofold. First, the defendant contends that she is entitled to prevail under the test that we previously have adopted for determining whether a statement made by a prosecutor during closing argument constitutes an improper comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Alternatively, the defendant maintains that we should reject our current test in favor of a less rigorous standard, and that she is entitled to a new trial under that less stringent test. The defendant also asserts that we should adopt that new test for purposes of the state constitution. With respect to the defendant\u2019s federal constitutional claim, we adhere to the test that we previously have embraced for fifth amendment purposes and conclude that, upon application of that test, the defendant is not entitled to a new trial. With respect to the defendant\u2019s state constitutional claim, we need not decide whether to adopt the new test that she advocates because we conclude that she cannot prevail under that test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>ingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">\u201cIt is well settled that comment by the prosecuting attorney ... on the defendant\u2019s failure to testily is prohibited by the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Arline, </em>223 Conn. 52, 66, 612 A.2d 755 (1992). As we repeatedly have stated, \u201c[i]n determining whether a prosecutor\u2019s comments have encroached upon a defendant\u2019s [fifth amendment] right to remain silent, we ask: Was the language used manifestly intended to be, or was it of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify?\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>244 Conn. 547, 571, 710 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>A.2d 1348 (1998); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>222 Conn. 506, 533, 610 A.2d 1113 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>165 Conn. 61, 72, 327 A.2d 576 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">The defendant acknowledges that we consistently have applied the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test in resolving claims of improper prosecutorial comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. She recognizes, as well, that the United States Circuit Courts of Appeals unanimously have adopted the test. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lampton, </em>158 F.3d 251, 260 (5th Cir. 1998), cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1183, 119 S. Ct. 1124, 143 L.

Ct. 273, 116 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1991). The defendant further concedes that the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test is used by a majority of state courts in resolving claims of improper prosecutorial comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Bracy, </em>145 Ariz. 520, 535, 703 P.2d 464 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1110, 106 S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>Ct. 898, 88 L. Ed. 2d 932 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamlin, </em>146 Vt. 97, 103, 499 A.2d 45 (1985); <em>Stanton </em>v. <em>State, </em>692 P.2d 947, 949-50 (Wyo. 1984). Noting, however, that the United States Supreme Court has never expressly approved the test,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the defendant urges us to adopt a different, less stringent test for evaluating federal constitutional claims of improper prosecutorial comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Specifically, the defendant contends that the fifth amendment is violated by prosecutorial comment that is \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d of being considered a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testily.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The defendant\u2019s sole argument in support of her claim is that the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test places too great a burden on an accused to establish that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks constitute an improper reference to the accused\u2019s failure to testify. We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s claim. The purpose of the rule enunciated in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 380 U.S. 615, is to safeguard an accused\u2019s fifth amendment right to remain silent, not to curtail the state\u2019s \u201copportunity to meet fairly the evidence and arguments of [the accused].\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>485 U.S. 25, 33, 108 S. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>864, 99 L. Ed. 2d 23 (1988). \u201cNeither the language, the history, nor the policy of the self-incrimination clause affords support for the . . . proposition that in declaring that no person \u2018shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself,\u2019 the authors of the Bill of Rights intended to prohibit proper advocacy concerning the strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. This is quite different from specific comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Leak </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>418 F.2d 1266, 1268 (2d Cir. 1969), cert. denied, 397 U.S. 1050, 90 S. Ct. 1388, 25 L. Ed. 2d 665 (1970). Thus, \u201c[i]t is one thing to prevent the state from making capital of the defendant\u2019s invocation of the constitutional privilege but quite another to say that an accused who avails himself of it is entitled to impose on the prosecution shackles that would be unavailable to a man who testifies in his own defense.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Magnotti, </em>198 Conn. 209, 220, 502 A.2d 404 (1985) (\u201c[t]he accused, by his failure to testify, cannot insulate himself from general comment on the weakness of his case, even though his failure so to testify may be perceived by the jury as having contributed to the general weakness about which comment is made\u201d). Furthermore, the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d test finds support in the realization that \u201cclosing arguments of counsel . . . are seldom carefully constructed in toto before the event; improvisation frequently results in syntax left imperfect and meaning less than crystal clear. While these general observations in no way justify prosecutorial misconduct, they do suggest that a court should not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through a lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging inteipretations.\u201d <em>Donnelly </em>v. <em>DeChristoforo, </em>416 U.S. 637, 646-47, 94 S. Ct. 1868, 40 L. Ed. 2d 431 (1974); accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 533-34. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>these reasons, we agree with the overwhelming weight of federal and state authority that the fifth amendment\u2019s prohibition against adverse prosecutorial comment on an accused\u2019s failure to testify is adequately safeguarded by the \u201cnaturally and necessarily\u201d standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defendant also contends that we should adopt the \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d test under article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> a position that she asserts is supported by application of the analysis that we have approved for evaluating claims that our state constitution provides a higher level of protection than the analogous federal constitutional provision.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We need not, and therefore do not, decide that question,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> however, because we conclude that, for the following reasons, the defendant cannot prevail even under the \u201cfairly susceptible\u201d test that she advocates.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>In determining whether the challenged remarks constitute an impermissible comment on the defendant\u2019s constitutionally protected right to refrain from testifying, we review the remarks in the particular context in which they were made. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 571. Viewed in context, it is highly unlikely that the jury considered the prosecutor\u2019s rhetorical use of the word \u201cI\u201d in referring to the defendant as a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The prosecutor was well aware that defense counsel intended to argue to the jury that the defendant had been so intoxicated at the time of the stabbing that she was unable to form the intent necessary to commit murder. In her own closing argument, the prosecutor therefore underscored the fact that the defendant had \u201cgo[ne] for the jugular\u201d of her taller victim rather than some other, more readily accessible and less \u201cvital area of [the victim\u2019s] body.\u201d Thus, in arguing that it was \u201cridiculous\u201d for the defendant \u201cto claim, gee, I didn\u2019t know I was hitting him in a vital area of his body,\u201d the prosecutor merely sought to explain why, in the state\u2019s view, the defendant\u2019s claim regarding her lack of intent was highly implausible. Similarly, the prosecutor, in characterizing the defendant\u2019s contention as \u201cgee, I must have been so drunk I didn\u2019t know what I was doing,\u201d accurately anticipated the defendant\u2019s claim, expressly articulated by defense counsel during closing argument, that the defendant was so intoxicated when she stabbed the victim that she did not \u201c[intend] to hurt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>anybody or kill anybody. . . . [S]he just didn\u2019t know what she was doing.\u201d Both of the prosecutor\u2019s statements, therefore, related to the only seriously disputed factual issue in the case, namely, the defendant\u2019s state of mind when she assaulted the victim. In focusing upon that issue, the prosecutor was addressing the defendant\u2019s <em>claim, </em>rather than her failure to testify. We see no persuasive reason to conclude that the jury would have attributed the latter meaning, rather than the former, to the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Our conclusion is supported by several additional factors. First, the prosecutor\u2019s comments that the defendant now claims were improper apparently were not so obviously prejudicial as to evoke a contemporaneous objection from defense counsel. \u201c[I]t seems strange that, if the state\u2019s comments were as egregious at trial as they have been depicted on appeal, no contemporaneous objection was made.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 535 n.15; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Satchwell, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 572 (\u201cbecause the defendant made no objection to the statements at trial, we may presume that he did not consider [them] to be seriously prejudicial at the time they were made\u201d). Second, the prosecutor, during her closing argument, also used the personal pronoun \u201cI\u201d in referring to the jurors themselves.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This fact makes it less likely that the jury would have placed undue emphasis on the prosecutor\u2019s use of this rhetorical device when she used it in arguing the weakness of the defendant\u2019s claim. Finally, the trial court properly instructed the jurors that the defendant had a right to refrain from testifying and that they were to draw no unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>We acknowledge that it would have been preferable for the prosecutor to have refrained from using the word \u201cI\u201d when referring to the defendant during the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. The use of such language gives rise to an unnecessary risk that one or more jurors might misinterpret the remarks as a veiled reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to testily. We nevertheless are satisfied that the prosecutor\u2019s comments in this case, when viewed in context, created no realistic possibility of juror misunderstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a provides in relevant part: \u201cMurder, (a) A person is guilty of murder when, with intent to cause the death of another person, he causes the death of such person . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b671-10\"> The defendant appealed pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (b), which provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following matters shall be taken directly to the Supreme Court ...

Id., 239-40. Although we agree with the defendant that she has satisfied the first two prongs of <em>Golding </em>and, consequently, is entitled to review of her claims, we conclude that the defendant cannot prevail because she has not satisfied the third prong of <em>Golding.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AsR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The state maintains that we should not reach the merits of the defendant\u2019s claims of prosecutorial impropriety because her failure to raise them at the time of trial deprived the trial court of the opportunity to take whatever corrective action it might have deemed appropriate at that time. The state further argues that, by addressing the defendant\u2019s claims, we may be encouraging defendants in future cases to refrain from raising contemporaneous objections to such allegedly improper prosecutorial comment in reliance on the possibility that, absent a curative or cautionary instruction, the claim on appeal may be stronger than it would have been had the court given such an instruction. We are not unsympathetic to the state\u2019s argument. Nevertheless, there has been no suggestion in this case that the defendant\u2019s failure to raise her claim in a more timely manner was the product of any tactic or stratagem. Accordingly, we choose to review the defendant\u2019s claims notwithstanding her failure to raise a timely objection to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper remarks.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b677-8\"> The defendant also claims that the prosecutor\u2019s argument violated General Statutes \u00a7 54-84, which forbids a prosecutor from commenting on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify and, in addition, requires the court, in the absence of a contrary request from the defendant, to inform the jurors that they may draw no unfavorable inference from the defendant\u2019s failure to testify. Although the defendant malees the conclusory assertion that she is entitled to review of this unpreserved claim under the plain error doctrine, she did not adequately brief the issue and, accordingly, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b677-9\"> The defendant does not claim that the prosecutor intended her remarks to be a comment on the defendant\u2019s failure to testify.
