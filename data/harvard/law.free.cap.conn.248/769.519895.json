Following our grant of certification to appeal, <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the named defendant, William C. Gilmore,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> appeals from the Appellate Court\u2019s judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>ment affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment of strict foreclosure in favor of the plaintiffs, Alan M. Solomon and Mary Ellen Torneo. The defendant claims that a secondary mortgage loan issued by a lender in violation of the licensing requirements of \u00a7 36a-511 is not enforceable in a foreclosure action. We agree.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The Appellate Court opinion provides the following facts and procedural history relevant to this certified appeal. \u201cThe plaintiffs commenced this action by a complaint alleging that they had loaned the defendants $55,000, which loan was memorialized by a promissory note dated May 30, 1989, and was secured by a second mortgage encumbering property known as 44 Bradford Corner Road in the town of Woodstock. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants failed (1) to pay monthly installments on the loan after May 5, 1993, (2) to keep the property insured, and (3) to pay property taxes. As a result of these alleged breaches of the mortgage agreement, the plaintiffs accelerated payment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\u201cThe defendants filed an answer denying that any money was owed to the plaintiffs. The defendants also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>filed seven special defenses<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and a six count counterclaim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-97,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the trial court granted a motion to bifurcate the trial. Thereafter, the plaintiffs filed separate motions for summary judgment. Solomon submitted a supplemental affidavit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>support of his motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On April 26, 1996, the trial court, <em>Sferrazza, J., </em>issued a memorandum of decision granting, in part, both plaintiffs\u2019 motions. On June 3, 1996, the issues not disposed of by way of summary judgment were tried to the court, <em>Loiselle, J., </em>and a judgment of strict foreclosure was rendered.\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>48 Conn. App. 80, 82-83, 707 A.2d 746 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">The defendant appealed from the judgment to the Appellate Court. The Appellate Court affirmed the judgments of the trial courts granting the plaintiffs\u2019 motions for summary judgment and rendering a judgment of strict foreclosure against the defendants; id., 81-82; and decided each of the defendant\u2019s remaining claims adversely to him.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Id., 87. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-7\">The defendant claims that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that a secondary mortgage issued by a lender in violation of the licensing requirements of \u00a7 36a-511 is enforceable against a mortgagor in a foreclosure action. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>In concluding that the only material fact that existed was \u201cwhether the defendants [had] paid or tendered payment of the mortgage debt in full upon demand,\u201d the trial court implicitly rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that, as a matter of law, the mortgage was illegal because the plaintiffs\u2019 were not licensed secondary mortgage lenders.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Appellate Court agreed, stating that \u201c[s]ince the absence of a license on the part of the plaintiffs would make no difference in the result of the case, it is not a material fact for purposes of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Solomon </em>v. <em>Gilmore, </em>supra, 48 Conn. App. 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-510 through 36a-524, the secondary mortgage act, regulate the conduct of persons engaging in certain secondary mortgage loan transactions. This court has not previously considered the issue of whether a mortgage taken by a lender who is unlicensed in contravention of the secondary mortgage act is enforceable. Our approach to this question, however, is guided by three well settled principles of law. First, in light of the fact that \u00a7 36a-511 does not expressly address the enforceability of a contract entered into by an unlicensed lender, we undertake our consideration of this question bearing in mind that in construing statutes, \u201cour fundamental objective [is to ascertain and give effect] to the apparent intent of the legislature.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Packer </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>246 Conn. 89, 115, 717 A.2d 117 (1998). Second, it is well established that contracts that violate public policy are unenforceable. <em>Konover Development Corp. </em>v. <em>Zeller, </em>228 Conn. 206, 231, 635 A.2d 798 (1994). Third, the secondary mortgage act is a remedial statute that is intended to protect the consumer. Thus, because \u201cremedial statutes should be construed liberally in favor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>of those whom the law is intended to protect\u201d; <em>Dysart Corp. </em>v. <em>Seaboard Surety Co., </em>240 Conn. 10, 18, 688 A.2d 306 (1997); we liberally construe the secondary mortgage act in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We begin with a review of the various provisions governing secondary mortgage lenders in this state. Secondary mortgage lenders are regulated through a comprehensive statutory scheme that includes, in addition to a licensing requirement, rules that impose certain obligations on secondary mortgage lenders, as well as rules that prohibit lenders from engaging in certain activities. Penalties are available to ensure compliance with these mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">As noted, \u00a7 36a-511 (a) prohibits persons from \u201cengag[ing] in the secondary mortgage loan business in this state as a lender or a broker unless such person has obtained a license . . . .\u201d See footnote 1 of this opinion. General Statutes \u00a7 36a-513 details the specific requirements and steps of the license application process.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-512 sets forth the persons exempt from the license requirement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>Our review of the secondary mortgage act indicates that \u00a7 36a-511 serves three purposes. First, because licensed lenders are required to comply with the remaining provisions of the secondary mortgage act, which we discuss in more detail later in this opinion, the licensing requirement generally aims to protect consumers by prohibiting certain unscrupulous lending practices. Second, because licensed lenders are subject to this comprehensive scheme of rules, \u00a7 36a-511 serves an integral role in the statutory scheme through which the legislature exercises control over the secondary mortgage industry in Connecticut. Third, by expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>authorizing statutory penalties for violations of the licensing requirement, \u00a7 36a-511 serves as a deterrent to persons who might otherwise avoid the licensing requirement in order more readily to engage in unscrupulous lending. The enforcement of mortgages taken by unlicensed lenders in foreclosure proceedings would thwart each of these purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The secondary mortgage act places several affirmative obligations on secondary mortgage lenders. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-516 (a)<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> requires that each licensee \u201cmaintain adequate records of each loan transaction,\u201d and that these records be retained for specified periods of time. General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 36a-522<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and 36a-524,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> respectively, govern the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>required in the headings of mortgage deeds securing secondary mortgage loans, and the content of advertisements by persons acting as brokers rather than lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Other provisions prohibit secondary mortgage lenders from engaging in certain activities. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-519<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> prohibits a licensee from imposing \u201cany charge as a penalty for the prepayment of principal of a second mortgage loan which exceeds five per cent of the balance prepaid,\u201d and prohibits the imposition of any penalty \u201cfor any prepayment occurring more than three years after the date of such loan.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 36a-521<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> limits the amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>that a licensee can charge for the services related to the secondary mortgage transaction, and prescribes the monetary remedies available to a borrower who is charged in excess of the statutorily authorized amounts. Section 36a-521 (c) also provides that, in the absence of an agreement that meets certain statutorily specified criteria, \u201cevery advance fee shall be refundable.\u201d In addition, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-523<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> prohibits secondary mortgage lenders from accepting applications or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>referrals from brokers whom the lender knows is operating in violation of the secondary mortgage lender licensing provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The secondary mortgage act also authorizes the commissioner of banking (commissioner) to control the licensing of lenders and to bring injunctive or penal actions against lenders who violate the rules. For example, General Statutes \u00a7 36a-517 (a)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> grants the commissioner the power to \u201csuspend, revoke or refuse to renew any license . . . for any reason which would be sufficient grounds for the commissioner to deny an application . . . or if the commissioner finds that the licensee or any owner, director, officer, member, partner, shareholder, trustee, employee or agent of such licensee,\u201d has committed any of a number of specified violations, including fraud or the issuing of any material misrepresentations or misstatements. Section 36a-517 (b) also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>permits the commissioner to enforce penalties against a licensee \u201c[w]henever it appears to the commissioner that any person has violated, is violating or is about to violate any of the provisions\u201d of the secondary mortgage act. Moreover, the penalties available to the commissioner for violations of the secondary mortgage act are governed by General Statutes \u00a7 36a-50,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and are the same as those available for any violation of the banking laws of this state. Pursuant to \u00a7 36a-50 (b), the commissioner may, among other things, seek, as against the violator: (1) injunctive relief in the Superior Court; (2) a court order imposing monetary penalties; and (3) a court order mandating that the violator pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We next consider the role that the \u00a7 36a-511 licensing requirement plays in this comprehensive statutory scheme. The evolution of the secondary mortgage act, as buttressed by the legislative history surrounding the passage of various amendments, affirms that the legislature increasingly has viewed the secondary mortgage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>act\u2019s licensing requirement as integral to the overall objective of protecting consumers against unscrupulous secondary mortgage lenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In 1977, the original act, entitled \u201cAn Act Concerning the Regulation of Second Mortgage Lenders,\u201d was passed with the stated purpose \u201c[of regulating] the secondary mortgage loan industry to insure that borrowers are protected from dishonest lenders.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Raised Committee Bill No. 1390, January Sess. 1977, p. 8. In 1980, as indicated in the legislative history of Public Acts 1980, No. 80-67, the legislature sought to regulate more closely the secondary mortgage industry. The history further indicates that the legislature recognized that a more rigorous licensing scheme would be an effective means of achieving this end. In explaining the proposed bill,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Representative John P. Sponheimer stated: \u201cThis bill would further regulate the second mortgage industry. It would allow the Banking Commissioner to investigate when a person applies for a second mortgage license. ... It would allow the Commissioner, if he believes that a second mortgage lender is violating the provisions of the statute, to take . . . action. . . . What this has done is further tighten up a field which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>many people believe needs further regulation. ... I think this bill is a first step in a tight regulation of this industry, and I move its passage.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> 23 H.R. Proc., Pt. 3, 1980 Sess., pp. 873-74. Public Act 80-67, \u00a7 2, subsequently amended the secondary mortgage act to include what is now \u00a7 36a-513 (c),<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> mandating that the commissioner investigate the facts stated in an application for a license and only to \u201cissue a license if the commissioner finds that the applicant is in all respects <em>properly qualified and of good character </em>and that granting such license would not be against the public interest. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In 1990, moreover, the legislature again strengthened<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> the licensing provision through No. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>90-184, \u00a7 2, of the 1990 Public Acts, which amended \u00a7 36-224b, now \u00a7 36a-511 (b), to provide that persons who engage in the secondary mortgage loan business without obtaining the licenses required by the secondary mortgage act would be assessed civil penalties.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">Thus, the changes made to what is now \u00a7 36a-511 over the past twenty-two years evidence a trend toward strengthening the protection afforded to credit consumers under the secondary mortgage act by making the licensing requirement more rigorous in terms of both the process through which a license is obtained and the penalties available for assessment against violators. Although the legislature did not expressly provide that failure to comply with \u00a7 36a-511 will render the secondary mortgage act unenforceable, there is no evidence, either in the text of the statute or in the legislative history surrounding passage of the various amendments, that the legislature intended violators to be subject only to those penalties stated in the secondary mortgage act. On the contrary, a decision that a secondary mortgage loan issued in violation of \u00a7 36a-511 is unenforceable would be more consistent with and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>would better preserve the protective purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Moreover, \u201c[i]t is unquestionably the general rule, upheld by the great weight of authority, that no court will lend its assistance in any way toward carrying out the terms of a contract, the inherent purpose of which is to violate the law. In case any action is brought in which it is necessary to prove the illegal contract in order to maintain the action, courts will not enforce it, nor will they enforce any alleged right directly springing from such contract .... <em>McMullen </em>v. <em>Hoffman, </em>174 U.S. 639, 654, [19 S. Ct. 839 (1899)]. <em>Vaszauskas </em>v. <em>Vaszauskas, </em>115 Conn. 418, 423, 161 Atl. 856 [1932], . . . This court has further said that every contract made for or about any matter or thing which is prohibited and made unlawful by statute is a void contract, though the statute does not mention that it shall be so, but only inflicts a penalty on the offender; because a penalty implies a prohibition, though there are no prohibitory words in the statute. <em>Bartlett </em>v. <em>Vinor, </em>Carthew, 252. <em>Funk </em>v. <em>Gallivan, </em>49 Conn. 124, 128 [1881].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Tator </em>v. <em>Valden, </em>124 Conn. 96, 101-102, 198 A. 169 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>In <em>G. Nicotera Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>115 Conn. 102, 106, 160 A. 426 (1932), we considered whether a plaintiff who had violated the provision of the Small Loan Act requiring that a note state the rate of interest charged, could recover the balance owed from the borrower. At the time, although the Small Loan Act expressly provided that a note that charged in excess of 42 percent interest would be unenforceable, it provided only for fines and imprisonment as penalties against lenders who failed to state the rate of interest. Id. Nonetheless, this court reaffirmed the holding of <em>Westville &amp; Hamden Loan Co. </em>v. <em>Pasqual, </em>109 Conn. 110, 116-17, 145 A. 758 (1929), rejecting \u201cthe claim . . . that provision for a fine and imprisonment was an exclusive penalty and [that] in view of the provisions voiding the loan in specified instances, it could not be held that the note was void for failure to comply with any other provisions of the [Small Loan] Act than those specified.\u201d <em>G. Nicotera Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>supra, 106-107. Relying on <em>Sagal </em>v. <em>Fylar, </em>89 Conn. 293, 295, 93 A. 1027 (1915), and <em>DiBiase </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>103 Conn. 21, 27-28, 130 A. 81 (1925),<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> this court held this claim to be \u201cuntenable\u201d stating that \u201c[i]t follows that the trial court was correct in holding that the plaintiffs failure to comply with the [Small Loan] Act in the particulars pointed out, renders the note illegal and void.\u201d <em>G. Nicotera Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>supra, 107.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">More recently, in <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>215 Conn. 316, 323-24, 576 A.2d 455 (1990), we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>that, although the Home Improvement Act; General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.; does not expressly bar persons who have violated the act from recovering in quasi-contract, the remedial purposes of the statute would be impaired by allowing a contractor who had violated the provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 20-429<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> to recover in quasi-contract. In reaching this decision we stated that \u201c[i]t bears emphasis that the Home Improvement Act was passed for the protection of the public.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 323. The plaintiffs, however, assert that <em>Barrett Builders </em>\u201ccan be easily distinguished from the present action\u201d because the Home Improvement Act \u201cexpressly provides for the invalidation of home improvement contracts made in its violation.\u201d Although <em>Barrett Builders </em>is distinguishable because of the specific statutory bar noted by the plaintiffs, nonetheless, much of its reasoning supports the defendant\u2019s claim in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Significantly, the court in <em>Barrett Builders </em>looked beyond the language of the Home Improvement Act. The majority held that recovery could not be had in quasi-contract even though the language of the act did <em>not </em>specifically prohibit restitutionary recovery. Id., 324. Furthermore, the dissent, which focused on the language of the Home Improvement Act and reasoned that \u201c[t]here [was] nothing in the language ... [to compel] this court to disallow the restitutionary remedies of recovery\u201d; id., 329 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting); stated that, had the contractor instead violated a licensing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>provision, public policy would require disallowing the restitutionary recovery sought. Id., 331 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). The dissent stated: \u201cIt is true that when the purpose of a statute would be defeated by allowing restitution, such a remedy cannot be permitted. The cases from other states cited by the majority, in which contractors were denied any recovery for their work because they had failed to obtain proper licenses, as the home improvement statutes in those states required, illustrate this principle. . . . The purpose of such statutes, to ensure that home improvement work is performed by those having the requisite qualifications, would surely be frustrated if contractors could operate without the licenses required and still obtain, in restitution, the value of the services they perform.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). Distinguishing the facts before it, the dissent stated: \u201cIn the present case we are not concerned with the registration requirements of our Home Improvement Act . . . which are similar to the licensing statutes involved in the cases cited by the majority and thus may be deemed to establish a public policy that would be frustrated by allowing restitution.\u201d (Citation omitted.) Id., 332 <em>(Shea, J., </em>dissenting). We read both the majority and the dissenting opinions, therefore, as consistent with the view that, had the contractor violated a statutory licensing requirement, as did the plaintiffs in the present case, any recovery would have been barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Relying upon <em>Sagal </em>v. <em>Fylar, </em>supra, 89 Conn. 293, the plaintiffs also argue that because this court has held that agreements made in contravention of statutes that \u201c[extend] only to the qualification of the party to do business\u201d are not unenforceable, a violation of \u00a7 36a-511 should not bar the enforcement of a mortgage contract. In <em>Sagal, </em>this court held that a contract made in violation of chapter 277 of the 1911 Public Acts, which prohibited persons from doing business under a trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>name without filing a certificate with the town clerk, was enforceable. Id., 296. In explaining its decision, this court stated that \u201c[t]he contract which furnishe[d] the foundation for this action was one which parties competent to contract might properly enter into. Its purpose was lawful, and the means to be employed lawful. . . . The prohibition of the statute . . . did not extend to the business done or contract made. The contract sued upon was thus in no sense one \u2018for or about any matter or thing\u2019 which was prohibited or made unlawful.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">It is true that, in <em>Sagal, </em>we described the statute that had been violated as similar to statutes that \u201c[extend] only to the qualification of the party to engage in the business or transaction, or to enter into the contract or undertaking\u201d; id.; in order to distinguish it from the statutes and violations involved in prior cases in which the court subsequently had held the contracts unenforceable. We disagree, however, with the plaintiffs\u2019 interpretation of the applicability of this language to the issue presently before us. Similar to our view of this court\u2019s decision in <em>Barrett Builders, </em>we consider a determination that the secondary mortgage in this case is unenforceable as consistent with, rather than contrary to, this court\u2019s decision in <em>Sagal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">First, unlike the public act at issue in <em>Sagal,</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which did not place any obligations on those persons operating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>under assumed names other than the requirement that they register with the town clerk, the licensing requirement of \u00a7 36a-511 does \u201cextend to the business done or [the] contract made.\u201d Id. As we have explained, persons licensed pursuant to \u00a7 36a-511 are subject to the comprehensive set of rules and associated penalties that make up the secondary mortgage act. These rules govern many aspects of a secondary mortgage lender\u2019s activities, and thus address considerations far beyond the lender\u2019s mere personal qualifications to engage in the secondary mortgage business.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">Moreover, the court in <em>Sagal </em>also explained that \u201c[i]n cases of this character . . . there is no inflexible rule of arbitrary application for the determination of the effect by implication of the prohibitory statute. <em>The question is one of legislative intent to be gatheredfrom the language of the statute read in the light of the circumstances with which it deals, the remedial object apparently in view, and such considerations of public policy </em>as may be involved in the conflicting claims of construction.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id., 296-97. As we have discussed, the enforcement of a contract entered into in violation of \u00a7 36a-511 would thwart \u201cthe remedial object\u201d of the statute as we have gleaned from the text and legislative history of the secondary mortgage act.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Finally, it is true, as the plaintiffs point out in their brief, that this court has often stated that \u201c[t]he principle that agreements contrary to public policy are [unenforceable] should be applied with caution and only in cases plainly within the reasons on which that doctrine rests . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Vista Vestra, Inc., </em>178 Conn. 323, 328, 422 A.2d 274 (1979), quoting <em>Twin City Pipe Line Co. </em>v. <em>Harding Glass Co., </em>283 U.S. 353, 356-57, 51 S. Ct. 476, 75 L. Ed. 1112 (1931). We disagree, however, that this principle requires the enforcement of the mortgage at issue in the present case. Rather, we view the public policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>concerns that are implicated by violations of \u00a7 36a-511 as sufficient to warrant the determination that mortgages taken by lenders in violation of this provision are unenforceable.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In reaching this conclusion, we join several of our sister states that similarly have held that loan contracts issued by moneylenders or creditors in violation of statutory licensing requirements are not enforceable, even though the applicable statutes did not expressly so provide. See, e.g., <em>Derico </em>v. Duncan, 410 So. 2d 27, 31 (Ala. 1982) (violation of licensing provision of consumer loan statute);<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> <em>Levinson </em>v. <em>Boas, </em>150 Cal. 185, 193-94, 88 P. 825 (1907) (violation of licensing provision of pawnbroking statute); annot., 29 A.L.R.4th 884 (1984) (listing cases in which courts have barred enforcement of contracts entered into by unlicensed lenders or creditors in absence of statute that explicitly provided that violation of licensing provision would render contracts unenforceable). Moreover, several jurisdictions \u201chave taken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>the position that generally unlicensed artisans or contractors cannot recover on the contract for services rendered even though the relevant licensing statute contained no express provision relating to the enforceability of contracts of unlicensed contractors or artisans.\u201d Annot., 44 A.L.R.4th 271, 318 (1986); id., 318-19 (listing cases from twelve jurisdictions); id., 13 (Sup. 1998) (listing additional cases from three of twelve jurisdictions and listing additional cases from two additional jurisdictions); see, e.g., <em>Billes </em>v. Bailey, 555 A.2d 460 (D.C. 1989) (home improvement contractor); <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>258 Md. 290, 265 A.2d 759 (1970) (same); <em>Chosen Construction Corp. </em>v. <em>Syz, </em>138 App. Div. 2d 284, 525 N.Y.S.2d 848 (1988) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Our conclusion is also consistent with the decisions of those states that follow \u201cthe well-established rule that if the purpose of a licensing statute is the regulation of the business licensed and not merely the collection of revenue, a person not licensed cannot enforce a contract for services rendered within the scope of the regulated business.\u201d <em>Tucker </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>293 Ala. 589, 592, 308 So. 2d 245 (1975); see <em>Harry Berenter, Inc. </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>supra, 258 Md. 293; <em>Hastings Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Local 369 Building Fund, Inc., </em>42 Mass. App. 162, 177, 675 N.E.2d 403, review denied, 424 Mass. 1108, 678 N.E.2d 1334 (1997); see also 2 Restatement (Second), Contracts \u00a7 181 (1981) (\u201c[i]f a party is prohibited from doing an act because of his failure to comply with a licensing, registration or similar requirement, a promise in consideration of his doing that act or of his promise to do it is unenforceable on grounds of public policy if [a] the requirement has a regulatory purpose, and [b] the interest in the enforcement of the promise is clearly outweighed by the public policy behind the requirement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">To the extent that our conclusion might be viewed as allowing the defendants to receive a windfall at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>expense of the plaintiffs, we note that this result is common, and, as we previously have determined, necessary in many cases in which contracts are deemed unenforceable on the grounds of furthering overriding public policies. See <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 323-24 (no recovery in quasi-contract for goods and services provided in violation of Home Improvement Act); <em>G. Nicotera Loan Corp. </em>v. <em>Gallagher, </em>supra, 115 Conn. 106-107 (no recovery on note that did not state rate of interest and amount of loan as required under Small Loan Act); <em>DiBiase </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>supra, 103 Conn. 28 (no recovery for repair persons who violate statute requiring written authority to perform automobile repairs in excess of $50).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed with respect to the foreclosure and the case is remanded to that court with direction to reverse the judgment of the trial court on that issue, and to direct that judgment be rendered for the defendants on the complaint for foreclosure of the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b788-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 36a-511 (formerly \u00a7 36-224b) provides: \u201c(a) No person shall engage in the secondary mortgage loan business in this state as a lender or a broker unless such person has obtained a license under sections 36a-510 to 36a-524, inclusive.

See footnote 20 of this opinion. This amendment was one of the many changes included in Public Act 94-122, which was intended to streamline the banking industry in Connecticut. See 37 H.R.

In that case, the lender had violated the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practice's Act (CUTPA), and General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 36-224/,, now 8 36a-521, the provision of the secondary mortgage act that limits the amount a lender may charge in prepaid finance charges. <em>Cheshire Mortgage Service, Inc. </em>v. <em>Montes, </em>supra, 82-83. Similar to the case before us, the defendants claimed in their special defenses and counterclaims that the plaintiffs mortgage was unenforceable. Id., 87. Although we did not decide which, if any, of these violations would render the mortgage unenforceable, we remanded the case to the trial court \u201cin order to permit the trial court on the remand to consider the issue of the effect, if any, on the judgment of foreclosure of the remedies flowing from the plaintiffs violation of TILA, CUTPA, and \u00a7 36-224/.\u201d Id., 115. We therefore left open the possibility that a violation of the secondary mortgage act could, at the least, contribute to a finding that the underlying mortgage was unenforceable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> In <em>DiBiase </em>v. <em>Garnsey, </em>supra, 103 Conn. 28, this court held that a repair person could not recover for services rendered in violation of a statute requiring that repair persons obtain the written authority of the owner before performing any car repairs costing in excess of $50. We based this decision on the general principle that illegal contracts are not enforceable, the fact that \u201cthe remedial object [of the statute was] apparently in view, and the considerations of public policy . . . .\u201d Id., 27. We determined that to limit the penalties to only those stated in the act \u201cwould largely impair its efficiency.\u201d Id., 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b805-7\"> In <em>Barrett Builders </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>supra, 215 Conn. 316, it was undisputed that the plaintiff had violated General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 20-429, which provided in relevant part: \u201c(a) No home improvement contract shall be valid unless it is in writing and unless it contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">\u201c(c) The contractor shall provide and deliver to the owner, without charge, a completed copy of the home improvement contract at the time such contract is executed. ...\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\"> Chapter 277 of the 1911 Public Acts provided in pertinent part: \u201cSection 1. No person, except as hereinafter provided, shall, after October 1, 1911, conduct or transact business in this state under any assumed name, or under any designation, name, or style, corporate or otherwise, other than the real name or names of the individual or individuals conducting or transacting such business, unless there has been filed in the office of the town cleric in the town in which such business is or is to be conducted or transacted, a certificate stating the name under which such business is or is to be conducted or transacted ....</p>\n<p id=\"b807-9\">\u201cSec. 3.

We have stated that \u201cthe equitable maxim that he who comes into equity must come with clean hands . . . should be applied ... to promote public policy and the integrity of the courts, and is not one of absolutes.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>DeCecco </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>174 Conn. 29, 34-35, 381 A.2d 543 (1977). We believe that the public policy concerns implicated by the question of the enforceability of this mortgage loan render the \u201cunclean hands\u201d doctrine inapplicable. We therefore do not decide whether the defendants in the present case actually did come to the court with unclean hands.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b809-8\"> In 1990, Alabama amended its code to provide that an agreement entered into in violation of the licensing provision that had been violated in <em>Derico </em>v. <em>Duncan, </em>supra, 410 So. 2d 27, \u201cshall not be void\u201d and that \u201cany creditor who fails to comply with any requirement imposed under this [consumer finance] chapter with respect to any person is liable to the person only for the actual economic damages sustained by the person as the result of the failure. . . .\u201d Ala.
