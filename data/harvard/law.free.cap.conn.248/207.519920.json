We reject these claims and, accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. On or about January 29, 1992, the defendant\u2019s mother, Willie Mae Hodge Perry, who resided in New Haven, contacted the defendant to inform him that her kitchen had sustained damage as a result of a fire. Several days thereafter, the defendant, who was living in New Jersey at the time, returned to Connecticut and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>took up residence with Perry. Perry, in the meantime, had retained the services of Biller Associates, an independent insurance adjuster,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to assess the extent of the fire damage and to process a claim with Perry\u2019s insurance company. Over the next several days, the defendant met with the victims, Lawrence Biller, the owner and president of Biller Associates, and Bruce Horowitz, who was employed by Biller Associates as an adjuster, at Perry\u2019s residence. Biller and Horowitz already had arranged for an independent cleaning contractor, known as Servpro, to clean Perry\u2019s house and, according to the defendant, had received an assignment form, signed by Perry, authorizing payment of a portion of the insurance proceeds directly to Servpro.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">During March and April, 1992, questions arose concerning the amount of the insurance settlement and the manner in which payment to Servpro was to be made. Because the defendant and Perry had expected to receive approximately $20,000 from Perry\u2019s insurer, they were disappointed to learn from Horowitz, on April 8, that Perry, instead, would be receiving a total net settlement of approximately $15,500. Horowitz assured them, however, that he had done all that he could. When asked by the defendant about the payment for cleaning services, Horowitz stated that Servpro\u2019s bill of $4700 already had been paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">Later in April, 1992, however, the defendant learned from an agent of Perry\u2019s insurance company that the insurer had prepared two checks, one payable to Perry in the approximate amount of $12,500, and the other payable to Servpro in the approximate amount of $4700. The defendant telephoned Biller Associates several times in an unsuccessful effort to discuss the apparent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>discrepancy in the payment to Servpro, which the defendant believed was the reason why Perry was to receive $3000 less than she had been promised originally. When the defendant telephoned the company on April 29, he indicated that he would be away for a short period of time, and provided the company with a telephone number where he could be contacted. The defendant expressly requested, moreover, that Biller Associates contact him, rather than Perry, to resolve the matter. Notwithstanding this request, Horowitz contacted Perry during the defendant\u2019s absence. Upon the defendant\u2019s return, he arranged a meeting at Horowitz\u2019 office on May 4 to discuss further the matter of the payment to Servpro.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On the morning of May 4, 1992, the defendant met with Horowitz and Biller in Biller\u2019s office. After expressing his dissatisfaction with the fact that Perry stood to receive $3000 less than she had expected, the defendant proposed that Biller Associates remit one half of that amount, $1500, to Perry. Biller asked the defendant whether he expected Biller to pay the defendant $1500 of Biller\u2019s own money, and inquired as to what measures the defendant expected to take if the defendant and Biller Associates were unable to resolve the matter. The defendant responded: \u201cI would go to war with you. I will cause you and your company as much pain as you\u2019ve caused me and my family.\u201d The defendant added that he would file a civil suit if necessary. Biller replied that no one had ever prevailed in a lawsuit against Biller Associates. After some further discussion, Biller stated that the matter would not be resolved that day. The defendant then inquired: \u201c[S]o that\u2019s the way it is?\u201d Biller replied: \u201c[T]hat\u2019s the way it is.\u201d As the defendant rose to leave, he pulled out a nine millimeter handgun and shot and killed both Biller and Horowitz. The defendant immediately left the scene and, thereafter, fled to Costa Rica.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>After a police investigation of the killings, the defendant was charged with two counts of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a), one count of capital felony in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54b (8)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and one count of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of \u00a7 29-35. Three weeks after the shootings, the defendant, who had returned to the United States from Costa Rica, was arrested.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">At the defendant\u2019s trial, several employees of Biller Associates testified regarding the events leading up to and culminating in the deaths of the victims. The testimony of these witnesses, who were present in the Biller Associates office at the time of the shootings, established the defendant as the shooter. In addition, Edward McDonough, a physician with the state medical examiner\u2019s office, testified that both victims had died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds. McDonough concluded that Biller\u2019s body had seven entry wounds, one of which was from a bullet that had severed Biller\u2019s spinal cord. McDonough located three entry wounds on Horowitz\u2019 body, including one from a bullet that had entered his back and penetrated his aorta.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">The defendant, who testified in his own defense, admitted that he had shot the victims, but sought to establish the affirmative defenses of mental disease or defect<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In support <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of these defenses, the defendant presented the testimony of Ezra Griffith, a psychiatrist and the director of the Connecticut Mental Health Center (mental health center), who opined that the defendant was legally insane at the time of the shootings and, further, that he had acted under an extreme emotional disturbance. The defendant also adduced the testimony of John Ceg-alis, a clinical psychologist, who testified that the defendant, although not legally insane when he shot the victims, was suffering from an extreme emotional disturbance. In rebuttal, the state presented the testimony of Donald Grayson, a psychiatrist, who refuted both affirmative defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">The trial court instructed the jury on capital felony, murder, first degree manslaughter as a lesser included offense of murder and carrying a pistol without a permit. After deliberating for nine days, the jury, which twice had indicated that it was deadlocked, returned a verdict of guilty of murder with respect to the death of Biller and of first degree manslaughter with respect to the death of Horowitz. The jury also found the defendant guilty on the charge of carrying a pistol without a permit. The trial court rendered judgment sentencing the defendant to consecutive prison terms of fife on the murder count, twenty years on the manslaughter count and five years on the count of carrying a pistol without a permit.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">THE PEREMPTORY CHALLENGES CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The defendant first claims that he is entitled to a new trial under the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> because the state, during jury selection, improperly discriminated against six minority venirepersons by exercising its peremptory challenges to strike those prospective jurors from the juiy array in violation of <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), and its progeny. We reject the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. Jury selection for the defendant\u2019s trial, which involved the potentially racially charged shooting deaths of two white men by the defendant, who is African-American, took place over thirty-eight days, during which thirty-three panels were summoned, approximately 400 venirepersons were sworn and seventy-two persons were fully voir dired. In light of the capital felony charges, the court granted each party thirty-one peremptory challenges. Of those, the state used twenty-four, six of which were challenged by the defendant as discriminatory under <em>Batson. </em>The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenges, concluding that, in each case, the state had provided credible, race neutral reasons for exercising its peremptory challenge. The final jury of twelve regular and three alternate jurors included four African-Americans and two Hispanics. Additional facts specific to the state\u2019s allegedly improper use of its peremptory challenges are set forth below.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"A-B\">We begin our analysis of the defendant\u2019s claim with an overview of our jury selection process and the use of peremptory challenges. \u201cVoir dire plays a critical function in assuring the criminal defendant that his [or her] Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury will be honored. <em>Rosales-Lopez </em>v. <em>United States, </em>451 U.S. 182, 188, 101 S. Ct. 1629, 68 L. Ed. 2d 22 (1981).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 61, 544 A.2d 611 (1988). \u201cPart of the guarantee of a defendant\u2019s right to an impartial jury is an adequate voir dire to identify unqualified jurors. <em>Morgan </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 729, 112 S. Ct. 2222, 119 L. Ed. 2d 492 (1992).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em>230 Conn. 385, 391, 645 A.2d 535 (1994). \u201cOur constitutional and statutory law permit each party, typically through his or her attorney, to question each prospective juror individually, outside the presence of other prospective jurors, to determine the venireperson\u2019s fitness to serve on the jury. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 19;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-82f;<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Practice Book \u00a7 848 [now \u00a7 42-12].\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>237 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>Conn. 238, 247, 676 A.2d 384 (1996). Because the purpose of voir dire is to discover \u201cif there is any likelihood that some prejudice is in the juror\u2019s mind which will even subconsciously affect his [or her] decision of the case, the party who may be adversely affected should be permitted questions designed to uncover that prejudice. This is particularly true with reference to the defendant in a criminal case.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>197 Conn. 314, 318, 497 A.2d 387 (1985). \u201cAfter the completion of the voir dire of a particular venireperson, a party may challenge the venireperson for cause. The court must excuse that juror if the judge ... is of the opinion from the examination that [the] juror would be unable to render a fair and impartial verdict .... Unless one of the patties exercises a peremptory challenge to remove the venireperson, a venireperson who has not been excused for cause must be accepted by the parties as a prospective member of the jury panel. . . . The purpose of voir dire is to facilitate [the] intelligent exercise of peremptory challenges and to help uncover factors that would dictate disqualification for cause.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Peremptory challenges are deeply rooted in our nation\u2019s jurisprudence and serve as \u201cone state-created means to the constitutional end of an impartial jury and a fair trial.\u201d <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 57, 112 S. Ct. 2348, 120 L. Ed. 2d 33 (1992). Although such challenges generally may be based on subjective as well as objective criteria; see, e.g., <em>Burks </em>v. <em>Borg, </em>27 F.3d 1424, 1429 (9th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1160, 115 S. Ct. 1122, 130 L. Ed. 2d 1085 (1995); they may not be used to exclude a prospective juror because of his or her race or gender. <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 146, 114 S. Ct. 1419,128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994) (gender); <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 89 (race). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201cIn <em>Batson . . </em>. the United States Supreme Court recognized that a claim of purposeful racial discrimination on the part of the prosecution<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> in selecting a jury raises constitutional questions of the utmost seriousness, not only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole. . . . The court concluded that [although a prosecutor ordinarily is entitled to exercise permitted peremptory challenges for any reason at all, as long as that reason is related to his [or her] view concerning the outcome of the case to be tried . . . the Equal Protection Clause<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> forbids the prosecutor to challenge potential jurors solely on account of their race .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 323, 630 A.2d 593 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 10-11, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 394, 538 A.2d 210 (1988).\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 243-44. Relying on the rationale underlying <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court has held that gender-based challenges also are impermissible. <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>supra, 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Under Connecticut law, \u201c[o]nce a [party] asserts a <em>Batson </em>claim, the [opposing party] must advance a neutral explanation for the venireperson\u2019s removal. . . . The [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] is then afforded the opportunity to demonstrate that the [opposing party\u2019s] articulated reasons are insufficient or pretextual. . . . [T]he trial court then [has] the duty to determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>if the [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] has established purposeful discrimination.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 323; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 244-45. \u201cThe [party asserting the <em>Batson </em>claim] carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the jury selection process in his or her particular case was tainted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>by purposeful discrimination.\u2019\u2019<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>supra, 206 Conn. 395; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 278, 717 A.2d 168 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that [a party\u2019s removal] of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was . . . motivated [by race or gender]. These include, but are not limited to: (1) [t]he reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race [or gender] were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors ... (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race [or gender] as the challenged juror were not struck ... (5) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the [party exercising the peremptory strike] used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race [or gender].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 325. Moreover, \u201c[although the racial composition of the jury impaneled is certainly not dispositive of the issue<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>. . . it is a factor that we must consider in assessing the . . . explanation [of the party who exercises the allegedly unconstitutional peremptory challenge].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 332; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>951 F.2d 22, 26 (2d Cir. 1991) (\u201c[t]he waiving of [a peremptory] challenge when minority venirepersons were available for challenge . . . is a factor that can lend some support to a finding of race neutral challenges\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">In assessing the reasons proffered in support of the use of aperemptory challenge, we note that \u201c[a]n explanation . . . need not ... be pigeon-holed as wholly acceptable or wholly unacceptable . . . and even where the acceptability of a particular explanation is doubtful, the inquiry is not at an end. In deciding the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent, the judicial officer is entitled to assess each explanation in light of all the other evidence relevant to prosecutorial intent. The officer may think a dubious explanation undermines the bona fides of other explanations or may think that the sound explanations dispel the doubt raised by a questionable one. As with most inquiries into state of mind, the ultimate determination depends on an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s finding that the reasons given by a prosecutor for the use of a peremptory challenge were not pretextual, this court previously has declined to review all of the reasons given by the prosecutor in support of his or her use of the peremptory challenge once we concluded that at least one of the reasons articulated was race neutral. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 14 n.8 (refusing to consider validity of state\u2019s second proffered reason after concluding first was valid); <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 405 (same). To clarify any possible ambiguity regarding the proper role of the <em>trial court </em>in resolving <em>Batson </em>claims, we emphasize that, in evaluating such a claim, the trial court must consider all of the proffered reasons together in determining whether, as a factual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>matter, the party exercising the peremptory challenge was motivated, in whole or in part, by impermissible discriminatory considerations.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">Finally, the trial court\u2019s decision on the question of discriminatory intent represents a finding of fact that will necessarily turn on the court\u2019s evaluation of the demeanor and credibility of the attorney of the party exercising the peremptory challenge. <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New </em>York, 500 U.S. 352, 365, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98 n.21; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 25; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 395. Accordingly, a trial court\u2019s determination that there has or has not been intentional discrimination is afforded great deference and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 323-24; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 406-407. \u201cA finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Components, Inc. </em>v. <em>Wdowiak, </em>239 Conn. 259, 263, 684 A.2d 693 (1996).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">The Individual <em>Batson </em>Challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">We now address the propriety of the state\u2019s exercise of each of the six peremptory challenges that gave rise to the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claims. We conclude that, with respect to each challenge, the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">Two preliminary issues require resolution prior to our consideration of the defendant\u2019s arguments. First, with respect to each of his <em>Batson </em>claims, the defendant contends that <em>none </em>of the reasons articulated by the state constituted a neutral, nondiscriminatory ground for the exercise of the peremptory challenge. The defendant therefore contends that the trial court was required to find, in light of the allegedly pretextual nature of all of the reasons proffered by the state, that the state\u2019s exercise of each of the six peremptory challenges was the product of purposeful discrimination. The defendant relied solely upon this argument in the trial court in support of his <em>Batson </em>claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>In the alternative, the defendant, for the first time on appeal, asserts that he is not required to establish that the state exercised each of the allegedly improper peremptory challenges solely for discriminatory reasons. He claims, instead, that he must show only that the use of the peremptory challenge was at least partially motivated by impermissible discriminatory considerations and that, upon such a showing, the burden then shifts to the state to establish that it nevertheless would have exercised the peremptory challenge solely for nondiscriminatory reasons. In support of this argument, the defendant relies on <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>986 F.2d 24, 25 (2d Cir. 1993), a federal habeas coipus case in which a state prosecutor, after a trial that had been conducted prior to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Batson, </em>acknowledged that he had exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse an African-American venireperson due, in part, to the prospective juror\u2019s race.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">We do not doubt that, in certain circumstances, a trial court, after hearing the reasons why a peremptory challenge was used to remove a particular venire-person, reasonably could conclude that the use of that challenge was based on both impermissible discriminatory reasons and valid, nondiscriminatory reasons. In such circumstances, the dual motivation analysis set forth in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>supra, 986 F.2d 24, would be applicable. In this case, however, the defendant failed to raise a dual motivation claim in the trial court; the defendant asserted only that the reasons articulated by the state\u2019s attorney compelled the conclusion that the state\u2019s attorney had engaged in purposeful discrimination. Moreover, the trial court expressly found that the reasons given by the state\u2019s attorney for striking the six minority venirepersons were not pretextual. Because the defendant failed to raise a dual motivation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>claim, the trial court never addressed it and, consequently, the record is inadequate for consideration of the defendant\u2019s unpreserved claim. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 240, 567 A.2d 823 (1989) (\u201cThe defendant bears the responsibility for providing a record that is adequate for review of his claim of constitutional error. If the facts revealed by the record are insufficient, unclear or ambiguous as to whether a constitutional violation has occurred, we will not attempt to supplement or reconstruct the record, or to make factual determinations, in order to decide the defendant\u2019s claim.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">Second, in support of his contention that the trial court improperly rejected his <em>Batson </em>claims, the defendant relies, to a considerable degree, on the argument that the state failed to exercise peremptory challenges against certain white venirepersons with characteristics similar to the minority venirepersons who were the subject of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claims. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 325 (pretext may be shown where \u201cpersons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race as the challenged juror were not struck\u201d). The defendant articulated this disparate treatment claim in connection with three of his <em>Batson </em>challenges; see parts IB 3,1B 5 and IB 6 of this opinion; thereby enabling the trial court to consider the facts of his claim with respect to those three venirepersons. Accordingly, the record is adequate for our review of the defendant\u2019s claim with respect to those three venire-persons. Because, however, the defendant failed to raise a disparate treatment claim with respect to the other three venirepersons, the record is inadequate for appellate review of his claim with respect to those venirepersons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">The defendant, nevertheless, urges us to review his unpreserved disparate treatment claims in light of our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>recent decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 238, in which we concluded that a defendant may renew a disparate treatment claim regarding the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge even at the conclusion of voir dire because such a claim \u201crequire[s] knowledge of the state\u2019s use of all of its peremptory challenges.\u201d Id., 250. Although, under <em>Robinson, </em>a defendant may renew a disparate treatment claim at the end of the voir dire process, the defendant in this case failed to do so. Because a disparate treatment claim raises factual questions that must be decided by the trial court, the defendant\u2019s failure to raise the claim in the trial court is fatal to his claim on appeal.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, in determining the propriety of the trial court\u2019s findings on the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claims, we do not consider the defendant\u2019s disparate treatment claim in those instances in which the defendant failed to raise that claim in the trial court.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A9v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>1</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Venireperson C.W.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">On the eighth day of voir dire,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> the state claimed that venireperson C.W., an African-American female, should be excused for cause. The trial court disagreed, and the state exercised a peremptory challenge to remove C.W. from the panel. In response to the defendant\u2019s request for a race neutral explanation for the exercise of the peremptory challenge, the state\u2019s attorney reiterated the reasons that he had articulated in support of his challenge for cause, namely, that: (1) C.W. initially had indicated that she would hold the state to a standard of proof higher than proof beyond a reasonable doubt;<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> (2) C.W. had expressed reluctance, based on her religious convictions, to voice her personal opinion or to judge another person;<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> (3) both C.W.\u2019s son and brother had criminal convictions; and (4) C.W. believed that her cousin, who had been indicted for a homicide in New York, had been treated harshly by the police in light of his claim of self-defense. The state\u2019s attorney further observed that, although C.W. had expressed the belief that she could be fair, she also had expressed some concern over the possibility that the defendant might be required to serve time in prison. The state\u2019s attorney emphasized that \u201cwe have not. . . had a juror where all these circumstances existed in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>[his or her] life, nor have we taken a juror where there has been doubt about whether they understand proof beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no one who has been accepted who in any way remotely approaches [C.W.] as far as her background . . . .\u201d The state\u2019s attorney also observed that two of the five jurors who already had been accepted were members of a minority group.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">In response, the defendant sought to downplay the role that police testimony would play in the case by stating that, because the defendant admitted that he had shot and killed the victims, the crux of the case was the defendant\u2019s mental state at the time he fired the shots. He characterized C.W. as \u201cfair minded, intelligent, and introspective,\u201d disputed that she had demonstrated any indication that she was biased against the state, and disagreed with the conclusion of the state\u2019s attorney that C.W. would not apply the appropriate standard of proof. The defendant asserted, moreover, that the selection of two jurors who were members of a minority group was irrelevant to the determination whether the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to exclude C.W. from the panel was racially motivated. The trial court upheld the state\u2019s use of the peremptory challenge to excuse C.W., concluding that the state had exercised the challenge for valid, race neutral reasons.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>We agree with the state that the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the reasons given by the state\u2019s attorney for excusing C.W. were legitimate. Courts consistently have upheld the use of peremptory challenges to excuse a venireperson with a close relative who has been prosecuted because of the real possibility that the venireperson may harbor resentment against prosecuting authorities generally. See, e.g., <em>Lovejoy </em>v. <em>United States, </em>92 F.3d 628, 631 (8th Cir. 1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>941 F.2d 1102, 1109 (10th Cir. 1991); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>911 F.2d 113, 114 (8th Cir. 1990); <em>People </em>v. <em>Chambie, </em>189 Cal. App. 3d 149, 156, 234 Cal. Rptr. 308 (1987); <em>Henry </em>v. <em>State, </em>265 Ga. 732, 733-34, 462 S.E.2d 737 (1995); <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>507 So. 2d 304, 309 (La. App. 1987). C.W testified that her son, brother and cousin each had a prior arrest record and that her son had been prosecuted by the New Haven office of the state\u2019s attorney, the same office involved in prosecuting the present case. In addition, C.W. characterized her cousin\u2019s treatment at the hands of the prosecutor who handled his case as unfair. Although C.W. stated that she would not allow these considerations to affect her impartiality as a juror, a prosecutor is not bound to accept the venireperson\u2019s reassurances, but, rather, is entitled to rely on his or her own experience, judgment and intuition in such matters. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 326-27 (\u201c[t]he fact that a prosecutor distrusts a juror or finds [the juror\u2019s] responses not to be credible [may] be a sufficiently race-neutral reason for using a peremptory challenge\u201d [internal quotation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>marks omitted]); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 14-15 (\u201c[a] venireperson\u2019s assessment of his [or her] own prejudices may be untrustworthy for a variety of reasons\u201d). Furthermore, C.W.\u2019s son, like the defendant, had been represented by a public defender, a legitimate ground for suspecting that C.W. might favor the defense. Additional support for the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s reasonable apprehension regarding C.W.\u2019s impartiality may be found in the concern expressed by C.W. over the possibility that the defendant, upon conviction, might be faced with a prison term. Finally, C.W.\u2019s equivocation with respect to holding the state to a higher burden of proof than proof beyond a reasonable doubt and her expressed reluctance to judge others also were valid, nondiscriminatory reasons for excusing her. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Blackman, </em>66 F.3d 1572, 1574 (11th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1126, 116 S. Ct. 1365, 134 L. Ed. 2d 531 (1996). In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim with respect to C.W. was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">2</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Venireperson J.G.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">On the tenth day of voir dire, the state, after unsuccessfully challenging venireperson J.G., an African-American female, for cause, exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse her. In response to the defendant\u2019s claim of a <em>Batson </em>violation, the state\u2019s attorney explained that he had exercised the peremptory challenge due to: (1) J.G.\u2019s confusion regarding the standard of proof; (2) J.G.\u2019s statement, which she later retracted, that her employer had conducted business with Biller Associates; (3) J.G.\u2019s eagerness to serve as a juror on the case; (4) J.G.\u2019s acquaintance with two persons employed in the public defender\u2019s office; (5) J.G.\u2019s background in insurance adjusting; and (6) J.G.\u2019s familiarity with the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>The defendant asserted that these reasons were pre-textual, claiming that the state\u2019s line of questioning concerning the standard of proof was confusing, and that J.G., who was college educated, had assured the court that she would follow its instructions. He attributed J.G. \u2019s contradictory responses regarding her employer\u2019s prior dealings with Biller Associates to her initial misunderstanding of the questions asked by the state\u2019s attorney. Furthermore, the defendant observed that J.G. had reassured the court that her knowledge of the insurance industry would not affect her objectivity. The defendant noted, moreover, the state\u2019s ostensible proclivity to excuse minority venirepersons. The court, however, found the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney to be race neutral and not pretextual, and overruled the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">A review of the transcript of J.G.\u2019s voir dire examination supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the state\u2019s decision to strike J.G. was not racially motivated. A prosecutor may challenge a juror who appears unable to understand questions or who demonstrates confusion. <em>Baynard </em>v. <em>State, </em>518 A.2d 682, 685-86 (Del. 1986); <em>People </em>v. <em>Mack, </em>128 Ill. 2d 231, 240, 538 N.E.2d 1107 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1093, 110 S. Ct. 1170, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (1990); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>543 So. 2d 886, 898-99 (La. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1074, 110 S. Ct. 1796, 108 L. Ed. 2d 798 (1990). J.G. repeatedly expressed confusion in response to questions asked by the defendant, the state\u2019s attorney and the trial court concerning the applicable standard of proof. Although J.G. stated that she would follow the court\u2019s instructions, she also indicated that, in light of the seriousness of the case, she would be inclined to hold the state to a higher standard than proof beyond a reasonable doubt. In evaluating J.G.\u2019s suitability as a juror, the state\u2019s attorney was entitled to rely on J.G.\u2019s entire voir dire testimony to determine whether, in light of all of J.G.\u2019s responses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>she would be willing and able to apply the proper standard of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">J.G., moreover, had considerable work experience in the field of insurance adjusting; she had been employed as an in-house claims adjuster for various organizations. Regardless whether her employer had had any business dealings with Biller Associates,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> and notwithstanding her assurances that her employment background would not affect her performance as a juror, it was reasonable for the state\u2019s attorney to have concluded that J.G.\u2019s close familiarity with the industry in which the victims were employed might color her perception of them. Finally, J.G.\u2019s acquaintance with two employees of the public defender\u2019s office, her familiarity with the crime scene and her eagerness to serve as a juror,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> reasons that are concededly less closely related to the issues in the case and upon which the state\u2019s attorney appeared to place less reliance, nonetheless lend support to the trial court\u2019s determination that the state did not excuse J.G. because of her race. The record, therefore, supports the trial court\u2019s finding that the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney in support of exercising a peremptory challenge to strike J.G. from the jury panel were not pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">3</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">Venireperson I.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">On the twenty-first day of voir dire, after ten venire-persons had been selected,<footnotemark>32</footnotemark>1.M., an African-American <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>female, was voir dired. At the conclusion of her examination, the state exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse her. In response to the defendant\u2019s request for a race neutral explanation for removing I.M. from the panel, the state\u2019s attorney provided the following reasons: (1) I.M. either did not understand or was confused by a number of questions; (2) I.M. had an eighth grade education; (3) I.M. testified that she was not familiar with psychiatric defenses, which, the state\u2019s attorney suggested, reflected a general lack of sophistication; (4) I.M. would be predisposed to favor Griffith, a key defense witness who was the director of the mental health center, the facility at which her son had been treated; (5) I.M. had expressed contradictory views as to whether persons who, like her son, suffered from a mental illness, should be held accountable for their actions; and (6) I.M. would be biased toward the defendant in light of her experience with her mentally ill son.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">In response, the defendant observed that W.V., a white juror with a sixth grade education, already had been selected to serve on the jury.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> The defendant also challenged the assertions made by the state\u2019s attorney that I.M. was confused by the questioning and that she was unlikely to hold persons with mental illnesses accountable for their actions. The defendant also questioned whether the particular circumstances of her son\u2019s mental health treatment were relevant. The trial court, concluding that the explanations given by the state\u2019s attorney were not pretextual, rejected the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">We agree with the state that the record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the reasons offered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>state\u2019s attorney for excluding I.M. from the jury panel were valid. In view of the psychiatric testimony that the defendant was expected to adduce at trial and the subtle distinctions in mental condition upon which the case turned, the concern expressed by the state\u2019s attorney over I.M.\u2019s ability to understand the evidence and the applicable legal principles was legitimate. A fair reading of the record supports the state\u2019s claim that I.M. was confused at various points during her voir dire. For example, I.M. did not understand the question posed by the state\u2019s attorney about whether the nature of the charges in the case would predispose her toward one party or the other. Later, after I.M.\u2019s unresponsive answer to a question concerning the presumption of innocence, the state\u2019s attorney attempted to explain and rephrase his question. I.M. indicated that she was still confused and did not understand the point that the state\u2019s attorney was trying to make. Furthermore, although the lack of familiarity with a complex psychiatric defense might not, in and of itself, provide a strong basis upon which to exercise a peremptory challenge, the state\u2019s attorney was entitled to consider that issue along with the other relevant aspects of I.M.\u2019s background and experience in ascertaining her suitability as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Closely related to the foregoing was the concern expressed by the state\u2019s attorney over I.M.\u2019s eighth grade education. Several courts have held insufficient formal education to be a race neutral reason for striking a prospective juror from the jury array. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>86 F.3d 679, 683 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 985, 117 S. Ct. 443, 136 L. Ed. 2d 339 (1996); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lane, </em>866 F.2d 103, 106 (4th Cir. 1989); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harrell, </em>847 F.2d 138, 139 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 944, 109 S. Ct. 371, 102 L. Ed. 2d 360 (1988); <em>State </em>v. <em>Lindsey, </em>supra, 543 So. 2d 898. Although the defendant observed that the white juror, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>W.V., had been selected notwithstanding his sixth grade education, the failure \u201cto strike a white juror who shares <em>some </em>traits with a struck black juror does not itself automatically prove the existence of discrimination.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>United States </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>65 F.3d 918, 926 (11th Cir.), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1134, 116 S. Ct. 958, 133 L. Ed. 2d 881 (1995); cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jimenez, </em>77 F.3d 95, 100-101 (5th Cir. 1996); <em>Hollingsworth </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>30 F.3d 109, 112-13 (11th Cir. 1994), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1131, 115 S. Ct. 944, 130 L. Ed. 2d 888 (1995). Moreover, W.V. had expressed strong negative feelings about guns. In light of the fact that the defendant was charged with two fatal shootings, it would be reasonable for the state\u2019s attorney to conclude that W.V.\u2019s views on firearms outweighed whatever concerns he may have had about W.V.\u2019s educational background. Furthermore, notwithstanding his sixth grade education, W.V. had owned an autobody repair business for many years, which he operated out of his backyard. Thus, the state had strong reason to select W.V. notwithstanding his limited formal education. The same cannot be said for I.M.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The state\u2019s attorney also provided the trial court with a reasonable basis to conclude that I.M. might be favorably disposed toward the defense. First, although I.M. acknowledged that she was not acquainted with Griffith, a key defense witness, and it was not established that Griffith was in charge of the mental health center when her son was treated there, I.M. indicated that she would look kindly on Griffith, raising the possibility that she would accord his testimony greater weight than that of other witnesses. The state\u2019s attorney\u2019s belief that I.M. might be reluctant to convict the defendant, in light of his psychiatric defense, was reasonable, because I.M., who had a mentally ill son, initially had equivocated with respect to whether a person with a mental illness should be held accountable for his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>her actions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Although it is by no means clear that I.M. would have been unable to put aside her personal experiences regarding mental illness, we cannot say, in light of I.M.\u2019s entire voir dire examination, that the contrary belief expressed by the state\u2019s attorney was unreasonable or otherwise lacking support in the record. Upon consideration of all of the reasons cited by the state\u2019s attorney for excusing I.M., we are satisfied that the trial court was not clearly erroneous in concluding that the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge against I.M. was not the product of racial discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">4</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">Venireperson M.F.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">The state, on the twenty-fourth day of voir dire,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse M.F., an African-American male who was a member of the Islamic faith. In response to the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge, the state\u2019s attorney explained that he had excused M.F. principally on the basis of his prior criminal record and because of concerns that if a conflict arose between Islamic and state law, M.F. would follow the former. Emphasizing that the challenge was premised, however, on the \u201ccollective situation,\u201d rather than on any one factor, the state\u2019s attorney provided the following additional reasons for excluding M.F.: (1) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>M.F. had equivocated with respect to his experiences with police officers, legal concepts and sympathy for the defendant; (2) M.F. had referred to, but did not elaborate on, \u201cbad things\u201d he had done in the past; (3) M.F. was acquainted with homicide victims and with a person serving a life sentence; (4) M.F. previously had been represented by a public defender; (5) M.F. was confused about the standard of proof applicable to criminal cases; and (6) M.F. had a girlfriend and a sister with ties to the mental health center at which Griffith, one of the defense witnesses, served as the director. The state\u2019s attorney acknowledged that, at times, M.F. had endeavored to reassure counsel that he would not be influenced by some of these factors, but the state\u2019s attorney nevertheless expressed his belief that \u201ctoo much was unknown,\u201d and, therefore, was disinclined to rely on these reassurances.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The defendant countered that the state\u2019s challenge was motivated by improper racial and religious considerations.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Observing that this was the fourth challenge the state exercised to exclude an African-American venireperson, and claiming that the state\u2019s attorney had not similarly examined the religious beliefs and practices of any other venireperson, the defendant argued that the questioning undertaken by the state\u2019s attorney was calculated to elicit responses that would provide grounds for a challenge. Moreover, the defendant attributed M.F.\u2019s confusion to the duration of the voir dire and underscored M.F.\u2019s repeated assertions that he would follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. The court observed that the state\u2019s attorney had questioned M.F. more extensively than he had questioned previous venire-persons, but concluded that none of the reasons offered by the state\u2019s attorney for excusing M.F. was pretextual. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>Accordingly, the court overruled the defendant\u2019s <em>Bat-son </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Turning first to the defendant\u2019s claim of impermissible religious discrimination, we note that the United States Supreme Court has not addressed whether the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits the use of peremptory challenges on the basis of religion. For the reasons that follow, however, we conclude that a peremptory challenge based on a venireperson\u2019s religious affiliation is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">In <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>supra, 511 U.S. 146, the United States Supreme Court extended the scope of <em>Batson </em>beyond race to encompass intentional discrimination on the basis of gender.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Acknowledging that this country\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex discrimination . . . warrants the heightened scrutiny [afforded] all gender-based classifications\u201d;<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> (citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted) id., 136; the court employed traditional equal protection analysis, observing that \u201cthe only question is whether discrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>tion on the basis of gender injury selection substantially furthers the State\u2019s legitimate interest in achieving a fair and impartial trial.\u201d Id., 136-37. The court rejected the justification offered by the state that jurors would be likely to sympathize along gender lines in a paternity action, declaring that \u201c[w]e shall not accept as a defense to gender-based peremptory challenges the very stereotype the law condemns.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 138. Emphasizing the harm that race or gender-based discrimination in jury selection causes \u201cthe litigants, the community, and the individual jurors who are wrongfully excluded from participation in the judicial process\u201d; id., 140; the court concluded that \u201c[Ijailing to provide jurors the same protection against gender discrimination as race discrimination could frustrate the purpose of <em>Batson </em>itself. Because gender and race are overlapping categories, gender can be used as a pretext for racial discrimination.\u201d Id., 145. Moreover, the couit noted: \u201cEqual opportunity to participate in the fair administration of justice is fundamental to our democratic system. It not only furthers the goals of the jury system. It reaffirms the promise of equality under the law \u2014 that all citizens, regardless of race, ethnicity, or gender, have the chance to take part directly in our democracy. . . . [T]he Equal Protection Clause prohibits discrimination in jury selection on the basis of gender, or on the assumption that an individual will be biased in a particular case for no reason other than the fact that the person happens to be a woman or happens to be a man. As with race, the core guarantee of equal protection, ensuring citizens that their State will not discriminate . . . would be meaningless were we to approve the exclusion of jurors on the basis of such assumptions, which arise solely from the jurors\u2019 [gender].\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 145-46. Finally, the court expressly rejected the claim that its holding was likely to result in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>elimination of all peremptory challenges, stating that \u201c[p]arties may . . . exercise their peremptory challenges to remove from the venire any group or class of individuals normally subject to \u2018rational basis\u2019 review.\u201d Id., 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">One month after its decision in <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. </em>T.R., supra, 511 U.S. 127, the United States Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari;<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>511 <em>U.S. 1115, 114 S. </em>Ct. 2120, 128 L.

W.2d 767 (Minn. 1993), in which that court concluded that the federal constitution does not prohibit a party from exercising a peremptory challenge on the basis of religion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> See generally id., 770-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Justice Thomas, who, joined by Justice Scalia, dissented from the denial of the petition for certiorari, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>observed that <em>\u201cJ.E.B. </em>was explicitly grounded on a conclusion that peremptory strikes based on sex cannot survive heightened scrutiny under the [equal protection clause] . . . because such strikes are not substantially related to an important government objective .... In breaking the barrier between classifications that merit strict equal protection scrutiny and those that receive what we have termed heightened or intermediate scrutiny, <em>J.E.B. </em>would seem to have extended <em>Batson\u2019s </em>equal protection analysis to all strikes based on the latter category of classifications \u2014 a category which presumably would include classifications based on religion. Cf. <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Valente, </em>456 U.S. 228, [244-46, 102 S. Ct. 1673, 72 L. Ed. 2d 33] (1982); <em>Batson </em>[v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S.] 124 (Burger, C. J., dissenting). It is at least not obvious, given the reasoning in <em>J.E.B., </em>why peremptory strikes based on religious affiliation would survive equal protection analysis. . . . <em>J.E.B. </em>itself provided no rationale for distinguishing between strikes exercised on the basis of various classifications that receive heightened scrutiny .... Once the scope of the logic in <em>J.E.B. </em>is honestly acknowledged, it cannot be glibly asserted that the decision has no implications for peremptory strikes based on classifications other than sex, or that it does not imply further restrictions on the exercise of the peremptory strike outside the context of race and sex.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 1117-18 (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel.

Courts uniformly have employed strict scrutiny in evaluating the constitutionality of state interference with or involvement in religion.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Accordingly, in order for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>removal of a venireperson on the basis of his or her religious affiliation to survive equal protection analysis, we would have to be persuaded that allowing the use of a peremptory challenge in such circumstances constituted a narrowly tailored means to serve the compelling state interest of ensuring a fair and impartial jury. Although one\u2019s religious <em>beliefs </em>may render a prospective juror unsuitable for service in a particular case, one\u2019s religious <em>affiliation, </em>like one\u2019s race or gender, bears no relation to that person\u2019s ability to serve as a juror. See <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>McCollum, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 59 (\u201c[i]n our heterogenous society policy as well as constitutional considerations militate against the divisive assumption \u2014 as a <em>per se </em>rule \u2014 that justice in a court of law may turn upon the pigmentation of skin, the accident of birth, or <em>the choice of </em>religion\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]). Moreover, to allow the exclusion of an otherwise qualified venireperson simply on account of that person\u2019s religious affiliation would amount to permitting jury selection procedures that promote \u201cstate-sponsored group stereotypes rooted in, and reflective of, historical prejudice\u201d; <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>supra, 511 U.S. 128; a practice that the United States Supreme Court expressly has rejected as violative of the equal protection clause. Absent a showing that the holding of <em>J.E.B. </em>is not logically applicable to religion, we conclude that the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution prohibits the exercise of a peremptory challenge to excuse a venireperson because of his or her religious affiliation.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>Having so concluded, however, we agree with the trial court that the state\u2019s attorney did not excuse M.F. on the basis of his religious affiliation. It is true that the state\u2019s attorney, upon learning of M.F.\u2019s adherence to the Islamic faith,<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> questioned him extensively about his religious beliefs. The trial court found, however, that he had done so to determine whether those beliefs were likely to affect adversely his ability to serve as a juror.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Indeed, a review of the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s voir dire of M.F. reveals that his questions concerning reli<em>gion </em>\u2014 to <em>which no objections were made on relevancy grounds </em>\u2014 were motivated primarily by a concern that the teachings of the particular Islamic sect to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>M.F. belonged might prevent him from rendering a verdict in accordance with the law. Although it is true that several of the questions asked by the state\u2019s attorney regarding M.F.\u2019s religious background were of dubious relevance,<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> the great majority of the questions addressed beliefs held by M.F. that might affect his ability to serve impartially as a juror and follow the court\u2019s instructions.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> In addition, although certain lines of questioning appeared to stem from either the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s lack of knowledge about the Islamic faith or possible misconceptions about it, the entire record supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the in-depth questioning put to M.F. by the state\u2019s attorney did not give rise to an inference that the state had exercised a peremptory challenge against M.F. on account of M.F.\u2019s religious affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>Finally, M.F. expressly indicated that, in the event of a conflict between the court\u2019s instructions and his religious beliefs, he would seek guidance from his religious leader about how to handle the situation.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> This response alone provided a reasonable basis for the state\u2019s attorney to doubt whether M.F. could follow the court\u2019s instructions, including the requirement that he not discuss the case with anyone during the pendency of the trial. Accordingly, the trial court properly concluded that, to the extent that the state\u2019s attorney had excused M.F. for reasons related to his religion, those reasons were not based upon M.F.\u2019s religious affiliation, but, rather, upon certain views that could impair his ability to decide the case solely on the facts and the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">We also reject the defendant\u2019s claim that the other reasons given by the state\u2019s attorney in support of the peremptory challenge were so unfounded as to be pre-textual. The state\u2019s attorney was principally concerned with M.F.\u2019s prior arrest record,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> a consideration that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>for obvious reasons, generally has been recognized as a proper ground for the exercise of a peremptory challenge. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>935 F.2d 862, 864-65 (7th Cir. 1991), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1045, 112 S. Ct. 907, 116 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1992); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 14; <em>State </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>516 So. 2d 349, 354 (La. 1987), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 871,109 S. Ct. 180, 102 L. Ed. 2d 149 (1988). In connection with one of M.F.\u2019s arrests, he testified that, although he did not believe that the police or the prosecutor treated him unfairly, he was frustrated with the manner in which the police had handled the arrest. Moreover, M.F.\u2019s obscure reference to past misdeeds,<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> some of the details of which were not disclosed, his prior representation by a public defender in connection with his burglary conviction, and his acquaintance with a person serving a sentence of life imprisonment provide support;, in varying degrees, for the concerns of the state\u2019s attorney regarding M.F.\u2019s ability to serve impartially and objectively as a juror. Finally, the other reasons given by the state\u2019s attorney to justify the exclusion of M.F., namely, M.F.\u2019s equivocal responses to questions about whether he might harbor any sympathy for the defendant,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>apparent confusion over the applicable standard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>proof<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> and his potential bias toward Griffith, the director of the mental health center,<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> all have a sufficient basis in the record. In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court properly determined that the state had not rejected M.F. on account of either his race or his religious affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">5</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Venireperson G.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-8\">On the twenty-seventh day of voir dire,<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> the state exercised a peremptory challenge to excuse G.D., a twenty-three year old Hispanic male. The defendant, exercising his right under <em>Batson, </em>requested that the state\u2019s attorney articulate the reasons for excluding G.D. from the jury. The state\u2019s attorney initially asserted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>that he was not required to render such an articulation because, he claimed, the law does not require the state to give race neutral reasons for its use of a peremptory challenge against a minority venireperson unless the prospective juror is the same race as the defendant. The state\u2019s attorney nevertheless provided the following reasons for excluding G.D. from the jury panel: (1) G.D. likely would be overwhelmed by the medical testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s psychiatric defenses; (2) G.D. had little or no experience in making important decisions; (3) G.D. was acquainted with a murderer and the murderer\u2019s victim; (4) G.D. had had an unpleasant experience with a police officer; and (5) G.D. was the second youngest in a family of seven children, of which he was the only male.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-6\">The defendant claimed that the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney were pretextual. In particular, he argued that a white juror with a sixth grade education who had \u201cworked on cars in his backyard for his entire life\u201d already had been accepted.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> The defendant further observed that, although G.D. had stated that he knew a murderer and that murderer\u2019s victim, he did not claim to be a friend of either one. The state\u2019s attorney acknowledged that he had accepted a white juror with less formal education than G.D., but explained that that juror was considerably older than G.D. The trial court accepted the reasons advanced by the state\u2019s attorney and found that the peremptory challenge was not racially motivated.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-7\">We begin by observing that, contrary to the assertion made by the state\u2019s attorney during voir dire, a <em>Batson </em>claim may be made with respect to a venireperson who is not a member of the same race as the defendant. In <em>Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>499 U.S. 400, 415, 111 S. Ct. 1364, 113 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>L. Ed. 2d 411 (1991), the United States Supreme Court extended the <em>Batson </em>principle to prohibit the use of racially motivated peremptoiy challenges irrespective of the race of the defendant. Accordingly, the defendant in the present case was entitled to raise a <em>Batson </em>claim in connection with the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge to excuse G.D.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-6\">Turning to the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney for excusing G.D., we conclude that, although the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge against G.D. presents a closer question than the defendant\u2019s other <em>Bat-son </em>claims, the trial court\u2019s ruling was not clearly erroneous. In support of G.D.\u2019s removal from the panel, the state\u2019s attorney observed, first, that G.D. might experience difficulty understanding the expert psychiatric testimony in light of his \u201cless than illustrious\u201d high school career. G.D. had stated that, during high school, his principal concern was \u201c[g]etting it over with.\u201d G.D. then elaborated: \u201cI wasn\u2019t really too good of a student. I didn\u2019t get too involved with it. I just did my work.\u201d The defendant then asked G.D. whether he \u201cenjoy[ed] doing a lot of reading or not really?\u201d G.D. responded \u201c[n]o.\u201d Although a careful review of G.D\u2019s voir dire testimony indicates that G.D. did not appear- to be confused by the questions, he responded monosyllabically to most questions, thereby creating the impression that his comprehension may have been somewhat superficial.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We are mindful, moreover, that appellate review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>of a cold record is no substitute for the ability of the trial court to witness firsthand a venireperson\u2019s responses and demeanor. \u201cA prosecutor . . . may legitimately [base his or her decision] not only on answers given by the prospective juror to questions posed on voir dire, but also on the prosecutor\u2019s observations of the prospective juror. An impression of the conduct and demeanor of a prospective juror during the voir dire may provide a legitimate basis for the exercise of a peremptory challenge. . . . Thus, a prosecutor\u2019s explanation that a venireperson was excluded because he or she seemed, for example, inattentive or hostile to the government, if credible is sufficient.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 254-55 n.15.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-6\">The state\u2019s attorney also observed that G.D. never had been \u201cput in a position where he had to make decisions,\u201d noting that G.D.\u2019s job did not require decision making. G.D. had testified that he had been employed for the preceding five years as a waste water treatment operator, explaining: \u201cI take samples of the water and I get the pH [readings], mak[ing] sure everything is within range, [and] not out of regulation.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Although the record does not establish with specificity the extent, if any, to which G.D.\u2019s job entailed independent decision making, his description was of work that appeared to be routine and perfunctory, rather than supervisory or managerial. Accordingly, the record provides sufficient grounds for inferring that G.D.\u2019s employment required little or no decision making.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Because jurors in a criminal case are called upon to make critical decisions about the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>perceived lack of a demonstrated ability to make decisions constitutes one reasonable basis upon which to gauge the suitability of a prospective juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">The defendant also contends that his claim of pretext is supported by the fact that the state already had accepted a venireperson with less formal education than G.D. Specifically, he claims that the state\u2019s acceptance of W.V., a white juror who possessed a sixth grade education, indicates that G.D.\u2019s purported lack of education simply was a makeweight argument designed to mask the real reason why the state sought to exclude G.D., namely, because he is Hispanic.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">The record indicates, however, that W.V. and G.D. were markedly different in certain other key respects. In particular, W.V., who was forty-six years old, was significantly older than G.D., who was twenty-three. Moreover, W.V., who had been married for many years, had managed his own automotive repair business and raised two children to adulthood. Consequently, it was reasonable for the state\u2019s attorney to conclude that W.V., by virtue of his greater maturity and life experience, would be a more desirable juror than G.D., a young, single male who lived with his parents and collected autographs and baseball cards and watched television in his spare time.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>supra, 86 F.3d 683 (venireperson with limited education and who was young, single and living with parents excused for race neutral reasons); <em>Ex parte Brooks, </em>695 So. 2d 184, 190 (Ala. 1997) (venireperson who was young, single and generally inexperienced was properly subject to peremptory challenge).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">The state also proffered reasons relating to G.D.\u2019s potential bias. First, G.D. reported that, nearly two years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>earlier, a police officer, while arresting G.D.\u2019s friend for breach of the peace, used excessive force and \u201ctried to be too macho.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> When the case went to court, G.D. was called as a witness; the case eventually was dismissed and the police officer was reprimanded. Although G.D. maintained that this experience would have no bearing on his performance as a juror,<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> the state\u2019s attorney was entitled to rely, instead, on his own impression regarding the extent to which the incident was likely to affect G.D.\u2019s ability to be impartial. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 14-15 (juror\u2019s use of word \u201charassed\u201d to describe encounter with police belied his assertion that he could be impartial).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">We acknowledge that the remaining reasons offered by the state\u2019s attorney in support of the state\u2019s exercise of a peremptory challenge against G.D., namely, G.D.\u2019s casual acquaintance with the victim of a homicide and the victim\u2019s perpetrator,<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> and the fact that he is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>second youngest of six siblings,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> lack any obvious relevance to G.D.\u2019s qualifications as a juror. The state\u2019s attorney did not explain how these factors might have tended to affect G.D.\u2019s performance, and neither the defendant nor the trial court sought such an explanation. Although it is difficult for us to discern the relevance of these considerations, we are not prepared to say, in light of the other reasons offered by the state\u2019s attorney, that they necessarily must give rise to a finding of pretext. Although reasons that appear unrelated or only marginally related to the issues in the case or to a juror\u2019s qualifications will, in some circumstances, result in a finding of pretext, \u201ceven where the acceptability of a particular explanation is doubtful, the inquiiy is not at an end. In deciding the ultimate issue of discriminatory intent, the judicial officer is entitled to assess each explanation in light of all the other evidence relevant to prosecutorial intent. ... As with most inquiries into state of mind, the ultimate determination depends on an aggregate assessment of all the circumstances.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 26. Although G.D., in contrast to some of the other venirepersons who were subject to peremptory challenges, did not possess attributes strongly suggestive of an inability to fulfill the duties of a juror, we are persuaded that, in light of all of the circumstances, including G.D.\u2019s youth, his modest academic goals and accomplishments, and his general lack of experience and sophistication, the trial court\u2019s rejection of the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim with respect to G.D. was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>6</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">Venireperson B.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">On the thirty-first day of voir dire, the state exercised its twentieth peremptory challenge against B.A., an African-American female, which prompted the defendant\u2019s sixth <em>Batson </em>claim.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The state\u2019s attorney explained that he had excused B.A. because she had: (1) an eighth grade education and a sporadic work history; (2) two brothers with criminal records; (3) an arrest for a domestic incident; (4) received psychiatric treatment at an institution that may have been affiliated with the mental health center; and (5) given inconsistent answers during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">With respect to B.A.\u2019s educational background, the defendant again claimed that, because the state\u2019s attorney did not excuse W.V., the white juror with a sixth grade education, his stated reliance on B.A.\u2019s eighth grade education was pretextual. As further evidence of the state\u2019s alleged discriminatory intent, the defendant also asserted that certain white professionals<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> had not been asked about their own or their family members\u2019 experiences with the criminal justice system. As to the defendant\u2019s latter contention, the state\u2019s attorney countered that he had not asked B.A. whether she had been involved with the criminal justice system, but, rather, that she had volunteered that information when he inquired whether she or anyone in her family had ever been the victim of a crime. The state\u2019s attorney also observed that, of the nineteen peremptory challenges the state previously had exercised, fifteen had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>used to excuse persons who were not African-American. The trial court overruled the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">The record amply supports the trial court\u2019s determination that the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney for excluding B.A. from the jury were not pretextual. B.A. had two brothers with serious criminal histories; one had been arrested twelve times for burglary and both had served time in prison. In addition, B.A. and her boyfriend had been arrested for a domestic dispute two years earlier. Although the charges against her subsequently were dismissed, B.A. stated that she did not think that the police had treated her fairly. In light of these circumstances, it was reasonable for the state\u2019s attorney to conclude that B.A.\u2019s exposure to the criminal justice system might prejudice her against the prosecution in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">Furthermore, although B.A. stated that she was not acquainted with Griffith, a key defense witness who also was the director of the mental health center, she had received treatment for depression at a facility to which she had been referred by the mental health center that may have been affiliated with the mental health center. In addition, B.A. gave ambiguous or inconsistent answers to several key questions during her voir dire, including inquiries relating to the presumption of innocence, publicity concerning the crime, the psychiatric defenses and sympathy for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">Finally, the trial court was not required to conclude that the state engaged in purposeful discrimination against B.A., who had an eighth grade education, simply because the state did not exercise a peremptory challenge to excuse W.V., the white male with a sixth grade education. B.A.\u2019s limited education was only one of several factors that prompted the state to exercise a peremptory challenge against her, and it was reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>for the trial court to have concluded that B.A.\u2019s educational level, when considered with the other valid reasons articulated by the state\u2019s attorney, constituted an objective, nondiscriminatory reason for B.A.\u2019s exclusion from the jury panel.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s sixth and final <em>Batson </em>claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">In concluding our discussion of the defendant\u2019s <em>Bat-son </em>claims, we make a few additional observations that lend support to the trial court\u2019s findings that the state did not engage in purposeful discrimination in the exercise of its peremptory challenges. First, at the time of each <em>Batson </em>challenge, the state already had accepted minority venirepersons; the final jury of twelve regular and three alternate jurors included four African-Americans and two Hispanics. As we previously have noted, the trial court, in assessing the validity of the state\u2019s proffered reasons, is entitled to take into account the extent to which the state has accepted minority venire-persons. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 332. Second, the state declined to exercise seven of its allotted peremptory challenges. \u201cThe waiving of a challenge when minority venirepersons were available for challenge, though it provides no insulation from judicial scrutiny, is a factor that can lend some support to a finding of race neutral challenges.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Alvarado, </em>supra, 951 F.2d 26; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 332.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-9\">We again emphasize that \u201cthe issue of purposeful racial discrimination in the state\u2019s use of peremptory jury challenges is a matter of utmost seriousness, not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>only for the integrity of a particular trial but also for the perceived fairness of the judicial system as a whole.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). Because purposeful discrimination on the basis of gender and religion similarly has no place in our justice system, the use of peremptory challenges for either of those two reasons also cannot be tolerated. At the same time, however, we are mindful that the fact-bound determination concerning the propriety of the use of peremptory challenges is a matter that necessarily must be entrusted to the sound judgment of the trial court, which, unlike an appellate court, can observe the attorney and the venireperson and assess the attorney\u2019s proffered reasons in light of all the relevant circumstances. In this case, we conclude that the record supports the trial court\u2019s findings that the state did not discriminate on the basis of race or religious affiliation in the exercise of its peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">THE JURY INSTRUCTION CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">The defendant also claims that the trial court improperly instructed the jury with respect to the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">The following facts are relevant to our resolution of this claim. The defendant submitted a request to charge on extreme emotional disturbance, seeking the instruction that, \u201c[a]s used in this affirmative defense, the word \u2018extreme\u2019 has its ordinary meaning, that is, it means great or substantial.\u201d The trial court rejected the defendant\u2019s request and, instead, provided the jury with the definition of the term \u201cextreme\u201d that we expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>adopted, for purposes of the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 10, 411 A.2d 3 (1979) (\u201c[i]n its charge, the trial court should explain that the term \u2018extreme\u2019 refers to the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm for that individual\u201d). Thus, the trial court, in accordance with <em>Ellio tt, </em>instructed the jury that \u201cthe word \u2018extreme\u2019 . . . means the greatest degree of intensity away from the norm, away from the normal or usual state of the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> The defendant excepted to the court\u2019s instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The defendant concedes that the court\u2019s definition of the term extreme was expressly authorized, and indeed, mandated, by this court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 10. He claims, nevertheless, that the definition that we adopted in <em>Elliott </em>creates an unreasonably high threshold for a defendant who claims to have acted under an extreme emotional disturbance, and that the instruction he requested provides a fairer and more accurate statement of the degree to which the emotional disturbance must be found to have affected the defendant\u2019s mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">We are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument. The definition of extreme that we adopted nearly two decades ago in <em>Elliott </em>is, by now, well established in our jurisprudence. E.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 681, 718 A.2d 925 (1998); <em>State </em>v. <em>DeJesus, </em>236 Conn. 189, 204, 672 A.2d 488 (1996). Indeed, the legislature has taken no action to change the definition of extreme that we approved in <em>Elliott. </em>\u201cWhile we are aware that legislative inaction is not necessarily legislative affirmation; see <em>Conway </em>v. <em>Wilton, </em>238 Conn. 653, 662, 680 A.2d 242 (1996); we also presume that the legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>is aware of [this court\u2019s] interpretation of a statute, and that its subsequent nonaction may be understood as a validation of that interpretation. <em>Ralston Purina Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>203 Conn. 425, 439, 525 A.2d 91 (1987).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>240 Conn. 727, 733-34, 694 A.2d 758 (1997).<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> Moreover, because \u00a7 53a-54a (a) contains no definition of the term extreme, \u201cit is appropriate to look to the common understanding of the term as expressed in a dictionary.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Payne, </em>240 Conn. 766, 771, 695 A.2d 525 (1997). The definition that the defendant challenges is derived from the dictionary, which defines extreme as \u201cexisting in the highest or the greatest possible degree .... [S]ituated at the farthest possible point from a center . . . farthest advanced in any direction.\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">In support of his claim, the defendant relies on two out-of-state cases, <em>State </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>753 P.2d 439 (Utah 1988), and <em>State v. Ott, </em>297 Or. 375, 686 P.2d 1001 (1984). Neither case constitutes persuasive precedent for the defendant\u2019s contention. In <em>Bishop, </em>the Utah Supreme Court did not address the validity of the trial court\u2019s definition of the word extreme in connection with the defendant\u2019s claim of extreme emotional disturbance. Instead, the court considered whether the trial court misinstructed the jury by limiting the realm of emotional disturbances recognized under the state\u2019s manslaughter statute to those triggered by external stimuli to which the defendant\u2019s reaction was reasonable. See generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>supra, 467-72.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>In <em>Ott, </em>the defendant challenged the trial court\u2019s instruction on extreme emotional disturbance on a number of grounds, including the ground that the court should not have defined the word extreme at all, but, instead, should have explained the term \u201cextreme emotional disturbance\u201d as a whole.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Ott, </em>supra, 297 Or. 390. The Oregon Supreme Court agreed, concluding that \u201ca trial court . . . should pose the issue in terms of whether [the] defendant was under the influence of an emotional disturbance to the extent that he lost his self-control that would have otherwise prevented his committing the homicide.\u201d Id., 393. The court also noted that the definition of extreme used by the trial court \u201cwould seem to require a state of mind so far from the norm as to be characteristic of a mental illness. The defense was meant to be understood in more relative terms as referring to a loss of self-control due to intense feelings.\u201d Id., 392. In this case, in contrast to <em>Ott, </em>the defendant does not claim that the trial court should have refrained from providing <em>any </em>definition of the term extreme, but, rather, that it should have defined the term differently.<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Moreover, we disagree with the dicta in <em>Ott </em>that the use of the dictionary definition of the word extreme in the context of a claim of extreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>emotional disturbance necessarily carries with it the suggestion that the defendant must establish that he or she was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offense. See id. Furthermore, any such possibility was dispelled in this case by the totality of the trial court\u2019s jury charge, in which the court explained the difference between the defendant\u2019s insanity defense, which required proof of a mental disease or defect, and his defense of extreme emotional disturbance, which, by contrast, required proof only that the defendant acted under the influence of an extreme emotional disturbance. Specifically, the trial court, after distinguishing between the defendant\u2019s insanity defense and his defense of extreme emotional disturbance, explained to the jury that, in order to establish his claim of extreme emotional disturbance, the defendant was required to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he \u201cwas exposed to an extremely unusual and overwhelming state that is more than mere annoyance or unhappiness,\u201d and that he \u201chad an extreme emotional reaction to that state as a result of which there was a loss of self-control and his reason was overborne by intense feelings such as passion, anger, distress, grief, obsessive agitation or other similar emotions.\u201d The trial court further explained to the jury that it \u201cshould give consideration to whether the intensity of these feelings was such that the defendant\u2019s usual intellectual controls failed and his normal rational thinking no longer prevailed at the time of the act.\u201d In light of these instructions, we are persuaded that the trial court, in accordance with the dictates of <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>supra, 177 Conn. 10, properly instructed the jury regarding the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

See, e.g., <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 358-59, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 395 (1991); <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 96-98. Pursuant to this court\u2019s supervisory authority over the administration of justice, we have eliminated the requirement, contained in the first step of this process, that the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 &amp; n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). Thus, in this state, after the party contesting the use of the peremptory challenge has raised a <em>Batson </em>claim, the party exercising the challenge must proffer a race neutral explanation for its decision to strike the venireperson from the jury array. Id., 646. In Connecticut, therefore, the party objecting to the exercise of the peremptory challenge satisfies step one of the tripartite process simply by raising the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court specified that, although the reason for a peremptory challenge \u201cneed not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause\u201d; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 97; it must be \u201c \u2018clear and reasonably specific\u2019 \u201d; id., 98 n.20; and \u201crelated to the particular case to be tried.\u201d Id., 98.

[t]he second step of this process does not demand an explanation that is persuasive, or even plausible. At this [second] step of the inquiry, the issue is the facial validity of the prosecutor\u2019s explanation. . . . It is not until the <em>third </em>step that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant .... At that stage, implausible or fantastic justifications may (and probably will) be found to be pretexts for purposeful discrimination. But to say that a trial judge <em>may choose to disbelieve </em>a silly or superstitious reason at step three is quite different from saying that a trial judge <em>must terminate </em>the inquiry at step two when the race-neutral reason is silly or superstitious.\u201d (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 767-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\"> The dissent incorrectly asserts that we have applied the wrong test in reviewing the defendant\u2019s claim under <em>Batson </em>and <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 646 <em>&amp; </em>n.4, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989). See part II of the dissenting opinion. The dissent suggests that we apply the test enunciated by the dissenting opinion in <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 770, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting), whereby the party offering the race neutral reason at step two of the process would be required to demonstrate, at that second step, that the reason was related to the trial of the case. Id., 775 (Stevens, J., dissenting). This contention is flawed for several reasons. First, the defendant has not raised this claim. On the contrary, the defendant\u2019s sole and exclusive argument is that he is entitled to prevail under the majority holding in <em>Purkett, </em>which indicates that case relatedness is to be considered by the trial court at step three. See id., 768; see also footnote 18 of this opinion. Indeed, the defendant expressly concedes that \u201cthe state has met its burden\u201d of establishing a legitimate, race neutral reason for the exercise of the challenge under step two of the <em>Batson-Holloway </em>test, claiming only that the state \u201chas failed under step [three].\u201d Second, tire defendant has challenged the state\u2019s exercise of its peremptory challenges under the United States constitution only; he makes no claim under the state constitution and does not ask us to invoke our supervisory authority. Consequently, we are bound to apply the <em>Batson </em>test as explicated by the majority in <em>Purkett, </em>subject, of course, to the modification to step one of that test as previously approved by this court in <em>Holloway. </em>Furthermore, contrary to the assertion of the dissent, <em>Purkett </em>did <em>not </em>effect a change in the court\u2019s <em>Batson </em>jurisprudence; in fact, the court in <em>Purkett </em>expressly and emphatically explained that it was applying the <em>same </em>three step procedure that it previously had adopted in <em>Batson. Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>supra, 767. Thus, as the court in <em>Purkett </em>stated in concluding that the Circuit Court of Appeals had used an improper test, \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals erred by combining <em>Batson's </em>second and third steps into one, requiring that the justification tendered at the second step be not just neutral but also at least minimally persuasive, i.e., a \u2018plausible\u2019 basis for believing that \u2018the person\u2019s ability to perform his or her duties as a juror will be affected.\u201d Id., 768. The court in <em>Purkett </em>went on to explain that \u201c[t]he Court of Appeals appears to have seized on our admonition in <em>Batson </em>that to rebut a prima facie case, the proponent of a strike must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of his legitimate reasons for exercising the challenges . . . and that the reason must be related to the particular case to be tried .... <em>This warning was meant to refute the notion that a prosecutor could satisfy his burden of production by merely denying that he had a discriminatory motive or by merely affirming his good faith. What </em>[Batson] <em>means by a legitimate reason is not a reason that makes sense, but a reason that does not deny equal protection.\u201d </em>(Citations omitted; emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 768-69. The dissent, in mischaracterizing the holding of the court in Purkett; see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>footnote 15 of the dissenting opinion; ignores the unambiguous language of the <em>Purkett </em>majority and, instead, chooses to rely on the <em>Purkett dissent\u2019s </em>characterization of the majority opinion. Finally, even if the defendant had raised a claim under the state constitution, he could not prevail because, as we recently have reiterated, \u201d[a]fter the burden shifts to the state to demonstrate that its challenges were race-neutral, the defendant\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim is treated similarly under the state and federal constitutions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 245 n.6; accord <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 322 n.23.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">The dissent also contends that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 404, we indicated our approval of what has since become the test advocated by the dissent in <em>Purkett </em>for purposes of state law. See footnote 21 of the dissenting opinion. This assertion is false. We expressly noted in <em>Gonzalez </em>that our decision in that case rested solely upon <em>Batson\u2019s </em>interpretation of the <em>federal </em>constitution and not any independent ground under state law. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 393-94 n.2. Because the defendant makes no claim that article first, \u00a7 8, of the constitution of Connecticut affords him any additional protection from discriminatory jury selection, our decision today rests on federal grounds. Indeed, the language that the dissent takes from <em>Gonzalez to </em>support its contention is a direct quote from <em>Batson. </em>See id., 404; footnote 21 of the dissenting opinion. Moreover, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>we <em>rejected </em>a case-relatedness argument nearly identical to the argument advanced by the dissent. <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>supra, 404. Thus, as we stated previously, our state jurisprudence differs from <em>Batson </em>only in that, under state law, we dispense with the requirement that the defendant make a prima facie showing of discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">The dissent further asserts that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 717 A.2d 168 (1998), this court adopted the test advocated by the dissent in <em>Purkett. </em>We disagree. Although we acknowledge that <em>Beltran </em>contains some discussion of case relatedness during the analysis of step two of the process established under <em>Batson </em>and <em>Holloway, </em>id., 279-80; our decision in <em>Beltran </em>was predicated solely upon the federal constitution; id., 277 n.7 (\u201c[b]ecause the defendant has failed to provide any independent analysis under file state constitution [appellate review is limited] to the federal constitution\u201d); and, therefore, we were not free to deviate from the test enunciated by the majority in <em>Purkett. </em>Moreover, no claim was made by either party in <em>Beltran </em>that the state was required to demonstrate case relatedness at step two of the process rather than at step three. Accordingly, we reject the dissent\u2019s contention that <em>Beltran </em>requires a showing of case relatedness prior to step three.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-9\">Finally, it is true, as the dissenting justice states, that the dissenting justice moved, sua sponte, to request the filing of supplemental briefs and reargument regarding his assertion, not raised by the defendant either in the trial court or on appeal, that we should apply the test advocated by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>dissent in <em>Purkett </em>rather than the test enunciated in <em>Batson </em>as explicated by the majority in <em>Purkett. </em>The dissenting justice did not do so, however, until a full ten months after oral argument in this case; indeed, his failure to raise the issue in a timely manner is the <em>sole </em>reason for the delay in the issuance of this opinion. Contrary to the approach belatedly advocated by the dissenting justice, we defer consideration of the argument he advances until it is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b240-7\"> The racial composition of the jury is not dispositive because \u201cthe striking of even one [prospective] juror on the basis of race violates the equal protection clause, even when other jurors of the defendant\u2019s race were seated . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 332.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\"> The dissent, in reliance on <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 400^107, contends that a trial court \u201cshould analyze each proffered reason for exercising the challenge in isolation from one another, but within the context of the entire record.\u201d In <em>Gonzalez, </em>we discussed each of the prosecutor\u2019s two reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge separately, solely in order to effectuate a thorough appellate review. We did not state, or otherwise intimate, that a trial court should evaluate each reason in isolation when determining whether it is pretextual.

E.g., <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 500 U.S. 364-65, 369; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Franklyn, </em>157 F.3d 90, 97 (2d Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"ACm\">In addition, the dissent, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 701, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995), maintains that we should subject the trial court\u2019s findings to ihe same \u201cindependent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding . . . .\u201d The defendant, however, has not sought such heightened review in this case; the dissent simply concludes that we should apply it. Moreover, in cases in which we have invoked the heightened review urged by the dissent, we have done so within the broader context of the clearly erroneous standard. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 448-50, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>supra, 700-701; <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). In any event, even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the trial court\u2019s findings, which led to the rejection of the defendant\u2019s claims of discriminatory intent, are subject to the same heightened review generally reserved for constitutional fact-finding, our \u201cindependent and scrupulous examination of the entire record\" persuades us that the defendant may not prevail on those claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b246-6\"> In <em>State v. Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 <em>Conn. </em>406, we reviewed and summarily rejected a disparate treatment claim under <em>Batson, </em>which was raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Gonzalez, </em>however, was decided prior to <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>supra, 213 Conn. 240, wherein we concluded that we will not review an unpreserved constitutional claim requiring a predicate factual determination. Because the defendant\u2019s unpreserved disparate treatment claim raises undecided questions of fact, we will not review it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b246-7\"> According to the dissent, this court, in evaluating the defendant\u2019s disparate treatment claims, should consider not only those venirepersons who were expressly identified by the defendant in the trial court in support of his claim, but, in addition, any other venirepersons whose selection by the state\u2019s attorney might support the defendant\u2019s claim of disparate treatment. We disagree. It would be both unfair and unreasonable to require the trial court to conduct a comparative evaluation of the backgrounds of venirepersons who have not been identified by the defendant in support of his <em>Batson </em>claim. Because a party is entitled to raise <em>&amp; Batson </em>challenge at any time prior to the swearing in of the jury; <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 250; there is no reason why the burden of identifying, with reasonable specificity, those venirepersons whose selection by the opposing party tends to support the moving party\u2019s <em>Batson </em>claim should be on the trial court, rather than on the party making the <em>Batson </em>claim. Moreover, because a claim of purposeful discrimination under <em>Batson </em>raises issues of fact to be decided by the trial court, the moving party\u2019s failure to inform the trial court of the full factual basis for the claim renders that claim unreviewable.

The defendant maintains that the trial court was required to address explicitly each reason given by the state\u2019s attorney for exercising the allegedly discriminatory peremptory challenge. The defendant, however, cites to no authority in support of his claim. Moreover, the defendant, having failed either to raise this argument in the trial court or to request a further, more specific articulation by that court regarding its findings, is not entitled to review of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The defendant also asserts that the record tends to demonstrate that the trial court, after concluding that one of the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney for the use of the peremptory challenge was legitimate, ended its inquiry instead of considering whether all of the reasons given by the state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>attorney, taken together and in light of all of the circumstances, gave rise to an inference of discriminatory intent. We reject the defendant\u2019s contention because it is not supported by the record. The record indicates that the trial court considered all of the reasons tendered by the state\u2019s attorney for exercising the peremptory challenges. The record also indicates that the trial court gave the defendant a full opportunity to demonstrate, in the case of each of his <em>Batson </em>challenges, why, in his view, the reasons proffered by the state\u2019s attorney were pretextual.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b252-10\"> J.G. initially appeared to indicate that her employer had had some contact with Biller Associates, but later denied it.

Although we agree with both of these observations, we are not persuaded that they provide a meaningful basis upon which to distinguish, for equal protection purposes, between the use of peremptory challenges to exclude venirepersons based on their race or gender, on the one hand, and their religious affiliation, on the other. Although it is true that the religious affiliation of a prospective juror is not as readily discernible as a venireperson\u2019s race or gender, and questions about a venireperson\u2019s religion may be objectionable, it is by no means improbable that an attorney, through the expert use of the voir dire process or otherwise, could ascertain a venireperson\u2019s religion. Indeed, this is especially true in this state due to the constitutional right to question prospective jurors individually and the statutory right to question prospective jurors outside the presence of other prospective jurors. See footnotes 13 and 14 of this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"43\">\n<p id=\"b262-8\"> Because religion-based constitutional challenges generally are raised under the free exercise or establishment clauses of the first amendment to the United States constitution, \u201c[r]eligious discrimination rarely is challenged under the [federal] equal protection clause.\u201d Note, \u201cApplying the Break: Religion and the Peremptory Challenge,\u201d 70 Ind.

I join in the majority opinion. I write separately, however, because it is neither necessary nor desirable to apply the holding of <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), to religious beliefs or affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In this case, as the majority recognizes, the state\u2019s attorney proffered valid reasons for excusing each venireperson. We have upheld a trial court\u2019s finding that a prosecutor\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge did not run afoul of <em>Batson </em>where at least one of the nondiscriminatory reasons articulated by the prosecutor was not pretextual. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 14 n.8, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992). This court, therefore, could have affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision without ruling on the constitutionality of peremptory challenges based upon religious beliefs or affiliation. This court has always \u201ceschew[ed] unnecessary determinations of constitutional questions.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Stamford Hospital </em>v. <em>Vega, </em>236 Conn. 646, 663, 674 A.2d 821 (1996). The court should do so here.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The importance of the peremptory challenge and the differences between race and gender and religious beliefs and affiliation weigh against extending <em>Batson </em>and <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 114 S. Ct. 1419, 128 L. Ed. 2d 89 (1994), to religion-based peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">For centuries, the peremptory challenge has been an important means of promoting fairness and impartiality in jury trials. \u201cThe principal value of the peremptory is that it helps produce fair and impartial juries. . . . Peremptory challenges, by enabling each side to exclude those jurors it believes will be most partial toward the other side, are a means of eliminat[ing] extremes of partiality on both sides, thereby assuring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the selection of a qualified and unbiased jury. . . . The peremptory\u2019s importance is confirmed by its persistence: It was well established at the time of Blackstone and continues to endure in all the States.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 147 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Over one hundred years ago, the United States Supreme Court, relying on the wisdom of Blackstone, described the peremptory challenge as \u201can arbitrary and capricious right [that] must be exercised with full freedom, or it fails of its full purpose.\u201d <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>United States, </em>146 U.S. 370, 378, 13 S. Ct. 136, 36 L. Ed. 1011 (1892). While the United States Supreme Court restricted the freedom to exercise peremptory challenges on the basis of race and gender in <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 89, and <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>supra, 511 U.S. 146, respectively, it has yet to do so for religious beliefs or affiliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The differences between race and gender and religious beliefs or affiliation are numerous and vital. A person\u2019s race and gender may be readily apparent, while \u201c[r]eligious affiliation (or lack thereof) is not as self-evident.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>511 U.S. 1115, 114 S. Ct. 2120, 128 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1994) (Ginsberg, J., concurring). People generally do not wear- their religions on their sleeves, and their beliefs are not readily apparent. Religious beliefs and affiliation also differ from race and gender in that people have control over the influence of their faith, belief or organized system of worship in their daily lives. See note, \u201cApplying the Break: Religion and the Peremptory Challenge,\u201d 70 Ind. L.J. 569, 594-95 (1995). Religion may be a chosen affiliation, and each person has free will to decide whether, and with what intensity, to practice a faith or adhere to a belief.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Furthermore, a showing of such an unconstitutional peremptory challenge would require counsel to question a venireperson about his or her religious convictions. Such questioning is quite properly disallowed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>under the first amendment to the United States constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cOrdinarily . . . inquiry on voir dire into a [venireperson\u2019s] religious affiliation and beliefs is irrelevant and prejudicial, and to ask such questions is improper.\u201d <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Minnesota, </em>supra, 511 U.S. 1115 (Ginsberg, J., concurring). \u201cQuestions about religious beliefs are relevant only if pertinent to religious issues involved in the case, or if a religious organization is a party, or if the information is a necessary predicate for a voir dire challenge. . . . The trial court, in the exercise of its discretion, controls the questions that can be asked to keep the voir dire within relevant bounds. . . . [P]roper questioning for a challenge should be limited to asking jurors if they knew of any reason why they could not sit, if they would have any difficulty in following the law as given by the court, or if they would have any difficulty in sitting in judgment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>504 N.W.2d 767, 772 (Minn. 1993), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1115, 114 S. Ct. 2120, 128 L. Ed. 2d 679 (1994). In the absence of a religious belief that may directly affect a venireperson\u2019s ability to serve on a jury in a particular case,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> religious beliefs are not relevant to the voir dire process and questions regarding religious beliefs should be disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>Because of the thin line between one\u2019s religious beliefs and one\u2019s other beliefs and biases, other problems will arise. While challenges based upon race and gender often are obvious, challenges based upon a venireperson\u2019s religion will be more difficult to evaluate. The court may be required to separate religious beliefs from other beliefs, thus attempting to determine what constitutes \u201creligion.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This would force courts to make judgments concerning religious beliefs, a practice that is both difficult and constitutionally suspect.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">The expansion of <em>Batson </em>to religious beliefs or affiliation would lead to its application to national origin, political affiliation and philosophy as well as other things that may distinguish potential jurors. See, e.g., <em>J.E.B. </em>v. <em>Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>supra, 511 U.S. 161 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201c[the majority\u2019s decision] places <em>all </em>peremptory strikes based on <em>any </em>group characteristic at risk, since they can all be denominated \u2018stereotypes\u2019 \u201d [emphasis in original]). While discrimination based on any of those differences, including religious beliefs or affiliation, is abhorrent, the continued expansion of <em>Batson </em>simply destroys the peremptory challenge. Trial lawyers have found these challenges necessary for centuries because peremptory challenges allow them to act on their intuition that a potential juror would not be sympathetic to their case. See generally <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995).

The United States Supreme Court recognized this fact when it stated: \u201c[W]e have not questioned the premise that racial discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends the dignity of persons and the integrity of the courts.

Ct. 3000, 120 L. Ed. 2d 876 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">This perception of racism is not the fault of the trial judges. Rather, to a great degree, this court must assume responsibility because it narrowly shapes the protective contours of our laws regarding jury selection and has failed repeatedly to apply those limited protections in order to assure that the selection is not tainted. Instead of firmly setting out the law for the guidance of the trial courts, this court sends mixed messages, as the majority does in the present case. Even worse, when confronted with obvious cases of the state\u2019s intentional discriminatory use of peremptoiy challenges in order to eliminate minorities, this court avoids reversal, as it does in this case, by affording the trial court \u201cgreat deference\u201d and refusing to overrule any trial court decision \u201cunless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d In short, the majority of this court does nothing more than pay lip service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>to the constitutional command that a peremptory challenge cannot be employed to exclude prospective jurors on the basis of race, gender or other prohibited discrimination pursuant to <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S. Ct. 1712, 90 L. Ed. 2d 69 (1986), and as modified by state law in <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>209 Conn. 636, 645-46, 553 A.2d 166, cert. denied, 490 U.S. 1071, 109 S. Ct. 2078, 104 L. Ed. 2d 643 (1989) (hereinafter <em>Batson/Holloway)</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Indeed, since the adoption of <em>Batson </em>by the United States Supreme Court in 1986, this court and the Appellate Court have reviewed claims of purposeful discrimination in the exercise of peremptory challenges in seventeen cases. <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Neither court, however, has ever found impermissible discrimination in the exercise of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>a peremptory challenge,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a statistical fact that lends credence to the public perception that our judicial system fosters discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The majority in this case adds fuel to the public perception that the judicial branch will tolerate racism. It refuses to review certain aspects of the <em>Batson/Hol-loway </em>issues in this case because it claims that they were not raised at trial or in this court. Although I take issue with my colleagues\u2019 claim that they were not raised in total, I must confess that some issues were not raised or not clearly argued.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As a result, I moved at conference for the court to request the filing of supplemental briefs and reargument, but my efforts were rejected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>1 am unable to understand my colleagues and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>I am sure that the African-American community will also be unable to understand their refusal, especially in view of the state\u2019s paper-thin case for murder that I shall describe herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">More importantly, merely because a lawyer either failed to raise a claim of law or incorrectly argued the law, does not mean that we should establish law that does not comport with concepts of justice. We deal with the precious liberty of persons. Indeed, in establishing and applying the law we sometimes, unfortunately, determine who shall live and who shall die. In other words, this is no game \u2014 we have grave responsibilities andmust do justice. Equally important, this opinion not only establishes the law for this case, but also for all the other relevant cases that are pending, as well as those that will arise in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">Furthermore, precedent does not support the majority\u2019s myopic review of this case. In the past this court has reviewed nonracial claims that were not raised in the trial court or in the Appellate Court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>when deciding such an issue in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 162, 540 A.2d 679 (1988), we explained: \u201cWe may ourselves determine to exercise our inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice to review the defendant\u2019s claim. ... To do so in this case would comport with the interests of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Citations omitted.) In <em>Genovese </em>v. <em>Gallo Wine Merchants, Inc., </em>226 Conn. 475, 480 n.6, 628 A.2d 946 (1993), in order to do justice the majority of this court raised on its own a statute it claimed was applicable, but was never raised by either party on appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The majority in the present case obviously concludes that the defendant\u2019s allegedly unpreserved claims herein, which are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>predicated on claims of racism and resulted in a sentence involving the loss of the defendant\u2019s liberty for a period of eighty-five years, deserve less consideration than the claims of the plaintiff in <em>Genovese, </em>which were concerned solely with money. I wholly disagree and would, at the very least, order rebriefing and reargument. Nevertheless, on the basis of what is before us, I would reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">In the present case, the defendant, Dennis Hodge, an African-American, was charged with the murder of two Caucasian independent insurance adjusters in a highly publicized case. The murder occurred during a meeting to discuss a settlement agreement that the adjusters had made with an insurance company on behalf of the defendant\u2019s mother, whose kitchen had been damaged as a result of a fire. The defendant and his mother believed that she deserved a larger settlement than the amount procured by the two adjusters. He admitted that he killed the two Caucasian victims, but claimed that he was not guilty due to mental disease or defect; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-13 (a); or, in the alternative, was guilty only of manslaughter due to extreme emotional disturbance. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The jury deliberated for nine days, during which time it reported that it was deadlocked on two occasions. Nevertheless, after the trial court gave the infamous coercive \u201cChip Smith\u201d* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> instruction, the jury returned a verdict finding the defendant guilty of intentional manslaughter of one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>victim, murder of the second victim, and carrying a pistol without a permit. The defendant was sentenced to prison for an effective term of eighty-five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">During jury selection, the defendant challenged the state\u2019s use of six peremptory challenges in excusing one Hispanic and five African-American venirepersons. The state in this case, as it typically does when a defendant challenges the constitutionality of the use of its peremptory challenges, furnished a laundry list of reasons in the hope that the court would find one to be nondiscriminatory and, therefore, uphold the peremptory challenge. Although I conclude that the trial court ruled incorrectly on all six challenges raised in this appeal, I will limit this dissent to the peremptory challenge of G.D.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I shall begin, however, by discussing some preliminary matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">First, I will discuss those portions of the majority opinion with which I agree, at least for the purpose of this decision. I agree with the majority that we must overrule cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>222 Conn. 1, 14 n.8, 608 A.2d 63, cert. denied, 506 U.S. 942, 113 S. Ct. 383, 121 L. Ed. 2d 293 (1992), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>206 Conn. 391, 405, 538 A.2d 210 (1988),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> to the extent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>that they explicitly or implicitly hold that <em>Batson/Hol-loway </em>is satisfied whenever a trial court finds that at least one of the proffered reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge was not pretextual. More specifically, I agree with the majority that \u201cthe trial court must consider all of the proffered reasons together in determining whether, as a factual matter, the party exercising the peremptory challenge was motivated, in whole or in part, by impermissible discriminatory considerations.\u201d Thus, whenever the trial court finds any one of the proffered reasons for exercising the challenge to be pretextual, at the very least the dual motivation analysis under federal law, as set forth in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>986 F.2d 24 (2d Cir. 1993), must be applied.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>In addition, I agree with the majority that the federal constitution\u2019s equal protection clause prohibits the use of peremptory challenges on the basis of religion. Of course, I also agree that a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>claim may be made when the venireperson is not of the same race as the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">I take issue with the majority\u2019s analysis of the law that is applicable to the present case. More specifically, I am greatly concerned with footnotes 18 and 19 of the majority opinion, wherein it sets forth the analysis required under <em>Batson </em>as modified pursuant to <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>514 U.S. 765, 115 S. Ct. 1769, 131 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1995), and refuses to apply Connecticut state law. The majority correctly explains the new standard set by the majority of the United States Supreme Court in <em>Purkett, </em>a per curiam decision, which allows a party to satisfy the second step of <em>Batson </em>\u2014 our first step under <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>\u2014 by advancing an explanation that is \u201cfantastic\u201d or simply \u201csilly or superstitious\u201d; id., 768; indeed, the reason need not be \u201cpersuasive, or even plausible.\u201d Id. Of course, it follows that a reason that is fantastic, silly, superstitious or implausible is not related to the particular case at hand or even a reason that tends to recur in all criminal trials. Id., 768-69; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 404 (relatedness encompasses reasons that recur in all criminal trials). In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>allowing such fantastic explanations, however, the majority disregards the fact that <em>Purkett </em>significantly diluted the second step of <em>Batson </em>(step one under <em>Bat-</em>son/Holloway). The United States Supreme Court in <em>Batson </em>had made it clear that the state\u2019s explanation had to be \u201ca neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98. This requirement of relatedness was adopted as part of our state law when we gave more protection to defendants by eliminating the necessity of the first step in <em>Batson. </em>Thus, in Connecticut, whenever such a claim is made by a defendant, the state must \u201cprovide the court with a prima facie case response consistent with the explanatory mandate of <em>Batson.'\u201d State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 646.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In footnote 19 of its opinion, the majority tries to gloss over this departure from <em>Batson, </em>which we adopted as our state law in <em>Holloway, </em>by simply declaring that <em>Purkett </em>\u201cexplicated\u201d <em>Batson\u2019s </em>second step. The majority disregards the significance of this change, and summarily adopts <em>Purkett </em>as our state law without allowing defense counsel to be heard or without addressing specifically whether relatedness will continue to be a factor under Connecticut law. The majority argues in footnote 19 <em>that </em>Purkett\u2019s majority rule, as modified by <em>Holloway, </em>should be applied in the present case because: (1) the defendant raised a claim of discrimination under the United States constitution only; (2) the defendant does not argue on appeal that the <em>Purkett </em>dissent should apply, but, rather, asserts that the state failed step three under <em>Batson </em>as modified by <em>Purkett-, </em>and (3) even if a state constitutional claim was raised, the state would still prevail because a <em>Batson </em>claim is treated similarly under the state and federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">I disagree. To begin, I must address a fundamental issue regarding this appeal; one that the majority opinion overlooks. Unless we are willing to ignore the plain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>language of <em>Bals\u00f3n </em>requiring a prosecutor to articulate a. \u201cneutral explanation <em>related </em>to the particular case to be tried\u201d; (emphasis added) <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98; we must admit that <em>Purkett </em>clearly changed federal law when it removed the requirement of relatedness in the second step of a <em>Batson </em>analysis. See <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>500 U.S. 352, 372, 111 S. Ct. 1859, 114 L. Ed. 2d 1859 (1991) (trial court could find pretext on sole basis that reason was not related \u201cto the particular circumstances of the trial\u201d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Accordingly, even if the present case was to be viewed through the narrow lens of federal law alone, <em>Purkett </em>would have no application to this case because voir dire was completed and a final verdict was rendered months before the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Purkett</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Therefore, it simply is disingenuous for the majority in the present case to rely on <em>Purkett </em>and to argue that relatedness was not a requirement for <em>Batson's </em>second step at the time of jury selection.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Furthermore, the fact that the defendant on appeal argues only that the state\u2019s proffered reasons fail the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>third step under <em>Batson, </em>as modified <em>by Purkett,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>does not require us to misapply the law, as I pointed out in the beginning of this dissent. It is well established that we have the authority to decide a case on a theory that was not espoused by the parties. See, e.g., <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>238 Conn. 1, 23-24, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996). This is especially appropriate in a case such as this when important matters are at stake \u2014 the perception of racism in our criminal justice system involving a defendant who has been given a sentence pursuant to which he will be incarcerated for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">It is clear that we have developed our own jurisprudence<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> in order to assure that the taint of discrimination based upon impermissible considerations is eliminated in jury selection, as evidenced by <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>supra, 209 Conn. 645-46. When we adopted the <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>constitutional analysis as modified by our common law, we indicated that the state had the burden of proving that its reasons be \u201ca neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried\u201d; <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 641. Accordingly, the majority simply is wrong when it states that a <em>Batson </em>claim is treated similarly under state and federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The majority concedes that two of the state\u2019s proffered reasons for exercising its peremptory challenge of G.D. \u201clack any obvious relevance,\u201d but goes on to conclude that, notwithstanding our own jurisprudence, unrelatedness does not necessarily mean that the proffered reasons are pretextual. Unrelatedness must be viewed in light of all relevant circumstances, according to the majority.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, the majority changes our law by removing the requirement that a proffered reason must be related to the trial at issue in order to rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and pass the first prong of <em>Batson/Holloway.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Such a holding is amazing in light of the unanimous decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>246 Conn. 268, 279-80, 717 A.2d 168 (1998), decided after Purkett,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> in which we explicitly reaffirmed Connecticut\u2019s requirement that a proffered reason must be both race neutral <em>and </em>related to the specific case at hand in order to rebut the prima facie case of discrimination. See id., 279 (\u201cthe state must \u2018articulate a neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried\u2019 \u201d). Indeed, the majority would have us believe that <em>Beltran </em>was an aberration of sorts. Yet, as early as 1988, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>supra, 206 Conn. 404, this court made it clear that \u201cthe neutral explanation given by the prosecutor must relate \u2018to the particular case to be tried.\u2019 <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, [476 U.S.] 98.\u201d In <em>Gonzales, </em>the sufficiency of the second step in <em>Batson, </em>the first step under <em>Batson/ Holloway, </em>was specifically at issue. This court explained that the relatedness includes whether \u201ca particular juror is unfit for duty because of an infirmity relating to his or her general status as a discerning observer of trial activity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 404. Once again, not only does the majority\u2019s lack of clarity add more confusion to Connecticut\u2019s law of peremptory challenges, but it also tramples on our state law and the rights of an accused. Simply put, the majority\u2019s decision today can be described only as result oriented.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In contrast, I agree with <em>Beltran, Gonzalez </em>and the dissent in <em>Purkett </em>that the explanation of the state must be at least \u201crace neutral, reasonably specific, <em>and </em>trial related.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 775 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Justice Stevens in his dissent pointed out the following: \u201cToday, without argument, the Court replaces the <em>Batson </em>standard with the surprising announcement that any neutral explanation, no matter how \u2018implausible or fantastic,\u2019 [id., 768], even if it is \u2018silly or superstitious,\u2019 [id.], is sufficient to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination. A trial court must accept that neutral explanation unless a separate \u2018step three\u2019 [step two under Holloway] inquiry leads to the conclusion that the peremptory challenge was racially motivated. The Court does not attempt to explain why a statement that \u2018the juror had a beard,\u2019 or \u2018the juror\u2019s last name began with the letter \u201cS\u201d \u2019 should satisfy step two, though a statement that T had a hunch\u2019 should not. See [id., 769]; <em>Batson </em>[v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98]. It is not too much to ask that a prosecutor\u2019s explanation for his strikes be race neutral, reasonably specific, <em>and </em>trial related. Nothing less will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>serve to rebut the inference of race-based discrimination that arises when the defendant has made out a prima facie case. Cf. <em>Texas Dept. of Community Affairs </em>v. <em>Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253 [101 S. Ct. 1089, 67 L. Ed. 2d 207] (1981). That, in any event, is what we decided in <em>Batson.\u201d </em>(Emphasis in original.) <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>supra, 775 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Justice Stevens\u2019 dissent in <em>Purkett </em>points out that \u201c \u2018 [ w] ere facially neutral explanations sufficient without more, <em>Batson </em>would be meaningless. It would take little effort for prosecutors who are of such a mind to adopt rote \u201cneutral explanations\u201d which bear facial legitimacy but conceal a discriminatory motive. We do not believe the Supreme Court intended a charade when it announced <em>Batson. </em>\u2019 \u201d Id., 773, quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Antwine, </em>743 S.W.2d 51, 65 (Mo. 1987). Likewise, the majority of this court now guts <em>Batson/Holloway </em>by allowing the state to satisfy its burden in step one by advancing such reasons as the prosecutor did not like the look of a venireperson\u2019s long hair or that the day was Friday the 13th.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In the magnificent words of Justice Glass, \u201cbecause this issue is of such vital importance to our real and perceived adherence to the rule of law, in the exercise of our inherent supervisory authority over the administration of justice\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Holloway, </em>supra, 209 Conn. 645-46; this court should reaffirm our state law that, in order to pass Batson/Holloway's first step the state\u2019s explanations for its peremptory challenge must be \u201crace neutral, reasonably specific, and trial related.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 775 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 279-80; <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 404.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>If the state fails to meet this test, the trial court must strike the peremptory challenge and seat the venire-person as a juror. Nevertheless, even under federal law as set forth in <em>Batson </em>and as modified by the majority in <em>Purkett, </em>I believe the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">I start my analysis with this court\u2019s standard of review for the trial court\u2019s rejection of a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge. The majority claims that the trial court\u2019s decisions on the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenges are entitled <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>to \u201cgreat deference and will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.\u201d That is simply an incorrect statement of the law and, if it was correct, inapplicable to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">First, the majority ignores the heightened standard with which we review findings of factual underpinnings necessary to determine constitutional issues arising from jury selection.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In <em>State </em>v. <em>Ellis, </em>232 Conn. 691, 701, 657 A.2d 1099 (1995), Justice Norcott writing for a unanimous court held: \u201c[Bjecause of the constitutional implications of the alleged defect in the jury selection process, we will subject the findings of the trial court to the same \u2018independent and scrupulous examination of the entire record that we employ in our review of constitutional fact-finding . . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Ross, </em>230 Conn. 183, 259, 646 A.2d 1318 (1994) . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> (Citations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>omitted.) <em>Filis </em>is by no means an isolated case. We have recognized this heightened review in other cases. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 449, 680 A.2d 147 (1996); <em>State </em>v. <em>Medina, </em>228 Conn. 281, 294, 636 A.2d 351 (1994); <em>State </em>v. <em>Greenfield, </em>228 Conn. 62, 68-69, 634 A.2d 879 (1993). To be sure, if there is any question about our review, it clearly was put to rest in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mercer, </em>208 Conn. 52, 58, 544 A.2d 611 (1988): \u201cDue to the serious constitutional implications of the defendant\u2019s claim [regarding voir dire during jury selection], we \u2018have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\u2019 <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Maxwell, </em>384 U.S. 333, 362-63, 86 S. Ct. 1507, 16 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Marra, </em>195 Conn. 421, 428, 489 A.2d 350 (1985); <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>177 Conn. 677, 685-86, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979).\u201d I can conclude only that the majority either fails to take seriously <em>Batson/HoUoway </em>claims or fails to understand that those claims have constitutional underpinnings. It simply is baffling that the majority is turning a blind eye to our former jurisprudence in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Second, even if the \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d standard applied, which it does not, such deferential review does not mean the kind of deference that the majority applies in this case. \u201cDiscretion means a legal discretion, to be exercised in conformity with the spirit of the law and in a manner to subserve and not to impede or defeat the ends of substantial justice. In a plain case this discretion has no office to perform, and its exercise is limited to doubtful cases, where an impartial mind hesitates.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Onofrio, </em>179 Conn. 23, 29, 425 A.2d 560 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Furthermore, at least with respect to the first step under <em>Batson/Holloway, </em>an appellate court reviewing a trial court finding should make a determination without deference. <em>Purkett v.

Justice Stevens, in his <em>Purketl </em>dissent, pointed out that the majority opinion implicitly ratified the appellate court\u2019s independent evaluation of whether the prosecutor satisfied step two of the <em>Batson </em>challenge without deference to the trial court. Id., 776. In other words, an appellate court, without any deference to the trial court, can determine whether the prosecutor\u2019s explanation is \u201crace neutral, reasonably specific, <em>and </em>trial related.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 775 (Stevens, J., dissenting). \u201cThis presents a pure legal question, and nothing is gained by remand if the appeals court can resolve that question on the facts before it.\u201d Id., 776 (Stevens, J., dissenting). To do otherwise would result, in appellate court review that is nothing more than a meaningless charade. Id., 777 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In the present case, the trial court\u2019s determinations of whether the peremptory challenge passed the first step of <em>Batson/Holloway </em>likewise should be subject to an independent review by this court based on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">Finally, under the facts of this case, it would be unfair to defer to the trial court decisions regarding the <em>Bat-son/Holloway </em>challenges because the trial court\u2019s review of the challenges raised by the defendant was superficial. For example, after the defendant made the first <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge, the trial court asked the prosecutor if he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to respond to the defendant\u2019s challenge. After a brief discussion about the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge, the court commented: \u201cI don\u2019t know whether a finding is necessary on my part in such a claim.\u201d Indeed, after each <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge the trial court failed to make specific findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>regarding each of the state\u2019s explanations. Consequently, the trial court did not complete the required <em>Batson/Holloway </em>analysis in order to determine whether the state\u2019s proffered reasons were pretextual. Furthermore, the trial court also did not make any further inquiries about the defendant\u2019s claims of disparate treatment of venirepersons. Instead, it summarily proceeded to find that all of the prosecutor\u2019s original explanations were not pretextual. This complete lack of analyses throughout the six <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenges makes deferring to the trial court decisions problematic.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The trial court\u2019s analysis was particularly troublesome regarding the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge of G.D., a Hispanic venireperson to be discussed in more detail in part IV of this dissent. The state argued erroneously that it did not have to respond to the charge of discrimination regarding G.D. because \u201c[o]ur law provide[s] that one must be a member of the defendant\u2019s minority for the <em>Batson </em>rule to kick in . . . .\u201d That is not our law. <em>See Powers </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>supra, 499 U.S. 406 (Caucasian defendant has standing to raise <em>Batson </em>challenges regarding black jurors). While the defendant argued otherwise, the trial judge was silent on the matter, leading one to wonder whether the judge appreciated that a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge was applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Although I believe that the majority purposefully focuses on the wrong standard of review and deprives the defendant of a meaningful appellate review in order to reach its desired result, I would conclude, no matter what standard of review was employed, that the state exercised its peremptory challenges to exclude purposefully African-Americans and other minorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">Even though I conclude that in exercising the peremptory challenges the state purposely discriminated based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>upon race with respect to all six venirepersons that are the subject of this appeal, only one such instance is necessary for this court to order a new trial. Accordingly, I will focus only on the violation regarding venire-person G.D., a twenty-three year old Hispanic male.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark>1 have included in this dissent the complete transcript of (1) the voir dire of G.D. in appendix A and (2) the subsequent argument of counsel with respect to the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>hearing in appendix B in order to expose the manner in which the majority egregiously misrepresents the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">As set forth in part III of this dissent, when the defendant originally raised a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge regarding the peremptory challenge of G.D., the state argued erroneously that the law did not require it to provide any race neutral reasons for its use of a peremptory challenge against a minority venireperson of a different race than the defendant. Notwithstanding this claim, the state offered the following list of reasons for G.D.\u2019s exclusion: (1) the feeling that G.D. might be overwhelmed by the medical testimony in the case and unable to understand the evidence, based on his education, intelligence and career; (2) G.D.\u2019s supposed friendship with a homicide victim and his murderer, and his exposure to the publicity of that murder; (3) the fact that a friend of G.D. had an \u201cunpleasant experience with a police officer,\u201d which G.D. had witnessed; and (4) the fact that G.D. was the second youngest and only male sibling in a family of seven children.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">After hearing the list of proffered reasons for the peremptory challenge, the public defender raised the issue of disparate treatment between G.D. and the acceptance of a Caucasian juror with a fifth grade education and an employment history that consisted only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>of fixing cars in his backyard. The state responded that it had selected a venireperson with less than twelve years of education, but argued that the Caucasian juror was substantially older than G.D. The state then iterated its claim that <em>Batson/Holloway </em>did not apply to venire-persons who were a different race than the defendant. Immediately after the public defender responded to this latter claim, the trial court concluded that the peremptory challenge of G.D. was not racially motivated and that the reasons advanced by the state were sufficient and not pretextual. Indeed, the transcript indicates that the trial court, at best, gave short shrift to the defendant\u2019s claim and did not perform any meaningful review. It simply is incredible and disingenuous for the majority to hold that there was any consideration of the <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>challenge in this case. A reading of the entire transcript pertaining to the argument of counsel on the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge of G.D. demonstrates this lack of consideration. See appendix B of this dissent. Nevertheless, under any standard of review \u2014 whether it is deference, deference subject to an independent and scrupulous examination, or no deference<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> \u2014 the peremptory challenge of G.D. cannot withstand the scrutiny compelled by the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">\u201cWe have identified several specific factors that may indicate that the state\u2019s excuse of a venireperson through a peremptory challenge was racially motivated. These include, but are not limited to: (1) The reasons given for the challenge were not related to the trial of the case ... (2) the prosecutor failed to question the challenged juror or only questioned him or her in a perfunctory manner ... (3) prospective jurors of one race were asked a question to elicit a particular response that was not asked of the other jurors . . . (4) persons with the same or similar characteristics but not the same race \u00e1s the challenged juror were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>struck ... (5) the prosecutor advanced an explanation based on a group bias where the group trait is not shown to apply to the challenged juror specifically . . . and (6) the prosecutor used a disproportionate number of peremptory challenges to exclude members of one race. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, [206 Conn.] 399. . . . <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>[supra, 222 Conn. 11].\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>227 Conn. 301, 325, 630 A.2d 593 (1993). Pretext should also be found where the reason offered is not supported by the record. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>29 Conn. App. 304, 341, 615 A.2d 149 (1992) (Norcott, <em>J., </em>dissenting and concurring); see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>548 So. 2d 501, 506 (Ala. App. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1028, 109 S. Ct. 1160, 103 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1989) (finding pretext where reason offered not supported by venireperson\u2019s answers).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">When a trial court is reviewing a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge it should analyze each proffered reason for exercising the challenge in isolation from one another, but within the context of the entire record. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 400-407. If the trial court determines that any one of the proffered reasons is pretextual, it has shown that impermissible discrimination was a part of the motivation for the state\u2019s peremptory challenge. Consequently, <em>under federal constitutional law </em>the trial court should then conduct a dual motivation analysis as set forth in <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>supra, 986 F.2d 24.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In a dual motivation analysis the state has the burden of an affirmative defense, through which it must prove \u201cthat the same challenges would have been exercised for race-neutral [or other permissible] reasons in the absence of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>partially improper motivation.\u201d Id., 30. If the state meets that burden, under federal law no discrimination should be found. Id., 30-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">While the majority accepts the dual motivation analysis in theory, it fails to indicate that the burden shifts to the state as required by <em>Senkowski. </em>In addition, instead of examining each proffered reason in isolation when applying the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>tests, the majority seems to believe that a finding of pretext should be based on an analysis of all the proffered reasons in aggregate. Such an analysis, however, fails to isolate adequately each proffered reason when determining whether it is pretextual. All of the proffered reasons should be considered and balanced together only when the dual motivation analysis is applied. Thus, the majority\u2019s method blurs the distinction between the <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>tests and the dual motivation test that comes into play under federal law when discrimination is found in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">In addition, a reviewing court should also consider all relevant circumstances surrounding the peremptory challenges; thus our review of the trial court\u2019s decisions requires consideration of the entire record. Because discrimination in the selection of jurors implicates the basic integrity of this branch of government, we should review a disparate treatment claim within a <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>challenge no matter when the disparate treatment claim is raised, taking the prior accepted jurors as well as subsequently selected jurors into consideration, as long as the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>claim is made prior to the swearing in of the jury. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 327 (appellate review of questioning of venireperson that occurred after <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 406-407 (analyzing disparate treatment claim raised for first time on appeal); see generally <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>237 Conn. 238, 253, 676 A.2d 384 (1996) (\u201cwe hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>a defendant may object to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge on <em>Batson </em>equal protection grounds at any time prior to the swearing of the jury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Nevertheless, because the disparate treatment basis of the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>claim is so compelling in this case that it would lead to reversal, the majority changes the rules and refuses to review the entire record pertaining to the selection of all the jurors. For example, the majority refuses to apply any disparate treatment analysis to the three <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenges in which the defendant did not raise specifically a disparate treatment claim within his challenge at trial.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s assertions, a disparate treatment analysis is not a separate examination from a <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>claim, but, rather, an integral part of any evaluation of a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>claim. The challenging party need not raise a disparate treatment claim separately when it makes a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 406-407.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>More specifically, the majority compares the peremptory challenge of G.D. only with the acceptance of juror W.V., the one juror the defendant specifically mentioned in his <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge during voir dire. Hence, the majority refuses to review the aspects of the defendant\u2019s disparate treatment claim based upon any other juror, which includes jurors identified in the defendant\u2019s brief that were accepted before and those that were accepted after the court excused G.D. Such a refusal, as I indicated previously, departs from our prior jurisprudence in two ways. First, in <em>Hinton </em>we reviewed a disparate treatment claim based on a comparison with a juror questioned after the <em>Batson/Hol-loway </em>challenge without the defendant\u2019s renewal of her <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge. <em>State </em>v. <em>Hinton, </em>supra, 227 Conn. 327. Second, because of the importance of the issue, as I have already indicated, we previously have reviewed a disparate treatment claim within a <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>challenge when the disparate treatment claim was raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 406-407. Such a review is possible in the present case when the record is viewed in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">When the complete record is examined regarding venireperson G.D.,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> it reveals the pretextual nature of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>all of the state\u2019s proffered reasons for its peremptory challenge. More specifically, the pretext is evidenced by: (1) the vagueness of the state\u2019s explanations; (2) the disparate treatment of G.D. and similar Caucasian jurors who were not challenged by the state;<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> see id., 399; (3) the lack of support in the record for the state\u2019s reasons; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 341 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting and concurring); see also <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 548 So. 2d 506; and (4) the state\u2019s failure to conduct more than a perfunctory inquiiy into these matters. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 203 Conn. 399; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>661 So. 2d 770, 772-73 (Ala. App. 1994) (failure to inquire into specific bias of venireperson raises strong inference venirepersori struck solely on basis of race); <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>503 So. 2d 350, 355 (Fla. App. 1987) (failure to ask follow-up questions in order to establish assumed trait indicates perfunctory questioning). I will next review separately each of the state\u2019s proffered reasons in order to demonstrate their pretextual nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">The state\u2019s claim that it challenged G.D. because of a perceived lack of ability to comprehend the medical testimony that would be presented during the trial passes <em>Batson/Holloway\u2019s </em>first test \u2014 because it is a neutral explanation related to the case being tried \u2014 but fails the second test. According to the state, it based its perception of G.D.\u2019s inability on the fact that he had a \u201cless than illustrious\u201d high school career and held a job that \u201c[does not] demonstrate a position where he has to make decisions.\u201d While such reasons sound like neutral, potentially valid reasons to peremptorily challenge a juror, the transcript exposes these reasons to be pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>First, when the record does not support a claimed reason, as in the present case, the reason may be viewed as speculative and pretextual. <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 341 <em>(Norcott, J, </em>dissenting and concurring); see also <em>Williams </em>v. State, supra, 548 So. 2d 506. For example, the description of G.D.\u2019s job as a pollution control analyst does not support either the conclusion that such analysts are not intelligent people or the assumption that the job does not require any decision-making skills. G.D.\u2019s job entailed performing scientific testing that involved making judgments about water quality in order to guard against pollution. Furthermore, nothing in G.D.\u2019s testimony supports the claim that he was not intelligent. While G.D. admitted he was not very interested in high school, there is absolutely no evidence regarding his academic achievements or lack thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">Moreover, the disparate treatment of G.D. becomes obvious when the treatment of G.D. is compared to that of W.V. and A.T., two Caucasian venirepersons with substantially less than a high school education. This disparity is not justified and, therefore, the state\u2019s peremptory challenge of G.D. should have been found to be pretextual. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399 (disparate treatment of challenged juror and seated jurors as evidence of pretext). The state\u2019s explanation that it did not challenge W.V., a juror with a fifth grade education, because he was substantially older than G.D., who was twenty-three years old, is not sufficient. First, four jurors ultimately chosen and two alternate jurors were also in their twenties.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In addition, the challenge of G.D. cannot be justified by reference to his stated leisure activities ofplaying softball and collecting autographs and baseball pards or by his admission that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>he did not read a newspaper regularly. In comparison, when asked about his hobbies, accepted juror W.V. explained that his hobbies consist of \u201c[rjeally nothing, just sitting around the house all day. I cook.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Perhaps most significantly, the state employed inexplicable disparate treatment regarding W.V. and A.T. because both of these Caucasian venirepsersons displayed difficulty understanding several key legal concepts, whereas G.D.\u2019s answers manifested no such difficulty. This disparity is especially notable with regard to A.T., who had completed high school but gave a series of confused answers that showed a complete inability to understand legal and psychiatric concepts. In contrast, even the majority concedes that G.D. did not appear to be confused by the many, sometimes legally complicated, questions that he was asked by the state. These disparities demonstrate that the state did not challenge G.D. because it feared he would not be able to understand the complicated medical testimony that would be offered during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The state\u2019s lack of meaningful questions regarding G.D.\u2019s job and education supply further evidence of pretext;<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> in fact, the defendant asked most of the questions regarding those topics. Our court, as well as many others, has often stated that a failure to question a venireperson beyond a perfunctory manner on a relevant subject is often evidence of pretext. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 661 So. 2d 772-73; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 503 So. 2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">In sum, both the testimony relating to G.D.\u2019s ability to comprehend medical testimony and the selection of other jurors who demonstrated substantially less comprehension support the conclusion that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>court incorrectly failed to find that the state\u2019s first proffered reason for its peremptory challenge was pre-textual.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">The state\u2019s second reason for challenging G.D. \u2014 his alleged friendships with a homicide victim and his murderer \u2014 does not pass even the first prong of the <em>Batson/ Holloway </em>test, for it is not \u201ca neutral explanation related to the particular case to be tried.\u201d <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 476 U.S. 98. Even if the reason was determined to have rebutted the prima facie case of discrimination or if it was determined that the <em>Purkett </em>majority somehow applied, the reason certainly would not pass the final hurdle as a valid one.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The record does not support the state\u2019s claims that either the murder victim or the perpetrator of the murder was even a friend of G.D. On the contrary, G.D., on two separate occasions, clearly stated that he was not friends with either the perpetrator or the victim of the other murder and that he \u201cLj]ust knew them by name.\u201d Accordingly, the trial court should have found this reason to be pretextual. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 341 <em>(Norcott, J, </em>dissenting and concurring); <em>Williams </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 548 So. 2d 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">Beyond very preliminary questions relating to G.D.\u2019s relationship with these two individuals, the state failed to pursue the issue with any questions designed to elicit any bias based on G.D.\u2019s experience with that homicide, which is strong evidence of pretext. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 661 So. 2d 772-73; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 503 So. 2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-10\">In an effort to justify the peremptory challenge against G.D., the state offered: \u201cI am not sure how the fact that a friend of his or an acquaintance was murdered, and he knows the fellow that murdered him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>how it took place. He indicated that he initially did follow the case and I guess lost interest.\u201d Nothing in these two sentences indicates why or how such a relationship could affect G.D.\u2019s ability to serve as a juror. In the course of this vague explanation, the state admitted that even it was \u201cnot sure\u201d what to think about G.D.\u2019s knowledge of these persons and the homicide. Consequently, it is inconceivable that G.D.\u2019s relationship to this murder constituted a legitimate reason for striking G.D. as a juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Moreover, the record indicates that the state treated differently several other prospective jurors with similar relationships, without accounting for this disparate treatment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399 (disparate treatment salient to showing of pretext). For example, the state accepted three venirepersons with similar and closer relationships with murder victims than those of G.D.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> It also accepted two venirepersons who had been criminal defendants themselves and six other venirepersons with relatives who had been criminal defendants.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">In sum, an examination of G.D.\u2019s testimony and the state\u2019s proffered reasons and explanations does not reveal any relevance between this information and the present case. The majority even concedes its lack of relevance, but nevertheless affirms the trial court\u2019s determination that it is not pretextual because it apparently examines all the proffered reasons in aggregate when applying the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>tests. As I previously have indicated, that analysis is improper. Even under that analysis, however, one must conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>this reason is pretextual. To conclude, I believe the fact that the explanation is unrelated to the present case prevents it from rebutting the prima facie case of discrimination, as a matter of law.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">The state\u2019s third reason for its peremptory challenge of G.D. was G.D.\u2019s alleged \u201cunpleasant experience with a police officer . . . .\u2019\u2019While this reason is race neutral, the fact that G.D. may have had an unpleasant experience with a police officer is not related to this case. <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399. The police\u2019s credibility was not at issue in the present case. The defendant admitted that he shot the two victims. As a result, the sole issue at trial was the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the murders. The officer\u2019s testimony, however, was related only to the crime scene and the chain of custody of the defendant. Thus, this reason cannot even rebut a prima facie case of discrimination. It, therefore, fails <em>Batson/Holloway\u2019s </em>first test. Even if the reason did pass this first hurdle, upon further examination it would be found to violate <em>Batson/Hol-loway\u2019s </em>second test as merely a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The incident to which the state referred involved G.D.\u2019s witnessing a friend\u2019s arrest for breach of the peace. The arresting officer, whom G.D. believed had \u201ctried to be too macho,\u201d was charged with using excessive force regarding the arrest. While G.D. was called as a witness in court, the charge was eventually dropped, and the officer was reprimanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Even though it is not uncommon for the state to strike venirepersons who have had negative experiences with the police; see <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 14; this fact does not give the state carte blanche to strike <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>venirepersons based on any kind of unpleasant experience with the police. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>supra, 29 Conn. App. 341 <em>(Norcott, J., </em>dissenting and concurring). In the present case, G.D. was not involved in the arrest of his friend, he was only a witness to it. Furthermore, he merely was performing his civic duty by testifying as to the circumstances surrounding the arrest when he was called as a witness in court. Moreover, there was also evidence that could have demonstrated that G.D. was biased in favor of the police because G.D. testified that he had friends who were police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">G.D. unequivocally denied that either his friend\u2019s arrest or his friendships with police officers would affect his objectivity as a juror. This denial is not undermined by any contrary testimony. Nevertheless, the state claimed that, despite G.D.\u2019s assertion, \u201cone never knows subconsciously how that would play in his judgement in this case.\u201d While it is true that the state is entitled to rely on its own impressions, such impressions must be treated like any other proffered reason. In other words, the trial court must find an asserted impression to be pretextuai where the evidence does not support it. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 399. Thus, the state\u2019s refusal to accept a venireperson\u2019s assessment of his own impartiality should be based on something in the record. <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 661 So. 2d 774. In the present case, however, the state had no basis for inferring that G.D. would be biased against police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The state also failed to explain its disparate treatment of other venirepersons who were Caucasian and had unpleasant experiences with the police or had relatives who were arrested. For example, the state inexplicably accepted six venirepersons who had relatives who had been arrested<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> as well as two other venirepersons who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>had more compelling and direct unpleasant experiences with the police. The most striking contrast to the state\u2019s treatment of G.D. is its treatment of G.T., a Caucasian alternate juror who was arrested and charged with \u201cthreatening and breach of the peace\u201d relating to a domestic argument. The incident occurred when G.T.\u2019s estranged wife and a friend came over to his house one evening and began banging on the door. G.T. called the police, retrieved his handgun, and waited. When a police officer arrived, he refused to listen to G.T. and falsely arrested him. Subsequently, the prosecutor did not want to listen to G.T. and gave him a \u201craw deal,\u201d forcing him to go through a domestic violence education program. G.T. also appeared to be angry with his lawyer who told him it would cost $5000 to go to trial. G.T. did not have the money to fight the charges in court, therefore, he agreed to attend a domestic violence education program in order to have the charges dropped. G.T.\u2019s negative views regarding every aspect of his experience with the criminal justice system were evident throughout his testimony. G.T. twice stated that he got a \u201craw deal,\u201d and explained that he felt that the police officer and the prosecutor refused to listen to him. His description of the officer was that \u201che just came in hot headed and not thinking of what he should have done . . . .\u2019\u2019All of this information was developed as a result of the defendant\u2019s voir dire of G.T.; the state\u2019s voir dire included only two questions relating to G.T.\u2019s potential bias toward prosecutors.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The second venireperson with a direct unpleasant experience with a police officer was A.T., a Caucasian who lost his driver\u2019s license for four years after he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>involved in an automobile accident. Unlike G.D.\u2019s case, the state did not appear to be concerned with A.T.\u2019s unpleasant experience with the police. The state merely accepted A.T. without even asking if this experience would affect the way he would view the testimony of the police in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">The fact that G.D. witnessed a <em>friend\u2019s </em>arrest, as opposed to a stranger\u2019s, also cannot account for why the state tried to excuse G.D. because, as I have previously discussed, it accepted six other venirepersons who had close relatives who had been arrested. Furthermore, the charges against G.D.\u2019s friend were eventually dropped. The state offered no reason for this disparate treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The state\u2019s disparate treatment, coupled with the proffered reason\u2019s unrelatedness to this case, lead to the conclusion that the state truly was not concerned with G.D.\u2019s negative experience. Therefore, even if it was determined that this reason was actually related to the present case, and consequently the reason rebutted a prima facie case of discrimination, it still should be held that this incident merely was a pretext for the state\u2019s discriminatory peremptory challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">The state\u2019s most blatantly pretextual reason for the peremptory challenge of G.D. is its fourth and final one. It clearly is not trial related, and, therefore, fails <em>Batson/ Holloway\u2019s </em>first test. Furthermore, even if the court did not require trial relatedness at that step, this reason is undoubtably pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-10\">At trial the state claimed that the fact that G.D. had six sisters and was one of the youngest of the seven siblings was \u201cof some interest in terms of how he would look at this case.\u201d I agree with the majority that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>reason also lacks any obvious relevance to G.D.\u2019s capacity to serve as a juror in this case. I would, however, again disagree with the majority that this finding must be viewed within the context of the other proffered reasons in order to determine whether this reason is pretextual. Instead, each proffered reason must be analyzed in isolation in order to examine whether it is a pretext for discrimination. See, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 206 Conn. 400-407. A proper examination of this asserted reason strongly supports the conclusion that the trial court incorrectly found it not to be pretextual because it is totally unrelated to the present case. Nevertheless, even if the majority is correct that all the proffered reasons must be analyzed together, this reason is so egregiously pretextual that it necessitates a finding of pretext.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Not only did the state fail to relate this reason to the case, the state\u2019s questioning also reveals that G.D.\u2019s familial status in relation to his siblings was never even a concern. Beyond the occupations of G.D.\u2019s sisters and parents, the state failed to ask G.D. any other questions about his relationship with his family or the importance of his birth order.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This failure to question beyond a perfunctory manner is further evidence of pretext. Id., 399; see also <em>Moore </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 661 So. 2d 772-73; <em>Slappy </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 503 So. 2d 355.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">Lastly, the state also engaged in disparate treatment between chosen jurors and G.D. concerning this topic. For example, W.V., a Caucasian male, and F.O., a Caucasian female, both had seven sisters and one brother. Yet, the state did not challenge either of these jurors. Consequently, the trial court should have found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>G.D.\u2019s birth order and the number and gender of his siblings could not pass Batson/Holloway\u2019s first test.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">It is clear that, based upon the marathon deliberation of the jury (nine days) and the jurors\u2019 announcement that they were deadlocked (twice), this was a close case. The defendant will never believe that he had a fair trial before an unbiased jury; indeed, neither will the African-American community because G.D., a Hispanic, and five African-American venirepersons were not allowed to serve on the jury as a result of the state\u2019s exercise of its peremptory challenges based upon impermissible considerations. Under any standard of review, there is only one conclusion that reasonably can be drawn in this case \u2014 that the state intentionally used its peremptory challenges to eliminate minorities from the jury. I would therefore reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction and order a new trial. It is terribly troubling that the opinion of the majority is result oriented and ignores long-standing precedent in order to uphold this conviction of an African-American defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Unfortunately, the majority sets that stage for the future by sending a message to the trial courts that <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenges do not have to be taken seriously. The majority either ignores or fails to appreciate that \u201c[r]ace [or for that matter any impermissible] discrimination within the courtroom raises serious questions as to the fairness of the proceedings conducted there. Racial bias mars the integrity of the judicial system and prevents the idea of democratic government from becoming a reality. ... In the many times we have addressed the problem of racial bias in our system of justice, we have not questioned the premise that racial discrimination in the qualification or selection of jurors offends the dignity of persons and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the integrity of the courts. ... To permit racial exclusion in this official forum compounds the racial insult inherent in judging a citizen by the color of his or her skin.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Edmonson </em>v. <em>Leesville Concrete Co., </em>500 U.S. 614, 628, 111 S.

Yes, it would. It\u2019s not working for a law firm or something like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-15\">\u201cQ. And the sister who is in optometry school, did she go to college before going to that school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-17\">\u201cQ.

Now, as far as your parents, what type of work do they do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-22\">\u201cA. My mother baby-sits kids for a living, and my father works at Times Fiber Communications in Wall-ingford.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u201cQ. As far as Cytec, that is your employer. You realize if you\u2019re selected, you will be excused until some time next week and go home today. You will have to come back probably later next week and you may be here for approximately four weeks, Monday through Friday, ten to five. As far as work, will that create a hardship at work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-6\">\u201cA. No, it wouldn\u2019t create a hardship because we are a union shop and it allows for jury duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cQ. So, they will pay you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-9\">\u201cQ. And will you be sitting here worried or distressed about the fact that you\u2019re not back at work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-10\">\u201cA. Definitely not, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-11\">\u201cQ. Now, have you ever been on jury duty before, [G.D.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-12\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-13\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been in court for any reason except for perhaps motor vehicle violations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-14\">\u201cA. Yes, I was in court once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">\u201cQ. Can you tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-16\">\u201cA. My friend got into an altercation with a police officer. The police officer was accused of overstepping his boundaries, so we had to go to court to rectify the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">\u201cQ. The police officer was accused of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">\u201cA. Overstepping his boundaries. He tried to be too macho.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-19\">\u201cQ. He used excessive force?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-20\">\u201cA. Excessive force, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\u201cQ. And did he arrest your friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-6\">\u201cA. Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\">\u201cQ. And what happened \u2014 what did he arrest him for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\">\u201cA. Breach of peace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\">\u201cQ. And what happened to that case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\">\u201cA. When it went back to court, I was called on to be a witness because I was there, and the police officer was reprimanded and the case was thrown out. Nothing was filed against my friend.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-11\">\u201cQ. How long ago was this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\">\u201cA. About, I would say, almost two years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\">\u201cQ. And was this a Meriden police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-14\">\u201cA. No, it was Middletown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-15\">\u201cQ. So, you went to court in Middletown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">\u201cQ. And did you actually talk to a prosecutor? Did you personally talk to a prosecutor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-18\">\u201cA. I talked to his lawyer. The prosecutor questioned me on the stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-19\">\u201cQ. And I am a prosecutor, obviously. As a result of that, do you have a feeling about prosecutors, that they overstep their bounds or are not fair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-20\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-21\">\u201cQ. Do you think the prosecutor was fair to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-22\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-23\">\u201cQ. As far as that individual officer, do you know what happened to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-24\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>\u201cQ. Was he disciplined?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\">\u201cA. I never found out what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-7\">\u201cQ. But the case against your friend was dropped; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-9\">\u201cQ. Now, obviously we are going to call a number of police officers, not from Middletown but probably from Hamden, maybe the state police, maybe a federal agent. As the court indicated yesterday, you\u2019ve got to treat a police officer like any other witness. You don\u2019t give them any special credit, but on the other hand, you don\u2019t put him at a disadvantage. Do you think that you could follow that law and treat a policeman like anyone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-10\">\u201cA. Yes, I could.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-11\">\u201cQ. Do you have a feeling, as a result of that experience with that police officer, that might affect your judgment about all police officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-12\">\u201cA. No, I don\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-13\">\u201cQ. I assume that you were present when the officer made the arrest of your friend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">\u201cA. Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-15\">\u201cQ. Where were you when that occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-16\">\u201cA. I was on the street in Middletown, I don\u2019t know the exact street name, but we were heading one place, and the whole thing took place there. He just pulled us over without ever putting on a siren. He called over the megaphone and demanded my friend to get out. He didn\u2019t ask him to step out of the car. He was just real obnoxious.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">\u201cQ. Do you realize there are obnoxious people in every profession?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, it\u2019s not just a police officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cQ. Have you ever had any other unpleasant experience with a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cQ. Are you friendly with or related to any police officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cA. I know a couple of police officers, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cQ. From what town?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">\u201cA. From Meriden.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-12\">\u201cQ. Have you ever discussed their work with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-13\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-14\">\u201cQ. How about the rest of your family, your sisters and your parents, have any of them ever had an unpleasant experience with a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">\u201cQ. Now, any other reason that you were ever in court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-18\">\u201cQ. You put on your questionnaire that you received a speeding ticket, not unlike a lot of people, but when was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-19\">\u201cA. Um, when I was younger I got a couple of speeding tickets. I had to go to court for them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-20\">\u201cQ. Did you actually go to court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-21\">\u201cA. I never went into court, I just spoke to the D.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-22\">\u201cQ. And what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-23\">\u201cA. She reduced the ticket. She didn\u2019t nolle it, but she just reduced it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-24\">\u201cQ. In both cases?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u201cA. In both cases, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">\u201cQ. Was that in Meriden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">\u201cQ. As far as your meeting with the prosecutor, anything about that that you walked away saying that prosecutor is a real pain in the neck?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-10\">\u201cQ. So, you don\u2019t have a thing about prosecutors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-12\">\u201cQ. As far as anyone else in your family, sisters or parents or close friends or relatives, anyone who has ever been to court for any type of significant case, civil or criminal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-14\">\u201cQ. Now, as far as this particular case, there are a couple of rules that apply, [G.D.]: Number one, we have to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. The judge told you yesterday that\u2019s less than 100 percent certainty. Do you realize you don\u2019t have to be 100 percent certain to convict? Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-15\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-16\">\u201cQ. There are very few things in life that you can be 100 percent certain of. Do you recognize that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-17\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-18\">\u201cQ. Sentencing, are you aware that the jury has nothing to do with sentencing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-19\">\u201cA. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-20\">\u201cQ. Did you know that before you came to court yesterday?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-21\">\u201cA. No, I found that out yesterday.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u201cQ. Good. The way it works, as you now know, if the jury convicts, then it\u2019s the judge who imposes the appropriate sentence. That\u2019s how it works, and it falls from that that you\u2019re not supposed to worry about the sentence or what the judge would do or let it influence your judgment. You\u2019re not supposed to look over at [the defendant] and think, \u2018Gee, if I vote guilty, the judge will put him in jail. That will bother me, so I will vote not guilty.\u2019 Do you understand you\u2019re not supposed to worry about the sentence at all. You have nothing to do with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">\u201cQ. And you can accept that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-9\">\u201cQ. As far as being on a jury, you\u2019re put in a position of judging other people, judging the accused. Do you have any religious or moral reservations about sitting on a criminal jury and judging someone else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-11\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been the victim of a crime, had your car broken into or vandalized, your apartment broken into, theft of property, pocketbook snatched, anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-12\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-13\">\u201cQ. How about any of your sisters or your parents?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-14\">\u201cA. A sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-15\">\u201cQ. Can you tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-16\">\u201cA. It was just spousal abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-17\">\u201cQ. When she was married or a boyfriend?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-18\">\u201cA. Married.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-19\">\u201cQ. And did she actually \u2014 was an arrest made?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">\u201cQ. And did she have to go to court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">\u201cA. I believe so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">\u201cQ. How long ago was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-9\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think it was a court thing. I think it was just a court for divorce, divorce court. I don\u2019t know how long ago, maybe about three or four years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-10\">\u201cQ. So, she is divorced from her husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">\u201cQ. Anything about that that would affect your judgment here as far as police officers or prosecutors or the court, that you think your sister wasn\u2019t treated fairly or the system didn\u2019t work well? Anything about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">\u201cQ. Anything else as far as being a victim of a crime, any of your other family members?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-16\">\u201cQ. Do you have any friends who might have been victims of crimes, any type of crime, an assault or even a homicide, anyone that you know that has been murdered or arrested for a homicide?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-17\">\u201cA. Yeah, I know a couple of people, not friends, people I know. That\u2019s about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-18\">\u201cQ. Arrested or actually victims?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-19\">\u201cA. A couple of both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-20\">\u201cQ. A couple of both?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-21\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-22\">\u201cQ. Are these people that you knew when you were at Maloney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>\u201cA. No, people I played football with, usually on Sundays. That\u2019s how I know them, just to play football.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201cQ. Tell us about any \u2014 the people who have been victims of homicides that you know, can you tell us about those situations, who they are, when it occurred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cA. The homicide was someone who was like three years ahead of me in high school. He was shot by another person that went to our high school, and that\u2019s it. He was on the football team. I just knew of him, just a couple of \u2018hi\u2019s, \u2018bye\u2019s. That\u2019s it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-8\">\u201cQ. So, you weren\u2019t familiar with either the victim or the shooter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-9\">\u201cA. Just knew them by name. We never went out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-10\">\u201cQ. I assume the fellow was arrested and prosecuted for the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">\u201cQ. Did you follow the case at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-13\">\u201cA. At the beginning, but not at the end, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-14\">\u201cQ. This was about three years ago?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-15\">\u201cA. Um, less than three; maybe two.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-16\">\u201cQ. Do you remember the name of the fellow who was arrested for the shooting?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-17\">\u201cA. Tony Lyons, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-18\">\u201cQ. Do you know what happened to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-19\">\u201cA. I believe he\u2019s in jail.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-20\">\u201cQ. Anything about that that might affect your judgment in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-21\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-22\">\u201cQ. Do you feel \u2014 obviously that is a tragedy. Do you feel Mr. Lyons was treated unfairly or the police didn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>respond properly? Anything that you know about the case that might affect your judgment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-7\">\u201cQ. Anyone else, as far as either being the victim or someone who was arrested for a homicide or an assault?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-9\">\u201cQ. Now, how about a witness to a crime, ever see someone commit a crime? You weren\u2019t the victim, but maybe you saw someone else, their car was broken into or their house was broken into?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-10\">\u201cA. I saw someone do a hit-and-run, hit another car and then take off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-11\">\u201cQ. Did you give a statement to the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-12\">\u201cA. Yeah. It was after a party, graduation. I went up to the guy\u2019s door, I knocked on it and I said, \u2018someone just hit your car.\u2019 I looked quick enough so I could see the license plate. I gave the guy the license plate, and the next day the police officer called up at my house to verify what I saw. I identified the car and the license plate, and that was as far as I heard of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-13\">\u201cQ. Did you ever hear anything more? Were you ever asked to go to the police department or go to court?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-14\">\u201cA. No, I wasn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-15\">\u201cQ. Did you know the fellow who was driving the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-16\">\u201cA. No, I didn\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-17\">\u201cQ. Have you ever given a statement to the police in any other situation, other than that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-18\">\u201cA. No, just beside that friend that I told you about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-19\">\u201cQ. In Middletown?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-20\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cQ. Now, as far as the evidence in this case, it may be unpleasant. There may be a photograph of . . . the two victims. There may be testimony by the medical examiner, who did an autopsy, describing the wounds and the cause of death. This will be upsetting, I am sure, to most people, but is there anything about that that would be so upsetting that you do not think that you could sit on this case fairly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">\u201cQ. As far as some of the laws that apply, in terms of murder, in order for us to prove murder, we have to prove [the defendant], with intent to cause the death of another, caused that person\u2019s death. Translated into the allegations here, we have to prove at the time he pulled the trigger, he intended to kill, but what we don\u2019t have to prove, [G.D.], is that he planned it in advance. We don\u2019t have to prove that he went to the office intending to shoot someone. We don\u2019t have to prove ten minutes before the shooting, he intended it, only at the time of the shooting he intended to do it. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">\u201cQ. Most people think murder means that you have to plan it, but that is not the case. As far as motive, as far as the reason he committed the crime, we don\u2019t have to prove motive. We don\u2019t have to prove why he did it. I recognize that a jury would like to know why, but legally, we are not bound to prove it. Can you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-11\">\u201cQ. Now, that case is almost two and one-half years old. May 4, 1992, was over thirty months ago. Without knowing the reason for the delay in this case going to trial, do you think it\u2019s unfair to either side to try a case this long after the offense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201cQ. So, you\u2019re not going to sit there and say it\u2019s not fair for the state to try him two and one-half years later and hold it against us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cQ. As far as insurance companies, I mentioned yesterday that our allegation was that [the victims] were public insurance adjusters, and that the meeting was set up to discuss a claim filed by [the defendant\u2019s] mother. Have you ever filed a claim against an insurance company or had a claim filed against you by an insurance company, the most common example being an automobile accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-9\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-10\">\u201cQ. You have never been involved with an insurance company, one way or another, other than medical\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-11\">\u201cA. Well, I had a claim filed against me. I also filed one when someone hit me in an accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-12\">\u201cQ. Were you satisfied with the resolution of the claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-14\">\u201cQ. How about any of your sisters or your parents or close friends or relatives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cA. Same thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-16\">\u201cQ. Nothing else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-18\">\u201cQ. Are you familiar with the difference between a public insurance adjuster and an insurance company adjuster? Have you ever heard of the two types of adjusters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>\u201cA. I have never heard of it, but I think I can base an opinion on the evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\">\u201cQ. As you sit there now, you don\u2019t have a feeling now that insurance companies are all thieves or that they are out to expose other people or \u2014 you don\u2019t have an ax to grind with insurance companies, I assume?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">\u201cQ. As far as the defense in this case, you heard both myself and the defense mention as possible witnesses several \u2014 a couple of psychiatrists and a psychologist. [G.D.], it\u2019s no secret in this case that the defense may offer a psychiatric defense, and in our state, our law recognizes, under certain circumstances, a psychiatric defense as appropriate. The question is whether the circumstances apply here. So my question to you is, as you sit there now, do you have any feeling about the use of a psychiatric defense in a criminal case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">\u201cQ. You\u2019ve never given it any thought?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">\u201cQ. So, you could treat that type of defense fairly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-14\">\u201cQ. Also in our law, not to confuse this, and if you don\u2019t understand the question, please tell me, in our law, we have to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt. If the defense chooses to offer a psychiatric defense, they have to prove that defense by a preponderance of the evidence. So, there is a burden on the defense. It\u2019s their obligation to prove that defense. So there are two burdens: we have to prove our case, they have to prove their defense, if they offer that. Can you understand the two burdens?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cQ. And can accept \u2014 the judge tells you all this stuff, and you don\u2019t take my word for it, but at some point the judge will explain the law. He will explain that to you, about the two burdens. Can you accept that concept of the two burdens in our law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-7\">\u201cQ. Have you or a member of your family or close friend, [G.D.], ever retained the services of a psychologist or a psychiatrist or psychotherapist or counselor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-8\">\u201cA. Again, my sister went to a counselor when she was abused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-9\">\u201cQ. Was that a marriage counselor, domestic violence counselor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-10\">\u201cA. I think both, she went to both of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-11\">\u201cQ. Did she ever discuss with you her opinion about whether those people helped her at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-12\">\u201cA. Not really sit down and have a big discussion, but she briefly indicated what was happening.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-13\">\u201cQ. Did she feel it was worthwhile going to counselors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-14\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-15\">\u201cQ. Based on what little you know about the case, you know that we\u2019ve charged [the defendant] with going to a meeting and shooting two people. Based on what little you know, do you have a feeling that he must have been nuts? Are you already starting to decide that that guy, in order to do it, must have been crazy? Are you starting to think that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-17\">\u201cQ. So, you could sit and listen to the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201cQ. As I recall yesterday, I think you indicated, [G.D.], that you have never heard about this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cQ. Do you have any feeling at all about someone who has any type of mental problem, any feeling that they should never be held accountable for what they do, that if you have a mental problem, that you can do whatever you want without being held accountable? Do you think that way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-9\">\u201cQ. Have you ever given this \u2014 most people never thought about this. Have you ever thought about this? Is this an area that interests you or that you read about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">\u201cQ. Let\u2019s assume that you are selected, [G.D.], and you listen to all the evidence and you sit here, you listen to everything that goes on and what the judge tells you the law is, what the rules are that apply to your deliberations, and then you deliberate and you\u2019re convinced that we have proven [the defendant] guilty in the shooting death of [the victims]. If you\u2019re convinced we have proven him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, do you think you could actually vote guilty for the crime of murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">\u201cQ. Can you think of anything that might in any way prevent you from being fair on this case or treating this case fairly?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201cMr. Dearington: Okay. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-16\">\u201cVOIR DIRE EXAMINATION BY [THOMAS ULL-MANN, DEFENSE COUNSEL]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cQ. Good morning. How are you today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">\u201cA. Fine, thanks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">\u201cQ. I have some additional questions to ask of you. They are [not] meant to pry into your personal affairs. If you feel they do, please tell the judge. That is not the purpose of the questions, nor Mr. Dearington\u2019s. We are both looking at the form that you filled out, and I apologize in advance if I cover some territory that he has already gone over. If you could just raise your voice so everyone in the courtroom could hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">\u201cA. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">\u201cQ. We try to estimate as best as possible how long this trial will last, and we think it will get started some time next week and it will span through approximately December 16. We could be off by a couple of days on the short end or on the long end. We try to let jurors know that so they can plan accordingly. Is there anything of a personal, professional or financial hardship that you feel would make it difficult for you to sit on the case during that period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">\u201cQ. I assume that you understand that we need to have people who can focus their attention on what is going on in the courtroom and not be distracted by anything that\u2019s going on in their personal or professional lives. Can you assure us that you would give us that attention?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">\u201cQ. You have never gone through this process before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">\u201cQ. Never been on jury duty before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>\u201cQ.

You live with\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-8\">\u201cA. My parents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-9\">\u201cQ. They own their own home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-10\">\u201cA. Yes, they do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-11\">\u201cQ. What part of the city of Meriden do you live in, what\u2019s it called? What\u2019s it referred to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-12\">\u201cA. Meriden-Wallingford town line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">\u201cQ. Is that where you have been for your entire life?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-14\">\u201cA. No, I was on the west side for like my first eleven years. I have lived there for the last twelve.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-15\">\u201cQ. When your sisters were undergraduates in Gordon, what were their majors in school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-16\">\u201cA. I believe [one sister\u2019s] was science, because she\u2019s going into optometry, and [another sister\u2019s], I don\u2019t know what the major was there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-17\">\u201cQ. She is at UConn?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-19\">\u201cQ. Is she a full-time student or works on the side?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-20\">\u201cA. Full-time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-21\">\u201cQ. Your father, what does he do for Times Fiber?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-22\">\u201cA. A tool crib attendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-23\">\u201cQ. How long has he been there, approximately?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-24\">\u201cA. About twenty-five years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-25\">\u201cQ. And your mom does the baby-sitting out of her house or\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-26\">\u201cA. Out of her house, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>\u201cQ. How long has she been doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">\u201cA. Less than a year.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-7\">\u201cQ. And at Maloney High School, what was your\u2014 did you participate in a lot of different things at the high school? What was your focus at high school? WTiat were your plans, going through high school, in terms of what you would do after that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">\u201cA. Getting it over with. I wasn\u2019t really too good of a student. I didn\u2019t get too involved with it. I just did my work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-9\">\u201cQ. Were you involved in sports activities?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-10\">\u201cA. Yeah, a couple of sports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-11\">\u201cQ. And what were those?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-12\">\u201cA. Track and field, cross-country.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-13\">\u201cQ. And were you involved in any organizations connected with the high school at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-15\">\u201cQ. And how would you describe the racial makeup of the school when you were there, in terms of whites, African-American, Hispanic, if you can venture to guess at the percentages?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-16\">\u201cA. Probably broken into a pie, maybe forty, thirty, thirty, pretty even.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-17\">\u201cQ. How would you describe what the relationships were among the different groups?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-18\">\u201cA. Very good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-19\">\u201cQ. And how about the community that you grew up in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-20\">\u201cA. The same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-21\">\u201cQ. Same kind of mix?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u201cA. Same kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-6\">\u201cQ. And you\u2019re currently living in Meriden?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-8\">\u201cQ. Any military history at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">\u201cQ. Any association with any charitable organization or volunteer groups of any kind? I don\u2019t mean a donation here and there, I mean active involvement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-12\">\u201cQ. Let me be a little bit more specific as it might relate to this particular case. Any connection at all with gun control organizations or a group like the [National Rifle Association]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-14\">\u201cQ. Do you have any particular hobbies or things that you enjoy doing outside of your work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-15\">\u201cA. Yeah, collectibles like collecting autographs, baseball cards, stuff like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-16\">\u201cQ. How long have you been doing that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-17\">\u201cA. About ten years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-18\">\u201cQ. Specifically in baseball or other sports?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-19\">\u201cA. Baseball.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-20\">\u201cQ. And do you enjoy doing a lot of reading or not really?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-21\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-22\">\u201cQ. Now, did you graduate from high school in the normal period of time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-23\">\u201cA. Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-24\">\u201cQ. Which is something you didn\u2019t like school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">\u201cQ. How about at work, you went to work right after high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">\u201cQ. And you have been there ever since?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-10\">\u201cQ. Is that the only place that you\u2019ve worked subsequent to high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-11\">\u201cA. I worked at a couple of places while I was in high school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-12\">\u201cQ. Doing what kind of things?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-13\">\u201cA. I was a cook at the Yankee Silversmith and I was a bank teller.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-14\">\u201cQ. Now, at Cytec, how long have you been in this particular position?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-15\">\u201cA. About six months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-16\">\u201cQ. What were you doing before that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-17\">\u201cA. Before that I was in building one, it\u2019s plastic moldings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-18\">\u201cQ. What\u2019s the specific tasks now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-19\">\u201cA. Waste water treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-20\">\u201cQ. What do you particularly do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-21\">\u201cA. I take samples of the water and I get the pHs, make sure everything is within range, it\u2019s not out of regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-22\">\u201cQ. These are waters that have been treated\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-23\">\u201cA. Yeah, we treat the water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-24\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s done in another building or is it done in your building?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>\u201cA. It\u2019s done in my plant, not my specific end of the plant, but at the whole facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cQ. Yours is sort of a quality control check?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">\u201cQ. At that point, once it passes you, if it\u2019s okay, it goes back into the Main Street?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201cQ. That\u2019s a union position that you have?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-12\">\u201cQ. And the plant that you work in, how would you describe the racial makeup of the plant there? Would you say there is a fair mix of Caucasians, African-Americans and Hispanics?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-14\">\u201cQ. Or is it leaning in one direction or the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-15\">\u201cA. I think it\u2019s relatively fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-16\">\u201cQ. Now, we have two different kinds of cases in our court system, we have civil cases and we have criminal cases. In a civil case the plaintiff, the person who brings the action, has the burden of proof by what is called a fair preponderance of the evidence, kind of tipping the scale one way or the other. In a criminal case the state brings the action and the state has the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. There\u2019s a much greater burden of proof in the criminal case. Do you understand the distinction and can apply it if instructed how?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-17\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-18\">\u201cQ. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not mean proof to an absolute certainty. New things in life can be proven to that level of certainty. However, you must be certain that each one of the charges here have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>proven beyond any reasonable doubt. Do you have any problem with that principle or concept?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-7\">\u201cQ. Now, obviously the charges here are very serious allegations, as serious as you can get under our laws. Is there anything about the nature of the charges or the kind of testimony that you might expect to hear, given that set of charges, that you feel would predispose you in one direction or another for whatever reason?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">\u201cQ. Let me ask you what your reaction was when you heard what the case was about, when you first came in here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-10\">\u201cA. My reaction? I was not shocked, but just\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">\u201cQ. Were you surprised?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-12\">\u201cA. Surprised, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-13\">\u201cQ. And nothing rang a bell at that point because you had not \u2014 you didn\u2019t remember anything about this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-15\">\u201cQ. And you might expect, as Mr. Dearington indicated, that there would be some rather graphic and unpleasant testimony in this case, photographs depicting deceased individuals with gunshot wounds and medical examiner testimony relating to the cause of death and the tracks of those wounds, nothing that we look at in our day-to-day lives, or talk about. Do you feel that you could put whatever natural emotional reaction you might have aside and not let that affect your objective determination of the facts in the case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-16\">\u201cA. Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-17\">\u201cQ. There also will be testimony regarding the recovery of shell casings and bullet fragments, both at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>scene as well as during the course of the autopsies that were performed, and there will also be testimony about the use of a firearm. Is there anything about the nature of that kind of testimony that you feel would affect your ability to be fair and impartial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">\u201cQ. Do you have any strong opinions about guns and the use of guns?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">\u201cQ. Do you have any familiarity at all with the location that was mentioned here, the Dixwell Avenue, Chimney Square area?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-10\">\u201cA. I just know Dixwell Avenue. I don\u2019t know where the Chimney Square area is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-11\">\u201cQ. And Dixwell Avenue you know in what regard? Just from coming to the city every once in a while?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-12\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-13\">\u201cQ. Can I ask you what your source of news is on a daily basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-14\">\u201cA. Source of news? ESPN. I am not much of a news man. I like sports.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-15\">\u201cQ. So, you\u2019re not reading a daily newspaper or watching the local news at night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-16\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-17\">\u201cQ. Now, have you heard of my name before at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-18\">\u201cA. No, I haven\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-19\">\u201cQ. And have you read anything or observed anything concerning the public defender\u2019s office recently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-20\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>\u201cQ. These days there is a lot in the media, even in headlines, about crime and the use of guns and homicides in our cities and surrounding towns. Is there anything that you have either read, observed, heard or a case that you may have followed that you feel has caused you to form some strong personal opinions about the criminal justice system that you feel would affect how you looked at this case in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">\u201cA. I have been reading about the Susan Smith case, just following that a little bit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">\u201cQ. I think everybody was affected by that. Have you formed any opinions at all about either that case or anything else that you\u2019ve read that you feel would affect how you looked at the facts of this particular case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-9\">\u201cQ. Some people have opinions about the criminal justice system, that there are too many legal technicalities or courts are too lenient, things like that. Do you share any opinions like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-11\">\u201cQ. Have you had \u2014 outside of what you described previously, have you had any prior contact with the criminal justice system for any reason, ever witness an incident \u2014 I am excluding what you talked about, the motor vehicle hit-and-run and the other thing that happened with your friend \u2014 ever witness any other kind of incident or given a statement to a police officer or testified in a court of law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-12\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-13\">\u201cQ. And you never had a lawsuit brought against you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-15\">\u201cQ. And you never brought a lawsuit against anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">\u201cQ. You made a claim regarding damages for a motor vehicle accident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-8\">\u201cQ. And I assume you did that with your insurance company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">\u201cQ. And have you ever \u2014 how many times have you done that, if you can recall, made a claim to an insurance company?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">\u201cA. Mine, just once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-12\">\u201cQ. And have you or your family suffered any kind of property damage, like a fire in a home or bodily injury, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">\u201cQ. Have you ever been the victim of a crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-16\">\u201cQ. Any family member or close friend that\u2019s been the victim of a crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-17\">\u201cA. Just my sister.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-18\">\u201cQ. And how long ago did that occur?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-19\">\u201cA. It had to be three to four years ago.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-20\">\u201cQ. Is there anything about your sister\u2019s victimization, that was the spousal relationship, that you feel would in any way affect your ability to be fair and impartial sitting here in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-21\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-22\">\u201cQ. I assume she was physically assaulted on some occasions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cQ. And was she living in Meriden at the time, or was she\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201cA. Yes, she was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201cQ. She was, okay. Now, have either a colleague at work, a neighbor, a friend or family member been the victim of a homicide, some kind of sexual assault or some kind of other crime of violence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201cA. Just the incident\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201cQ. Just what you mention about the people from high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">\u201cQ. How about [besides] that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">\u201cQ. Now, when you said you followed that case initially, they were both people that you weren\u2019t friends with but you knew from high school?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">\u201cQ. How did you follow it? You looked at the news coverage on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-17\">\u201cA. A little bit [from] hearsay from other friends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-18\">\u201cQ. From people in the community?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-19\">\u201cA. And a little bit reading about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-20\">\u201cQ. Did you have any impressions, either from what you heard from other people or what you read, about the criminal justice system or defense attorneys or prosecutors, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-21\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-22\">\u201cQ. Now, you heard the list of witnesses. They include a number of police officers. Would you have a tendency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to credit a police officer with any greater weight just because they are a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cQ. And you wouldn\u2019t give them any less weight just because they are a police officer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\">\u201cQ. Is it a fair statement that a police officer comes into this witness box like anybody else, you listen to what they have to say, what they may have observed, and you scrutinize their testimony like anybody else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\u201cQ. Any relatives or friends that are law enforcement officials, either police officers, attorneys or judges, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-12\">\u201cA. A couple of friends, a couple of people that I know are police officers, and I know a lawyer, but I think he\u2019s just a real estate lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cQ. And the police officers are Meriden uniform police officers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-14\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-15\">\u201cQ. Not detectives?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-16\">\u201cA. I believe one is a detective now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-17\">\u201cQ. They made detective recently?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-18\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-19\">\u201cQ. Where are they friends from? Are they from high school or growing up in the neighborhood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-20\">\u201cA. No, a couple of people that I play softball with, their fathers are police officers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u201cQ. Anything about those relationships at all that you feel would affect, one, how you looked at police officers\u2019 testimony, or two, your objectivity here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-5\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">\u201cQ. Now, do you think that [the defendant] must have done something wrong because he\u2019s sitting in court here today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cA. I am here to hear the facts. I don\u2019t make an assumption that he did something wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-8\">\u201cQ. Obviously somebody does think he has done something wrong because he has been arrested and accused. His is presumed innocent like every person would be.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-10\">\u201cQ. Can you assure us that you would not use the fact that he had been arrested and accused as evidence against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-11\">\u2018A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-12\">\u201cQ. The sequence of our trial is such that Mr. Dearing-ton presents the state\u2019s case first, and that could go on for awhile. The defense can then choose to put on a case, but doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do that. After the close of all the evidence, the lawyers will argue the merits of the case to the jury and then the judge will give you the instructions on the law. That is really the first time that you hear what specific principles of law apply to the facts of this case, and thereafter you will begin to deliberate this case with your fellow jurors. Can you assure us that you would honor the presumption of innocence until such time as you\u2019ve heard all the witnesses, all the legal arguments and the instructions from the judge?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>\u201cQ. And then begin your deliberations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u201cQ. And you can understand the importance of not making up your mind after witness number one or number five or number ten, you wait until you hear the whole case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">\u201cQ. Now, a decision hasn\u2019t been made whether [the defendant] will testify during the course of the trial. Let\u2019s say he did not, would you have a tendency to hold that against him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-10\">\u201cA. No, I would not hold that against him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-11\">\u201cQ. That is an interesting principle, because sometimes, in reality, we kind of sit back and say, T really would like to have heard what that guy had to say, if the defense is taking that kind of position,\u2019 but that doesn\u2019t always happen here in the courtroom. Do you feel you could honor his right not to testify?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-12\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-13\">\u201cQ. You would be instructed that you should draw no unfavorable inference from the fact that he didn\u2019t testify. Any problem with that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-14\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-15\">\u201cQ. Conversely, if he did testify, I assume you would scrutinize his testimony like any other witness according to the instructions the judge gives you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-16\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-17\">\u201cQ. Now, the defense is under no burden to put on any evidence whatsoever, we can simply rest after the state\u2019s case. Can you assure us that you would hold the state to its burden of proof even if we did not call a single witness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">\u201cQ. In other words, the state has to meet that burden of proof irrespective of what the defense does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-8\">\u201cQ. Their threshold isn\u2019t lower or lesser. Now, every crime we have in our state is defined, and we define them into terms that we call elements. The judge will tell you what the elements are to each of the four offenses here. He will also tell you each and every element of each offense has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and I want to give you a hypothetical for a moment. You\u2019re sitting on a case, and unlike this one, which has four charges, you only have to make a decision on one charge. You sit and listen to all the testimony, you listen to the lawyers make their arguments to you. Now the judge is giving you the instructions on the law, and among the instructions you receive are the following: that this one offense is made up of three separate elements and that each one of those three elements has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, okay? Now it\u2019s time for you to go back into that room and deliberate with your fellow jurors and it\u2019s your opinion, based on what you observed and what you heard in the courtroom, that there\u2019s plenty of evidence about element number one, well beyond a reasonable doubt, and there\u2019s plenty of evidence about element number two, also well beyond a reasonable doubt, but you have a doubt about element number three, it could be based on the evidence or lack of the evidence. Would you have any hesitation in returning a not guilty verdict under those circumstances?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">\u201cA. No hesitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">\u201cQ. I assume that\u2019s because that if the judge tells you that an offense is comprised of three elements and all three have to be proven, two out of three is not enough?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-6\">\u201cQ. Even though it sure looks like something was wrong. That is a very important principle. That analysis applies to each one of the four charges here because each charge has their own set of elements, and the jury is required to return a verdict on each one. What that means, in a case like this with multiple charges, the jury could come back with any number of different verdicts: it could be not guilty on everything, it could be guilty of everything, it could be not guilty on some, guilty on some, or vice versa, or you may hear some instructions from the judge regarding what is called lesser included offenses such as manslaughter, or you may not be able to reach a unanimous verdict with your fellow jurors. Any problem with that scenario?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-7\">\u201cA. No problem.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-8\">\u201cQ. Now, if you were selected as a juror in this case, would you voice your own opinion when it came time to discuss this case with your fellow jurors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-10\">\u201cQ. Are you the kind of person that would stand by your own opinion even if you were in the minority?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-12\">\u201cQ. I assume you would listen to what other people would have to say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-13\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-14\">\u201cQ. If they reasonably persuaded you, that would be one thing, but you wouldn\u2019t just change your vote because of the numbers?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-15\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-16\">\u201cQ. How do you feel about working in a group situation with the jury? Do you feel you would speak out, speak your mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">\u201cQ. Do you \u2014 let\u2019s say the vote was eleven to one and you were the one, how do you feel you would handle that situation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\">\u201cA. Well, I would make sure that everyone knows why I am voting against it or for it, whatever. If I was in the minority, I would try to see if they would see my point of view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">\u201cQ. Again, you would listen to what their position would be, and you would not change your vote just because of the numbers, it doesn\u2019t matter whether you\u2019re voting for guilty or for not guilty, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-9\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-10\">\u201cQ. Now, every case has issues of credibility that come up during the course of the case, both civil and criminal, and this case will be no different. One of the\u2014 and the judge will provide you with a series of factors to take into account in assessing a witness\u2019 credibility and believability. Many of them axe what we use in our everyday judgments of people in general. One of the things not to use is sympathy, and there could be a lot of sympathy in a case like this. You have two deceased individuals, you have family members present in court, and will be for the duration of the trial. [The defendant] is sitting here, he\u2019s facing very serious allegations and repercussions for those allegations, and family members of his will be present as well. Can you assure us that you could put whatever natural sympathies you might have aside and not let that affect your objective determination of the facts in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">\u201cQ. Now, have you ever studied or read books in the field of psychology or psychiatry or psychotherapy, anything like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">\u201cQ. And you indicated to Mr. Dearington the only time that a family member has utilized the services of a therapist was when your sister was going through the marital dissolution with her husband?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\u201cQ. How long did she attend therapy, do you know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">\u201cA. It\u2019s hard to determine how long it was. It was for a couple of months, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cQ. Has there been any other instance at all, within the family, in which either a psychotherapist or mental health worker or psychiatrist has been utilized?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-11\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">\u201cQ. And can I ask you what your impressions are of the field of psychiatrist or psychology or psychotherapy?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-13\">\u201cA. My impressions?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-14\">\u201cQ. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-15\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t really understand. I don\u2019t understand how they go. I never witnessed someone analyze someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-16\">\u201cQ. You don\u2019t really know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-17\">\u201cA. Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-18\">\u201cQ. Some people feel that it\u2019s not a qualified profession or they don\u2019t pay it a lot of attention or they don\u2019t give it a lot of respect. Do you have any feelings like that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-19\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-20\">\u201cQ. Now, how do you feel about the use of, or do you have any opinions about the use of, psychiatric testimony in a courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201cQ. And let me extend it one step further. Do you have any opinions concerning the use of psychiatric testimony in a criminal case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201cQ. Some people feel that when the defense introduces psychiatric testimony regarding state of mind, that that shouldn\u2019t be allowed, that that\u2019s a legal technicality and it shouldn\u2019t be allowed in a courtroom, even though the law allows it. Do you have any kind of feelings like that at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201cQ. Do you feel that you would listen to psychiatric testimony fairly, that was presented in this case, look at it and scrutinize it carefully?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-12\">\u201cQ. And are you coming in with any kind of preconceived notions that evidence like that has two strikes against it to start off with?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-13\">\u201cA. Evidence of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-14\">\u201cQ. Of a psychiatric nature.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-15\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-16\">\u201cQ. I think it\u2019s obvious that if the defense attorney is listing a psychiatrist and a psychologist and the prosecutor is listing a psychologist and you\u2019re being asked questions about that, it\u2019s obvious that the defense will not contest that [the defendant] was involved in the shootings in this case. Does that offend you or bother you in that the defense would rely on psychiatric testimony, the relevance of that testimony, to a state of mind?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-17\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>\u201cQ. So, I assume that you could scrutinize that testimony, listen to the instructions that the judge provides and make your decisions based on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cQ. Obviously [the defendant] is black. Is there any underlying prejudice at all that you feel would in any way affect your ability to be fair and impartial sitting on his case in this courtroom?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201cQ. Both deceased individuals are both white males. Is there anything about the fact that the case presents a situation where a black man is accused of killing two white men that you feel presents any difficulties for you at all?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-11\">\u201cQ. And the defense psychiatrist, Dr. Ezra Griffith, is a black male. Is there anything about that fact that you feel in any way would affect how you looked at his testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-12\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-13\">\u201cQ. Okay, we all, in society, are consumers of goods and services. Have you ever felt taken advantage of in purchasing goods or services?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-14\">\u201cA. Yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-15\">\u201cQ. Does anything stand out in your mind about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-16\">\u201cA. Buying a car, buying something that\u2019s falsified, like a collectible show.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-17\">\u201cQ. Do you feel that you were taken advantage of because of race or your professional status or lack of professional status, or by the status of the person who was selling the goods?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>\u201cA. Taken advantage of because of lack of knowledge, because I didn\u2019t know about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">\u201cQ. Can you assure [the defendant] that you would give him a fair trial in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">\u201cQ. Any question about that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">\u201cA. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-10\">\u201cMr. Ullmann: Okay. Thank you, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-11\">\u201cThe Court: Would you be good enough to step into the jury room right behind you, for just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-12\">\u201c(Whereupon the juror stepped out of the courtroom.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">See appendix B of this dissent for the argument of trial counsel regarding the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">APPENDIX B</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">The transcript of the entire argument by counsel with respect to the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>hearing \u2014 which in my view demonstrates that the trial court never gave a meaningful review of the claim \u2014 is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-16\">\u201cThe Court [addressing G.D.]: Would you be good enough to step into the jury room right behind you, for just a moment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-17\">\u201c(Whereupon the juror stepped out of the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-18\">\u201c[Michael Dearington, State\u2019s Attorney]: Excused.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-19\">\u201cThe Court: Bring him back.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-20\">\u201c[Thomas Ullmann, Defense Counsel]: I would like to be heard on this. I would like to ask for \u2014 I know that [G.D.] is not a member of the defendant\u2019s race, but he is a minority, a Hispanic minority, and I would ask for a racially neutral reason for that challenge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cThe Court: Mr. Dearington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">\u201cMr. Dearington: Our law provide[s] that one must be a member of the defendant\u2019s minority for the <em>Batson </em>rule to kick in, or the <em>Batson </em>case. I don\u2019t think I am obligated to do that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">\u201cThe Court: Do you have any reason otherwise? Do you have any other reasons?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">\u201cMr. Dearington: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-9\">\u201cThe Court: Why don\u2019t you recite them for the record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-10\">\u201cMr. Dearington: In terms of his ability to, his intellectual ability to understand a psychiatric defense bothers me. I think he was never put in a position where he had to make decisions. He admitted that his high school career was less than illustrious. His position at work doesn\u2019t demonstrate a position where he has to make decisions. That concerns me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-11\">\u201cAgain, the psychiatric defense, I have a feeling that he might be overwhelmed by the testimony by all of the doctors, if not one of them. That concerns me. I am not sure how the fact that a friend of his or an acquaintance was murdered, and he knows the fellow that murdered him, how it took place. He indicated that he initially did follow the case and I guess lost interest. He was obviously exposed to an unpleasant experience with a police officer, and I know he says that would not play a part in this case, [but] one never knows subconsciously how that would play in his judgment in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-12\">\u201cI mentioned his education. Although we have taken people with twelve years of education, I have a sense in this case that \u2014 I just don\u2019t feel that he would be up to understanding the evidence in this case and dealing with it, as I have already elaborated on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>\u201cAlso, he being one of [seven] children, the other [six] of them sisters, he being near the youngest, that\u2019s something that I find of some interest in terms of how he would look at this case. Those are a few of the reasons, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cThe Court: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">\u201cMr. Ullmann: Your Honor, I guess it\u2019s okay to take a Romanian citizen [in reference to W.V., a juror who was selected] [who has] a fifth grade education, who worked on cars in his backyard for his entire life, but a man with a twelfth grade education [who is] working for five years at Cytec, he\u2019s got problems understanding that? I strongly disagree.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-8\">\u201cI think that the United States Supreme Court has indicated that in addition to the <em>Batson </em>case ground for racially neutral explanations, that minority members have rights in themselves as jurors to be seated on a jury, and I am exercising that right on behalf of [G.D.]; and I think that under our own case law in the state of Connecticut, which has exceeded the <em>Batson </em>requirements and which the court, our Supreme Court, has stated they have supervisory control of this particular issue in seating minority members on juries, that they would frown upon the excuses that were made by Mr. Dearington regarding [G.D.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201c[G.D.] is a working man. He graduated from high school. He is someone who grew up in Meriden. He didn\u2019t say he was friends, he said he knew these people, and other than that, he had no connection with those particular individuals.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-10\">\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s the slightest basis for excusing [G.D.] from this particular case, and I really find the state\u2019s position outrageous. I am asking the court to seat [G.D.] in the case and reject the explanation that was raised by Mr. Dearington.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u201cMr. Dearington: We did select someone who had less than twelve years education, but he was substantially older than this gentleman, who is twenty-three. I am just citing our Connecticut law, that a <em>Batson </em>showing must include evidence that the defendant is a member of a cognizable racial group, and this prosecutor has exercised a peremptory challenge to remove the venireman, who is not a member of the defendant\u2019s race. I mean the law is clear.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">\u201cMr. Ullmann: Is Mr. Dearington suggesting that people can be eliminated based on racial or religious or sexual grounds if they are somewhat different in terms of their racial makeup than the defendant? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case law, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s United States Supreme Court case law, and I don\u2019t think that our Connecticut Supreme Court would tolerate that explanation at all particularly under Atate v. <em>Holloway </em>[supra, 209 Conn. 636] in which this Supreme Court went further than the United States Supreme Court in <em>Batson </em>in exercising its supervisory capacity on this particular issue. So, I don\u2019t think that the citation or authority there would apply to this particular instance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">\u201cThe Court: All right, the court is satisfied that the use of the peremptory challenge here was not racially motivated and that the reasons advanced by the state are sufficient in the court\u2019s judgment and not pretextual. So, bring him back, please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\">\u201c(Whereupon the juror returned to the courtroom.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-9\">\u201cThe Court: [G.D], you have been excused from service in this particular case. Since you were carried over from yesterday, that means that your jury service is completed. We appreciate your coming back, but please go back to the ninth floor and tell them that you\u2019re all done. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-10\">\u201c(Whereupon the juror [G.D.] was excused and left the courtroom.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b288-7\"> \u201cOne of the cornerstones of our judicial system is the right to a jury trial; yet minorities do not serve on jury trials in proportion to their eligible population. This is of concern both because of the importance of minorities serving on jury duty, and because of the perception that racial and ethnic biases among non-minority jurors can have an adverse effect on civil and criminal case deliberations. An overwhelming percentage of Judicial Branch judges and attorneys reported that minority litigants felt they would not be judged by a jury of their peers. 75% of judges felt this was true more than 25% of the time; 99% of minority attorneys and 86% of Caucasian attorneys agreed. This fuels a perception that the system does not mete equal justice for all.\u201d Connecticut Judicial Branch Task Force on Minority Fairness, supra, p. 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-8\"> The survey conducted was a telephone poll of 1201 Connecticut residents.

I have two responses. First, work on this case has been a long, slow process for both the majority and the dissent. For example, a justice\u2019s decision to join the concurring opinion and revised drafts of the majority\u2019s opinion were circulated as recently as March, 1999 \u2014 several months <em>after </em>I made the motion that the majority maligns as \u201cbelated.\u201d Moreover, the majority did not circulate its first draft opinion in this matter until July 2,1998, followed by a second draft on July 31 \u2014 the last day before the beginning of our summer recess. Accordingly, I had no opportunity to respond to the majority\u2019s sixty-four page opinion until we returned to chambers in September. I filed my thirty-six page draft dissent in relatively short order, in October.</p>\n<p id=\"ABP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>More important than this temporal nitpicking, justice should not depend on when a matter is raised by a member of this court. I wish I had made my motion earlier. The fact that I failed to do so because of my frailties may supply a reason for chagrin, but it does not supply a legitimate reason for denying the motion. It should not be necessary to remind my colleagues that, as members of the court of last resort in the state of Connecticut, we should aspire to do justice. Among other things, this means that we should generally address all of the relevant issues of each case \u2014 especially when some of the issues go to the very heart of the perception of justice in our courts. In the present case, the African-American defendant has received a sentence of eighty-five years. Unless his conviction is overturned, he will in all likelihood spend the rest of his life in jail. The majority\u2019s assurance that they \u201cawait consideration of the argument . . . until it is properly before us\u201d will provide little solace to the defendant. Of equal significance, the majority\u2019s failure to address this issue fuels a perception by the public, particularly by the African-American community, that the Connecticut judicial system tolerates racism in its courtrooms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> Moreover, this court, albeit during a different era, recognized the problems of trial attorneys and public defenders. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Barrett, </em>205 Conn. 437, 444-45, 534 A.2d 219 (1987), this court stated: \u201cState constitutional law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>is only now emerging from the shadow of its federal counterpart. It is therefore understandable that parties may not engage in elaborate discussion and analysis of untested and novel state constitutional theories in trial court proceedings where defense counsel has other more immediately accessible and tangible targets to pursue. The reality is that time for original analysis is scarce, particularly in the ordinary criminal case; and particularly at the trial level, lawyers and courts often depend on the shorthand of case citations in preference to scrutinizing statutes and constitutional principles. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kennedy, </em>295 Or. 260, 266, 666 P.2d 1316 (1983); see also E.

We therefore conclude that the defendant\u2019s claim under article first, \u00a7 8, is reviewable at this juncture, despite his failure to raise the claim <em>during the trial </em>or <em>on the original </em>appeal.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) Simply put, <em>Barrett, </em>decided approximately four years after the trial and eighteen months after the first appeal in the present case, is the kind of justice that should be our benchmark.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b293-7\"> <em>Smith </em>did not involve a claim of racism, but merely the question of whether the trial court properly imposed a condition of probation one year after the defendant was sentenced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b293-8\"> In <em>Genovese, </em>I commended the majority\u2019s activism as follows: \u201cI also write separately to endorse the procedural activism employed by the majority in this case. The plaintiff in this case failed to raise his claim under [General Statutes] \u00a7 31-51bb both in the trial court and initially before this court. We, <em>on our own, </em>raised the applicability of \u00a7 31-51bb and ordered ihe parties to submit supplemental briefs. Accordingly, the majority has decided this case on the basis of a claim that was never raised in the trial court and was raised in this court only as a result of our direction. Although I do not agree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 31-51bb, I applaud the procedural route employed in this case. We may now employ this procedure in other cases as justice demands. Certainly, if we may use this newly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>established procedure to achieve justice on behalf of civil litigants, where only money is involved, we must do likewise when an individual\u2019s liberty is at stake.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>Genovese v.

Although one justice who is part of the majority in this case was a member of the panel in <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>supra, 222 Conn. 1, I do not believe that, if it is the reason, it is sufficient to justify the failure to overrule specifically the case. This failure causes confusion for both the trial bench and the bar. In my dissent in <em>Smith, </em>I pointed out the following: \u201cFairness and the perception of fairness, require that black defendants be given great latitude in uncovering racial bigotry. Unfortunately, \u2018[r] acial prejudice is a cultural malady that has shaped our history as a nation. It is a cancer of the mind and spirit which breeds as prolifically in the industrial cities of the North as in the rural towns of the South.\u2019 <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, </em>414 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>U.S. 1080, 1085, 94 S. Ct. 599, 38 L. Ed. 2d 486 (1973) (Marshall, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). Our courts must be sensitive to the problem of racial bigotry that may exist in the administration of our judicial system; otherwise our courts will not be courts of justice. Surely, the majority\u2019s ruling today does not enhance this sensitivity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Smith, supra, 221 Conn. 31 (Berdon, <em>J., </em>dissenting). In Smith, I would have reversed the conviction because the trial judge would not allow the public defender to ask the following question during voir dire: \u201c \u2018How would you feel if a relative of yours, son, daughter, brother or sister . . . expressed an intent to you that he [or she] wanted to marry a black person?\u2019 \u201d Id., 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b296-7\"> Because I believe the defendant is entitled to a new trial under federal law as embellished by the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>analysis, I need not reach the obvious issue of whether the state constitution requires more protection than that which is provided by <em>Senkowski. </em>See <em>Cologne v. Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984); W. Brennan, \u201cState Constitutions and the Protection of Individual Rights,\u201d 90 Har. L. Rev. 489, 491 (1977) (\u201c[S]tate courts cannot rest when they have afforded their citizens the full protections of the federal Constitution. State constitutions, too, are a font of individual liberties, their protections often extending beyond those required by the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of federal law. The legal revolution which has brought federal law to the fore must not be allowed to inhibit the independent protective force of state law \u2014 for without it, the full realization of our liberties cannot be guaranteed.\u201d). For example, we have an equal protection clause that is much more expansive than that of the United States constitution. Conn. Const., art. I, \u00a7 20; see R. Berdon, \u201cConnecticut Equal Protection Clause: Requirement of Strict Scrutiny When Classifications Are Based upon Sex, Physical Disability or Mental Disability,\u201d 64 Conn. B.J. 386 (1990). Article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by articles five and twenty-one of the amendments, a powerful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>equal protection clause, specifically focuses on, among other matters, \u201crace\u201d and \u201ccolor\u201d as follows: \u201cNo person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination in the exercise or enjoyment of his or her civil or political rights because of religion, race, color, ancestry, national origin, sex or physical or mental disability.\u201d There is no such comparable language in the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution. Therefore, a persuasive argument could be made that if a prosecutor, in exercising a peremptory challenge on behalf of the state, is motivated even in part by race, as evidenced by advancing a pretextual reason, the inquiry should end and the peremptory challenge should be stricken. In other words, there would be no necessity for a <em>Senkowski </em>analysis. Nevertheless, I leave this issue for another day.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b299-7\"> There is no question that. <em>Purkett </em>changed the law of <em>Batson. </em>The dissent in <em>Purkett </em>points out \u201c[i]n my opinion it is unwise for the Court to announce a law-changing decision without first ordering full briefing and argument on the merits of the case. The Court does this today when it overrules a portion of our opinion in <em>Batson </em>. . . .\u201d <em>Purkett </em>v. <em>Elem, </em>supra, 514 U.S. 770 (Stevens, J., dissenting). In his dissent in <em>Hernandez, </em>-Justice Stevens underscored the requirement of relatedness in step two of <em>Batson </em>as follows: \u201cOnce the defendant makes a prima facie showing, the burden shifts to the State to come forward with a neutral explanation. ... If the prosecutor offers no explanation, the defendant has succeeded in establishing an equal protection violation based on the evidence of invidious intent that gave rise to the prima facie case. If the prosecutor seeks to dispel the inference of discriminatory intent, in order to succeed his explanation need not rise to the level justifying exercise of a challenge for cause. . . . However, the prosecutor\u2019s justification must identify legitimate reasons that are related to the particular case to be tried and sufficiently persuasive to rebu[t] a defendant\u2019s prima facie case.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hernandez </em>v. <em>New York, </em>supra, 500 U.S. 376.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> The voir dire for jury selection in the present case was conducted throughout the fall of 1994 and the jury returned a verdict in early January, 1995, while <em>Purkett </em>was not decided until May, 1995.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\"><em> </em>The majority is absolutely correct that the defendant, in his appellate brief, accepts the majority\u2019s decision in <em>Purkett </em>and argues that relatedness should be considered in step two of <em>Batson/Holloway. </em>But, as I have already pointed out, the fact that the defendant incorrectly argues the law does not mean we should so apply it. We are here to do justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">Nevertheless, although the public defender at trial did not specifically argue that the proffered reasons were not related, he implicitly raised the issue when his argument is considered in light of the fact that the <em>Purkett </em>decision was decided approximately five months after the completion of the trial in the present case. Defense counsel implicitly raised the issue as follows: \u201c[Thomas Ullmann, Defense Counsel]: I think that under our own case law in the state of Connecticut, which has exceeded the <em>Batson </em>requirements and which the court, our Supreme Court, has stated <em>they </em>have supervisory control of this particular issue . . . that they <em>would frown upon the excuses that were made </em>by [the state\u2019s attorney] regarding [G.D.].\u201d (Emphasis added.) Defense counsel continued to discuss Connecticut law and its supervisory powers throughout his objection to the state\u2019s challenge of G.D. See appendix B of this dissent for the entire argument by counsel with respect to the <em>Batson/Holloway </em>hearing regarding G.D., the one venireperson on which this dissent focuses.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b300-9\"> \u201cIt is well established that federal constitutional and statutory law establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of individual rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights. . . . <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984). <em>State </em>v. <em>Barton, </em>219 Conn. 529, 546, 594 A.2d 917 (1991).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b301-8\"> The majority cites <em>United States v.

That is absolutely incorrect. This court quoted <em>Batson </em>in <em>Gonzalez, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>stating that the neutral reason \u201cmust relate \u2018to the particular case to be tried\u2019 id.; and went even further. We explained in <em>Gonzalez </em>under our own jurisprudence that such relatedness not only encompasses \u201creasons that might arise in . . . one case [but also] those that tend to recur in all criminal cases.\u201d Id. To be perfectly clear, I quote the entire passage from <em>Gonzalez: </em>\u201cIn <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated that the neutral explanation given by the prosecutor must relate \u2018to the particular case to be tried.\u2019 <em>Batson </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, [476 U.S.] 98. We decline to read this language as narrowly as the defendant urges. It is no doubt true that some neutral reasons for exercising peremptory challenges will impact the specific nature of the case to be tried. Just as frequently, however, the prosecutor may believe that a particular juror is unfit for duty because of an infirmity relating to his or her general status as a discerning observer of trial activity.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzalez, </em>supra, 404. This inteipretation of <em>Gonzalez\u2019 </em>gloss <em>onBatson/Holloway\u2019s </em>first step reinforces the fact that we reshaped <em>Batson\u2019s </em>relatedness under state law, thereby adopting it as part of the jurisprudence of Connecticut. It simply is disingenuous for the majority to claim otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">Second, the majority correctly points out that <em>Gonzalez </em>directly quotes <em>Batson </em>in order to reach its legal conclusion. The majority, however, misreads the significance of this reference when it argues that <em>Gonzalez </em>follows <em>Batson, </em>therefore, our state jurisprudence must blindly follow the majority opinion in <em>Purkett. </em>A decision that invites counsel to advance fantastic, silly or superstitious reasons evades the mandate of <em>Batson, </em>as well as that of <em>Gonzalez. </em>Thus, we should recognize that the <em>Purkett </em>majority overruled <em>Batson, </em>and should refuse to allow that mischief to undermine our well established jurisprudence that goes back to 1988, seven years before <em>Purkett </em>was decided, that requires counsel to advance neutral reasons that are based upon legitimate claims related to the trial. Our jurisprudence that requires relatedness for the neutral reason to rebut a prima facie case of discrimination, as I point out in this dissent, was confirmed in <em>State </em>v. <em>Beltran, </em>supra, 246 Conn. 279-80, three years after <em>Purkett </em>was decided. Just as we embel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>lished <em>Batson </em>when we decided <em>Holloway </em>under state law, we likewise did so with respect to relatedness under <em>Gonzalez/Beltran </em>by implicitly rejecting the majority decision in <em>Burkett. </em>Simply put, the trial courts, wherein justice is to be dispensed, should not be required to accept reasons such as \u201cI had a silly dream the night before that the venireperson would not be a good juror\u201d as satisfying the first prong of <em>Batson/Holloway.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b305-8\"> The majority\u2019s response in footnote 22 of its opinion that the defendant has not sought a heightened review is of no consequence. A reviewing court should not apply an incorrect standard of review simply because a party does not request such review. Within the same footnote the majority once again tries to limit this court to the federal law. As I pointed out in parts I and II of this dissent, we are not limited by the federal constitution when we are reviewing a claim that also encompasses a parallel provision in the Connecticut constitution and our state common law, as long as we grant more rights for the defendant than are provided by the federal constitution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b305-9\"> In footnote 22 of its opinion, the majority tries to refute our standard of review by arguing that when we have applied this heightened standard it has been \u201cwithin the broader context of the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d Whatever the majority means by this statement, it is of no significance. Simply put, we reviewed those factual findings under a heightened review because of the importance of the issues. <em>State </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>238 Conn. 389, 449, 680 A.2d 147 (1996) (\u201c[w]e will, however, subject these facts to the same searching inquiry that we apply in other instances of constitutional fact-finding\"); State <em>v.

Under federal constitutional law as set forth in <em>Batson, </em>the Second Circuit Court of Appeals has adopted the dual motivation analysis. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Senkowski, </em>supra, 986 F.2d 30. Although the United States Supreme Court has not ruled on the issue of the applicability of the dual motivation analysis, we follow the Second Circuit. See <em>Schnabel </em>v. <em>Tyler, </em>230 Conn. 735, 743 n.4, 646 A.2d 152 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b313-7\"> In order to maintain that the defendant\u2019s disparate treatment claims are unpreserved, the majority misconstrues <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>supra, 237 Conn. 238. The majority tries to support its present position by arguing that in <em>Robinson </em>the court \u201cconcluded that a defendant may <em>renew </em>a <em>disparate treatment </em>claim regarding the state\u2019s use of a peremptory challenge even at the conclusion of voir dire . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) In fact, in <em>Robinson </em>the court held that \u201ca defendant <em>may object </em>to the state\u2019s peremptory challenge on <em>Batson </em>equal protection grounds <em>at any time prior to the swearing oj'the jury.\" </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 253. Thus, <em>Robinson </em>requires only that a <em>Batson/Holloway </em>claim be made for the first time at any time prior to the swearing of the jury in order for an appellate court to review the claim and take into account other jurors who were subsequently seated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b313-8\"> In footnote 23 of its opinion, the majority claims unpersuasively that our review in <em>Gonzalez </em>of the disparate treatment claim under <em>Batson </em>that was raised for the first time on appeal is no longer relevant to this case because <em>Gonzalez </em>was decided before <em>Golding. Golding </em>did not change our jurisprudence regarding the review of alleged constitutional violations that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>State </em>v. <em>Golding, </em>213 Conn. 233, 239-40, 567 A.2d 823 (1989).
