The workers\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>compensation commissioner (commissioner) found that the plaintiff had suffered a \u201c20 percent permanent partial impairment of the skin . . . because of the loss of the function of [the plaintiffs] skin in addition to the permanent scars and disfigurement under [\u00a7] 31-308 (c),\u201d but did not award compensation for that impairment because the skin was excluded from the \u00a7 31-308 (b) schedule of body parts and organs for which permanent partial disability benefits may be awarded. The commissioner denied compensation on the grounds that the workers\u2019 compensation commission lacked jurisdiction to award compensation for a body part or member not set forth in \u00a7 31-308 (b). The plaintiff appealed that decision to the compensation review board (board).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The board, acting pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-324,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> reserved the following two questions for the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>ion of the Appellate Court: (1) Does \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprive the plaintiff of equal protection or due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution by providing permanent partial disability benefits for damage to certain scheduled organs and body parts, such as the gall bladder, teeth, pancreas and sense of smell, while denying permanent partial disability benefits to claimants who have sustained damage to the skin, as in the present case, or damage to other vital organs, such as the intestines, esophagus, endocrine glands, uterus, abdominal wall, and others? (2) Does \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprive the plaintiff of equal protection or due process of law under the provisions of article first of the Connecticut constitution by providing permanent partial disability benefits for damage to certain scheduled organs and body parts, such as the gall bladder, teeth, pancreas and sense of smell, while denying permanent partial disability benefits to claimants who have sustained damage to the skin, as in the present case, or damage to other vital organs, such as the intestines, esophagus, endocrine glands, uterus, abdominal wall, and others? We transferred the reservation from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>The relevant facts are undisputed. The plaintiff sought to recover workers\u2019 compensation benefits for injuries that he had sustained in a propane fire at his work site while employed by the defendant as an electrician. According to the commissioner\u2019s findings, the propane fire damaged the plaintiffs skin such that he suffers from continual lesions, and further, that he must avoid exposure to the sun because of his damaged facial skin. With regard to the plaintiffs physical injuries, the defendant and its insurer provided the plaintiff with the following compensation benefits: medical and surgical treatment and temporary total disability compensation; compromised disfigurement compensation of 150 weeks; and permanent partial disability compensation of 118.53 weeks, based on an accepted 33.1 percent loss of use of the plaintiffs right master hand and 40.6 percent loss of use of his left hand. The plaintiff and the defendant and its insurer also had entered into a stipulation and release of claims for scarring and disfigurement, pursuant to \u00a7 31-308 (c),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> which was approved by the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>The plaintiff sought compensation for a psychiatric condition, a permanent partial disability from the psychiatric condition, and a permanent partial disability of the skin.* *<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The commissioner further found that the plaintiff had suffered a 20 percent permanent partial impairment of his skin because of the loss of skin function, in addition to the permanent scars and disfigurement under \u00a7 31-308 (c). The commissioner concluded, however, that he had no jurisdiction to award compensation for such an impairment because the skin was not an organ or body part listed in the schedule of enumerated body parts and organs for which compensation is available under \u00a7 31-308 (b). Accordingly, the commissioner dismissed the plaintiffs claim for permanent partial disability based on the injury to his skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Before proceeding, we note that the reserved questions are too broad for us to answer as framed. In evaluating the constitutionality of statutes, we are mindful of the principle that \u201c[a] party mounting a constitutional challenge to the validity of a statute must provide an adequate factual record in order to meet its burden of demonstrating the statute\u2019s adverse impact on some protected interest of its own, in its own particular case, and not merely under some hypothetical set of facts as yet unproven. Whether a case comes to us by way of reservation or after a final judgment, the rule is the same. We do not give advisory opinions, nor do we sit as roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of legislative enactments. Determination of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the scope and constitutionality of legislation in advance of its immediate adverse effect in the context of a concrete case involves too remote and abstract an inquiry for the proper exercise of the judicial function.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Ganim, </em>233 Conn. 557, 570, 660 A.2d 742 (1995), quoting <em>International Longshoremen\u2019s &amp; Warehousemen\u2019s Union, Local 37 v. Boyd, </em>347 U.S. 222, 224, 74 S. Ct. 447, 98 L. Ed. 650 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Answering the reserved questions as they are framed would require us to evaluate whether the statute is unconstitutional based on the exclusion of not only the skin as an organ, but also the exclusion of \u201cthe intestines, esophagus, endocrine glands, uterus, abdominal wall, and others\u201d from the schedule. The plaintiff, however, seeks compensation for damages exclusively to the skin. For us to address the exclusion of any body part or organ other than the skin from the \u00a7 31-308 (b) schedule of compensable organs and body parts would render this an advisory opinion to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">In the past, in order to remedy the overbroad nature of particular reserved questions, we have modified the reserved question. \u201cThis court has overlooked a defect in a reservation because of the importance of the issues involved and the fact that the claims of the parties have been fully presented in argument and brief .... Where the questions propounded are improperly framed, we have to answer the questions in a manner which will be adequate to guide the trial court in rendering judgment.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gianetti </em>v. <em>Norwalk Hospital, </em>211 Conn. 51, 57, 557 A.2d 1249 (1989). Under the circumstances of the present case, therefore, we will entertain the first reserved question reframed as follows: (1) Does \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprive the plaintiff of equal protection or due process of law under the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution by providing permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>partial disability benefits for damage to certain scheduled organs and body parts, such as the gall bladder, teeth, pancreas and sense of smell, while denying permanent partial disability benefits to claimants who have sustained damage to their skin? We entertain the second reserved question reframed as follows: (2) Does \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprive the plaintiff of equal protection or due process of law under the provisions of article first of the Connecticut constitution by providing permanent partial disability benefits for damage to certain scheduled organs and body parts, such as the gall bladder, teeth, pancreas and sense of smell, while denying permanent partial disability benefits to claimants who have sustained damage to their skin?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">The plaintiff contends that if \u00a7 31-308 (b) is interpreted so as to disallow the commissioner discretion in awarding compensation for loss or permanent partial disability of body parts and organs not contained in the \u00a7 31-308 (b) schedule, then the statute violates the equal protection and due process clauses of both the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first of the Connecticut constitution because there is no rational basis for the legislature to have included certain body parts and organs in the schedule of compensable organs and body parts, and not to include the skin. We disagree with the arguments of the plaintiff, we answer the equal protection portions of both reserved questions in the negative, and we decline to address the due process portions under either the state or federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">In order to evaluate the constitutional validity of \u00a7 31-308 (b), we first must determine its meaning with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>respect to the amendment by No. 93-228 of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-228), according to the well established principles of statutory construction. \u201cThe process of statutory interpretation involves a reasoned search for the intention of the legislature. ... In seeking to determine that meaning, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>240 Conn. 422, 431, 692 A.2d 742 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">We begin our analysis by examining the plain language of \u00a7 31-308 (b). Prior to the 1993 amendment, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (b) contained a schedule of body parts and organs, the permanent complete or partial loss or disability* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of which entitled the injured employee to additional weeks of compensation. Body parts and organs for which compensation was available according to the schedule in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (b) were and are termed \u201cscheduled\u201d body parts and organs.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Permanent partial disability of body parts and organs not listed in the schedule in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (b), that is, the disability of \u201cunscheduled\u201d body parts and organs, was compensable prior to 1993, because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>the schedule in subsection (b) was supplemented explicitly by subsection (c) of that statute. General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (c) provided in relevant part that \u201c[i]n addition to compensation for total or partial incapacity, or for a specific loss of a member or loss of use of the function of a member of the body, <em>the commissioner may award compensation as he deems just for the loss or loss of use of the function of any organ or part of the body not otherwise provided for in this section, </em>taking into account the age and sex of the claimant, the disabling effect of the loss of or loss of function of the organ involved and the necessity of the organ or complete functioning of the organ with respect to the entire body. ...\u201d (Emphasis added.) Read together, General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (b) and (c) provided specific durations of compensation for loss or permanent partial disability of scheduled body parts and organs, and afforded the commissioner discretion in awarding compensation for the loss or permanent partial disability of any unscheduled body parts or organs, as the commissioner deemed just.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">With the passage of P.A. 93-228, two important changes occurred that are relevant to this statutory scheme. First, a number of formerly unscheduled body parts and organs were added to the schedule provided in General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (b);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>second, subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308, which previously had provided discretion to the commissioner to compensate injured employees for unscheduled injuries, was removed completely from the statute. See P.A. 93-228, \u00a7 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">Although we recognize that \u201cthe humanitarian and remedial purposes of the act counsel against an overly narrow construction that unduly limits eligibility for workers\u2019 compensation\u201d; <em>Herman </em>v. <em>Sherwood Industries, Inc., </em>244 Conn. 502, 511, 710 A.2d 1338 (1998); \u201cwe are not free to accomplish a result that is contrary to the intent of the legislature as expressed in the act\u2019s plain language.\u201d <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>247 Conn. 126, 137-38 n.16, 717 A.2d 747 (1998). The statute before us has no ambiguity that we could elect to construe either broadly or narrowly. The removal of subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 in its entirety necessarily means that the legislature elected to remove from the permanent partial disability provision, the discretion that formerly was afforded to the commissioner to award compensation for the disability of an unscheduled body part or organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-7\">In spite of the clear meaning of \u00a7 31-308 on its face, the plaintiff argues on the basis of certain comments in the legislative history of the statute, that we should ignore the removal of subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308, and instead read its discretionary language back into the current statute. As support for his interpretation, the plaintiff relies upon a statement \u2014 one of the few in which this portion of P.A. 93-228 was addressed through debate \u2014 by Senator Michael P. Meotti, a sponsor of the legislation. Contrary to the plaintiffs argument, however, a review of the relevant exchange in the Senate illustrates that the legislature was cognizant that its passage of P.A. 93-228 would result in the elimination of discretion as it existed under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">Senator Meotti stated<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that \u201cfor the purposes of explaining my intent and my sense of what should be in the legislative history, the issue has been raised recently in the public debate, not only here, but previous to tonight\u2019s debate about using examples of specific types of injuries that do not appear to be mentioned in the schedule, evisceration and you know, intestinal loss or damage or whatever, and I discussed that specific [issue] with representatives of the [National Council of Compensation Insurers] who were the people that I think all parties in this debate have gone to for costing out and other guidance on the issues and I would say that it is their opinion that based on existing practice in Connecticut and throughout the country that this particular example and other attempts to try to find particular injuries like this and say that they are not covered under this language would not in fact be correct, that the commissioners would have the discretion to find injuries of that sort to be subsumed within other descriptions within that schedule such as the stomach. I offer that not to challenge the assertion, but more to make the legislative history, that that is my view of how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>this is written in order to fully protect workers and injuries on the job.\u201d 36 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1993 Sess., pp. 3879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">We disagree with the plaintiff\u2019s contention that this statement by Senator Meotti constitutes evidence of a legislative intent to have subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 somehow interpreted back into the current statute. Senator Meotti\u2019s statement suggests only that he believed \u201cthat the commissioners would have the discretion to find injuries of that sort to be <em>subsumed within </em>other descriptions within that schedule . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) 36 S. Proc., supra, pp. 3879-80. The statement simply supports the notion that an injured employee could receive compensation for injury to an unscheduled body part or organ under the amended version of \u00a7 31-308 (b), to the extent that the injury related to the loss of or loss of use of a <em>scheduled </em>body part or member, because such injury always would be compensable as it pertained to a scheduled body part or member. The statement certainly does not contradict the argument that the elimination of subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 is self-explanatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Our reading of \u00a7 31-308 (b), with respect to the amendment by P.A. 93-228, is also consistent with the interpretation of the legislative program review and investigations committee (committee), a joint permanent standing committee of the General Assembly created inter alia, to examine state government programs and evaluate whether such programs are \u201ceffective, continue to serve their intended purposes, are conducted in an efficient and effective manner, or require modification or elimination . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 2-53d (1). The committee has conducted numerous studies of the workers\u2019 compensation system in Connecticut, and we previously have reviewed these studies as part of the relevant legislative history. Cf. <em>Dixon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number><em>United Illuminating Co., </em>232 Conn. 758, 772-73, 657 A.2d 601 (1995). As in <em>Dixon, </em>we again turn to the reports of the committee for evidence of what motivated the legislature to alter the workers\u2019 compensation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-5\">In December, 1995, the committee produced a report entitled \u201cWorkers\u2019 Compensation: Impact of the 1991<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and 1993 Reforms.\u201d In summarizing the impact of those reforms, the committee described the changes that P.A. 93-228 created in the permanent partial disability compensation scheme. Such a summary is evidence of the intent of the legislature, because, although drafted after the legislation already had been enacted, it nevertheless reflects what the legislature believed it was changing in \u00a7 31-308 (b) by enacting P.A. 93-228. In this regard, it is significant that the committee is an arm of the legislature, and that in reporting on the prior 1993 legislation it acts as such. It is, as we noted previously, a legislative institution statutorily presumed to know the \u201cintended purposes\u201d of prior legislation. In the report, the permanent partial disability compensation scheme prior to the 1993 reforms was described as follows: \u201cStatutes list the maximum number of weeks of compensation that may be awarded for certain body parts and functions (called scheduled) and gave commissioners discretion to award up to 780 weeks for loss of body parts or functions not specified in the law (unscheduled).\u201d Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Workers\u2019 Compensation: Impact of the 1991 and 1993 Reforms (1995) p. 61. In contrast, the report provided that the passage of P.A. 93-228 <em>\u201c[cjreated a statutory schedule for all unscheduled injuries </em>and reduced by 1/3 the number of weeks for all scheduled injuries except the back (reduced 28%) and knee (35%).\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Id. This reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>of \u00a7 31-308 (b) is consistent with our construction of the statute, by which the legislature removed discretion from the statutory scheme for permanent partial disability compensation, and now authorizes compensation only for scheduled injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-5\">In light of the plain language of the statute, as supported by the discussion on the floor of the Senate and the legislative history derived from the committee\u2019s 1995 report, we conclude that \u00a7 31-308 (b), with respect to the amendments by \u00a7 19 of P.A. 93-228, authorizes the commissioner to grant compensation for the loss or permanent partial disability of a scheduled body part or organ. It does not, however, provide the commissioner with discretion to award compensation for the loss or permanent partial disability of an unscheduled body part or organ.</p>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b829-7\">We next address the reserved questions as to whether \u00a7 31-308 (b), which contains a schedule of compensation for loss of or injury to enumerated body parts and organs that does not include skin, violates either the equal protection clauses or due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first of the Connecticut constitution. Specifically, regarding the equal protection claims, the plaintiff contends that the selection of organs and body parts for which compensation is available under the schedule contained in \u00a7 31-308 (b) is wholly arbitrary, capricious, and without rational basis. Regarding the due process claims, the plaintiff contends that by denying compensation for injury to the skin, an unscheduled organ, the statute unreasonably bars the common-law cause of action against the defendant that the plaintiff would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>have had but for its exclusion by the workers\u2019 compensation statutes. We answer the equal protection portions of both reserved questions in the negative, and we decline to address the due process portions under either the state or federal constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">We turn first to the plaintiffs contention that \u00a7 31-308 (b), which does not provide compensation for permanent partial disability of the skin, violates the equal protection clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The plaintiff maintains that there is no rational basis for denying compensation to an injured employee who suffers from a permanent partial disability of the skin, while granting compensation to injured employees who suffer from the loss or permanent partial disability of a scheduled body part or organ. We reject this claim under both the state and federal constitutions.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b831-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>\u201cWe note at the outset that the challenge of a statute on constitutional grounds always imposes a difficult burden on the challenger. We have consistently held that every statute is presumed to be constitutional and have required that invalidity be established beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Faraci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>211 Conn. 166, 168, 558 A.2d 234 (1989); <em>Peck </em>v. <em>Jacquemin, </em>196 Conn. 53, 64, 491 A.2d 1043 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">\u201cIn order to analyze the constitutionality of [the challenged statutory scheme], we must first detail the principles applicable to equal protection analysis. When a statute is challenged on equal protection grounds, whether under the United States constitution or the Connecticut constitution, the reviewing court must first determine the standard by which the challenged statute\u2019s constitutional validity will be determined. If, in distinguishing between classes, the statute either intrudes on the exercise of a fundamental right or burdens a suspect class of persons, the court will apply a strict scrutiny standard wherein the state must demonstrate that the challenged statute is necessary to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>achievement of a compelling state interest. ... If the statute does not touch upon either a fundamental right or a suspect class, its classification need only be rationally related to some legitimate government purpose in order to withstand an equal protection challenge.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 143, quoting <em>Flo-restal </em>v. <em>Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>236 Conn. 299, 314, 673 A.2d 474 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">Because neither a fundamental right nor a suspect class is at issue in the present case, the rational basis test is the appropriate standard for determining the constitutionality of the classification, which grants compensation for the loss or permanent partial disability of scheduled body parts and organs, but denies compensation for a permanent partial disability of the skin. The court\u2019s function under the rational basis test \u201cis to decide whether the classification and disparate treatment inherent in a statute bear a rational relationship to a legitimate state end and are based on reasons related to the accomplishment of that goal.\u201d <em>Zapata </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>207 Conn. 496, 507, 542 A.2d 700 (1988); <em>Daily </em>v. <em>New Britain Machine Co., </em>200 Conn. 562, 577, 512 A.2d 893 (1986). \u201cIn general, the Equal Protection Clause is satisfied so long as there is a plausible policy reason for the classification, see <em>United States Railroad Retirement [Board] </em>v. <em>Fritz, </em>449 U.S. 166, 174, 179 [101 S. Ct. 453, 66 L. Ed. 2d 368 (1980), reh. denied, 450 U.S. 960, 101 S. Ct. 1421, 67 L. Ed. 2d 385 (1981)], the legislative facts on which the classification is apparently based rationally may have been considered to be true by the government decisionmaker, see <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 464 [101 S. Ct. 715, 66 L. Ed. 2d 659, reh. denied, 450 U.S. 1027, 101 S. Ct. 1735, 68 L. Ed. 2d 222 (1981)], and the relationship of the classification to its goal is not so attenuated as to render the distinction arbitrary or irrational, see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>Cleburne v.

Co., </em>supra, 236 Conn. 314-15.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">We begin our analysis by reviewing the legislative history relevant to the passage of P.A. 93-228 to determine whether the legislative decision to include certain body parts and organs in the schedule, while barring compensation for permanent partial disability of the skin, was rational. Our first step is to determine what goals the legislature sought to achieve. Central to the reforms enacted pursuant to P.A. 93-228 was an intent to reduce the rising costs of the workers\u2019 compensation system. This intent is evident in the debate on the floors of both the House of Representatives and the Senate; see, e.g., 36 H.R. Proc., Pt. 18,1993 Sess., pp. 6145, 6188, 6213-14; 36 S. Proc., supra, pp. 3846, 3851-52, 3878; as well as in a 1991 report by the committee, which preceded both the 1991 and 1993 reforms. The committee concluded that \u201cbenefit costs [were] rapidly escalating, with little response from the system to contain them.\u201d Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Workers\u2019 Compensation in Connecticut (1991) p. i. The committee also concluded that \u201c[t]he largest portion [of claims filed, other than medical only], slightly over 50 percent, [go] to workers who suffer a permanent partial loss of a body part or function.\u201d Id., p. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">In the realm of permanent partial disability compensation, the means of achieving the intended cost reduction was twofold. The committee\u2019s 1995 report on the impact of the 1991 and 1993 reforms, referred to in part I of this opinion, explained that \u201c[although the goal of the indemnity changes in both the 1991 and 1993 public acts was the same \u2014 to cut costs \u2014 the focus was slightly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>different. Public Act 91-339 sought to cut costs primarily by reducing a claimant\u2019s weekly compensation rate .... The second component, duration, was the focus of the cost cutting strategy employed under Public Act 93-228. It should be noted that the indemnity provisions in P.A. 91-339 and 93-228 were not limited exclusively to changes in the rate or duration components of the formulas. The two acts also included changes in what was covered or considered a compensable claim under the state workers\u2019 compensation law.\u201d Legislative Program Review and Investigations Committee, Workers\u2019 Compensation: Impact of the 1991 and 1993 Reforms (1995) p. 59. It is the second area of change, altering what constitutes a compensable claim, that is the focus of the constitutional question in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">The plaintiff argues that the process by which previously unscheduled body parts and organs became scheduled was arbitrary. As evidence of the arbitrary nature of the process, he claims that the present schedule was derived by adding to the already existing schedule one commissioner\u2019s personal copy of a list of durational terms for certain unscheduled body parts and organs. According to the plaintiff, when the commissioners formerly had discretion to compensate for unscheduled injuries, each commissioner had a copy of a standard list of durational norms for common unscheduled body parts and organs, and some commissioners added additional norms to their own copies according to what arose in the course of their cases. The lack of rationality, the plaintiff contends, stems from the fact that another commissioner\u2019s copy of the list might have included some different body parts and organs that, by virtue of this selection process, were not included in the schedule. We find nothing in the legislative history to confirm the plaintiffs description of how the additions to the schedule were selected.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b835-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>Nevertheless, even if we were to assume, arguendo, that the plaintiff is correct about the derivation of the present schedule, such a scenario would not result in a determination that \u00a7 31-308 (b) is unconstitutionally arbitrary. Like the United States Supreme Court, \u201cwe have consistently deferred to legislative determinations concerning the desirability of statutory classifications affecting the regulation of economic activity and the distribution of economic benefits.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faraci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 211 Conn. 169, quoting <em>Idaho Dept. of Employment </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>434 U.S. 100, 101, 98 S. Ct. 327, 54 L. Ed. 2d 324 (1977). We have observed that \u201cequal protection is not a license for courts to judge the wisdom, fairness, or logic of legislative choices. In areas of social and economic policy, a statutory classification that neither proceeds along suspect lines nor infringes fundamental constitutional rights must be upheld against equal protection challenge if there is any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification. <em>D.A. Pincus &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Meehan, </em>235 Conn. 865, 879, 670 A.2d 1278 (1996), quoting <em>Federal Communications Commission </em>v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc., </em>508 U.S. 307, 313, 113 S. Ct. 2096, 124 L. Ed. 2d 211 (1993).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 144. \u201cThe test ... is whether this court can <em>conceive </em>of a rational basis for sustaining the legislation; we need not have evidence that the legislature actually acted upon that basis.\u201d (Emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>in original.) <em>Faraci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 169 n.2; see also <em>United Illuminating Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>179 Conn. 627, 642, 427 A.2d 830, appeal dismissed, 449 U.S. 801, 101 S. Ct. 45, 66 L. Ed. 2d 5 (1980). Further, \u201cthe Equal Protection Clause does not demand for purposes of rational-basis review that a legislature or governing decisionmaker actually articulate at any time the purpose or rationale supporting its classification.\u201d <em>Nordlinger </em>v. <em>Hahn, </em>supra, 505 U.S. 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">We have no difficulty in ascertaining a rational justification for constructing a statute such that the loss or permanent partial disability of many organs and body parts is compensable, but the permanent partial disability of the skin is not. First, the legislature has a legitimate interest in reducing the costs of the workers\u2019 compensation system. To further this interest, the legislature reasonably could decide to restructure the permanent partial disability portion of its workers\u2019 compensation scheme so that it carries a share of the burden of that cost reduction, by reducing the compensation paid out for permanent partial disability. At the same time, the legislature need not choose between compensating either for the loss or permanent partial disability of every body part and organ, or none at all, in order for \u00a7 31-308 (b) to remain constitutionally sound. \u201cAs the United States Supreme Court has reminded us, a state, consistent with the equal protection clause, may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind. . . . The legislature may select one phase of one field and apply a remedy there, neglecting the others. . . . Particularly with respect to social welfare programs, so long, as the line drawn by the State is rationally supportable, the courts will not interpose their judgment as to the appropriate stopping point. [T]he Equal Protection Clause does not require that a State must choose between attacking every <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>aspect of a problem or not attacking the problem at all.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Faraci </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>supra, 211 Conn. 172-73, quoting <em>Geduldig </em>v. <em>Aiello, </em>417 U.S. 484, 495, 94 S. Ct. 2485, 41 L. Ed. 2d 256 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Accordingly, it is rational that the legislature would seek to ensure that, with the elimination of subsection (c) of General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308, certain formerly unscheduled body parts and organs nevertheless remain compensable, a goal that would make additions to the schedule a necessity. To determine which unscheduled body parts and organs commonly were compensated under subsection (c), the legislature legitimately could have looked for guidance to an experienced commissioner\u2019s list of durational norms for unscheduled losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Moreover, the current subsection (c) of \u00a7 31-308 already provides a system of compensation for certain types of injury to the skin, specifically scarring and disfigurement on the face, head or neck.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In determining which unscheduled losses should become scheduled, it would be rational, therefore, for the legislature to have excluded skin generically in light of the existing coverage for scarring and disfigurement. That there may be other legitimate or more comprehensive means of crafting a revised compensation schedule is irrelevant to this analysis. Neither the state nor the federal constitution requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 31-308 (b), with respect to the amendment by P.A. 93-228, does not violate the equal protection clauses of either the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution or article first, \u00a7 20, of the Connecticut constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">We turn briefly to the question of whether \u00a7 31-308 (b) violates the due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiff contends that \u201csince he can receive no permanent partial disability benefits for the loss of use of his skin, he was unreasonably deprived of his common-law remedy against his employer for compensation for the permanent damage to his skin, in violation of the due process provisions of the state.\u201d We decline to reach the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-308 (b) on either state or federal due process grounds, however, because the plaintiff has not provided sufficient argument in support of such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\u201cWe have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the [plaintiff] has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>227 Conn. 711, 721, 631 A.2d 288 (1993); see also <em>Luce </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>supra, 247 Conn. 142 n.22; <em>State </em>v. <em>Crespo, </em>246 Conn. 665, 685 n.15, 718 A.2d 925 (1998), and cases cited therein. Further, where the plaintiff asserts a constitutional violation on both federal and state due process grounds \u201cwithout developing his argument either in his brief or at oral argument, we deem his due process claims to be abandoned. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>194 Conn. 52, 66 n.12, 480 A.2d 425 (1984); <em>Rodriguez </em>v. <em>Mallory Battery Co., </em>188 Conn. 145, 149, 448 A.2d 829 (1982).\u201d <em>Ganim </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>204 Conn. 760, 765 n.5, 529 A.2d 194 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>In the present case, the plaintiff refers generally to \u201cthe due process provisions\u201d of the state constitution, but fails to provide any analysis at all of due process protection under the state constitution. Similarly, although the reserved questions specifically reference the constitutionality of \u00a7 31-308 (b) under the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution, the plaintiff does not provide an analysis of this federal constitutional claim. We deem the plaintiff, therefore, to have abandoned the claims that \u00a7 31-308 (b) is violative of the due process provisions of either the federal or the state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The reserved questions are answered \u201cno\u201d to the extent that they address whether \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprives the plaintiff of equal protection under either the state or the federal constitution; the reserved questions are not answered to the extent that they address whether \u00a7 31-308 (b) deprives the plaintiff of due process of law under either the state or the federal constitution; and the case is remanded to the board with direction to affirm the decision of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">No costs will be taxed to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">In this opinion CALLAHAN, C.

If you have the following injuries, okay, we\u2019re going to give you compensation for those injuries. If you don\u2019t happen to have those injuries, well, the bill says or the bill doesn\u2019t say and there is no direction in the bill as to how to handle that.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">\u201cWell, you look through that list and at first you think, boy, that\u2019s a pretty comprehensive list, everything must be covered. Well, look a little further. One that was pointed out in the discussions we have is you could be working at a machine and you could be eviscerated by the machine. You could have your guts torn out by the machine. Where is that in the schedule? Nowhere. There is no injury in the schedule that deals with that.\u201d 36 S.

The plaintiffs reliance on this proposition is somewhat misplaced, however, and we take this opportunity to clarify the proper reading of our statement in <em>Daily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b830-10\"><em>Daily </em>must be understood in the context in which it was decided. The plaintiff in that case did not argue for greater protection under the state equal protection provision than under its federal counterpart and, accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>did not address any such issue. Our statement in <em>Daily </em>should not be read to suggest that the state equal protection provision can <em>never </em>have an independent meaning from the equal protection provision in the federal constitution: the question simply was not before us at that time. We further note that it was not until six years later that we decided <em>State </em>v. <em>Geisler, </em>222 Conn. 672, 684-85, 610 A.2d 1225 (1992), and outlined the tools properly to be applied in the course of an independent analysis of state constitutional provisions. In the wake of <em>Geisler, </em>the ingredients necessary for an independent state constitutional analysis are clear, as is the fact that \u201c \u2018in some instances . . . the protections afforded to the citizens of this state by our own constitution go beyond those provided by the federal constitution ....\u201d\u2019 Id., 684; see, e.g., <em>State </em>v. <em>Morales, </em>232 Conn. 707, 717, 657 A.2d 585 (1995) (due process). If a party does not provide an independent analysis asserting the existence of greater protection under the state constitutional provision than its federal counterpart, however, we will not of our own initiative address that question. With regard to the reserved questions before us, the plaintiff made no argument supporting an independent meaning under the state constitution. Accordingly, the federal equal protection standard is considered prevailing for the purposes of our review of both the state and federal equal protection claims in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b834-6\"> What does exist to shed light on the legitimacy of the selection process is found in appendix C to the committee\u2019s 1991 report.

I join the majority\u2019s essential holding that a worker who has suffered a permanent and grievous injury to his skin is entitled to compensation for this injury pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308, as amended by No. 93-228, \u00a7 19, of the 1993 Public Acts (P.A. 93-228).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>1 write separately for three reasons: (1) to set forth my understanding of why the plaintiffs injury is compensable; (2) to explain my view that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>contrary result would violate the equal protection clause of our state constitution; and (3) to express my disagreement with the remand that the majority has ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">I shall begin by briefly summarizing the pertinent facts. The plaintiff, Thomas F. Barton, was severely burned on his face, hands, arms and torso in a propane fire that erupted while he was working at the bottom of a manhole. The workers\u2019 compensation commissioner (commissioner) found that, as a result of these bums, the plaintiff will suffer for the rest of his life from \u201ccontinual lesions on his skin, particularly his face and his hands, in the form of pustules, eruptions and blackheads, requiring the daily application of creams and emollients, and [he] must avoid any exposure to sun because of the damaged nature of his facial skin; he must wear sunblock when he is required to be out of doors even minimally.\u201d In short, the injury to the plaintiffs skin \u2014 an essential bodily organ \u2014 has left him seriously and permanently disabled.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">Notwithstanding his express finding that the plaintiff sustained serious and permanent injuries to his skin, the commissioner nevertheless declined to compensate the plaintiff for these injuries. Citing the fact that skin qua skin is not specifically enumerated in the statutory schedule of compensable injuries set forth in \u00a7 31-308, the commissioner inferred that he did not have subject matter jurisdiction to compensate the plaintiff for his skin injuries. The plaintiff appealed from this ruling to the workers\u2019 compensation board (board), which, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-324, reserved two questions for the opinion of the Appellate Court: (1) whether \u00a7 31-308 violates the equal protection clause of our state constitution;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (2) whether \u00a7 31-308 violates <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>the equal protection clause of the federal constitution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We transferred the reservation from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c). The majority of this court holds today that the plaintiffs skin injuries are compen-sable, and that the commissioner therefore had subject matter jurisdiction. I join this holding. Inexplicably, the majority nevertheless affirms the commissioner\u2019s jurisdictional ruling. It is this aspect of the majority opinion from which I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">The questions reserved by the board assume that the plaintiffs skin injuries are not compensable under \u00a7 31-308 (b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Every member of this panel rejects this assumption, and for good reason: the legislature could not possibly have intended to provide nine weeks of compensation for the loss of a pinky toe, but no compensation whatsoever for the grievous disability with which the plaintiff is afflicted. As the majority succinctly puts it, \u201can injured employee [may] receive compensation for injury to an unscheduled body part or organ ... to the extent that the injury relate[s] to the loss of or loss of use of a scheduled body part or member, because such injury always [is] compensable as it pertain[s] to a scheduled body part or member.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">Accordingly, I agree with my colleagues in the majority that the commissioner should have subsumed the plaintiffs serious injury to his skin \u2014 which does not appear in the statutory schedule \u2014 into the framework provided by the list of anatomical regions that are explicitly scheduled. So, for example, the commissioner should have subsumed the plaintiffs injury to the skin covering his hands into the schedule for \u201chand.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>legislative history supplies ironclad support for this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The defendants observe that, by adopting P.A. 93-228, the legislature deleted former \u00a7 31-308 (c), which specifically authorized the commissioner to award compensation for injuries that were not listed in the statutory schedule.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In addition, the defendants correctly point out that skin qua skin is absent from the statutory schedule. If this deletion and this absence were the only evidence in the record before us, then there might be some merit to the defendants\u2019 argument that the legislature intended to eliminate the commissioner\u2019s authority to compensate claimants for unscheduled injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-6\">These items are not, however, the only evidence of legislative intent. In fact, affirmative statements contained in the legislative history provide conclusive support for our view that the commissioner had the power to award compensation for the plaintiffs skin injuries. Senator Michael P. Meotti made the following remarks: \u201cI want to rise briefly on two specific points that I think are important to clarify in this debate. First, for purposes of explaining my intent and my sense of <em>what should be in the legislative history, </em>the issue has been raised ... of specific types of injuries that do not appear to be mentioned in the schedule, evisceration and you know, intestinal loss or damage or whatever, and I discussed that specific [issue] with representatives of the [National Council of Compensation Insurers] who were the people that I think all parties in this debate have gone to for . . . guidance on the issues and I would say that it is their opinion that based on existing practice in Connecticut and throughout the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>country that this particular example and other attempts to try to find particular injuries like this and say that they are not covered under this language <em>would not in fact be correct, that the commissioners would have the discretion to find injuries of that sort to be subsumed within other descriptions within that schedule </em>such as stomach. I offer that <em>... to make the legislative history, </em>that that is my view of how this is written <em>in order to fully protect workers and injuries on the job.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 36 S. Proc., Pt. 11, 1993 Sess., pp. 3879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">We accord substantial weight to the words of Senator Meotti, for two reasons: (1) he was the principal sponsor of P.A. 93-228, the act that revised the statutory scheme relevant to this appeal; and (2) he intended his comments \u201cto make the legislative history\u201d upon which courts would subsequently rely. Id., p. 3880. His statements make it crystal clear that the legislature did not intend to deny compensation for injuries to the skin, such as those that the plaintiff has suffered. Instead, as Senator Meotti explained, the legislature intended for the commissioner to \u201csubsume\u201d such unscheduled injuries into the statutory schedule.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Id. The defendants\u2019 interpretation of the statute eviscerates this intention. Furthermore, as I discuss in part II of this concurring and dissenting opinion, the defendants\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 31-308 would render the statutory scheme for workers\u2019 compensation unconstitutional under our state constitution.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">I agree with the majority that the plaintiff failed to argue that our state equal protection clause provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>more protection than its federal counterpart. I do not, however, agree with the majority\u2019s statement that \u201cwe [should] not of our own initiative address that question.\u201d The board reserved the questions before us pursuant to \u00a7 31-324.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This means that the board was \u201cof the opinion that the [issue] involves principles of law which are not free from reasonable doubt and which [the] public interest requires shall be determined by [an appellate court], in order that a definite rule be established applicable to future cases . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-324. Accordingly, it is not necessary to address the question of our own initiative; the initiative was taken by the board. Moreover, the board framed two separate questions, one limited exclusively to the state constitution,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the other limited exclusively to the federal constitution.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In short, the majority decides not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>to consider the contours of our state equal protection clause, notwithstanding the fact that the board has (1) determined that the public interest requires us to reach the issue and (2) scrupulously reserved the question for our judgment. I disagree with this decision. Furthermore, for the reasons discussed below, I believe that we cannot construe \u00a7 31-308 in a comprehensive and principled manner unless we consider the constitutional implications of the defendants\u2019 interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Turning to the merits of the issue that the majority fails to consider, it is fundamental that \u201c[f]edera! law, whether based upon statute or constitution, establishes a minimum national standard for the exercise of . . . rights and does not inhibit state governments from affording higher levels of protection for such rights.\u201d <em>Cologne </em>v. <em>Westfarms Associates, </em>192 Conn. 48, 57, 469 A.2d 1201 (1984). Our state equal protection clause is much more expansive than its federal counterpart. See, e.g., E. Peters, \u201cCapacity and Respect: A Perspective on the Historic Role of the State Courts in the Federal System,\u201d 73 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1065, 1067-68 (1998) (\u201c[I]t should be old news that state constitutions contain some provisions for which there are no federal counterparts. . . . Over the years, our state constitution has been amended to include an equal protection clause that is especially capacious. . . . [T]hese <em>distinctive state constitutional rights </em>furnished the underpinnings for our recent school desegregation case, <em>Sheff </em>v. <em>O\u2019Neill </em>[238 Conn. 1, 678 A.2d 1267 (1996)].\u201d [Emphasis added.]). The state equal protection clause provides in pertinent part that \u201c[n]o person shall be denied the equal protection of the law nor be subjected to segregation or discrimination . . . because of . . . physical . . . disability.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Conn. Const., amend. XXI. This specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"828\">*828</page-number>proscription against discrimination along the vector of physical disability triggers strict scrutiny in the present appeal.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It is apparent that the decision to compensate an employee who loses a pinky toe but not an employee who suffers a grievous injury to his skin cannot survive the rigors of strict scrutiny. More specifically, it cannot be \u201cjustified ... by a compelling state interest.\u201d <em>Keogh </em>v. <em>Bridgeport, </em>187 Conn. 53, 66, 444 A.2d 225 (1982). Not even the fanciful imagination of Dr. Seuss could conjure up a rationale that could satisfy this stringent test on the facts of the present appeal. My colleagues in the majority do not dispute this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"829\">*829</page-number>Accordingly, if the defendant were correct that the plaintiffs skin injuries are not compensable under \u00a7 31-308, then the statute would violate the unique equal protection clause of our state constitution. It is fundamental, however, that this court reads statutes \u201cso as to avoid, rather than to create, constitutional questions.\u201d <em>In re Valerie D., 223 </em>Conn. 492, 534, 613 A.2d 748 (1992). More specifically, \u201c[i]n choosing between two statutory constructions, one valid and one constitutionally precarious, we will search for an effective and constitutional construction that reasonably accords with the legislature\u2019s underlying intent.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>In re Baby Girl B., </em>224 Conn. 263, 286, 618 A.2d 1 (1992). \u201c[I]f literal construction of a statute raises serious constitutional questions, we are obligated to search for a construction that will accomplish the legislature\u2019s purpose without risking the statute\u2019s invalidity.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Worsham </em>v. <em>Greifenberger, </em>242 Conn. 432,443, 698 A.2d 867 (1997). As I discussed in part I of this concurring and dissenting opinion, the legislature intended \u201cto fully protect workers and injuries on the job.\u201d 36 S. Proc., supra, p. 3880, remarks of Senator Meotti. Because the defendant\u2019s argument is constitutionally \u201cprecarious,\u201d we must prefer a reasonable construction of \u00a7 31-308 that facilitates, rather than frustrates, the intention of the legislature. In short, well settled principles of statutory construction compel us to adopt the understanding of \u00a7 31-308 that I set forth in part I of this concurrence and dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">I wish to reiterate with unambiguous clarity that every member of this panel agrees on the following proposition: the plaintiffs grievous skin injuries are compensable, even though skin qua skin is not specifically enumerated in the statutory schedule.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"830\">*830</page-number>That said, we are not without our differences. The majority assumes that the commissioner compensated the plaintiff for \u201ca portion\u201d of the injuries that he suffered to the skin covering his hands. The majority cannot point to any evidence in the record that might justify our indulgence of this assumption. In fact, the majority acknowledges that \u201cthe commissioner denied compensation on the grounds that [he] lacked jurisdiction to award compensation for [an injury to the skin] . . . .\u201d I cannot comprehend the process by which the majority extracts from this denial the proposition that the commissioner compensated the plaintiff for \u201ca portion\u201d of the injury to his skin.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s assumption cannot survive the fact that the commissioner\u2019s award does not reflect the lion\u2019s share of the injuries that the plaintiff suffered. More specifically, the majority cannot explain why the commissioner would have compensated the plaintiff for the injury to the skin covering both of his hands but not for the injury to the skin covering his arms, his back, his stomach, his rib cage, his nose, or his jaw (all of which are expressly enumerated in the statutory schedule).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">For these reasons, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to affirm the commissioner\u2019s award. Although I join the majority\u2019s determination that the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for his grievous skin injuries\u2014 notwithstanding the fact that skin qua skin does not appear in the statutory schedule \u2014 I do not agree that he has already received such compensation. In my view, therefore, we must remand this case to the commissioner so that he may recalibrate his award in the wake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"831\">*831</page-number>of our holding that unscheduled injuries must be subsumed within the compensation structure for scheduled body parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Accordingly, I concur in part and dissent in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\"> See footnote 9 of the majority opinion for the text of P.A. 93-228, \u00a7 19 (b), now codified at General Statutes \u00a7 31-308 (b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b840-7\"> See footnote 10 of this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b841-7\"> See footnote 11 of this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b841-8\"><em> </em>See footnotes 10 and 11 of this concurring and dissenting opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b841-9\"> Likewise, the commissioner should have subsumed the plaintiffs injury to the skin covering his arms into the schedule for \u201carm,\u201d and so forth.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b842-7\"> General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-308 (c) provided in pertinent part: \u201c(T]he commissioner may award compensation as he deems just for the loss or loss of use of the function of any organ or part of the body not otherwise provided for in this section . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b843-8\"> If any members of the legislature had wished to refute the plain meaning of Senator Meotti\u2019s representation of \u201cwhat should be in the legislative history,\u201d they knew very well how to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b843-9\"> I do not advance my constitutional discussion as an exhaustive analysis.
