J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7c\">The principal issue in this appeal is whether Public Acts 1996, No. 96-241 (P.A. 96-241),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>provides the named defendant, the commission on human rights and opportunities (commission), with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing on a complaint brought to the commission by the defendant, Susan Hyde, against the plaintiff, Angelsea Productions, Inc. We conclude that P.A. 96-241 does provide the commission with jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. Hyde was employed by the plaintiff from September, 1990, until her resignation on January 29, 1991. In April, 1991, Hyde filed a complaint with the commission pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleging various discriminatory acts by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">On March 3, 1993, the plaintiff moved to dismiss Hyde\u2019s complaint on the ground that the commission had not concluded its investigation within nine months of the filing of the complaint as required by General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-83 (b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On March 17,1993, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>without ruling on the plaintiffs motion to dismiss Hyde\u2019s complaint, the commission issued a reasonable cause finding in favor of Hyde. Thereafter, on June 15, 1993, the commission denied the plaintiffs motion to dismiss its investigation of Hyde\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">On October 4, 1993, more than six months after its reasonable cause finding, the commission, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 46a-84 (b),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> appointed a hearing officer to adjudicate Hyde\u2019s claim against the plaintiff. On November 29,1993, citing the commission\u2019s failure to comply not only with the nine month deadline set forth in \u00a7 46a-83 (b), but also with the requirement set forth in \u00a7 46a-84 (b) that the commission hold a hearing within ninety days of issuing a reasonable cause finding, the plaintiff filed a motion seeking to have the hearing officer dismiss Hyde\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">On November 29, 1993, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the plaintiff also instituted a proceeding before the commission seeking to have the commission issue a declaratory ruling as to whether the time limitations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) were mandatory and required the dismissal of: (1) complaints not investigated within nine months of the date of filing; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>and (2) complaints not brought to a hearing within ninety days of the date of issuance of a finding of reasonable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">On January 4, 1994, the hearing officer denied the plaintiffs motion to dismiss Hyde\u2019s complaint for lack of jurisdiction. On March 22, 1994, the commission issued a declaratory ruling in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 4-176 (e).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In that ruling, the commission concluded that: (1) the time limitations of \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) were directory and not mandatory; (2) the commission\u2019s failure to comply with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) had not divested the commission of jurisdiction over Hyde\u2019s complaint; and (3) the public hearing on her complaint should continue until a final decision had been issued by the hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Thereafter, the plaintiff brought an administrative appeal from the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 4-176 (h) and 4-183.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In its administrative appeal, the plaintiff sought: (1) a declaratory ruling that failure to comply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) deprived the commission of jurisdiction to proceed with the public hearing process; and (2) an injunction prohibiting the commission from proceeding with the public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">At the request of the parties and to expedite resolution of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, the trial court reserved the following four questions for consideration by the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-235 and Practice Book \u00a7 4147, now \u00a7 73-1: (1) \u201cIs the time limit for investigating a complaint set forth in [\u00a7 46a-83 (b)] mandatory?\u201d; (2) \u201cIf the [commission] fails to make a reasonable cause determination within nine months from the date of filing a complaint, as set forth in [\u00a7 46a-83 (b)], must the [commission] dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?\u201d; (3) \u201cIs the time limit for holding a public hearing set forth in [\u00a7 46a-84 (b)] mandatory?\u201d; and (4) \u201cIf the [commission] fails to hold a public hearing within [ninety] days after a finding of reasonable cause, as set forth in [\u00a7 46a-84 (b)], must the [commission] dismiss the complaint for lack of jurisdiction?\u201d We transferred the reservation from the Appellate Court to this court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c) and Practice Book \u00a7 4023, now \u00a7 65-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>In <em>Angelsea Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commission on Human Rights &amp; Opportunities, </em>236 Conn. 681, 674 A.2d 1300 (1996) <em>(Angelsea I), </em>we answered all four of the reserved questions in the affirmative. Specifically, we concluded that the time deadlines set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) were mandatory, not discretionary, and that upon failure to comply with those time limits, the commission was required to dismiss the underlying complaint for lack of jurisdiction. Id., 700. Our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>was released on April 23, 1996, and on May 3, 1996, the defendants filed a timely motion for reargument.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">While the defendants\u2019 motion for reargument in <em>Angelsea I </em>was pending before this court, the legislature enacted P.A. 96-241. Public Act 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), which is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82b (a), provides, with respect to complaints pending before the commission, that \u201c [notwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities shall have jurisdiction over any complaint filed pursuant to section 46a-82 of the general statutes on or before January 1, 1996, which has not been finally adjudicated or resolved by action of the commission, that the commission would have had jurisdiction over but for the failure of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities to comply with the time requirements of chapter 814c of the general statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Regarding complaints in which an appeal had been taken from a decision rendered by the commission, P. A. 96-241, \u00a7 3 (a), which is codified at General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82d (a), similarly provides in relevant part: \u201cAny action filed pursuant to section . . . 4-183 of the general statutes concerning a complaint filed pursuant to section 46a-82 of the general statutes on or before January 1, 1996, in which a final judgment has not been entered prior [to June 6, 1996], otherwise valid except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>for the failure of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities to comply with the time requirements of chapter 814c of the general statutes is validated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">With respect to complaints that had been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction for failure to comply with the time deadlines, P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 3 (b), which is codified at \u00a7 46a-82d (b), provides: \u201cIf any action filed pursuant to section 46a-94a, 46a-95 or 4-183 of the general statutes concerning a complaint filed pursuant to section 46a-82 of the general statutes on or before January 1, 1996, has failed to be tried on its merits because the action has been dismissed by the Superior Court for want of jurisdiction due to the failure of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities to comply with the time requirements of chapter 814c of the general statutes, a party to the action may, on or before October 1, 1996, petition the court to reopen such action. The court shall set aside the judgment and reinstate the case on the docket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">Public Act 96-241 took effect on June 6, 1996. On that same date, we denied the defendants\u2019 motion for reargument in <em>Angelsea I. </em>On June 21,1996, contending that our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>required the trial court to sustain the plaintiffs administrative appeal from the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling, the plaintiff filed a motion requesting that the trial court render judgment in its favor and against the defendants. On July 8, 1996, before the trial court had ruled on the plaintiffs motion for judgment in its administrative appeal, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the appeal, arguing that P.A. 96-241 had rendered the appeal moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">On February 11, 1998, concluding that P.A. 96-241 gave the commission jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint, the trial court: (1) denied the plaintiffs motion for judgment; and (2) granted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the plaintiffs administrative appeal from the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling. The plaintiff appealed from the trial court\u2019s judgment of dismissal to the Appellate Court, and we transferred the appeal to this court pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 65-1 and General Statutes \u00a7 51-199 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">On appeal, the plaintiff argues that the trial court\u2019s granting of judgment in favor of the defendants was improper because P.A. 96-241 did not give the commission jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint, and, consequently, the commission\u2019s failure to comply with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) continued to deprive it of such jurisdiction. The plaintiff alternatively claims if P.A. 96-241 did provide the commission with jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint, P.A. 96-241 is unconstitutional because it abrogates the plaintiffs vested rights in the time limitations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b), and it violates the doctrine of separation of powers. We disagree with all three of the plaintiffs claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">The plaintiff first contends that the trial court improperly dismissed its administrative appeal from the commission\u2019s declaratory ruling. In the plaintiffs view, the fact that the trial court\u2019s reserved questions were answered adversely to the defendants by this court in <em>Angelsea I </em>on April 23, 1996, compels the conclusion that P.A. 96-241 does not bestow jurisdiction on the commission to proceed with a public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint because, after that date, her complaint was no longer pending. Although we agree that in the case of a question reserved to the Supreme Court, the trial court making the reservation must conform to our advice; General Statutes \u00a7 52-235 (b);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> we nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>conclude that Hyde\u2019s complaint still was pending after April 23, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">As previously noted, P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), which is codified at \u00a7 46a-82b (a), provides: \u201cNotwithstanding any provision of the general statutes to the contrary, the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities shall have jurisdiction over any complaint filed pursuant to section 46a-82 of the general statutes on or before January 1,1996, which has not <em>beenfinally adjudicated or resolved by action of the commission, </em>that the commission would have had jurisdiction over but for the failure of the Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities to comply with the time requirements of chapter 814c of the general statutes.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the effect of P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), was to provide the commission with jurisdiction over complaints filed prior to January 1, 1996, and still pending before the commission on June 6, 1996, the date on which P.A. 96-241 became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Hyde\u2019s complaint had not been resolved by the commission and was still pending on June 6, 1996. First, P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 5, as it amended \u00a7 46a-84 (b), requires that a hearing on a complaint filed with the commission be conducted \u201cin accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 4-180.\u201d Section 4-180 (c) provides in relevant part: \u201cA final decision in a contested case shall be in writing or orally stated on the record and, if adverse to a party, shall include the agency\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law necessary to its decision. . . . <em>The final decision shall be effective when personally delivered </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number><em>or mailed or on a later date specified by the </em>agency.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is undisputed that the hearing officer appointed to adjudicate Hyde\u2019s complaint did not render a decision dismissing her complaint on or before June 6, 1996, the effective date of P.A. 96-241.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">This court contemplated, moreover, more than a mere dismissal following our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>that the commission lacked jurisdiction to proceed with a hearing. We concluded that our determination that the commission\u2019s failure to comply with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) had divested it of jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing did not deprive Hyde of her constitutional due process rights because Hyde could bring a civil employment discrimination action against the plaintiff pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101 et seq.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Angelsea I, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 699. General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> provides in relevant part: <em>\u201cNo [civil] action may be brought . . </em>. unless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>the complainant has received a release from the commission in accordance with the provisions of this section. . . . The complainant . . . may request a release from the commission if his complaint with the commission is still pending after the expiration of two hundred ten days from the date of its filing. . . . <em>Upon granting a release, the commission shall dismiss or otherwise administratively dispose of the discriminatory practice complaint pending with the commission . . </em>. .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, we recognized in <em>Angelsea I </em>that, prior to dismissing Hyde\u2019s complaint, the commission still had authority to accept and act upon Hyde\u2019s request for a release to bring a civil employment discrimination action against the plaintiff, which she could not do without first requesting, and the commission granting, a release.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Moreover, our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>was released on April 23, 1996, and on May 3, 1996, the defendants filed a timely motion in this court for reargument. Practice Book \u00a7 71-6 provides: \u201cUnless the chief justice or chief judge shall otherwise direct, any stay of proceedings which was in effect during the pendency of the appeal shall continue until the time for filing a motion for reargument has expired, and, if a motion is filed, until ten days after its disposition, and, if it is granted, until the appeal is finally determined. If no stay of proceedings was in effect during the pendency of the appeal and the decision of the court having appellate jurisdiction would change the position of any party from its position during the pendency of the appeal, <em>allproceed-ings to enforce or carry out the decision of the court having appellate jurisdiction shall be stayed until the time for filing a motion for reargument has expired, and, if amotion is filed, until its disposition, </em>and, if it is granted, until the appeal is finally determined.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the hearing officer appointed to adjudicate Hyde\u2019s complaint lacked authority to render a final decision dismissing her complaint while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>defendants\u2019 motion for reargument in <em>Angelsea I </em>was pending before this court, i.e., until we denied the motion on June 6, 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><em>Further, as we have stated, Flyde can only bring a civil action against the plaintiff if she requests and, obtains a release from the commission. </em>General Statutes \u00a7 46a-101. We conclude that even though prior to June 6, 1996, the effective date of P.A. 96-241, the commission could not have proceeded with a public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint, her complaint had not been finally resolved by action of the commission on that date. Consequently, because Hyde\u2019s complaint was pending before the commission on June 6, 1996, the effective date of P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), the commission had jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing on and after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">We note, moreover, that our conclusion that P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), provides the commission with jurisdiction over Hyde\u2019s complaint accords with the spirit, as well as the letter, of P.A. 96-241. The act gives the commission jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing under three circumstances. First, \u00a7 1 (a) of the act provides the commission with jurisdiction over complaints that were filed before January 1,1996, and were still pending before the commission on June 6, 1996. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82b (a). Second, \u00a7 3 (a) of the act provides the commission with jurisdiction over complaints that were filed before January 1,1996, and were pending in the Superior Court on administrative appeal on June 6, 1996. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82d (a). Finally, \u00a7 3 (b) provides that complainants whose cases were dismissed by the Superior Court on the ground that the commission did not proceed in a timely manner may seek reinstatement of their appeals prior to October 1, 1996. See General Statutes \u00a7 46a-82d (b). Thus, by its terms, P.A. 96-241 evinces an intent to provide the commission with jurisdiction to proceed in <em>all </em>cases in which the commission had failed to meet the time deadlines imposed by \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The legislative history of House Bill No. 5518, which eventually was enacted as P.A. 96-241 and codified in relevant part at \u00a7\u00a7 46a-82b (a) and 46a-82d (a) and (b), also indicates unequivocally that the legislature intended that the commission have jurisdiction to proceed with respect to all complaints that had been filed prior to January 1, 1996, and in which the commission had failed to meet statutory deadlines. During the discussion of House Bill No. 5518 on the floor of the House of Representatives, Representative Richard D. Tulisano, a sponsor of the bill, remarked: \u201cAs a result [of <em>Angelsea I\\ </em>we have proposed this amendment today which does a number of things. It keeps jurisdiction within the commission over <em>any complaint filed . . . before January 1, 1996 </em>.... [I]t also says that anything that was in court which may be subject to being dismissed . . . will not be dismissed for failure to comply with the time limits required of the [commission]. And the third, in the event that there is some case dismissed before this bill is passed, it will have an automatic right of reopening and reentry on the docket.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 39 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1996 Sess., p. 5187. Thus, the legislative history of P.A. 96-241 clearly manifests an intention that the commission be provided with authority to proceed on <em>all </em>complaints in which it had not complied with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b). An application of P.A. 96-241, \u00a7 1 (a), that failed to provide the commission with jurisdiction to proceed with a public hearing on Hyde\u2019s complaint \u2014 a complaint that had not been fully resolved and that, therefore, still was pending on June 6, 1996\u2014 would contravene the clearly expressed intention of the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">The plaintiffs next claim is that P.A. 96-241 is unconstitutional because it deprives the plaintiff of due process by abrogating its \u201cvested rights\u201d in the time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>limitations set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b). In effect, the plaintiff maintains that, because the commission did not act within the statutory time limits, it has a constitutionally protected interest in having Hyde\u2019s employment discrimination claim adjudicated by a court, rather than by the commission. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">In <em>Angelsea I, </em>we concluded that although the commission\u2019s failure to comply with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (b) and 46a-84 (b) had deprived Hyde of an opportunity to litigate her employment discrimination claim before the commission, she had not been deprived of constitutional due process rights. Specifically, we concluded that, although Hyde had a constitutionally protected interest in an adequate and meaningful opportunity to have her case adjudicated, the statutes governing employment discrimination claims did not provide her a constitutionally protected interest in having her claim resolved in a particular forum, namely, in a hearing before the commission. <em>Angelsea I, </em>supra, 236 Conn. 699-700. Just as the statutes governing adjudication of employment discrimination claims do not provide Hyde with a constitutionally protected interest in litigating her claim in a particular forum, those statutes also do not provide the plaintiff with a constitutionally protected interest in having Hyde\u2019s claim resolved by a court, rather than by the commission.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">The existence of Hyde\u2019s substantive right of action against the plaintiff does not depend on compliance with the deadlines set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 46a-83 (a) and 46a-84 (b). Thus, we are not confronted with a situation in which, but for the enactment of P.A. 96-241, Hyde would have been barred irrevocably from obtaining the relief that she seeks from the plaintiff. See <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>Freedom of Information Commission, </em>201 Conn. 421, 426, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>518 A.2d 49 (1986) (defendant has constitutionally protected interest if, but for retroactive legislation, plaintiff would have been irrevocably barred from obtaining relief). Public Act 96-241 affects only the choice of forum for resolution of Hyde\u2019s employment discrimination claim. It does not affect the substantive rights giving rise to Hyde\u2019s claim or to the plaintiffs defense. Application of P.A. 96-241 to the present case, therefore, does not violate the plaintiffs constitutional due process rights to an adequate and meaningful opportunity to an adjudication of Hyde\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The plaintiffs final claim is that P.A. 96-241 is unconstitutional because it violates the doctrine of separation of powers. This claim is based entirely upon the proposition that our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>constituted a final judgment in the plaintiffs administrative appeal and, therefore, also constituted a final decision in the proceedings before the commission on Hyde\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">At oral argument, the plaintiff conceded that application of P.A. 96-241 to pending cases would not offend the doctrine of separation of powers. Because we have determined that our decision in <em>Angelsea I </em>did not resolve all of the parties\u2019 rights regarding Hyde\u2019s complaint and that her complaint was still pending before the commission on the date that P.A. 96-241 took effect, we do not address this claim.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-10\"> Public Acts 1996, No. 96-241, provides in relevant part: \u201cSection. 1.
