App. 591, 593-94, 696 A.2d 1310 (1997). The Appellate Court agreed with the defendant concerning the request for an instruction on lesser included offenses and reversed the judgment of the trial court on the assault count and remanded the case for a new trial on that charge. Id., 594. The Appellate Court further concluded that the defense of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut; id., 601; and that the trial court had not abused its discretion in precluding the defendant from introducing into evidence certain of the victim\u2019s prior convictions in order to establish the victim\u2019s violent character. Id., 605. We granted the defendant\u2019s petition for certification limited to these issues; <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>243 Conn. 902, 701 A.2d 334 (1997); and now affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The Appellate Court opinion sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \u201cThe victim, Michael Juarbe, and the defendant\u2019s wife, Carmen Rodriguez, had a five year relationship that ended in January, 1991. The defendant\u2019s wife had one daughter from this relationship with the victim. The victim had visitation rights with this daughter. In the summer of 1991, the defendant married Rodriguez. The defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and the victim had several confrontations leading up to April, 1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">\u201cOn April 7,1992, the defendant drove to the victim\u2019s New Haven apartment at approximately 10 p.m. Upon arriving at the victim\u2019s apartment, the defendant rang the doorbell located at the back door of the victim\u2019s premises. When the victim looked out his window, the defendant yelled to him to come out of the house to talk. The victim dressed and went to the front lawn of the apartment; where he found the defendant standing on the sidewalk. The victim noticed that the defendant\u2019s car was parked in front of the premises and two men were sitting inside the vehicle. The victim and the defendant began to argue about the victim\u2019s visitation rights with his daughter and about telephone calls that were made by the victim to the defendant\u2019s home. The defendant eventually sat in the front passenger seat of his car. From that location, the defendant pulled a loaded revolver from under the car\u2019s seat and fired approximately five shots at the victim from a distance of six to nine feet. The victim was struck by four of the bullets and sustained serious injuries. After shooting the victim, the defendant and his two companions drove away in the defendant\u2019s car.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">The defendant first claims that the Appellate Court was incorrect when it affirmed the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury on his theory of \u201cimperfect self-defense.\u201d According to that theory, if the jury found that the defendant had an honest but unreasonably held belief in the need to use deadly force, it could find that he acted with the requisite specific intent corresponding to the greater offense, but also could mitigate the defendant\u2019s guilt downward to an offense that would be consistent with a less culpable mental state. Specifically, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the defendant argues that the Appellate Court erroneously concluded that the defense of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As support for this contention, the defendant claims that, in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981), and <em>State </em>v. Knighton, 7 Conn. App. 223, 508 A.2d 772 (1986), both this court and the Appellate Court implicitly have sanctioned the use of the imperfect self-defense doctrine as a theory of defense, so as to mitigate intentional conduct to the less culpable mental state of recklessness. As a result, the defendant argues that the court should have instructed the jury on an imperfect self-defense theory of defense, by which, if the defendant had an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to use deadly force, his culpability would be reduced from an intentional to a reckless mental state, thus rendering him guilty only of a lesser offense. We conclude that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut and, therefore, was not available to the defendant. Accordingly, we affirm that portion of the decision of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">We begin our review by setting out the differences between the doctrine of imperfect self-defense and an instruction on lesser included offenses. It is well settled that a defendant is entitled, under certain circumstances, to a jury instruction on lesser included offenses. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980), we constructed a four prong test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>whereby \u201c[a] defendant is entitled to an instruction on a lesser offense if, and only if, the following conditions are met: (1) an appropriate instruction is requested by either the state or the defendant; (2) it is not possible to commit the greater offense, in the manner described in the information or bill of particulars, without having first committed the lesser; (3) there is some evidence, introduced by either the state or the defendant, or by a combination of their proofs, which justifies conviction of the lesser offense; and (4) the proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury consistently to find the defendant <em>innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">As the fourth prong of the <em>Whistnant </em>test reflects, a defendant can be found guilty <em>either </em>of the greater offense <em>or </em>the lesser offense, but not both.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A proper instruction on lesser included offenses is not, however, one that merely explains this \u201ceither or\u201d requirement. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Sawyer, </em>227 Conn. 566, 583, 630 A.2d 1064 (1993), we determined that, to assist the jury in making the transition from consideration of the greater offense to consideration of one or more lesser included offenses, the juiy must receive an \u201cacquittal first\u201d instruction. \u201cOnly <em>after </em>it has confronted and unanimously completed the difficult task of deciding the guilt or innocence of the accused as to the charged offense should the jury consider lesser included offenses. Anything less dilutes the right of the state and the defendant to have the juiy give its undivided attention and most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>serious deliberations to the offense with which the defendant is charged . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">This scheme, of acquittal on the greater charge as a condition precedent to deliberation of charges for offenses requiring a lesser specific mental state, is wholly separate from the doctrine of imperfect self-defense. In <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>State, </em>330 Md. 223, 623 A.2d 630 (1993), the Maryland Supreme Court accurately pinpointed the distinction between these two principles. A lesser included offense instruction is applicable where \u201ca defendant not entitled to mitigation may present as a defense evidence of an honestly held though objectively unreasonable belief that is inconsistent with the specific intent required to convict.\u201d Id., 234. In contrast, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense applies where \u201c[a] defendant may intend the exact result he brings about, but be entitled to mitigation because of the circumstances that caused him to act.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The doctrine of imperfect self-defense is a doctrine of mitigation. Simply put, unlike our acquittal first process required for a lesser included offense instruction, under the doctrine of imperfect self-defense a jury must find that the defendant acted with the requisite mental state corresponding to the greater offense before the jury can consider mitigating downward to an offense that is consistent with a less culpable mental state.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">The Appellate Court did not focus on this distinction in reaching its conclusion that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is not recognized in Connecticut. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>distinguished Connecticut from Maryland and California, two jurisdictions where the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is recognized, based upon its determination that our murder statute does not include the element of malice,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> while the murder statutes of Maryland and California do include the element of malice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>State </em>v. <em>Abdalaziz, </em>supra, 45 Conn. App. 601-603. Although the distinction essentially is accurate as to the jurisdictions discussed, it is nevertheless incomplete as a means of differentiating between the doctrine of imperfect self-defense and a lesser included offense instruction. The distinction, therefore, is not the proper means of determining whether the language in <em>Maselli </em>and <em>Knighton, </em>upon which the defendant relies, indicates Connecticut\u2019s adoption of the doctrine of imperfect self-defense. This is because in certain jurisdictions, such as Illinois, although the murder statute does not contain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>the element of malice, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is nonetheless recognized.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The application of the doctrine in Illinois illustrates that it is <em>mitigation </em>that distinguishes the doctrine of imperfect self-defense from a lesser included offense instruction. \u201cIn Illinois, a person commits second degree murder when he commits the offense of first degree murder and either of two mitigating statutory factors is present. The statutory factor applicable in this cause is that, at the time of the killing, the defendant believed the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, they would justify or exonerate the killing but his belief was unreasonable.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Bosek, </em>210 111. App. 3d 573, 594, 569 N.E.2d 551 (1991). \u201c[I]n order for the jury to reach the issue of whether the defendant is guilty of second degree murder, it must already have found him guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Id., 595; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Wright, </em>218 Ill. App. 3d 764, 776-77, 578 N.E.2d 1090 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Other states recognizing the doctrine of imperfect self-defense manifest this requirement as well. See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel, </em>25 Cal. 3d 668, 674, 603 P.2d 1, 160 Cal. Rptr. 84 (1979) (\u201c \u2018[a]n honest but unreasonable belief that it is necessary to defend oneself from imminent peril to life or great bodily injury negates malice aforethought, the mental element necessary for murder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>so that the chargeable offense is <em>reduced </em>to manslaughter\u2019 \u201d [emphasis altered]); <em>In re Christian S., 7 </em>Cal. 4th 768, 773, 872 P.2d 574, 30 Cal. Rptr. 2d 33 (1994) (same); <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 330 Md. 228 (\u201cthe doctrine of imperfect self-defense, like that of hot-blooded response to adequate provocation, does not serve to exonerate a defendant, \u2018but mitigates murder to voluntary manslaughter\u2019 \u201d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Abeyta, 120 </em>N.M. 233, 240, 901 P.2d 164 (1995) (\u201c[I]f the jury rejects the theory of self-defense, it may still find the defendant acted under provocation of fear and may mitigate the charge of murder to the lesser charge of voluntary manslaughter. . . . [T]he claim of imperfect self-defense simply presents an issue of mitigating circumstances that may reduce murder to manslaughter.\u201d [Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.]).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Requiring a finding of the requisite mental state corresponding to the greater offense as a condition precedent to reduction to an offense of lesser culpability is consistent with our own construction of the concept, as reflected in our treatment of extreme emotional disturbance as a basis for mitigation of a murder charge to manslaughter. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-54a<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>authorizes the affirmative defense of extreme emotional disturbance as a permissible means of mitigating the offense of murder to the lesser offense of first degree manslaughter. Under an instruction for extreme emotional disturbance, as with imperfect self-defense as applied by other jurisdictions, the defendant must be found to have intentionally caused the death of the victim before the crime can be mitigated downward to a lesser offense. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In commenting on the United States Supreme Court\u2019s determination in <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>New York, </em>432 U.S. 197, 210, 97 S. Ct. 2319, 53 L. Ed. 2d 281 (1977), that it was permissible to place the burden of proof for extreme emotional disturbance on the defendant, we stated that \u201cthe defense of extreme emotional disturbance does not serve to negate intent, but rather is raised to establish circumstances that mitigate culpability.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>177 Conn. 1, 6, 411 A.2d 3 (1979). \u201cThe purpose of the defense is to render the accused less culpable because his <em>intentional </em>acts were caused by an extreme emotional disturbance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>D\u2019Antuono, </em>186 Conn. 414, 421, 441 A.2d 846 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Thus, the critical question in evaluating both <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 66, and <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>supra, 7 Conn. App. 223, is whether this court or the Appellate Court endorsed a mitigation scheme or an acquittal first scheme, in the event that the defendant presents evidence that he held an honest but objectively unreasonable belief in the need to use deadly physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">The defendant claims that this court adopted the doctrine of imperfect self-defense on the basis of our statement in <em>Maselli </em>that \u201c[t]he jury might well have concluded that for the defendant to have believed under the circumstances revealed by the evidence that the victim was about to use deadly force upon him so that it was necessary to fire eight shots at point blank range was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 73. We disagree, and instead, interpret the relevant portions of that decision to stand for the proposition that, if evidence is presented that the defendant had an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to use physical force, such evidence may be sufficient for the jury to find the defendant innocent of the greater ciime for which specific intent is required, and guilty of the lesser included offense for which recklessness is required, and therefore, the jury should receive a <em>Whistnant </em>lesser included offenses instruction on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">In <em>Maselli, </em>the defendant, a passenger sitting in the front seat of a taxi, killed the driver of the taxi by firing eight shots from a pistol at close range.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Id., 68. After <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55, as a lesser offense included in the charge of murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a (a). The defendant appealed claiming, inter alia, \u201cthat the two kinds of manslaughter in the first degree submitted to the jury<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> [were] not properly included in the charge of intentional murder set forth in the indictment . . . .\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 68. We concluded that the charge under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) properly was included in the charge as a lesser included offense,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> specifically stating that as a matter of law, \u201cany lesser degree of homicide may be considered by the trier, subject to the requirements of <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>[supra, 179 Conn. 585], that the evidence does support a conviction of the lesser included offense and that the elements differentiating the lesser offense are sufficiently in dispute to justify finding the defendant <em>inno</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number><em>cent of the greater offense but guilty of the </em>lesser.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">We then noted that the defendant did not make any claim in his brief that the evidence would not support a conviction of manslaughter under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). Id., 73. In other words, the defendant did not contend that, even if we found as a matter of law that a charge under \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) properly could have been included as a lesser offense of murder under \u00a7 53a-54a, the actual evidence before the jury would not have permitted a lesser included offense instruction for \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3). \u201cDuring argument, however, the question did arise of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding that the defendant\u2019s avowedly intentional shooting of the victim constituted \u2018reckless\u2019 conduct creating a grave risk of death to the victim under circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, as proscribed by subsection (a) (3).\u201d Id. We concluded that there was sufficient evidence to permit a <em>Whistnant </em>lesser included offense instruction on \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), stating: \u201cIt appears that the defendant claimed neither insanity nor extreme emotional disturbance at the trial, but sought acquittal solely upon the ground of self-defense. The trial court instructed the jury upon the use of deadly physical force in defense of the person in accordance with General Statutes \u00a7 53a-19, charging that \u2018[i]t is the facts as they reasonably appear to the defendant at the time he acted which measure the existence of the right of self-defense.\u2019 The jury might well have concluded that for the defendant to have believed under the circumstances revealed by the evidence that the victim was about to use deadly force upon him so that it was necessary to fire eight shots at point blank range was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13).\u201d Id., 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The previously quoted description by the Maryland Supreme Court in <em>Richmond, </em>distinguishing between the doctrine of imperfect self-defense and the application of a lesser included offenses instruction, aptly describes the quoted passage from <em>Maselli. </em>\u201c[A] defendant not entitled to mitigation may present as a defense evidence of an honestly held though objectively unreasonable belief that is inconsistent with the specific intent required to convict.\u201d <em>Richmond </em>v. <em>State, </em>supra, 330 Md. 234. This is exactly what we concluded in the quoted passage from <em>Maselli. </em>Nothing in the language of <em>Maselli </em>suggests our endorsement of the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, that is, that under Connecticut law, the jury in <em>Maselli </em>could have found that the defendant intended to cause the death of the victim and so caused it, and then have had his culpability <em>mitigated </em>to a lesser charge of first degree manslaughter in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">We reach a parallel conclusion concerning the defendant\u2019s argument as to the Appellate Court\u2019s similar statements in <em>Knighton. </em>In that case, the evidence at trial showed that the defendant and victim had been involved in a confrontation earlier in the day, and later that evening returned to the same bar. <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>supra, 7 Conn. App. 224. Although some witnesses testified that they did not see the victim with a gun, the defendant asserted that the victim was about to draw a gun on him, and therefore, he went over to where the victim stood, drew his own gun and shot the victim four times. Id., 225. The defendant was charged with murder in violation of \u00a7 53a-54a, but was convicted, after a jury trial, of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55. Id., 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On appeal, the defendant claimed, inter alia, that the trial court incorrectly charged the jurors that they could consider manslaughter in the first degree as a lesser included offense of murder. Id., 225. The Appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>Court rejected this argument, relying in large part on our holding in <em>Maselli. </em>Id., 236-37. The court stated\u2014 and it is upon this statement that the defendant in the present case relies \u2014 that \u201cthe jury could have concluded that while the defendant did not intend to kill [the victim], his belief that he could protect himself only by firing four shots at [the victim] \u2018was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. Maselli, supra, [182 Conn.] 73.\u201d <em>State </em>v. Knighton, supra, 7 Conn. App. 237. We interpret this statement to mean simply that the jury had before it evidence by which it could have concluded that the defendant did not intend to kill the victim, that is, <em>he did not have the requisite mental state for a guilty verdict under the specific intent crime of murder, </em>but instead, he acted with the lesser mental state required in order to convict the defendant of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">The Appellate Court went on to hold that \u201c[additionally, the jury could have found that the conduct which resulted in the death was not limited to the actual shooting but rather encompassed the whole course of conduct the defendant engaged in: going into a crowded bar with a loaded gun; approaching the defendant, whether at his own initiative or by invitation, with a loaded gun; leaving the bar after the shooting without first securing medical attention for [the victim]. The jury reasonably could have found that through this course of conduct, the defendant did not intend to kill [the victim], nor to cause him serious physical injury, but did recklessly engage in conduct which created a grave risk of causing his death and thereby did cause his death. The court did not err in charging the jury on manslaughter.\u201d Id. This statement also explicitly reflects the principles embodied in the application of a lesser included offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>instruction, whereby the jury could have found that \u201cthe defendant did not intend to kill [the victim], nor to cause him serious physical injury\u201d; id.; that is, the defendant did not have the requisite mental state for a finding of guilt on the greater offense. Nothing in the language of <em>Knighton </em>even implicitly suggests that the Appellate Court determined a process of mitigation would be permissible in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Unlike the mitigation scheme for extreme emotional disturbance, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is not a part of our Penal Code.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Further, the appellate courts of this state have never recognized explicitly the doctrine of imperfect self-defense nor, contrary to the defendant\u2019s claims, have we recognized it implicitly. We conclude, therefore, that both <em>Maselli </em>and <em>Knighton </em>stand for the proposition that a defendant may present as a defense evidence of an honestly held though objectively unreasonable belief that is inconsistent with the specific intent required to convict on the greater offense and, therefore, if acquitted of that greater offense, the defendant may have the jury instructed on lesser <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>included offenses in accordance with the requirements of Whistnant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">While we have concluded that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense is not available to the defendant as a matter of law, we also note that the instruction actually sought at trial in the present case, although labeled as a request for an imperfect self-defense theory of defense, was simply a request for a Maselli-type lesser included offense jury instruction.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>The defendant\u2019s references to the doctrine of imperfect self-defense in the request to charge are limited to the statements that \u201c[i]f either [the defendant\u2019s] belief or his response were unreasonable, the law recognizes what is called imperfect self-defense. Imperfect self-defense does not completely eliminate the defendant\u2019s liability, but it reduces that culpability to the level of recklessness. Imperfect self-defense constitutes recklessness when it demonstrates that the defendant\u2019s act, although not undertaken with a conscious objective to cause death or injury \u2018was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">These statements amount to nothing more than a request for a Maselli-type lesser included offense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>instruction. In the first sentence, the defendant incorrectly states that the imperfect self-defense doctrine is recognized in Connecticut. In the second sentence, he accurately describes the doctrine \u2014 as it exists in other jurisdictions \u2014 as one by which the defendant\u2019s culpability may be reduced, that is, mitigated. The third sentence essentially rephrases our statements in <em>Maselli, </em>and as such, constitutes a request for a <em>Whistnant </em>lesser included offense instruction. The same is true of the text of the actual instructions sought.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The proposed instructions state that the defendant had an honest but unreasonable belief in the need to use deadly force and, therefore, he could be found guilty of the lesser included offenses of assault in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60 (a) (3),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and assault in the second degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-60a.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This also constitutes a request for a <em>Whistnant </em>instruction consistent with our decision in <em>Maselli. </em>Simply put, that which the defendant actually sought by his requested charge of \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d is exactly the lesser included offense charge which the Appellate Court already has determined he is entitled to on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The defendant\u2019s second claim is that the Appellate Court improperly concluded that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in precluding him from introducing into evidence four of the victim\u2019s previous criminal convictions for the purpose of establishing the victim\u2019s violent character. We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Appellate Court as to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The defendant sought to admit five misdemeanor offenses of which the victim had been convicted, namely, (1) assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-61,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> committed against the defendant in October, 1991, (2) assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61, committed against the victim\u2019s sister in April, 1990, (3) criminal trespass in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-107,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> by violating a restraining order obtained by Rodriguez in March, 1990, (4) breach of the peace in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> in March, 1990, and (5) assault in the third degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-61, committed against Rodriguez in March, 1988. The defendant sought admission of these prior convictions on the ground that, as convictions for violent crimes, they were admissible on the issue of whether the victim was the initial aggressor, pursuant to our decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>176 Conn. 107, 109-10, 405 A.2d 622 (1978). The trial court admitted the conviction for assault in the third degree against the defendant in October, 1991, but excluded the four remaining misdemeanor convictions based on their dissimilarity from the incident of aggression at issue, and further, because, according to the trial court, \u201c[their] relevance, if any, is minimal, and [their] prejudice is substantial,\u201d such that their admission would do nothing but \u201carouse the jury against the victim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">\u201cIn <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>[supra, 176 Conn. 109-10], we held that evidence of a homicide victim\u2019s violent character, regardless of the extent of the accused\u2019s knowledge of such character, may be offered as evidence by the accused to show that the victim was the aggressor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>their encounter. Although, in certain circumstances, the victim\u2019s prior convictions of crimes of violence may be admitted, we emphasized that the accused was not authorized \u2018to introduce any and all convictions of crimes involving violence, no matter how petty, how remote in time, or how dissimilar in their nature to the facts of the alleged aggression. . . .\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 114.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Bember, </em>183 Conn. 394, 399, 439 A.2d 387 (1981). We also have concluded that the trial court may exclude merely cumulative evidence related to a homicide victim\u2019s character. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 581, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Moreover, \u201cthe probative value of the evidence of certain convictions rests in the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Miranda, </em>supra, 176 Conn. 114; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>202 Conn. 463, 482, 522 A.2d 249 (1987); <em>State </em>v. <em>Maldonado, </em>193 Conn. 350, 365, 478 A.2d 581 (1984). It is well settled that our review is limited to whether there was an abuse of that discretion. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Small, </em>242 Conn. 93, 109-10, 700 A.2d 617 (1997); <em>State </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>228 Conn. 412, 430-31, 636 A.2d 821 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">The victim in the present case was the former boyfriend of Rodriguez and the father of her child. The alleged aggression was the culmination of an ongoing domestic dispute between the victim and the defendant. It was reasonable for the trial court to have determined that the four misdemeanor convictions were neither sufficiently similar in nature to the alleged aggression, nor sufficiently relevant, to be admitted. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excluding the victim\u2019s four prior convictions on that basis. In so deciding, however, we note that in the course of the new trial that the defendant will receive on remand, our determination that the trial court\u2019s evi-dentiary ruling did not constitute an abuse of discretion should not be understood to mean that this evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>must </em>be excluded.

I write separately only to express my view that this case demonstrates an anomaly in our criminal jurisprudence that, when an appropriate case presents it again, should be eliminated. That anomaly was introduced into our law by this court\u2019s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>182 Conn. 66, 437 A.2d 836 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1083, 101 S. Ct. 868, 66 L. Ed. 2d 807 (1981), and followed by the Appellate Court in <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>7 Conn. App. 223, 508 A.2d 772 (1986). The anomaly is that, on facts such as those presented in this case and in both <em>Maselli </em>and <em>Knighton, </em>where the homicidal conduct of the defendant would not permit a rational inference of a lesser state of mind than intent to kill, the court is permitted nonetheless to give a lesser included offense instruction permitting the jury to find that the defendant acted with a reckless state of mind. In my view, <em>Maselli </em>was ill-considered and wrongly decided, is inconsistent with the statutory concept of recklessness and with later cases that properly analyze the question involved, and should be overruled. I recognize, however, that we did not certify any such question and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to do so in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 182 Conn. 68, the defendant, who was charged with murder, had shot and killed the driver of a taxicab in which he was the sole passenger. The defendant \u201cfired eight bullets from a .32 caliber semi-automatic revolver at close range, six of which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>struck the victim in the head, face and neck.\u201d Id. On the basis of that undisputed evidence, we affirmed the trial court\u2019s instruction of the lesser included offense of manslaughter in the first degree under General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3), which provides: \u201c[U]nder circumstances evincing an extreme indifference to human life, [the defendant] recklessly engages in conduct which creates a grave risk of death to another person, and thereby causes the death of another person.\u201d We stated: \u201cThe jury might well have concluded that for the defendant to have believed under the circumstances revealed by the evidence that the victim was about to use deadly force upon him so that it was necessary to fire eight shots at point blank range was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness. General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 <em>(13).\"</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The Appellate Court properly followed the rule of <em>Maselli </em>in <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>supra, 7 Conn. App. 225, which involved a barroom killing in which it was undisputed \u201cthat the defendant went over to where [the victim] was standing, drew a gun and shot [the victim] four times.\u201d The court stated: \u201c[T]he admission by the defendant that he had acted intentionally did not prohibit the jury from finding that he acted recklessly also. Rather, the jury could have concluded that while the defendant did not intend to kill [the victim], his belief that he could protect himself only by firing four shots at [the victim] \u2018was such a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>observe in the situation as to constitute recklessness.\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Maselli, </em>supra, [182 Conn.] 73.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Knighton, </em>supra, 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Without belaboring the points, it is my view that there are several closely related fundamental flaws in the reasoning underlying <em>Maselli. </em>First, it defies both reality and common sense to say that, when a defendant pumps eight bullets into the head, face and neck of a victim from close range, the jury <em>reasonably </em>could find that he acted with anything other than the intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">Second, the <em>Maselli </em>reasoning justifying an instruction on recklessness misconstrues that concept. Unlike intention, which requires that the actor\u2019s \u201cconscious objective [be] to cause [the] result or to engage in [the] conduct\u201d; General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (ll); <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u201c[a] person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense <em>when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists. </em>The risk must be of such nature and degree that disregarding it constitutes a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a reasonable person would observe in the situation . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13). The reasoning of <em>Maselli </em>in effect collapses the first sentence into the second, and ignores the effect of the first. The concept embodied by the first sentence is that, <em>unlike intention, </em>which requires a conscious objective to bring about the proscribed result, recklessness requires an awareness and conscious disregard of the proscribed substantial and unjustifiable risk. Of course, when someone intentionally kills someone else he acts grossly inconsistent with what a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>person would do in the same situation. That alone, however, is an insufficient basis on which a jury reasonably can find that he <em>also </em>acted with the kind of conscious disregard required by the definition of recklessness.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">Third, the <em>Maselli </em>reasoning makes a mockery of the fourth requirement for a lesser included offense instruction, namely, that \u201cthe proof on the element or elements which differentiate the lesser offense from the offense charged is sufficiently in dispute to permit the jury <em>consistently </em>to find the defendant innocent of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Whistnant, </em>179 Conn. 576, 588, 427 A.2d 414 (1980). Although we recognize, in our lesser included offense jurisprudence, that evidence of states of mind may often permit differing reasonable inferences and, therefore, despite their doctrinal differences, they may be presented to the jury, as lesser included states of mind; <em>State </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, </em>180 Conn. 382, 404-408, 429 A.2d 919 (1980); the evidence must be \u201creasonably susceptible\u201d of such inferences. Id., 404. It is fanciful, in my view, to say that, on facts such as those in <em>Maselli, Knighton </em>and the present case, the evidence is reasonably susceptible of an inference of recklessness, rather than intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Fourth, the reasoning of <em>Maselli </em>is inconsistent with cases such as <em>State </em>v. <em>Crafts, </em>226 Conn. 237, 250, 627 A.2d 877 (1993), in which we rejected the defendant\u2019s claim that the evidence would have permitted a lesser included instruction on manslaughter, as opposed to the charge of murder. Our reasoning in that case was, properly in my view, that the evidence would not have permitted the jury reasonably to conclude that the defendant acted recklessly, rather than intentionally, in causing the victim\u2019s death. Id., 251; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Rasmussen, </em>225 Conn. 55, 72, 621 A.2d 728 (1993); <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>212 Conn. 593, 608-609, 563 A.2d 671 (1989); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Sivri, </em>231 Conn. 115, 139, 646 A.2d 169 (1994) (evidence would allow jury reasonably to infer defendant acted with lesser intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Eventually, we should eliminate this anomaly in our law. It only selves to permit a jury to render a verdict based on something other than a rational view of the evidence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b472-7\"> General Statutes \u00a7 53a-3 (13) provides: \u201cA person acts \u2018recklessly\u2019 with respect to a result or to a circumstance described by a statute defining an offense when he is aware of and consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such result will occur or that such circumstance exists.
