J.</author>\n<p id=\"A1\">In 1987, the plaintiff, Joseph Fimi-ani (claimant), suffered two related injuries in the course of his employment with the named defendant, Star Gallo Distributors, Inc. (Star Gallo). The dispositive issue in this certified appeal is whether General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-349<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> requires the defendant second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>injury fund (fund) to accept liability only for that portion of the workers\u2019 compensation disability benefits due the claimant that is attributable exclusively to his second injury. We conclude that \u00a7 31-349 requires the fund to accept liability for all disability benefits due the claimant, not just that portion of compensation benefits that is attributable to his second injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The following facts and procedural history are undisputed. On January 6, 1987, the claimant injured his lumbar spine (first injury) in the course of his employment. On that date, the defendant Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company (Nationwide)* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was Star Gallo\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. The claimant filed a timely application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Nationwide accepted liability for the claim and, on February 24, 1987, the workers\u2019 compensation commissioner for the third district (commissioner) approved a voluntary agreement awarding the claimant temporary total disability benefits.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Pursuant to that agreement, Nationwide paid the claimant weekly workers\u2019 compensation benefits in the amount of $428 until his return to regular work activity at Star Gallo on February 5, 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-6\">On November 30, 1987, the claimant sustained a second lumbar spine injury (second injury) in the course of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>his employment. On that date, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) was Star Gallo\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurance carrier. The claimant filed a timely application for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. Liberty contested its liability for the claimant\u2019s second injury, maintaining that the second injury was merely a recurrence of his first injury, not a separate injury, and that, consequently, pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-307b,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nationwide was responsible for providing coverage for the claimant\u2019s second injury. Nationwide argued, however, that the second injury was a separate injury, not a recurrence of the first injury, and that, pursuant to \u00a7 31-349, Liberty was responsible for providing coverage for the second injury.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">This dispute was the subject of informal hearings before the commissioner. At the informal hearings, the two insurers presented conflicting medical opinions regarding the cause of the claimant\u2019s second injury. Liberty relied on medical opinion that indicated that the claimant\u2019s second injury was a recurrence; Nationwide relied on medical opinion that indicated that the second injury was a new injury. After the hearings, but before the commissioner had ruled, Liberty and Nationwide entered into an agreement whereby Liberty agreed to accept responsibility for the claimant\u2019s second injury and Nationwide agreed to reimburse Liberty for 75 percent of any benefits Liberty paid to the claimant in connection with his second injury. Thereafter, Liberty accepted liability for the claimant\u2019s second injury, and a voluntary agreement awarding the claimant permanent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>partial disability benefits for the second injury was approved by the commissioner on November 13, 1989.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">Pursuant to the approved voluntary agreements, Liberty paid benefits to the claimant for a period of 104 weeks.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Liberty then sought to transfer liability for the entire claim to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349. The fund, however, agreed to accept liability only for 25 percent of the benefits payable to the claimant. The fund maintained that Nationwide was obligated to pay the remaining 75 percent of the benefits due the claimant. On July 12, 1994, at Nationwide\u2019s request, the commissioner held a formal hearing on the issue of whether Nationwide or the fund was responsible for payment of the remaining 75 percent of those benefits. The commissioner found that the claimant\u2019s second injury was a separate injury, not a recurrence of his first injury, and that the claimant\u2019s first injury was a \u201csubstantial factor in [his] disability.\u201d Concluding that \u00a7 31-349 (a) permitted an allocation between the fund and Nationwide of the benefits due the claimant, the commissioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>ordered the fund to accept liability for only 25 percent of the claim and Nationwide to accept liability for the remaining 75 percent of the benefits due the claimant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Nationwide appealed from the commissioner\u2019s decision to the compensation review board (board) pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The board concluded that \u00a7 31-349 required the fund to accept liability for payment of <em>all </em>benefits due the claimant, without allocation, and reversed the commissioner\u2019s decision. The fund appealed from the decision of the board to the Appellate Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301b. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Concluding that, \u201cin cases where an employee has suffered two separate compensable injuries that have contributed to cause a disability, and liability for that disability can be apportioned between the two injuries by the trial commissioner, the apportionment may also be extended to the liability imposed on the fund by \u00a7 31-349,\u201d the Appellate Court reversed the board\u2019s decision. <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>48 Conn. App. 474, 480-81, 710 A.2d 1374 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Thereafter, Nationwide petitioned this court for certification to appeal from the judgment of the Appellate Court. We granted certification limited to the following question: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the Appellate Court properly conclude that, pursuant to General Statutes [Rev. to 1987] \u00a7 31-349, the second injury fund was liable only for that percentage of the claimant\u2019s total disability attributable to his second injury?\u201d <em>Fimiani </em>v. <em>Star Gallo Distributors, Inc., </em>245 Conn. 912, 718 A.2d 17 (1998). We answer the certified question in the negative and, accordingly, reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">As a threshold matter, we set forth the standard of review applicable to workers\u2019 compensation appeals. \u201cThe principles that govern our standard of review in workers\u2019 compensation appeals are well established. The conclusions drawn by [the commissioner] from the facts found must stand unless they result from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them. . . . <em>Besade </em>v. <em>Interstate Security Services, </em>212 Conn. 441, 449, 562 A.2d 1086 (1989). Neither the review board nor this court has the power to retry facts. See <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 798-99, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996).\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>241 Conn. 692, 696-97, 699 A.2d 52 (1997). \u201cIt is well established that [although not dispositive, we accord great weight to the construction given to the workers\u2019 compensation statutes by the commissioner and review board. ... A state agency is not entitled, however, to special deference when its determination of a question of law has not previously been subject to judicial scrutiny. . . . <em>Duni </em>v. <em>United Technologies Corp., </em>239 Conn. 19, 24-25, 682 A.2d 99 (1996); <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>232 Conn. 311, 317, 654 A.2d 1221 (1995). Where ... [a workers\u2019 compensation] appeal involves an issue of statutory construction that has not yet been subjected to judicial scrutiny, this court has plenary power to review the administrative decision. <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>supra, 697; see <em>Davis </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number><em>Norwich, </em>supra, 317.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>244 Conn. 781, 798, 712 A.2d 396, cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1017, 119 S. Ct. 542, 142 L. Ed. 2d 451 (1998). The issue of whether \u00a7 31-349 permits the fund to accept liability only for the portion of benefits due a claimant that is attributable solely to the claimant\u2019s second injury has not been subject previously to judicial review and is a question of law involving the interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions. Consequently, we afford the conclusion of the board no special deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that interpretation of \u00a7 31-349 is a matter of statutory construction. \u201cStatutory construction is a question of law and therefore our review is plenary. . . . [0]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature. ... In seeking to discern that intent, we look to the words of the statute itself, to the legislative history and circumstances surrounding its enactment, to the legislative policy it was designed to implement, and to its relationship to existing legislation and common law principles governing the same general subject matter.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>General Motors Corp. </em>v. <em>Dohmann, </em>247 Conn. 274, 286, 722 A.2d 1205 (1998); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>244 Conn. 189, 195, 708 A.2d 1371 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">\u201cAs with any issue of statutoiy interpretation, our initial guide is the language of the operative statutory provisions.\u201d <em>In re Baby Z., </em>247 Conn. 474, 498, 724 A.2d 1035 (1999); <em>Federal Deposit Ins. Corp. </em>v. <em>Peabody, N.E., Inc., </em>239 Conn. 93, 102, 680 A.2d 1321 (1996). General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-349 (a), which sets forth the statutory scheme relating to compensation for a second injury, provides in relevant part that the \u201cemployer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the [second] injury . . . [shall] pay <em>all </em>awards of compensation and <em>all </em>medical expenses . . . for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>first one hundred four weeks of disability. . . . Thereafter <em>all </em>responsibility for compensation and medical treatment shall be with the custodian of the second injury fund. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, by its terms, \u00a7 31-349 requires the employer at the time of the second injury to pay all benefits during the first 104 weeks of the claimant\u2019s disability. Thereafter, the fund similarly is required to accept \u201call responsibility\u201d for the benefits due the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Moreover, the legislative history and genealogy of \u00a7 31-349 indicate that the legislature intended that the fund accept responsibility for all compensation benefits due a claimant for the claimant\u2019s injury. The Workers\u2019 Compensation Act has been a part of our law since 1913. See Public Acts 1913, c. 138; <em>Dowling </em>v. <em>Slotnik, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 803. As originally enacted, the workers\u2019 compensation law \u201crequire[d] an employer to assume total liability for any work related injury suffered by an employee even if the severity of such an injury had been aggravated by a preexisting disability. . . . Employers therefore hesitated to hire handicapped persons because if a previously injured or disabled employee were then injured on the job, the employer would be required to compensate the employee for the entire resulting disability even though the severity of the second injury might have been attributable substantially to the preexisting condition. \u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 319-20. In 1919, however, the legislature amended the workers\u2019 compensation law to limit employers\u2019 liability in such cases. Specifically, Public Acts 1919, c. 142, \u00a7 1, as subsequently codified at General Statutes (1930 Rev.) \u00a7 5223, provided: \u201cIn the case of aggravation of a pre-existing disease, compensation shall be allowed only for such proportion of the disability or death due to the aggravation of such pre-existing disease as may be reasonably attributed to the injury upon which the claim is based. . . .\u201d Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>the effect of \u00a7 5223 was to protect employers from paying for the proportion of the disability attributable to the preexisting injury. See <em>Cashman </em>v. <em>McTernan School, Inc., </em>130 Conn. 401, 404, 34 A.2d 874 (1943); <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Keegan, </em>121 Conn. 71, 74-76, 183 A. 14 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">In 1945, the legislature established the second injury fund. Public Acts 1945, No. 188, \u00a7 l,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> provided in relevant part: \u201c[An employee who sustains a second injury] shall be paid compensation by his employer for such incapacity to work, and for the specific loss of, or loss of use of, any of said members or organ, <em>due to the subsequent injury </em>.... After the completion of payments due from his employer, he shall be paid additional weekly compensation during the continuance of his incapacity .... Such additional compensation shall be paid out of the fund . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c[B]y creating the fund, the legislature intended to [protect] employers from the hardship of liability for those consequences of compensable injury <em>not attributable to their employment . . .

O. Penn Machinery Co., </em>[166 Conn. 352, 356, 349 A.2d 847 (1974)]; 2 A. Larson, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law (1994) \u00a7 59.31 (a), p. 10-492.399 and \u00a7 59.34 (a) (1), p. 10-528; especially considering that the combined effect of a successive injury to someone with a preexisting disability can far exceed the combined allowances for each injury existing separately. <em>Civardi </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 294.\u201d (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 320. Thus, under the second injury scheme enacted in 1945, an employer was required to pay only that portion of benefits that were attributable to the second injury, and the fund was required to pay any compensation that was attributable to the claimant\u2019s prior injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">In 1967, the legislature revised the statutory scheme governing the second injury fund. Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 20, which is codified at \u00a7 31-349, provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee who has previously incurred ... [a] permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, and necessary medical care . . . notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first <em>one hundred jour weeks of disability. . . . </em>Thereafter all responsibility for compensation shall be with the custodian of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>second injury fund. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, Public Acts 1967, No. 842, \u00a7 20, amended the statutory scheme governing the second injury fund to include, inter alia, the present limitation of the second injury employer\u2019s liability to 104 weeks. <em>\u201cThis allocation of liability was intended to charge the employer only with an approximation of those benefits attributable solely to the second, employment related injury. </em>By charging the employer with a predetermined period of 104 weeks of liability, the legislature sought to eliminate the administrative problems inherent in a case-by-case apportionment process. A. Larson, supra, \u00a7 59.34 (b), p. 10-553.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 232 Conn. 321. In adopting this apportionment scheme, \u201cthe legislature . . . implicitly determined that any compensation that must be paid after the initial 104 weeks is attributable to the preexisting injury or the aggravated result of the preexisting condition and the second injury combined. See A. Larson, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 59.31 (a) and 59.34 (a) (1). The 104 week period constitutes the following allocation of liability by the legislature: (1) 104 weeks of benefits are allocated to the <em>second, </em>work related injury and are therefore the [second] employer\u2019s responsibility; and (2) any benefits paid after the initial 104 week period are attributable to <em>the preexisting injury, </em>are not the [second] employer\u2019s responsibility and may be transferred to the fund.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Norwich, </em>supra, 323.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">The fund, nevertheless, maintains that it is responsible for the portion of the benefits that is attributable only to the <em>second </em>injury, and that Nationwide is still responsible for the portion of those benefits that is attributable to his first injury. To support this contention, the fund relies on the provision of \u00a7 31-349 (a) that provides: \u201c[The claimant] shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability . . . less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>to the previous disability . . . .\u201d Specifically, the fund argues that the phrase \u201cless any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u201d indicates an intention by the legislature to hold the first injuiy employer liable for compensation relating to the first injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The language on which the fund relies was added to \u00a7 31-349 in 1979. Public Acts 1979, No. 79-376, \u00a7 80 (P.A. 79-376). Prior to that amendment, General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-349 provided in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee who has previously incurred ... [a] permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability . . . resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, and necessary medical care . . . notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. ...\u201d Thus, prior to 1979, the express language of \u00a7 31-349 permitted a claimant who had suffered a second permanent disability to recover benefits for the <em>entire amount of that injury </em>without regard to whether the claimant previously had been awarded permanent disability benefits for his first injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">In 1979, however, the legislature, by adopting P.A. 79-376, amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1979) \u00a7 31-349 (a) to provide in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee who has previously incurred ... [a] permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability . . . resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary medical care . . . notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the [second] injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. ...\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1981) \u00a7 31-349.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The legislative history and genealogy of P.A. 79-376 indicate that the phrase \u201cless any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u201d was intended to prevent claimants who previously had been awarded partial permanent compensation benefits pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-308 (b), 31-309 and 31-295 (c) for a first work-related injury from recovering duplicative compensation for that first injury pursuant to \u00a7 31-349. In 1978, a commission, established pursuant to Public Acts 1975, No. 75-622, recommended to the General Assembly that \u00a7 31-349 be revised so that the \u201ccompensation for the subsequent disability will be limited to the <em>increase of the disability.\u2019'\u2019 </em>(Emphasis added.) Report of the Commission to Study and Make Recommendations for the Workmen\u2019s Compensation System of the State to the General Assembly (1978), p. 29. The commission recommended this revision because \u00a7 31-349 then permitted claimants to recover compensation for the entire amount of a second disability without regard to whether the claimant previously had been awarded permanent disability benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>for a prior work-related disability. Id.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> During the discussion on the floor of the House of Representatives of Substitute House Bill No. 7307, the bill enacted as P.A. 79-376 and codified at \u00a7 31-349, Representative Richard J. Balducci gave the following example: \u201cLet\u2019s say if an individual loses a finger and then somewhere along the line in the course of work is compensated for that loss, he loses an additional three fingers, plus the thumb, he would be compensated for the loss of the three fingers and the thumb, not the entire hand.\u201d 22 H.R. Proc., Pt. 15, 1979 Sess., p. 5054.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Furthermore, in 1993, pursuant to Public Acts 1993, No. 93-228, \u00a7 24 (P.A. 93-228), the legislature amended General Statutes (Rev. to 1993) \u00a7 31-349 to provide that the phrase \u201c \u2018compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u2019 includes compensation payable or paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, as well as any other compensation payable or paid in connection with the previous disability, regardless of the source of such compensation.\u201d General Statutes (Rev. to 1995) \u00a7 31-349 (a). During the committee hearing on Substitute House Bill No. 7172, the bill that eventually was enacted as P.A. 93-228, Jesse Frank!, a commissioner and the chairman of the workers\u2019 compensation commission, remarked that the phrase \u201cless any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u201d was intended to apply to the <em>increase in permanency rating </em>of a disability. See Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Labor and Public Employees, 1993 Sess., Pt. 4, p. 1213.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that P.A. 79-376 was intended to limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the liability of both the second employer and the fund by requiring that, in calculating the amount of benefits due the claimant for the claimant\u2019s second injury, a deduction be taken for any compensation benefits that the claimant already is entitled to recover for his first injury pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 31-308 (b), 31-309 and 31-295 (c).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Public Act 79-376 was not intended to replace the statutory apportionment scheme under which: (1) the first 104 weeks of benefits for the second injury are attributed to the second injury and are the responsibility of the second employer; and (2) all subsequent benefits for the second injury are attributed to the first injury and are the responsibility of the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">Finally, we note that under the fund\u2019s proposed construction of \u00a7 31-349 (a), even though the first employer would be responsible for benefits attributed to the claimant\u2019s first injury, the second employer still would be permitted to transfer liability for benefits attributed to the second injury to the fund. Thus, the second employer would be relieved of responsibility for bene<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>fits that are solely attributable to the second injury. We can discern no basis for allowing second employers to escape liability by transferring to the fund after the 104 week period has elapsed responsibility for that portion of a claimant\u2019s benefits that is completely attributable to his second employment. \u201cIt is ... a rule of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Ensign-Bickford Realty Corp. </em>v. <em>Zoning Commission, </em>245 Conn. 257, 270, 715 A.2d 701 (1998); <em>Ferrigno </em>v. <em>Cromwell Development Associates, </em>supra, 244 Conn. 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">We conclude that \u00a7 31-349 (a) requires the employer at the time of a claimant\u2019s second injury to accept liability for all of the compensation benefits due the claimant for a period of 104 weeks. Thereafter, \u00a7 31-349 requires the fund to accept liability for all of the benefits due the claimant for the combined injuries. Section 31-349 further requires that, in calculating the amount of benefits due the claimant, a deduction be taken for any permanent disability benefits the claimant already is entitled to recover for his first injury pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 31-308 (b), 31-309 and 31-295 (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">There is no claim in the present case that the claimant already is entitled to recover permanent disability benefits for his first injury, and, therefore, no further proceedings are required before the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is reversed and the case is remanded to that court with direction to affirm the decision of the board insofar as the board concluded that \u00a7 31-349 requires the fund to accept liability for all benefits due the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">In this opinion the other justices concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b654-9\"> \u201cWe look to the statute in effect at the date of injury to determine the rights and obligations between the parties. . . . This rule applies to the employer\u2019s right to transfer liability to the fund pursuant to \u00a7 31-349.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Six </em>v. <em>Thomas O\u2019Connor &amp; Co., </em>235 Conn. 790, 791-92 n.l, 669 A.2d 1214 (1996). General Statutes (Rev. to 1987) \u00a7 31-349 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cIf an employee who has previously incurred ... [a] permanent physical impairment, incurs a second disability by accident or disease arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in a permanent disability caused by both conditions which is materially and substantially greater than that which would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for the entire amount of disability, including total disability, less any compensation benefits payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and necessary medical care, as elsewhere provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of such disability was due to prior accidental injury, disease or congenital causes. The employer by whom the employee is employed at the time of the injury, or his insurance carrier, shall in the first instance pay all awards <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>of compensation and all medical expenses provided by this chapter for the first one hundred four weeks of disability. . . .
