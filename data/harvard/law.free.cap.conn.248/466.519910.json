This case is a companion case to <em>Cece </em>v. <em>Felix Industries, Inc., </em>248 Conn. 457, 728 A.2d 505 (1999), also decided this day.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">In <em>Cece, </em>we concluded that \u00a7 31-349 (e), which was added in the 1995 revision of the statute, had no constitutional flaw, either under the contracts clause <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or the due process clause<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>In the absence of a contract relationship between the second injury fund on the one hand and employers or their insurers on the other hand, we held that the legislature had the authority to require the fund to be re-notified promptly of potential future claims for transfer of payments to the fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In this case, the declaratory judgment action brought by the plaintiffs<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> against the defendants, principally the second injury fund,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> raises similar issues of constitutionality concerning two provisions in the revised \u00a7 31-349. After the parties had agreed on a stipulation of facts, the trial court reserved the questions of law for the advice of this court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 first claim is that the re-notification provision, now codified as \u00a7 31-349 (e), is unconstitutional because it impairs their contract rights and deprives them of their right to due process. As we held in <em>Cece, </em>there is no merit to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 second claim is that the limitations provision, now codified as \u00a7 31-349 (b), is unconstitutional on the same grounds. Pursuant to \u00a7 31-349 (b) (1), even after timely re-notification, an employer or insurer intending to transfer liability to the second injury fund must now notify the custodian of the fund <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>\u201cby certified mail no later than three calendar years after the date of injury or no later than ninety days after completion of payments for the first one hundred and four weeks of disability, whichever is earlier . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Although \u00a7 31-349 (b) (1) contains a further limitation on access to the second injury fund, the grounds for the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges to its constitutionality are indistinguishable from those advanced in <em>Cece. </em>Again, the premise underlying their constitutional claims is that the second injury fund had a contractual relationship with employees, employers and insurers in this state. In <em>Cece, </em>we expressly held that premise to be unsustainable.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We conclude, therefore, that \u00a7 31-349 (b) (1) passes constitutional muster.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">The questions reserved to this court were:</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">(1) \u201cDoes Public Act 95-277, \u00a7 3 [codified as General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 subsections (b) and (e)] violate Article I, \u00a7 10 of the United States Constitution?\u201d The answer to this question is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">(2) \u201cDoes Public Act 95-277, \u00a7 3 [codified as General Statutes \u00a7 31-349 subsections (b) and (e)] deprive the plaintiffs of a vested property right without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1, \u00a7 8 of the Connecticut Constitution?\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The answer to this question is \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">No costs will be taxed in this court to either party.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> General Statutes \u00a7 31-349, as it incorporates P.A. 95-277, provides in relevant part: \u201c(a) The fact that an employee has suffered aprevious disability, shall not preclude him from compensation for a second injury, nor preclude compensation for death resulting from the second injury. If an employee having a previous disability incurs a second disability from a second injury resulting in a permanent disability caused by both the previous disability and the second injury which is materially and substantially greater than the disability that would have resulted from the second injury alone, he shall receive compensation for (1) the entire amount of disability, includ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ing total disability, less any compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability, and (2) necessary medical care, as provided in this chapter, notwithstanding the fact that part of the disability was due to a previous disability. For purposes of this subsection, \u2018compensation payable or paid with respect to the previous disability\u2019 includes compensation payable or paid pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, as well as any other compensation payable or paid in connection with the previous disability, regardless of the source of such compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"agv-dedup-0\">\u201c(b) As a condition precedent to the liability of the Second Injury Fund, the employer or its insurer shall: (1) Notify the custodian of the fund by certified mail no later than three calendar years after the date of injury or no later than ninety days after completion of payments for the first one hundred and four weeks of disability, whichever is earlier, of its intent to transfer liability for the claim to the Second Injury Fund ....</p>\n<p id=\"AVe\">\u201c(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, no injury which occurs on or after July 1, 1995, shall serve as a basis for transfer of a claim to the Second Injury Fund under this section. All such claims shall remain the responsibility of the employer or its insurer under the provisions of this section.</p>\n<p id=\"A6F\">\u201c(e) All claims for transfer of injuries for which the fund has been notified prior to July 1, 1995, shall be deemed withdrawn with prejudice, unless the employer or its insurer notifies the custodian of the fund by certified mail prior to October 1, 1995, of its intention to pursue transfer pursuant to the provisions of this section. . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b486-10\"> Article one, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, of the United States constitution provides in relevant part: \u201cNo State shall . . . pass any . . .
