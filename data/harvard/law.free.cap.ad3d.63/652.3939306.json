In an attempt to move the car back to his house, which was situated down the block, the defendant directed the four youths to exit the vehicle and push the car while the car\u2019s transmission was in neutral and the defendant was steering the vehicle. Although two of the defendant\u2019s sons and their friend responded immediately to the defendant\u2019s directive by exiting the vehicle and starting to push it, the defendant\u2019s 15-year-old son Ramy (hereinafter the plaintiff) remained in the car. The defendant again instructed the plaintiff to exit the vehicle and to push the car. When the plaintiff attempted to comply with his father\u2019s instruction, the car\u2019s rear tire ran over his right foot and ankle, resulting in the injuries which gave rise to this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">After the plaintiffs commenced the present action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>defendants moved for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that a child has no cognizable cause of action against a parent for negligent supervision. While a parent\u2019s alleged failure to supervise his or her child is not recognized as a tort actionable by the child (see <em>Holodook v Spencer, </em>36 NY2d 35 [1974]), here, the defendants failed to establish their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, as the complaint did not assert that the accident resulted from negligent parental supervision but, rather, from the defendant\u2019s negligent operation and control of the vehicle <em>(see Hoppe v Hoppe, </em>281 AD2d 595, 596 [2001]; <em>Grivas v Grivas, </em>113 AD2d 264, 269 [1985]). Under these circumstances, it is not necessary to consider the sufficiency of the plaintiffs\u2019 opposition papers <em>(see Tchjevskaia v Chase, </em>15 AD3d 389 [2005]).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The defendants\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Dillon, J.E, Florio, Balkin and Austin, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
