Petitioner thereafter was charged in a misbehavior report with solicitation, providing misleading statements and committing a Penal Law offense. Following a tier III disciplinary hearing, petitioner was found guilty and a penalty was imposed. Upon administrative review, respondent dismissed the finding of guilt for committing a Penal Law offense, citing lack of evidence, but affirmed the penalty. Petitioner thereafter commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding and we now confirm.</p><p id=\"b1226-4\">The documentary evidence, including information from the Attorney General\u2019s investigation as well as the misbehavior report and the confidential information considered by the Hearing Officer, provide substantial evidence to support the determination of petitioner\u2019s guilt <em>(see Matter of Perretti v Fischer, </em>58 AD3d 999, 1000 [2009], <em>lv denied </em>12 NY3d 709 [2009]; <em>Matter of Morillo v Goord, </em>38 AD3d 947, 947 [2007]). Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, the Hearing Officer had the discretion to deny employee assistance to aid in his defense where he did not fall within one of the enumerated classifications that mandate assistance <em>(see </em>7 NYCRR 251-4.1; <em>Matter of Alston v Goord, </em>25 AD3d 852, 853 [2006]). Moreover, the record before us indicates that petitioner\u2019s hearing was conducted in a fair and impartial manner, and the determination was not the result of any alleged bias <em>(see Matter of Chavis v Goord, </em>58 AD3d 954, 955 [2009]; <em>Matter of Burgess v Selsky, </em>50 AD3d 1347, 1348 [2008]).</p><p id=\"b1226-5\">We find petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions to be either unpreserved or without merit.</p><p id=\"b1226-6\">Peters, J.P, Spain, Kane, McCarthy and Garry, JJ., concur. Adjudged that the determination is confirmed, without costs, and petition dismissed.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"
