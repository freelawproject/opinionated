In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff principally relied on the affidavit of her treating neurologist, Dr. Michael <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>Daras. Dr. Daras\u2019 affidavit was insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact. Neither the plaintiff nor Dr. Daras explained the 18-month gap in her treatment between March 2006 and September 2007 <em>(see Pommells v Perez, </em>4 NY3d 566 [2005]; <em>Ponciano v Schaefer, </em>59 AD3d 605 [2009]; <em>Garcia v Lopez, </em>59 AD3d 593 [2009]; <em>Pompey v Carney, </em>59 AD3d 416 [2009]; <em>Sapienza v Ruggiero, </em>57 AD3d 643 [2008]). Moreover, Dr. Daras failed to acknowledge in his affidavit that the plaintiff reinjured her back in a subsequent accident, and therefore his conclusion that the limitations he noted in the plaintiffs lumbar spine were caused by the subject accident was rendered speculative <em>(see Barnes v Cisneros, </em>15 AD3d 514 [2005]; <em>Mooney v Edwards, </em>12 AD3d 424 [2004] ). Furthermore, Dr. Daras failed to account for notations in the plaintiff s medical records indicating that she had full range of motion in her neck, back, and ankles within two months of the subject accident <em>(see Kaplan v Vanderhans, </em>26 AD3d 468 [2006]; <em>Brown v Tairi Hacking Corp., </em>23 AD3d 325 [2005] ).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The medical reports of Dr. James McWilliam were without any probative value in opposing the defendants\u2019 motion because they were unaffirmed <em>(see Grasso v Angerami, </em>79 NY2d 813 [1991]; <em>Niles v Lam Pakie Ho, </em>61 AD3d 657 [2009]; <em>Uribe-Zapata v Capallan, </em>54 AD3d 936 [2008]; <em>Patterson v NY Alarm Response Corp., </em>45 AD3d 656 [2007]; <em>Verette v Zia, </em>44 AD3d 747 [2007]; <em>Nociforo v Penna, </em>42 AD3d 514 [2007]; <em>Pagano v Kingsbury, </em>182 AD2d 268 [1992]).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs affidavit was insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact <em>(see Thomas v Weeks, </em>61 AD3d 961 [2009]; <em>Luizzi-Schwenk v Singh, </em>58 AD3d 811 [2009]; <em>Gochnour v Quaremba, </em>58 AD3d 680 [2009]).
