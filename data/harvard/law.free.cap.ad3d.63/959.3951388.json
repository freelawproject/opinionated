The appeal brings up for review the denial, after a hearing, of that branch of the defendant\u2019s omnibus motion which was to suppress physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-10\">Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">The underlying charges arise out of an incident that occurred on January 15, 2005, at approximately 1:00 a.m. At the suppression hearing, a law enforcement officer testified that, while he and other officers were patrolling in an unmarked minivan, he observed the defendant and another individual engage in an apparent drug transaction. The officers drove around the block, stopped that individual, and recovered from him a white rocky substance that appeared to be cocaine. The officers then returned to the location where they had observed the defendant engage in the original transaction, whereupon they observed the defendant engage in an apparent drug transaction with a woman by giving her an object that appeared to be narcotics. The testifying officer then arrested the defendant, and recovered from his hands a plastic package containing a substance that was later determined to be narcotics.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>The defendant contends that the Supreme Court erred in denying that branch of his motion which was to suppress the physical evidence seized upon his arrest, since the arresting officer\u2019s testimony as to his grounds for probable cause was incredible as a matter of law. In determining whether a hearing court properly determined that an arrest was supported by probable cause, the resolution of \u201c \u2018issues of credibility [is] primarily for the trial court [whose] determination is entitled to great weight\u2019 on appeal\u201d <em>(People v Lebron, </em>184 AD2d 784, 784 [1992], quoting <em>People v Garafolo, </em>44 AD2d 86, 88 [1974]; <em>see People v Umadat, </em>29 AD3d 830 [2006]). Here, the officer\u2019s testimony was not \u201cmanifestly untrue, physically impossible, contrary to experience, or self-contradictory\u201d <em>(People v Garafolo, </em>44 AD2d 86, 88 [1974] [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see People v Jeter, </em>6 AD3d 459 [2004]; <em>People v Sanchez, </em>248 AD2d 306 [1998]; <em>People v Olivo, </em>189 AD2d 786 [1993]). Accordingly, we discern no basis in the record to disturb the suppression court\u2019s credibility determination, and the suppression court properly denied that branch of the defendant\u2019s motion which was to suppress the physical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The defendant further contends that the Supreme Court erred in admitting the detective\u2019s trial testimony regarding the defendant\u2019s prior uncharged sale of drugs. Evidence of a defendant\u2019s commission of uncharged crimes or acts is inadmissible \u201cif the only purpose of the evidence is to show bad character or propensity towards crime\u201d <em>(People v Alvino, </em>71 NY2d 233, 241 [1987]). However, evidence of uncharged crimes or acts may be admissible to show, inter alia, the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the charged act <em>(see People v Alvino, </em>71 NY2d at 241-242). Here, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s alleged prior drug sale was properly admitted to show the defendant\u2019s intent to commit the charged offense <em>(see People v Brown, 4 </em>AD3d 156, 157 [2004]; <em>People v Rosello, </em>298 AD2d 212 [2002]; <em>see also People v Cain, </em>193 AD2d 810 [1993]).
