What details are essential will be incorporated in the discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Defendant asserts as a matter of law he cannot be convicted of violation of section 496 (commonly referred to as \u201creceiving stolen property\u201d) because there is evidence he was the actual thief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Before addressing the applicable law, we summarize the evidence introduced at trial on this charge, all of which was offered by the prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">Mr. Shumate, a resident of a motel near a construction site, testified he observed three men loading manhole covers into the back of a blue Chevrolet pickup truck in the evening hours of June 13, 1985. The manhole covers were the property of the Granite Construction Company and were marked with the initials \u201cGCC.\u201d Mr. Shumate equivocally identified defendant at trial as being part of the group loading the covers into the truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">On June 14, 1985, defendant sold a number of manhole covers bearing the mark \u201cGCC\u201d as scrap metal to A &amp; A Salvagers. The person to whom defendant sold the covers was familiar with defendant, having purchased scrap metal from him at least 10 other times.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Section 496, subdivision 1 currently provides in relevant part: \u201cEvery person who <em>buys </em>or <em>receives </em>any property which has been stolen or which has been obtained in any manner constituting theft . . . , knowing the property to be so stolen . . . , <em>or </em>who <em>conceals, sells </em>[or] <em>withholds </em>. . . any such property from the owner, knowing the property to be stolen ... is punishable by imprisonment in a state prison, . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>It has been held a thief may not be convicted under section 496 for \u201cconcealing\u201d or \u201cwithholding\u201d stolen property as these acts are part and parcel of the theft. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tatum </em>(1962) 209 Cal.App.2d 179, 183-185 [25 Cal.Rptr. 832] [\u201cTo conceal and withhold is the thiefs purpose from the very moment that he gains possession of the property.\u201d].) It is equally clear a thief may not be convicted under section 496, subdivision 1 of \u201cbuying\u201d or \u201creceiving\u201d the goods which he has previously stolen. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThis is because \u2018the word \u201creceive\u201d implies two persons, to the end that it must be proved that defendant received the goods from somebody. [Citation.] The word \u201cbuys\u201d similarly implies that there is a second party who purchases the stolen goods from the thief. Just as a thief cannot receive from himself, he cannot buy from himself.\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Stewart </em>(1986) 185 Cal.App.3d 197, 204 [229 Cal.Rptr. 445]; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Marquez </em>(1965) 237 Cal.App.2d 627, 637 [47 Cal.Rptr. 166].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In light of the foregoing, section 496 has been construed \u201cas a statute directed primarily at persons who do not physically participate in the actual theft of property. . . . [fl] [Instead, it] is directed at those who knowingly deal with thieves and with their stolen goods after the theft has been committed.\u201d (Ta<em>tum, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at pp. 183-184; cited with approval in <em>Stewart, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 204; <em>Marquez, supra, </em>237 Cal.App.2d at pp. 636-637.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Nonetheless, we conclude defendant was properly convicted of violation of section 496 even if the thief because the Legislature has, <em>post-Tatum, </em>expressed its intention to punish every person\u2014including the thief\u2014who <em>sells </em>stolen property. In 1972, the Legislature added the term \u201csells\u201d to subdivision 1 of section 496. (Stats. 1972, ch. 963, \u00a7 1, p. 1739.) Unlike the construction given \u201cbuy\u201d or \u201creceive\u201d <em>(see Stewart, supra, </em>185 Cal.App.3d at p. 204), \u201csell\u201d is a term necessarily presupposing two parties but <em>not </em>precluding the party stealing the goods from the reach of the statute. In addition, unlike \u201cconcealing\u201d and \u201cwithholding,\u201d the sale of stolen property is not part and parcel of the theft itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The 1972 amendment to section 496 was before the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(1978) 78 Cal.App.3d 533 [144 Cal.Rptr. 199]. In <em>Jackson, </em>the evidence demonstrated defendant had stolen his girlfriend\u2019s motorcycle and sewing machine, which he then sold to an undercover police officer. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 536-538.) Defendant was convicted of theft (\u00a7 487) and \u201cconcealing, withholding or selling\u201d the stolen goods. (\u00a7496, subd. 1.) The <em>Jackson </em>court reversed the latter conviction, asserting the 1972 amendment adding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>\u201csells\u201d did not clearly suggest it was intended to apply to thieves. <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 53S-539.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">We respectfully disagree with <em>Jackson. </em>First, an interpretation that \u201csells\u201d applies only to a person who receives stolen property and then resells it defies logic. Since such sellers would already be criminally liable under section 496 as presumably they have bought, received, concealed or withheld the goods, this interpretation would render the addition of \u201csells\u201d a nullity, an action we cannot ascribe to the Legislature. <em>(Lungren </em>v. <em>Deukmejian </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 727, 735 [248 Cal.Rptr. 115, 755 P.2d 299].)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Moreover, <em>Jackson </em>ignores the distinction between \u201csells\u201d and the other acts violative of the statute. The terms \u201cbuy,\u201d \u201creceive,\u201d \u201cwithhold\u201d and \u201cconceal\u201d have been interpreted literally, and so too must the word \u201csell.\u201d Thus it is clear concealing and withholding the stolen merchandise are part of the crime of theft, the purpose of the thief \u201cfrom the very moment that he gains possession of the property\u201d <em>(Tatum, supra, </em>209 Cal.App.2d at p. 183); furthermore, a thief cannot receive or buy stolen property from himself because it is logically impossible <em>(Marquez, supra, </em>337 Cal.App.2d at p. 637). By force of the same reasoning, however, it is equally clear a thief <em>can </em>sell stolen property and that the sale of such property is an act separate from the initial theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Finally, we reject the contention that simply because the Legislature did not use the word \u201cthief\u2019 as suggested in <em>Jamarillo </em>(see fn. 4, <em>ante), </em>the amendment adding \u201csells\u201d to section 496 was not intended to apply to the person who stole the property. The amendment is a direct indication of an intent to punish \u201c[e]very person\u201d who engages in the <em>separate </em>and <em>severable </em>act of selling stolen property. (\u00a7 496, subd. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Thus, even if the jury had found that defendant was the thief, thus ruling out a conviction for violation of section 496 on the theory of buying, receiving, concealing, or withholding, defendant\u2019s sale of the property renders him liable under section 496. Here, the People\u2019s sole theory in support of the section 496 charge was that defendant sold property he knew to be stolen. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury that the actus reus of violation of section 496 was \u201cthat a person sold or aided in selling property which had been stolen,\u201d omitting any mention of any of the other acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>characterizing a violation of section 496 such as receiving, withholding, concealing or buying. We hold defendant was properly convicted on the stolen goods charge.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">IV<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">As modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">Puglia, P.

Although the instructions provided the jury were not included in the opinion, undoubtedly such instructions spoke in the terms so charged. Thus, there would have been no way of determining whether the jury convicted the defendant permissively of selling or impermissively of concealing or withholding.
