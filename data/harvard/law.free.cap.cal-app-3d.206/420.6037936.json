Code, \u00a7 266j; statutory references are to this code unless otherwise noted);</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-11\">Seven counts (Nos.l, 2, 6, 8, 15, 23 and 26) of lewd acts upon a child under age 14 (\u00a7 288, subd. (a));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-12\">Four counts (Nos. 4, 5, 24, 25) of participation in an act of oral copulation with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than the perpetrator (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c));</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>One count (No. 3) of sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than the perpetrator (\u00a7 286, subd.

(b)).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The convictions for violation of former section 266j were premised upon defendant\u2019s taking his 13-year-old second cousin, Denise, to farm labor camps where she performed acts of prostitution. The remaining convictions were premised upon acts committed by defendant with or upon Denise.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Sentenced to a total unstayed state prison term of 45 years, defendant appeals. He contends: (1) the trial court erroneously denied his <em>Marsden </em>motions <em>(People </em>v. <em>Marsden </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 118 [84 Cal.Rptr. 156, 465 P.2d 44]); (2) the trial court erroneously denied his <em>Faretta </em>motion <em>(Faretta </em>v. <em>California </em>(1975) 422 U.S. 806 [45 L.Ed.2d 562, 95 S.Ct. 2525]); (3) the trial court should have suppressed an in-court identification of defendant by a witness; (4) the trial court committed various instructional errors; (5) the prosecutor committed misconduct during closing argument; (6) the trial court erroneously responded to a jury inquiry without informing defendant or his counsel; (7) the trial court erroneously imposed the upper term on count 9; (8) the trial court failed to observe the five-year limitation in subdivision (a) of section 1170.1 by imposing consecutive terms on certain counts; (9) the trial court should have stayed either count 24 or count 25 pursuant to section 654; and (10) the trial court committed error by failing to state reasons for sentencing pursuant to section 667.6, subdivision (c) instead of section 1170.1 as required by <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 335, 347 [193 Cal.Rptr. 882, 667 P.2d 686].</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In an unpublished portion of this opinion, we consider and reject all but two of these contentions. In this published portion we consider defendant\u2019s claims that (1) the jury should have been instructed that Denise\u2019s testimony required corroboration; and (2) the trial court\u2019s sentence violated subdivision (a) of section 1170.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">We shall affirm the judgment of conviction but stay certain consecutive sentences imposed in violation of section 1170.1, subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Facts<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AHq\">I, II<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>The Trial Court Correctly Declined to Instruct the Jury That the Testimony of the Child Victim Required Corroboration.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">The victim, Denise, testified at trial.  Defendant contends the trial court should have instructed sua sponte that her testimony on counts 9 through 14 and 16 through 22 required corroboration under either section 1108 or section 1111. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-8\">Section 1108 provides that \u201cUpon a trial for procuring or attempting to procure an abortion, or aiding or assisting therein, or for inveigling, enticing, or taking away an unmarried female of previous chaste character, under the age of eighteen years, for the purpose of prostitution, or aiding or assisting therein, the defendant cannot be convicted upon the testimony of the woman upon or with whom the offense was committed, unless she is corroborated by other evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">Defendant suggests he was prosecuted for \u201c. . . inveigling, enticing, or taking away an unmarried female of previous chaste character, . . .\u2019\u2019so that section 1108 applies. However, as the People properly note, this language was borrowed from section 266 which is set out below.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Any doubt this borrowing was intentional is dispelled by the Code Commissioners\u2019 Notes describing a 1905 amendment to section 1108 (Stats. 1905, ch. 533, \u00a7 2, p. 696) as follows: \u201cThe amendment consists in the substitution of the word \u2018eighteen\u2019 for \u2018twenty-five.\u2019 The purpose is to conform the section to the provisions of section 266.\u201d (See Code Comrs. Notes, West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (1985 ed.) \u00a7 1108, p. 364.)</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>Here, defendant was accused and convicted not of section 266 but of former section 266j which describes a different offense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Among other differences, sections 266 and 1108 refer to an unmarried female of previous chaste character; section 266j does not. Since defendant was not charged with, nor convicted of, violating section 266, section 1108 did not require that Denise\u2019s testimony be corroborated.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">Defendant also contends Denise\u2019s testimony required corroboration because she was an accomplice. (\u00a7 1111; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Terry </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 362, 398, 399 [85 Cal.Rptr. 409, 466 P.2d 961].) However, she was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">It has long been settled that where a penal statute expressly outlaws conduct against minors, a minor who is a victim of the proscribed conduct is not an accomplice and the jury need not be instructed that the minor\u2019s testimony requires corroboration. <em>(People </em>v. <em>De Paula </em>(1954) 43 Cal.2d 643, 647 [276 P.2d 600], followed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Poindexter </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 142, 149-150 [330 P.2d 763]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Montalvo </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 328, 331 [93 Cal.Rptr. 581, 482 P.2d 205, 49 A.L.R.3d 518]; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Yarber </em>(1979) 90 Cal.App.3d 895, 908-909 [153 Cal.Rptr. 875]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thomas </em>(1968) 267 Cal.App.2d 698, 703 [73 Cal.Rptr. 590], and authorities cited.) Each of the statutes defendant was accused of violating expressly protects minors, and Denise was the victim of each violation. Thus, Denise was not an accomplice. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Her testimony required no corroboration and accomplice instructions were inappropriate. <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">IV-VIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">IX</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\">\n<em>Certain Terms Must Be Stayed Pursuant to Subdivision (a) of Section 1170.1.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">At sentencing the trial court selected count 9 as the base term and imposed the upper term of eight years. Twelve consecutive two-year terms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>(one-third of the six-year middle term) were imposed on counts 10 through 14 and 16 through 22; however, nineteen of these twenty-four years were stayed pursuant to the five-year limitation in subdivision (a) of section 1170.1. Twelve consecutive two-year terms (one-third of the six-year middle term) were also imposed for counts 1 through 6, 8, 15, and 23 through 26. No part of these terms was stayed. An additional fully consecutive eight-year upper term was imposed for count 7. (\u00a7 667.6, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">Defendant contends the consecutive terms imposed on count 3 (\u00a7 286, subd. (c), sodomy with age difference) and counts 4, 5, 24, and 25 (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c), oral copulation with age difference) must be stayed because the court had already reached the five-year limitation of section 1170.1, subdivision (a) by imposition of consecutive terms on counts 10 through 12 (\u00a7 266j).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">Section 1170.1, subdivision (a), as it existed at the time of defendant\u2019s offenses, provided in pertinent part (as it does now) that, \u201cThe subordinate term for each consecutive offense which is not a \u2018violent felony\u2019 as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 shall consist of one-third of the middle term of imprisonment prescribed for each other such felony conviction for which a consecutive term of imprisonment is imposed, and shall exclude any enhancements. <em>In no case shall the total of subordinate terms for such consecutive offenses which are not \u2018violent felonies' as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5 exceed five years.\" </em>(Stats. 1982, ch. 1551, \u00a7 1.5, p. 6048, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The question turns on whether sections 286, subdivision (c) and 288a, subdivision (c) define \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The issue has apparently not been squarely decided. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hetherington </em>(1984) 154 Cal.App.3d 1132 [201 Cal.Rptr. 756], the court remarked in dictum in a footnote that section 288a, subdivision (c) did not define a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 1137, fn. 4.) And in <em>People </em>v. <em>Stephenson </em>(1984) 160 Cal.App.3d 7 [206 Cal.Rptr. 444], the appellate court approved without discussion the sentencing undertaken by the trial court, which had concluded that violations of sections 288a, subdivisions (b)(2)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and (c) and 286, subdivision (b)(2)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> were not \u201cviolent felonies.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at pp. 8, 11.) The question is therefore one of statutory interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>Section 667.5, subdivision (c), as it existed at the time of defendant\u2019s offenses, is set out in pertinent part in the margin.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The parties implicitly agree that sodomy or oral copulation with a 10-year age difference are not committed \u201cby force, violence, duress, menace, or threat of great bodily harm\u201d as required by subdivisions (c)(4) and (c)(5) of former section 667.5. Rather, the parties dispute whether the crimes are embraced by subdivision (c)(6), defining a violent felony as \u201cLewd acts on a child under 14 as defined in Section 288.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In essence, defendant contends these words state the name of a crime, i.e., the crime defined in section 288. Since defendant has not been convicted of violating section 288 in the counts at issue, because conviction on these counts did not require the specific intent necessary to a violation of section 288 (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Griffin </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1011, 1029-1030 [251 Cal.Rptr. 643, 761 P.2d 103]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pearson </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 351, 355 [228 Cal.Rptr. 509, 721 P.2d 595]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brocklehurst </em>(1971) 14 Cal.App.3d 473, 476 [92 Cal.Rptr. 340]), defendant says he has not been convicted of a \u201cviolent felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">The People contend subdivision (c)(6) of section 667.5 does not state the name of a crime. Rather, the People assert that the words, \u201cLewd acts on a child under 14 as defined in Section 288\u201d are directions; they tell the reader where to find a further definition of lewd acts. The People argue the statutory language commands the reader to look to section 288 to see what lewd acts are defined there. Thus, if a lewd act is \u201cdefined in section 288,\u201d it is a violent felony. The People note that subdivision (a) of section 288 provides in relevant part (as it did when defendant committed his crimes): <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u201cAny person who shall willfully and lewdly commit any lewd or lascivious act <em>including any of the acts constituting other crimes provided for in Part 1 of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>this code </em>upon or with the body, or any part of member thereof, of a child under the age of 14 years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires of such person or of such child, shall be guilty of a felony . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The People argue \u201cBoth . . . offenses, Penal Code section 286 (c) and 288a (c), are \u2018crimes\u2019 as provided in Part 1 of the Penal Code. Therefore, Counts 3, 4, 5, 24 and 25 are plainly \u2018violent felonies\u2019 within the meaning of section 667.5 (c)(6).\u201d Implicit in the People\u2019s argument is the assertion that the subject crimes were committed \u201cupon or with the body . . . of a child under the age of 14 years . . .\u201d as required by subdivision (a) of section 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">It thus appears that the meaning of subdivision (c)(6) of section 667.5 may change according to the perspective with which its language is viewed. For that reason, the statute is superficially ambiguous. However, closer analysis reveals the People\u2019s position is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Preliminarily we note that defendant\u2019s argument finds support in the language of subdivision (c) of section 667.5, read as a whole. Each of the subdivisions preceding (c)(6) clearly states the name of a felony crime, i.e., murder, mayhem, rape, sodomy and oral copulation. (See fn. 11, <em>ante.) </em>Moreover, \u201cLewd Act on Child Under 14\u201d is a name commonly given the crime defined by section 288. (See, e.g., Matthew Bender, The Standard California Codes (1988 ed.) Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.) Finally, defendant\u2019s construction accomplishes the announced purpose of the statute\u2014to identify certain felony offenses as \u201cviolent\u201d\u2014in a straightforward manner. Thus, if we construe subdivision (c)(6) in the context of the statute of which it is a part, as we are supposed to do <em>(People </em>v. <em>Woodhead </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1002, 1008 [239 Cal.Rptr. 656, 741 P.2d 154]), defendant\u2019s construction appears eminently plausible.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">If, as the People assert, the words \u201cLewd acts on a child under 14 as defined in section 288\u201d command us to look to section 288 to see what acts are defined there, then the plain language of that phrase would include <em>all </em>lewd acts defined in section 288, since the statutory language suggests no distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">The problem with having all lewd acts defined in section 288 be violent felonies is that either the acts must be accompanied by the specific intent specified in section 288 (\u201cthe intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions or sexual desires\u201d of the perpetrator or child) or else some acts otherwise embraced by section 288 would not be felonies. Although subdivision (a) of section 288 includes \u201cother crimes provided for in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Part I of this code upon or with the body . . . of a child . . . ,\u201d many of these crimes are misdemeanors. (E.g., battery; \u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (a).) Indeed, subdivision (a) of section 288 includes mere touchings which, in the absence of the requisite specific intent, are not crimes at all. (See, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Dontanville </em>(1970) 10 Cal.App.3d 783, 795 [89 Cal.Rptr. 172] [rubbing child\u2019s stomach].) Thus, Witkin makes the point that section 288 \u201cmay be violated by simple acts which are neither obviously sexual nor even obscene.\u201d (1 Witkin, Cal. Crimes (1963) \u00a7 549, p. 500.) Consequently, if we were to adopt the People\u2019s proposed interpretation of subdivision (c)(6) of section 667.5, in order to accomplish the aim of the statute\u2014the identification of violent felonies\u2014we would have to insist that the lewd acts defined in section 288 be accompanied by the specific intent that the latter statute by its plain language prescribes. (See p. 427, <em>ante.) </em>However, that would simply bring us back to where defendant started: with the crime defined by section 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In light of this analysis, we conclude the People\u2019s proposed interpretation of subdivision (c)(6) of section 667.5 is unreasonable.  \u201c[I]t is fundamental that a statute should not be interpreted in a manner that would lead to absurd results. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morris </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 1, 15 [249 Cal.Rptr. 119, 756 P.2d 843].)  Defendant\u2019s proposed construction is correct: subdivision (c)(6) states the name of the felony defined by section 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Since defendant was not convicted of section 288 (nor of any other violent felony) on counts 3, 4, 5, 24, or 25, the consecutive terms imposed on these counts must be stayed because they exceed the five-year limitation in subdivision (a) of section 1170.1. Also, since it appears the trial court imposed the maximum sentence allowed by law on all other counts, there is no need to remand to the trial court for resentencing. (Compare <em>People </em>v. <em>Savala </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 63 [195 Cal.Rptr. 193].) The sentences imposed on counts 3, 4, 5, 24, and 25 are hereby stayed, the stay to become permanent upon defendant\u2019s completion of his sentence on the unstayed counts. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Niles </em>(1964) 227 Cal.App.2d 749, 755-756 [39 Cal.Rptr. 11].)
