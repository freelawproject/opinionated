J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT1\">Michael Lynn Smith was convicted by jury of three counts of burglary. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury also found Smith suffered four prior serious felony convictions for \u201cburglary of a residence,\u201d each calling for a five-year enhancement pursuant to section 667. He contends three prior felony enhancements were improperly imposed. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>The facts need not be recounted in detail. On March 31, 1983, Smith burglarized a family residence. A second home was burglarized twice on April 6, 1983. At trial Smith admitted the March 31st burglary and one of the April 6th burglaries. The jury found Smith guilty of two counts of first degree residential burglary and one count of second degree burglary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">At the trial on the enhancements for prior burglaries the following evidence was produced:</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The August 16, 1967, Prior</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Smith pleaded guilty to second degree burglary; both the complaint and information alleged it was residential. On the <em>Tahl </em>form<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Smith admitted he entered the residence \u201cwith intent to commit theft.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The November 13, 1978, Prior</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Smith pleaded guilty to second degree burglary. The information alleged the burglary was residential; on the <em>Tahl </em>form Smith again admitted he entered a residence with intent to commit theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">The February 13, 1979, Prior</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Smith pleaded guilty to one count of second degree burglary alleged in the information to be residential. On the <em>Tahl </em>form Smith specifically admitted entering a residence with the intent to commit larceny, an admission he repeated at the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">Following trial on the 1983 burglaries Smith was sentenced to four years on one count; a consecutive term of one year and four months on the second burglary; three consecutive five-year terms for three residential burglary enhancements, and one concurrent five-year term for the remaining enhancement. The total sentence was 20 years and 4 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">In our opinion filed April 28, 1987, we affirmed Smith\u2019s conviction. We reversed the judgment imposing the enhancements, however, under the compulsion of <em>People </em>v. <em>Alfaro </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 627 [230 Cal.Rptr. 129, 724 P.2d 1154], A serious felony enhancement may only be imposed for convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tions under sections 667 and 1192.7, subdivision (c). <em>Alfaro </em>limited proof the felony was within that category to the abstract of judgment and \u201cmatters necessarily adjudicated therein.\u201d (42 Cal.3d at p. 636.) Consequently, we invalidated the findings Smith\u2019s prior convictions were serious felonies because the jury considered matters outside the judgment itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">Subsequently, the California Supreme Court accepted this matter for review and on April 21, 1988, transferred it to this court for reconsideration in light of <em>People </em>v. <em>Guerrero </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 343 [243 Cal.Rptr. 688, 748 P.2d 1150].</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">In <em>Guerrero, </em>our Supreme Court concluded a trier of fact is not limited to the abstract of judgment but may look to the entire record of conviction to determine whether the previous conviction involved burglary of a residence. The <em>Guerrero </em>court, however, did not resolve \u201csuch questions as what items in the record of conviction are admissible and for what purpose or whether on the peculiar facts of an individual case the application of the rule set forth herein might violate the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant.\u201d (44 Cal.3d at p. 356, fn. 1.) In his supplemental brief, Smith now raises these issues in an attempt to constrict the application of <em>Guerrero.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Smith contends that under <em>Guerrero </em>the trier of fact may consider only those items in the record of conviction that reveal the essential facts making the defendant\u2019s prior guilt res judicata. He claims his own admissions of residential burglaries were not essential to the judgment; second degree burglary did not then require proof the burglary was \u201cof a residence.\u201d Accordingly, Smith\u2019s prior admissions were mere surplusage because \u201c \u2018the prosecution had no need to prove, defendant no incentive to contest, and the trier of fact no duty to decide.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 343, 359, dis. opn. of Broussard, J.) On the same basis, he also challenges use of the charging documents to prove the prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">Smith\u2019s argument is based on the holding of <em>In re McVickers </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 264 [176 P.2d 40], cited by the <em>Guerrero </em>court as authority for the \u201centire record of conviction\u201d rule. In <em>McVickers, </em>the defendant contested a habitual criminal enhancement by attacking his prior convictions, including a federal conviction for forgery of postal money orders. The federal statute prohibited a series of activities, only some of which were felonies under California law. <em>McVickers </em>approved resort to the record of conviction to determine which section of the multi-offense statute was violated. <em>(In re McVickers, supra, </em>29 Cal.2d at pp. 280-281.)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number><em>McVickers </em>relied on <em>In re Taylor </em>(1944) 64 Cal.App.2d 47 [148 P.2d 143], where the defendant was convicted in North Carolina of two larceny counts, only one of which qualified as a felony in California. <em>Taylor </em>held the trier of fact could examine the record of conviction to determine whether one of the charges contained elements amounting to a felony in California. Based on these cases, Smith argues the trier of fact may only review the record of conviction for the essential fact of \u201cwhich count of a multi-count prosecution, or which paragraph of a multi-offense statute was involved in the allegation of the prior conviction.\u201d As a corollary, he claims facts not essential to the judgment are mere surplusage and cannot be considered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">Smith\u2019s strained analysis of <em>Guerrero </em>is not persuasive. In <em>Guerrero\u2019s </em>preface to the discussion of <em>Me Vickers </em>and its progeny, culminating with <em>In re Finley </em>(1968) 68 Cal.2d 389 [66 Cal.Rptr. 733, 438 P.2d 381], the court stated: \u201cThe question before us is whether <em>Finley </em>and its predecessors do in fact support the <em>Alfaro </em>holding. As will appear, the answer is negative.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 348.) The court did not intend to confine its holding to the facts of <em>McVickers-, </em>it merely reasoned that precedent failed to support <em>Alfaro\u2019s </em>conclusion proof of a prior conviction is limited to only those matters established by the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Moreover, Smith\u2019s analysis ignores the Supreme Court\u2019s distinction between a prior felony conviction and the enhancement under section 1192.7 for \u201cburglary of a residence\u201d; the court said the latter term refers to <em>conduct, </em>not a specific <em>crime. (People </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 355.) <em>Guerrero\u2019s </em>reliance on <em>In re Seeley </em>(1946) 29 Cal.2d 294 [176 P.2d 24] aptly demonstrates this principle. There, the defendant had been convicted in Oregon of \u201clarceny in a building.\u201d Viewed in the abstract the Oregon statute might\u2014but need not\u2014encompass a burglary, since larceny in a building could be committed by a person who formed the intent to steal post-entry. To decide whether the defendant had indeed committed a burglary in Oregon, the California Supreme Court in <em>Seeley </em>examined reports in the Oregon record that showed \u201cthe entry of the building involved had not been with an intent to steal or commit a felony.\u201d <em>(Id., </em>at p. 301.) Thus, although the evidence considered by the court in the record of conviction was not essential to the Oregon conviction, it disclosed the defendant\u2019s conduct fell outside the California burglary statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">In sum, the trier of fact may consider facts established within the record of conviction, even if those facts were not essential to the judgment.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Accordingly, the charging documents from Smith\u2019s prior convictions and his personal admissions in the <em>Tahl </em>forms may be admitted into evidence to prove Smith\u2019s prior burglaries were residential.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Smith contends the accusatory pleadings,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Tahl </em>forms, and transcript of the sentencing hearing should not be considered part of the record of conviction. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The <em>Guerrero </em>court did not state what items constitute the record of conviction. But we have no difficulty determining that charging allegations, <em>Tahl </em>forms and transcripts of the sentencing are included in any definition of \u201crecord of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Guerrero </em>itself concluded the trial court acted properly in examining records that \u201cincluded an accusatory pleading charging a residential burglary and defendant\u2019s plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\u201d (P<em>eople </em>v. <em>Guerrero, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 345.) Moreover, subsequent Court of Appeal decisions have validated the use of similar evidence, as well as the defendant\u2019s personal admission the burglary was residential. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Vasquez </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 1531 [252 Cal.Rptr. 331]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Carr </em>(1988) 204 Cal.App.3d 774, 778 [251 Cal.Rptr. 458]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Batista </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 1288, 1294 [248 Cal.Rptr. 46];<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Colbert </em>(1988) 198 Cal.App.3d 924, 930 [244 Cal.Rptr. 98].)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">During each of his prior convictions Smith offered the trial court a recitation of facts supporting his guilty plea: He admitted burglarizing a residence. Smith now contends this <em>Tahl </em>form factual basis is inherently unreliable because it was not constitutionally required and the reliability of a defendant\u2019s admission goes unchecked. We again disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">The reliability of Smith\u2019s <em>Tahl </em>form admissions is undiminished by the lack of constitutional compulsion. Other factors insure reliability. The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>court must make an on-the-record inquiry as to the factual basis for the plea <em>(People </em>v. <em>Tigner </em>(1982) 133 Cal.App.3d 430, 435 [184 Cal.Rptr. 61]), as was done in all three prior convictions. Moreover, Smith signed the <em>Tahl </em>forms under penalty of perjury, stating he understood the charges against him and the change of plea form. The records containing Smith\u2019s declarations against penal interest, on their face, disclose nothing <em>inherently </em>unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Even if the guilty pleas\u2019 factual bases were properly admitted to prove the prior convictions, Smith contends they did not establish the requisite \u201cinhabited dwelling\u201d component of residential burglary. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1969) 274 Cal.App.2d 912, 921 [79 Cal.Rptr. 650].) He argues mere use of the word \u201cresidence\u201d in the factual portion of the <em>Tahl </em>forms failed to prove the dwellings were inhabited but referred only to the purpose for which each structure was built.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">Smith\u2019s argument affects the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. The jury could reasonably conclude Smith used the term \u201cresidence\u201d in its most commonly accepted meaning, that of an inhabited dwelling. The charging documents for the crimes to which Smith pleaded guilty support this inference. The 1978 prior alleges the residence was <em>\u201coccupied </em>by Laurie and Janet Jazwiec\u201d; the 1979 prior alleges the residence was <em>\u201coccupied </em>by Louie Knight.\u201d Moreover, Smith was not barred from presenting evidence the burglaries were not residential; his motive to do so was strong, particularly since his trial occurred <em>pre-Alfaro. </em>In sum, sufficient evidence supports the verdict Smith suffered the prior convictions for residential burglary.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">VI-VIII<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Crosby, J., and Wallin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">A petition for a rehearing was denied December 15, 1988, and appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied March 16, 1989.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b337-11\">All statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise specified.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b338-15\">Smith\u2019s motion for new trial was granted on the second degree burglary.
