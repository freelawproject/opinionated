Cooke for reinstatement to the Bar of Maryland be, and the same is, hereby denied, by operation of Section 14 of the Maryland Constitution which provides, in pertinent part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Five of the judges shall constitute a quorum, and five judges shall sit in each case unless the Court shall direct that an additional judge or judges sit for any case. The concurrence of a majority of those sitting shall be sufficient for the decision of any cause, and an equal division of those sitting in a case has the effect of affirming the decision appealed from if there is no application for reargument as hereinafter provided. In any case where there is an equal division or a three to two division of the Court a reargument before the full Court of seven judges shall be granted to the losing party upon application as a matter of right.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">For purposes of applying this section to the matter at hand, the language \u201caffirming the decision appealed from\u201d is construed to refer here to Mr. Cooke\u2019s earlier disbarment (by consent). Thus, the failure of his petition for reinstatement to garner a majority of the sitting judges who participated in the final vote on his petition results in the denial of his petition and maintenance of his disbarment, subject to the reargument provisions of Section 14.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
