Out of those siblings, three brothers served as directors and officers of two family corporations, while the other five siblings were not actively involved in their management. After the death of one of the sisters, the corporations attempted to repurchase her stock pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement. The sister\u2019s estate refused on the grounds that the Agreement grossly undervalued the estate\u2019s shares. The corporations filed a declaratory judgment action, seeking enforcement of the Stock Purchase Agreement, and named the other, non-director siblings as defendants and interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-9\">Meanwhile, the non-director siblings had learned of an earlier stock transaction in which the three directors had acquired additional corporate stock for themselves. Aggrieved by this transaction, two of the non-director siblings sent a demand for litigation to the corporation, and shortly thereafter filed a derivative action in the Circuit Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Montgomery County, alleging self-dealing and a breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They also filed \u201cdirect\u201d claims, as cross-claims in the declaratory judgment action, on related grounds to the derivative action.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In response, the corporations appointed a special litigation committee (\u201cSLC\u201d), consisting of two newly hired \u201cindependent directors,\u201d to examine the claims. After an extended study, the SLC issued a report concluding that the stock transactions were legitimate and that the Stock Purchase Agreement was enforceable. The Circuit Court, deferring to the judgment of the SLC, granted summary judgment in favor of the corporations on the derivative action. In the declaratory judgment proceeding, the Circuit Court, relying on <em>res judicata, </em>dismissed the cross-claims and granted summary judgment to the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">On appeal in the derivative action, the Court of Special Appeals upheld the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, agreeing that the SLC\u2019s report resolved that matter. The two non-director siblings sought <em>certiorari </em>from this Court, which we granted. <em>See </em>417 Md. 500, 10 A.3d 1180 (2010). At the same time, we granted <em>certiorari </em>in the declaratory judgment action, which had been pending in the Court of Special Appeals. The questions presented for review in these two cases are as follows, rephrased for brevity and clarity:<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>1) In the derivative action, did the Circuit Court apply the correct standard of review when it analyzed the report of the Special Litigation Committee under the Business Judgment Rule and awarded summary judgment in favor of the Respondents, thus rejecting Petitioners\u2019 claim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">2) Are the Petitioners\u2019 \u201cdirect\u201d claims, brought as cross-claims in the declaratory judgment action, precluded by <em>res judicata </em>or otherwise resolved by the Special Litigation Committee report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-6\">3) In the declaratory judgment action, did the Circuit Court err in holding that the stock purchase agreements were enforceable and granting summary judgment to Respondents?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>In the derivative action (Circuit Court Case # 2821S8-V, Appellate No. 123), we shall reject the Petitioners\u2019 suggestion that Maryland courts should apply their \u201cindependent business judgment\u201d and review the SLC\u2019s substantive conclusions. Instead, we shall adhere to the business judgment rule as applied in <em>Auerbach </em>and limit the judicial investigation of an SLC report to the issues of whether the SLC was independent, acted in good faith based on facts, and followed reasonable procedures. Even under this more limited inquiry, however, we shall reverse the Circuit Court, as the court made an inadequate inquiry into the SLC\u2019s independence and the reasonableness of its procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">In the declaratory judgment action, (Circuit Court Case # 273284-V; Appellate No. 123) we shall affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Respondents on the contract issue, because we agree that the Stock Purchase Agreement in this case was supported by adequate consideration and was enforceable. We shall, however, reverse the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with regard to Petitioners\u2019 cross-claims (the direct action). The court based its summary judgment solely on the grounds that the Petitioner\u2019s cross-claims were barred by the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>because of its resolution in the derivative action. As we explain below, the resolution of a derivative claim is not necessarily a factual resolution of the merits of the claim, and the Petitioners stated a separate, individual cause of action regarding allegedly oppressive actions by the majority shareholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>1. The Boland Family Business</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">In the early 1960s, Louis Boland Sr., the patriarch of the Boland family, entered into a franchise agreement with the Trane Company to be its exclusive sales agent in the greater Washington, D.C., market. Boland established Boland Trane Associates (\u201cBTA\u201d), to sell and distribute Trane\u2019s heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment, and Boland Trane <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>Services, Inc. (\u201cBTS\u201d), to handle services and repairs.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Boland served as the chairman of the board and president of both corporations, and along with his wife, Maureen, owned all the stock in the companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">During the 19.60s, Boland<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> gave stock to each of his eight children: Colleen, Louis Jr., Sean, James, John, Kevin, Michael, and Eileen.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Later, at Boland\u2019s request, each child signed a Stock Purchase Agreement (\u201cSPA\u201d), which restricted their rights regarding the stocks. Specifically, the SPA required the children to offer the stock to the corporations at book value before selling to anyone else, and provided for a corporate repurchase of the stock upon the death of any of the children at book value plus 25 percent. Mr. Boland died on September 7, 2003. Before his death, Boland had set out his desired succession plan in a \u201cLetter of Instruction.\u201d Pursuant to the terms of that letter, Sean became chairman of the boards and CEO of BTA and BTS, James became president and chief operating officer, and Louis, Jr. became executive vice president and chief marketing officer. The letter also directed Lawrence Cain to become senior vice president and the chief financial officer. At all times relevant in this case, Sean, James, and Louis Jr. served on the boards of BTA and BTS along with Cain.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Under the new management, BTS and BTA continued to be profitable. In 2004, the corporations issued almost $5 million in dividends to the shareholders, and in 2005, the dividends increased to almost $6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>\n<em>2. The Stock Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">The dispute centers on a series of stock transactions, the first of which was a corporate repurchase of Mrs. Boland\u2019s stock. After Mr. Boland\u2019s death, Mrs. Boland owned a 20 percent share in BTS. Seeking to reduce her eventual estate for tax purposes, and to secure a more stable source of income, Mrs. Boland negotiated with BTS to exchange her stock in return for the purchase of an annuity. On June 25, 2004, she sold her holdings in BTS back to the corporation, and the corporation purchased her an annuity which provided a monthly payment of $28,544.70 for life.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">After the repurchase of Mrs. Boland\u2019s stock, the director siblings designed a series of stock purchases that would give them an increased share in BTA and BTS. First, in January 2005, BTS approved a sale of 75,075 shares to Sean\u2019s son, Sean Jr., and 151,150 shares to James, all at the price of $2.16 per share.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Then, in April 2005, BTA approved a sale of 282 shares of BTA to Lawrence Cain, 70 shares to Sean Jr., 566 shares to James, and 282 shares to Louis Jr., all at a price of $508 per share.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">After these transactions, the Directors and Sean Jr. all had an increased ownership in the corporations. Sean Jr., who previously owned no stock in either corporation, now held just under 2 percent in each company. James increased his share of BTS by approximately 3 percent, and his share in BTA by 14 percent. Louis Jr. and Lawrence Cain each increased their share in BTA by approximately 7 percent. The boards approved the stock sales, retroactively, on April 4, 2005, at a meeting attended by Sean, James, Louis Jr., and Cain.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The Board\u2019s stated purpose in approving these transactions was to compensate the corporations\u2019 directors and to increase their management share to a level comparable to similar corporations. The Board recognized a \u201cneed for management incentives for both short-term financial results as well as long-term growth of shareholder value[,]\u201d and \u201cacknowledged [that] it was most desirable to continue the employment of the [Directors] and adequately compensate them for their efforts and reward them for their accomplishments.\u201d In order to accomplish these goals, \u201cthe Board agreed it was critical that the compensation plan include an appropriate ownership interest in the Corporation\u2019s stock.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">The Boards structured the payments for these stocks in a way that required no money up front. Instead, in exchange for the stocks, the recipients gave promissory notes with nine-year terms and a set interest rate. At the rate the corporations were issuing dividends, these newly issued stocks would eventually pay for themselves.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\n<em>S. Dispute over the Transactions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The directors\u2019 stock purchases came to the attention of the non-director siblings, specifically John and Kevin, in June 2005.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> From that point, relations between the two factions of siblings quickly deteriorated.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The straw that broke the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>camel\u2019s back, and brought the whole family into court, was the corporations\u2019 attempt to exercise their rights under the SPA, after the death of Colleen.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Colleen died on June 7, 2006, and the corporations sent notice of their intention to repurchase the stocks on June 16, 2006. The valuation of her stock, pursuant to the stock purchase agreement, was significantly lower than some estimations of its market value. Upset at the low valuation of the stock, Colleen\u2019s personal representative resisted the corporations\u2019 attempts.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On July 19, 2006, the Respondents filed a complaint for declaratory judgment, seeking to enforce the repurchase provisions in Colleen\u2019s SPA, naming all the Boland siblings as defendants/interested parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Ten months later, on May 1, 2007, John and Kevin responded on two fronts. First, they filed a cross-claim in the corporation\u2019s declaratory judgment action, alleging breach of fiduciary duty, self-dealing, and oppression from threats to enforce buy-back provisions in the SPAs. This was a \u201cdirect\u201d action. Second, after sending the requisite demand for litigation to the corporations, John and Kevin filed a derivative complaint, on behalf of both BTS and BTA, naming Sean, James, Louis, and Lawrence Cain as the defendants.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>allegations included fraudulent conduct, oppression of minority shareholders, and breaches of the duties of good faith and loyalty, and they requested, inter alia, rescission of the stock transactions, compensatory damages, attorney\u2019s fees, and dissolution of the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Maryland courts have distinguished between direct and derivative claims by looking at the nature of the right claimed to be violated, and the remedy sought. In <em>Shenker v. Laureate Educ., Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 983 A.2d 408 (2009), for example, the shareholders brought claims after the corporation approved a cash-out merger, alleging that the directors \u201cviolated the fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of value\u201d resulting in \u201ca lesser value that shareholders received for their shares in the cash-out merger[.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 346, 983 A.2d at 425. We held that claim to be direct, as the fiduciary claims were \u201cbased on a breach owed directly to the shareholder!],]\u201d and the injury was \u201csuffered solely by the shareholders and not by [the] corporate entity.... A higher or lower price received by shareholders for their shares in the cash-out merger in no way implicated [the corporation\u2019s] interests and causes no harm to the corporation.\u201d <em>Id., </em>411 Md. at 346-47, 983 A.2d at 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">More generally, we have recognized the fundamental differences between a direct claim and a derivative claim. The derivative suit involves a <em>corporate right, </em>a distinction underlying many of the derivative action\u2019s peculiar procedures and standards of review. <em>See, e.g., Werbowsky v. Collomb, </em>362 Md. 581, 600, 766 A.2d 123, 133 (2001) (\u201cThe fact that the action is on behalf of the corporation, rather than the shareholder, has significant implications, not the least of which is the extent to which the corporation can control the litigation after it is filed.\u201d); <em>see also Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 344, 983 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>at 424 (\u201cIn a derivative action, any recovery belongs to the corporation, not the plaintiff shareholder.\u201d); 12B William Meade Fletcher, et al, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 5921 (2009 Rev. Vol.) (\u201cA shareholder may sue as an individual where the act complained of creates not only a cause of action in favor of a corporation but also creates a cause of action in favor of the shareholder as an individual ... and under certain circumstances, <em>even if the shareholders are unable to get relief on behalf of the corporation, their individual wrongs are not without remedy.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">One advantage a derivative action has for the shareholder is that the expenses of the litigation, if successful, may be borne by the corporation, not the shareholder: \u201cIn direct, as opposed to derivative actions, each side will normally be responsible for its own legal expenses. Costs and expenses of bringing a successful derivative action are usually available for the plaintiff-shareholder, and some jurisdictions may provide by statute for the recovery of attorney\u2019s fees in derivative actions.\u201d Fletcher, <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 5938. In Maryland, recovery of attorney\u2019s fees is permitted under the \u201ccommon fund\u201d doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Hess Constr. Co. v. Board of Educ., </em>341 Md. 155, 168, 669 A.2d 1352, 1358 (1996) (observing that the common fund theory, allowing reasonable recovery of fees for a successful plaintiff, is allowed \u201cwhere a stockholder\u2019s derivative action benefitted all of the shareholders\u201d) (citing <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>73 Md. 530, 21 A. 712 (1891)).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The \u201cdirect\u201d claim alleged by John and Kevin is that the majority shareholders oppressed them and threatened to squeeze them out of the company. In <em>Edenbaum v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number><em>Schwarcz-Osztreicherne, </em>165 Md.App. 233, 885 A.2d 365 (2005), Judge Krauser described a similar claim of oppression:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvS\">\u201cOppressive\u201d conduct is not defined by the statute. But, as it is singled out as a separate category of conduct justifying corporate dissolution by Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 3-413(b)(2), we surmise that it does not necessarily involve \u201cfraudulent\u201d or \u201cillegal\u201d conduct. \u201cOppressive\u201d conduct has been described by other jurisdictions as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">burdensome, harsh and wrongful conduct; a lack of probity and fair dealing in the affairs of a company to the prejudice of some of its members; or a visual departure from the standards of fair dealing, and a violation of fair play on which every shareholder who entrusts his money to a company is entitled to rely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">\u201cOppression,\u201d however, has also been defined by one Maryland commentator as \u201cconduct that substantially defeats the reasonable expectations of a stockholder.\u201d James J. Hanks, Jr. Maryland Corporation Law \u00a7 11.7(b) (1990, 2004 Supp.). Or, in the more precise terminology of one of our sister states, \u201cconduct that substantially defeats the \u2018reasonable expectations\u2019 held by minority shareholders in committing their capital to the particular enterprise.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 885 A.2d at 377-78. The \u201cdirect\u201d suit, alleging oppression, requested dissolution of the corporations, and any recovery would have run directly to John and Kevin.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The derivative suit, on the other hand, alleged injury to the corporation. At oral argument, the Petitioners asserted that, because of the stock purchases by the directors, the corporation was deprived of assets, that is, corporate treasury stock that it could have sold to third-parties for fair market value, an amount the Petitioners allege was much greater than the price paid by the director siblings.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The two cases were consolidated by the Circuit Court on June 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">J. <em>The Special Litigation Committee</em></p>\n<p id=\"AFU\">The corporations appointed two outside, independent directors to the Special Litigation Committee, at a May 2007 meeting of the Boards of Directors. These new directors had no business relationship with the corporations. Each had significant experience in corporate matters.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The new directors hired another attorney to serve as the SLC\u2019s independent counsel.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> On October 3, 2007, by motion of the corporation, the Circuit Court stayed the consolidated action to allow the SLC an opportunity to investigate the derivative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The SLC investigated the issues presented in the derivative complaint, as well as an issue it apparently raised on its own: whether John and Kevin were \u201cadequate shareholder representatives.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals summarized the SLC\u2019s investigation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-6\">[T]he SLC\u2019s investigation took five months.... The SLC met with Michael, Eileen, John, Kevin, Cain, Louis, Jr., James, Heise, Sean, Jr., Sean, and counsel for Maureen. The interviews were at least 45 minutes and lasted up to 5 hours, with the longest interviews being with [John and Kevin]. The interviews were conducted separately and with the interviewees signing confidentiality agreements, to promote frankness. The SLC also gave counsel for the appellants and for the corporations the opportunity to submit memoranda stating their differing positions. Counsel for the corporations submitted such a memorandum, while counsel for [John and Kevin] submitted the complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>derivative action. Pursuant to a request by [an SLC director, John and Kevin\u2019s] attorney met with the SLC to discuss the allegations in the derivative suit. The SLC reviewed and summarized a total of 131 documents in the course of its investigation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><em>Boland v. Boland, </em>194 Md.App. 477, 512-13, 5 A.3d 106, 127 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">After this investigation, the SLC concluded that \u201cnone of the derivative claims have merit and the actions on behalf of the corporations should be terminated.\u201d The SLC first found that \u201ceach individual\u2019s salary is commensurate with his education, experience, position, and\u2019 tenure with the company.\u201d The SLC also approved of the stock sales to the directors, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-8\">The enhancement of control is a positive benefit for the corporations. The SLC finds those transactions to be well within the business judgment rule and done in good faith for the benefit of the corporation. <em>See Cummings v. United Artists Theater [Theatre </em>] <em>Circuit, Inc., </em>237 Md. 1, 22, 204 A.2d 795 (1964); <em>Mountain Manor Realty, Inc. v. Buccheri, </em>55 Md.App. 185, 198, 461 A.2d 45, 53 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-9\">But an issue of the stock that has the collateral effect of enhancing the power of incumbent management is not invalid if the transaction has its principal purpose some proper corporate goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 197,] 461 A.2d at 52 (quoting <em>Heit v. Baird, </em>567 F.2d 1157, 1161 (1st Cir.1977)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">Further, the price received for those shares is more than in dollars. It rewards and expects services to be performed for the corporation. The law is well settled that a corporation may receive payment in any form that it may lawfully purchase property. To give stock in whole or in part for return for services is certainly well accepted and within the business judgment rule.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-12\">The SLC finds that the price paid for the stock was appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>Then the SLC moved on to the issue of \u201cadequate representation.\u201d The SLC concluded that John and Kevin were not adequate representatives of the shareholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-4\">[T]he majority shareholders disagree with [John and Kevin] and it is therefore obvious that they do not adequately represent all of the shareholders. In addition, it is clear that the derivative claims appear to be pursued for reasons other than their merit. [John and Kevin\u2019s] purpose seems to be to gain leverage in their personal efforts to change the provisions of the SPAs or obtain new agreements with terms they desire to further their perception of personal and family purposes in the future ownership and management of the corporations. [For example, Kevin Boland] described] his views and purportedly those of [John] as well that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-5\">There is real resentment that Jimmy has so much power on whether the company ever gets sold. Jimmy has told some of us that it is his dream to someday run the family business. For the younger half of the family, his dream is our nightmare.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-6\">These views are directly opposite those of Louis Boland, Sr.[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The SLC concluded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">The duty that is owed by the Director defendants is defined in Md.Code Ann., Corps. <em>&amp; </em>Ass\u2019ns, \u00a7 2-405.1 to act in: (1) good faith (2) in the best interests of the corporation (3) in a manner that an ordinarily prudent person in like or similar circumstances would exercise. The SLC finds the conduct of the Defendants to have met this standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The SLC submitted this report to the Circuit Court on February 1, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">\n<em>5. The Derivative Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">After the submission for the SLC\u2019s report, the Circuit Court severed the derivative action from the declaratory judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>action. In the severed derivative action,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the corporations moved to dismiss, based on the SLC report, on February 11, 2008. John and Kevin requested the court to review the SLC report under an \u201centire fairness\u201d standard, while the corporations argued that the business judgment rule should apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">On September 5, 2008, the Circuit Court denied the motion to dismiss.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Circuit Court first stated its standard of review:<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">In reviewing the findings and conclusion of the [SLC], the [SLC] is entitled to the benefit of the Business Judgment Rule. If, however, the transaction being evaluated by the Committee is one in which directors are \u2018on both sides of the transaction,\u2019 then the Court must apply the \u201centire fairness standard.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">[T]he factual determinations to be made by the court are (1) were the [SLC] members independent and did they perform their duties in good faith?; (2) did the [SLC] undertake a reasonable investigation of plaintiffs derivative claims?; and (3) are the findings and conclusion of the [SLC] reasonable? (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-8\">Reviewing the SLC\u2019s procedure under this standard, the Circuit Court concluded that the SLC was independent, performed its duties in good faith, and made a reasonable investigation. Turning to the third step, the court analyzed whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>the SLC made reasonable findings and conclusions on each individual count. The Circuit Court determined that the SLC\u2019s conclusion on the executive compensation was reasonable.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Then, however, the court denied the corporations\u2019 motion to dismiss so far as it pertained to the purchase by the corporations of Maureen Boland\u2019s stock, concluding that the SLC did not undertake a reasonable investigation with respect those allegations. The Circuit Court thus granted the corporations\u2019 motion to dismiss \u201cwith the exception of the claim against Defendant Cain and the purchase by the corporations of the shares of Maureen Boland stock from her estate.\u201d The corporations filed a motion for reconsideration, arguing that the Circuit Court erred in applying an \u201centire fairness\u201d test, and that the court should instead adhere to the business judgment rule. Without a hearing, the Circuit Court issued (1) an order granting the motion for reconsideration, and (2) a memorandum opinion granting summary judgment.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court applied the business judgment rule, as opposed to an entire fairness test, to the counts which survived the September 5, 2008, order. The court\u2019s analysis, under the business judgment rule, of the subject corporate actions is, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">Compensation of Lawrence J. Cain, Jr.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-6\">The finding by this Court that the compensation of Director Cain was not addressed by the SLC is also in error.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>The compensation of Cain and the other Directors was addressed by the SLC, whose decision must be reviewed under the business judgment standard. The application of the standard is clearly bolstered by the report of the SLC and the compensation of Director Cain is found by this Court to come within the standard. The Motion to Dismiss shall be granted in favor of Cain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">The Propriety of the Stock Purchase and Sale to Interested Directors</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">There are two stock transactions at the center of the claim contained in the Counter-Claim. In January, 2005 BTS sold James and Sean Jr. authorized but not issued stock. Then in April, 2005, a sale of BTA stock to Cain was authorized. The defendants, John and Kevin, seek a rescission of the stock sale.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-7\">The sale of the stock was a part of an overall executive compensation plan. <em>Bender, supra, </em>is cited in support of the exercise of deference to the board\u2019s decisions as to the levels of compensation under the business judgment rule. The sale and grant of stock meets this test. John and Kevin have not alleged fraud or deceit in the Counter-Complaint which requires the examination by the Court of the process, scope, and thoroughness of work performed by the SLC. This aspect was fully discussed in the original Memorandum Opinion. Given the standard of review, this Court concludes that the transactions fall within the Business Judgment Standard and will not be set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">The Circuit Court thus granted summary judgment on all counts.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\n<em>6. The Declaratory Judgment Action</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">After judgments against the plaintiffs in the derivative action, all that remained in the Circuit Court was the corporations\u2019 action for declaratory judgment, and John and Kevin\u2019s cross-claims and counterclaims, in Case #273284-V.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In particular, the Circuit Court asked the parties to brief whether resolution of the derivative claim also ended the \u201cdirect\u201d dispute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">And what will be interesting to me is the right of individuals to bring an oppression claim when a derivative action is already decided in a case.... So it\u2019s a very intense examination of the pleading and the decisions made thus far ... ? Is it a separate claim or different claim from the derivative claim?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">At a hearing on April 16, 2009, the two parties disputed whether the derivative claim could preclude direct claims based on similar factual events and allegations. The corporations argued that John and Kevin\u2019s claims were precluded by <em>res judicata, </em>because of the court\u2019s resolution of similar factual allegations in the derivative matter, stating at a hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUn\">[There are] no new allegations at all being raised in the amended counter-claim or in the cross-claim concerning oppression that weren\u2019t already raised. The conduct, the bad conduct on the part of the defendants was examined, it was alleged, it was litigated, it was examined by the [SLC,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>and the [SLC] came up with some findings and found that there was no merit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">The Court later agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-5\">But the point I\u2019m making is that if the [SLC], within the proper context of the operation of [an SLC], did make judgments about whether the board had acted improperly and had oppressed all stockholders, [then] why isn\u2019t that ultimately a <em>res judicata </em>binding decision that I have made by endorsing the SLC?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">The Court\u2019s persuaded that the derivative claims have been fairly decided and that opinion speaks for itself and that\u2019s on appeal and I do not intend, as part of this action, to permit any revisiting of those issues.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">To that end, the Court ... grant[s] the [Respondents\u2019] motion to dismiss ... the cross-claim with leave to amend.... [John and Kevin] will be permitted to re-file ... [but you] must identify specific oppression of Kevin and John.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">... I intend to scrutinize any [additional claims] by John and Kevin, and if I determine that it is in essence a restatement of the derivative claims, it\u2019s going to go out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhY\">The Court concluded at the hearing that <em>res judicata </em>could apply and dismissed all of John and Kevin\u2019s \u201cdirect\u201d claims, but it granted them leave to amend their complaints one final time to demonstrate an individual cause of action separate from the derivative claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">After John and Kevin filed an amended Counter-Claim on May 12, 2009, the court held a hearing on July 30, 2009, to consider whether any could survive <em>res judicata. </em>The court again concluded that John and Kevin had failed to present distinct claims from the derivative action:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-10\">I find that there was a final judgment, the claims are virtually identical, the parties are the same ... and there, is adequate relief under the declaratory judgment action so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>that it\u2019s not, dismissal does not then become prejudicial to [John and Kevin], And accordingly the court determines then that the second amended counterclaim and amended cross-claim should be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Having dismissed the direct claims of John and Kevin, the court finally turned to the dispute over the enforceability of the Stock Purchase Agreements. After a hearing, the court granted the Respondents\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Finding the SPAs to be \u201cplain and unambiguous[,]\u201d supported by consideration, and still valid despite Louis Sr.\u2019s death, the court ordered Colleen\u2019s estate to abide by the redemption clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">John and Kevin filed an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, and while that action was pending we granted a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">The first issue before the Court is the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the defendants in the derivative action. We begin with a brief discussion of judicial review of derivative actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">The common law tailored the derivative action to be a \u201cjustifiable, but limited, intrusion upon the general authority of the directors to manage the business affairs of the corporation.\u201d <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 602, 766 A.2d at 135. As an exception to the general rule that \u201cthe business and affairs of a corporation are managed under the direction of its board of directors[,]\u201d the derivative action is an \u201cextraordinary equitable device to enable shareholders to enforce a corporate right\u201d in certain circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 598-99, 766 A.2d at 133. \u201cThe purpose of the derivative action is to place in the hands of the individual shareholder a means to protect the interests of the corporation from the misfeasance and malfeasance of faithless directors and managers.\u201d <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 342, 983 A.2d at 423 (quotation marks and citations omitted). Despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>role given the shareholder, the \u201ccorporation is the real party in interest and ... [t]he substantive claim belongs to the corporation[.]\u201d <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 599-600, 766 A.2d at 133 (quoting 13 William Meade Fletcher, et al, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations, </em>\u00a7 5941.10 (1995 Rev. Vol.)). The derivative suit thus balances the interests of the shareholders with those of the corporation and its directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">The main levers with which the courts maintain this balance are varying levels of judicial scrutiny of corporate decisions. The default standard is the deferential business judgment rule, which insulates \u201cthe business decisions made by the director from judicial review[.]\u201d <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 344, 983 A.2d at 424. The Delaware Supreme Court, in a popular formulation of the rule, described it as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-6\">It is a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company. Absent an abuse of discretion, that judgment will be respected by the courts. The burden is on the party challenging the decision to establish facts rebutting the presumption.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-7\"><em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 812 (Del.1984) (citations omitted), <em>overruled on other grounds by Brehm v. Eisner, </em>746 A.2d 244 (Del.2000); <em>see also Della Ratta v.

This standard recognizes that the \u201cconduct of the corporation\u2019s affairs are placed in the hands of the board of directors and if the majority of the board properly exercises its business judgment, the directors are not ordinarily liable.\u201d <em>Devereux v. Berger, </em>264 Md. 20, 31-32, 284 A.2d 605, 612 (1971) (quoting <em>Parish v. Md. &amp; Va.

The protection of the business judgment rule \u201ccan be claimed only by \u2018disinterested directors whose conduct otherwise meets the tests of business judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 609, 766 A.2d at 138 (quoting <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 812). \u201c[T]his means that directors can neither appear on both sides of a transaction nor expect to derive any personal financial benefit from it in the sense of self-dealing, as opposed to a benefit which devolves upon the corporation or all stockholders generally.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A shareholder may \u201cshow either that the board or committee\u2019s investigation or decision was not conducted independently and in good faith, or that it was not within the realm of sound business judgment.\u201d <em>Bender v. Schwartz, </em>172 Md.App. 648, 666, 917 A.2d 142, 152 (2007). If the shareholder makes this showing, she may avoid the dangerous terrain of the business judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">This approach, where courts defer to corporate decisions generally, but inquire into the method, process, and self-interest of the decision makers, applies \u201cto all decisions regarding the corporation\u2019s management.\u201d <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 344, 983 A.2d at 424 (citing <em>NAACP v. Golding, </em>342 Md. 663, 673, 679 A.2d 554, 559 (1996)). In a derivative lawsuit, this includes a corporate decision on whether the case should proceed, as \u201cany exercise of the corporate power to institute litigation and the control of any litigation to which the corpo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ration becomes a party rests with the directors[.]\u201d <em>Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 599, 766 A.2d at 133. Thus, the common law developed a requirement that the derivative plaintiff, at the outset, seek a corporate decision on whether to maintain a lawsuit, a prerequisite known as the \u201cdemand requirement.\u201d <em>See Waller v. Waller, </em>187 Md. 185, 192, 49 A.2d 449, 453 (1946) (observing that a stockholder must \u201callege and prove he requested the directors to institute suit in the name of the corporation, and they refused\u201d); <em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 343-44, 983 A.2d at 423 (describing demand requirement as one of \u201ca number of procedural hurdles [the derivative plaintiff must overcome to] demonstrate that he or she, rather than the corporation itself, should control the litigation\u201d). <em>See generally Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. 581, 766 A.2d 123 (discussing changes in the demand requirement and the futility exception).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-4\">Once demand is made, the corporation\u2019s board of directors must conduct an investigation into the allegations in the demand and determine whether pursuing the demanded litigation is in the best interests of the corporation. If the corporation, after investigation, fails to take the action requested by the shareholder, the shareholder may bring a \u2018demand refused\u2019 action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\"><em>Shenker, </em>411 Md. at 344, 983 A.2d at 423-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">Judicial review of a demand refusal is subject to the business judgment rule, and the court considering a demand refused action limits its review to whether the board acted independently, in good faith, and within \u201cthe realm of sound business judgment.\u201d <em>See George Wasserman &amp; Janice Wasserman Goldsten Family LLC v. Kay, </em>197 Md.App. 586, 611, 14 A.3d 1193, 1208 (2011) (citing <em>Bender, </em>172 Md.App. at 666, 917 A.2d at 152) (\u201cTo determine whether the board wrongly refused to bring suit, courts review the board\u2019s investigation under the strict business judgment rule. Under that rule, courts [generally] defer to the board or committee\u2019s decision not to bring suit[.]\u201d). \u201cThe plaintiff can still allege that the board, in fact, did not act independently, or that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>board\u2019s refusal to bring suit was wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the plaintiff can successfully show that the subject decision was not the product of sound business judgment, the reviewing court may allow the derivative suit to proceed.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Of course, the reality is that many business dealings are approved by directors who are not entirely disinterested; those dealings thus may not be entitled to deference on their decisions regarding a derivative lawsuit. Rather than stripping such transactions of the business judgment rule\u2019s protection, courts have recognized a vehicle, usually known as a special litigation committee (\u201cSLC\u201d), through which corporations can retain a voice in the derivative lawsuit despite the adverse interests of board members. <em>See generally Gall v. Exxon Corp., </em>418 F.Supp. 508 (S.D.N.Y.1976) (recognizing that a committee of disinterested directors, to whom the corporation delegates decision-making ability, may make a decision to dismiss derivative litigation). An SLC, composed of independent, disinterested directors, either inside the corporation or specially appointed from outside the corporation, is vested with the authority to render a corporate decision. By isolating the tainted directors and delegating the corporation\u2019s decision-making ability to an independent committee, the directors may be able to insulate themselves from a derivative lawsuit. In general, the use of SLCs has spread and is now widely recognized, and it is not disputed that an SLC may recommend termination of a derivative lawsuit. <em>See, e.g., Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 619, 766 A.2d at 144 (observing that the use of special litigation committees has become a \u201ccommon practice\u201d) (citing, <em>inter alia, Burks v. Lasker, </em>441 U.S. 471, 99 S.Ct. 1831, 60 L.Ed.2d 404 (1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b381-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">A more disputed question is how rigorously a court should review that recommendation. One approach, commonly referred to as the <em>Auerbach </em>approach, after the case <em>Auerbach v. Bennett, </em>47 N.Y.2d 619, 419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d 994 (1979), treats the SLC\u2019s decision like other corporate decisions, and engages in limited review under the business judgment rule. Another approach, known as the <em>Zapata </em>approach, after the Delaware case <em>Zapata Corp. v. Maldonado, </em>430 A.2d 779 (Del.Supr.1980), provides an additional layer of scrutiny. In this appeal, Petitioners have criticized the <em>Auerbach </em>approach and requested this Court to adopt the <em>Zapata </em>approach instead. We discuss these two divergent approaches before considering the Petitioners\u2019 specific claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In <em>Auerbach, </em>shareholders of a corporation brought a derivative action regarding certain illegal foreign payments made by the corporation. <em>See Auerbach, </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 997. In response, the corporation appointed an SLC to consider the claims.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> After the SLC concluded, in a report to the trial court, that it was not in the corporations\u2019 best interest to pursue the lawsuit, the court granted summary judgment on the derivative complaint. <em>Id., </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1000.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">On appeal, the appellate court concluded that the SLC\u2019s decision fell under the business judgment rule, explaining that the \u201cultimate substantive decision ... not to pursue the claims advanced in the shareholders\u2019 derivative actions ... falls squarely within the embrace of the business judgment doctrine ... [and] is outside the scope of our review.\u201d <em>Id., </em>419 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1002. In support of this conclusion, the <em>Auerbach </em>court recognized that the decision to pursue a derivative action involves \u201cthe weighing and balancing of legal, ethical, commercial, promotional, public relations, fiscal and other factors familiar to the resolution of many if not most corporate problems.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court further recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">[C]ourts are ill equipped and infrequently called on to evaluate what are and must be essentially business judgments. The authority and responsibilities vested in corporate directors both by statute and decisional law proceed on the assumption that inescapably there can be no available objective standard by which the correctness of every corporate decision may be measured, by the courts or otherwise. Even if that were not the case, by definition the responsibility for business judgments must rest with the corporate directors; their individual capabilities and experience peculiarly qualify them for the discharge of that responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-6\"><em>Id., </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d 994 at 1000. A more limited inquiry into methodologies and procedures, the court observed, was well within the domain of the judicial system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ash\">As to the methodologies and procedures best suited to the conduct of an investigation of facts and the determination of legal liability, the courts are well equipped by long and continuing experience and practice to make determinations. In fact they are better qualified in this regard than are corporate directors in general. Nor do the determinations to be made in the adoption of procedures partake of the nuances or special perceptions or comprehensions of business judgment or corporate activities or interests. The question is solely how appropriately to set about to gather the pertinent data.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\"><em>Id., </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d 994 at 1002. The <em>Auerbach </em>rule, like the business judgment rule generally, carves out a limited role of judicial review, and allows a \u201ctainted\u201d board of directors to reclaim the protection of the business judgment rule through the appointment of an SLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>One year later, Delaware emerged with an alternative standard in the landmark <em>Zapata </em>case. As in <em>Auerbach, </em>the <em>Zapata </em>court considered the appropriate standard of review of an SLC\u2019s conclusion that a derivative lawsuit should be dismissed.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The <em>Zapata </em>court perceived a shortcoming in allowing the corporation to completely regain the business judgment rule through a special litigation committee in such an action. Specifically, the court thought the <em>Auerbach </em>approach, in a demand refused action, failed to adequately protect shareholders, and that the SLC\u2019s decision needed \u201cfresh view of a judicial outsider[.]\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> <em>Zapata, </em>430 A.2d at 788. The <em>Zapata </em>court summarized this new standard, which it termed its \u201cindependent business judgment,\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Whether the Court of Chancery will be persuaded by the exercise of a committee power resulting in a summary motion for dismissal of a derivative action, where a demand has not been initially made, should rest, in our judgment, in the independent discretion of the Court of Chancery. We thus steer a middle course between those cases which yield to the independent business judgment of a board committee and this case as determined below which would yield to unbridled plaintiff stockholder control. In pursuit of the course, we recognize that the final substantive judgment whether a particular lawsuit should be maintained requires a balance of many factors \u2014 ethical, commercial, promotional, public relations, employee relations, fiscal as well as legal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">[When presented with a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment based on an SLC\u2019s conclusion] [t]he Court should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>determine, applying its own independent business judgment, whether the motion should be granted. This means, of course, that instances could arise where a committee can establish its independence and sound bases for its good faith decisions and still have the corporation\u2019s motion denied. [This independent review] is intended to thwart instances where corporate actions meet the criteria of [business judgment rule], but the result does not appear to satisfy its spirit, or where corporate actions would simply prematurely terminate a stockholder grievance deserving of further consideration in the corporation\u2019s interest. The Court of Chancery of course must carefully consider and weigh how compelling the corporate interest in dismissal is when faced with a non-frivolous lawsuit. The Court of Chancery should, when appropriate, give special consideration to matters of law and public policy in addition to the corporation\u2019s best interests.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">(Emphasis added.) (Quotations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 788-89. In embracing involvement by the courts, the <em>Zapata </em>court \u201crecognizefd] the danger of judicial overreaching\u201d but further concluded that this independent review provided \u201cthe essential key in striking the balance between legitimate corporate claims as expressed in a derivative stockholder suit and a corporation\u2019s best interests as expressed by an independent investigating committee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788-89. It further reasoned that review under the strict business judgment rule \u201cwould in the name of practicality and judicial economy foreclose a judicial decision on the merits,\u201d a result it found unnecessary and undesirable. <em>Id. </em>at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">In the \u00e1ftermath of <em>Zapata </em>and <em>Auerbach, </em>courts reviewing motions to dismiss or for summary judgment were presented with two alternatives: <em>Auerbach\u2019s </em>adherence to the business judgment rule or <em>Zapata\u2019s </em>belief that the SLC process should be independently examined, on the merits, by the courts.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>Many courts hewed to the business judgment rule, adopting a standard like that in <em>Auerbach.

For example, the <em>Alford </em>court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>characterized the <em>Auerbach </em>approach as a \u201cslavish adherence to the business judgment rule\u201d which necessarily requires \u201cgreat deference\u201d to the corporation. <em>Alford, </em>358 S.E.2d at 326. In <em>Abella, </em>the court recognized the \u201crelative ease with which a committee could construct a record of apparently diligent investigation after having predetermined the outcome of the investigation.\u201d <em>Abella, </em>546 F.Supp. at 799. In <em>Rosengarten v. Buckley, </em>613 F.Supp. 1493, 1500 (D.Md.1985), the district court, applying Maryland law, posited that the <em>Auerbach </em>approach \u201cdoes not acknowledge the structural bias inherent in a system which allows directors to judge the actions of their fellow directors.\u201d Indeed, John and Kevin seemingly advance this view of the <em>Auerbach </em>approach, arguing that, without an independent <em>Zapata </em>inquiry, a court would \u201csimply sign off on a litigation committee\u2019s decision,\u201d and warning that \u201clegitimate complaints of minority shareholders will be subject to summary dismissal based upon reports from committees chosen by the accused without <em>any reasonable judicial </em>review.\u201d (Emphasis added).<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">We disagree, however, that <em>Auerbach\u2019s </em>inquiry must necessarily be a \u201crubber stamp\u201d review. Although <em>Auerbach </em>held that an SLC\u2019s <em>substantive decisions </em>are presumed reasonable, it did not presume that the SLC was independent, acted in good faith, or followed reasonable procedures. We conclude that there should be no presumption on these issues. Rather, the court should not grant summary judgment on the basis of an SLC\u2019s decision unless the directors have stated how they chose the SLC members and come forward with some evidence that the SLC followed reasonable procedures and that no substantial business or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>personal relationships impugned the SLC\u2019s independence and good faith. This places a minimal burden on the directors, as these assertions can be made in an affidavit. If the corporate directors have met this burden, then the burden shifts to the derivative plaintiffs to come forward with evidence regarding these issues sufficient to survive summary judgment. If the plaintiff survives summary judgment, at trial, the burden is on the directors to prove that the SLC was independent, acted in good faith, and made a reasonable investigation and principled, factually supported conclusions.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See Auerbach, </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1001 (\u201cWe examine then the proof submitted by defendants\u201d on the issue of the SLC\u2019s \u201cdisinterested independence.\u201d); <em>Booth Family Trust v.

For example, in <em>In re Oracle Corp. Derivative Litig., </em>824 A.2d 917 (Del.Ch.2003), the Delaware Court of Chancery<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> first outlined the breadth of the independence inquiry, summarizing the standard as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>At bottom, the question of independence turns on whether a director is, <em>for any substantial reason, </em>incapable of making a decision with only the best interests of the corporation in mind. That is, the [courts should] ultimately focus on impartiality and objectivity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-4\">For all these reasons, the independence inquiry is critically important if the [SLC] process is to retain its integrity, a quality that is, in turn, essential to the utility of that process----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-5\">... The composition and conduct of [an SLC] therefore must be such as to instill confidence in the judiciary and, as important, the stockholders of the company that the committee can act with integrity and objectivity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-6\">... Just as there are obvious dangers from investigators suffering from too much zeal, so too are dangers posed by investigators who harbor reasons not to pursue the investigation\u2019s targets with full vigor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\">The nature of the investigation is important, too. Here, for example, the SLC was required to undertake an investigation that could not avoid a consideration of the subjective state of mind of the Trading Defendants. Their credibility was important, and the SLC could not escape making judgments about that, no matter how objective the criteria the SLC attempted to use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-8\">Therefore, [the court] necessarily measure[s] the SLC\u2019s independence contextually, and [the court\u2019s] ruling confronts the SLC\u2019s ability to decide impartially whether the Trading Defendants should be pursued____ This contextual approach is a strength of our law, as even the best minds have yet to devise across-the-board definitions that capture all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the circumstances in which the independence of directors might reasonably be questioned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 938-41 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> After setting forth this standard, the court engaged in an extended discussion of the relationship of the SLC members with the defendant directors, and concluded that the SLC was not independent. <em>See id. </em>at 940-48. <em>See also Hasan, </em>729 F.2d at 379 (concluding that the SLC members, who had a previous business relationship with the defendants, had not convinced the court of their \u201cindependence.\u201d); <em>Holmstrom v. Coastal Indus., Inc., </em>645 F.Supp. 963, 988 (N.D.Ohio 1984) (court was unable to conclude that committee was independent because of circumstances surrounding the recruitment of the committee members, and the members\u2019 inability to explain their investigation); <em>Houle v.

The <em>Oracle </em>court, however, dealt with a particularly complex network of social influence and interaction. As a practical matter, we cannot expect as detailed and prolonged of a factual analysis from the trial court in every case.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">Regarding the second prong of the <em>Auerbach </em>inquiry (the reasonableness of the SLC\u2019s methodology), the reviewing court inquires into the procedural aspects of the SLC\u2019s investigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[T]he court may properly inquire as to the adequacy and appropriateness of the committee\u2019s investigative procedures and methodologies[.] ... [T]hose responsible for the procedures by which the business judgment is reached may reasonably be required to show that they have pursued their chosen investigative methods in good faith. What evidentiary proof may be required to this end will, of course, depend on the nature of the particular investigation, and the proper reach of disclosure at the instance of the shareholders will in turn relate inversely to the showing made by the corporate representatives themselves. The latter may be expected to show that the areas and subjects to be examined are reasonably complete and that there has been a good-faith pursuit of inquiry into such areas and subjects. What has been uncovered and the relative weight accorded in evaluating and balancing the several factors and considerations are beyond the scope of judicial concern. Proof, however, that the investigation has been so restricted in scope, so shallow in execution, or otherwise so <em>pro forma </em>or halfhearted as to constitute a pretext or sham, consistent with the principles underlying the application of the business judgment doctrine, would raise questions of good faith <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>or conceivably fraud which would never be shielded by that doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-5\"><em>Auerbach, </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1002-03.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Although this line of inquiry does not address the merits of the SLC decision, it can still set a high bar for the SLC. For example, in <em>Peller v. S. Co.,</em><footnotemark><em>37</em></footnotemark><em> </em>707 F.Supp. 525 (N.D.Ga.1988), <em>aff'd, Peller v. S.

Nonetheless, the court continues to be troubled by the fact that the [SLC] relied almost exclusively on [independent counsel] to conduct the substantive aspects of the investigation.... The conduct of the interviews is a most important factor in determining whether the [SLC] pursued its charge with diligence and zeal, or whether it played softball with critical players. Plaintiff has not been given an opportunity to review the annotated summaries of interviews prepared by [independent counsel]. Thus, by relying on counsel to outline and to conduct all interviews and then prepare interview summaries that contain \u201cprivileged information\u201d, the [SLC] has insulated its investigation from scrutiny by plaintiff. This is not good faith.

Accordingly, we believe that the proposition that a court must decide between a <em>Zapata </em>review and no review at all overlooks the most appropriate standard of review. Indeed, other courts employing the business judgment rule to SLC decisions have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>similarly concluded. In rejecting <em>Zapata, </em>the Alabama Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">We do not feel that the rule we adopt today will be the death knell of shareholder derivative suits in Alabama. The action of the board and the committee will still be subject to judicial scrutiny as to whether their action was in the best interest of the corporation and whether such determination was made independently and in good faith. If the court finds the action to have been done otherwise, then the case may proceed. (Citation omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><em>Roberts, </em>404 So.2d at 636. Similarly, the <em>Miller </em>court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-7\">We are confident that the diligent [review of the SLC\u2019s independence, disinterestedness, good faith, and thoroughness] [<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>] ... will satisfactorily strike the balance sought by the court in <em>Zapata </em>while remaining consistent with the business judgment rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b395-8\"><em>Miller, </em>591 N.E.2d at 1343.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">We further observe that some of <em>Zapata\u2019s </em>most fervent advocates have applied a \u201cmerits\u201d review which could have adequately been accomplished under <em>Auerbach\u2019s </em>\u201cprocedural\u201d review. For example, in <em>Alford, </em>the North Carolina Supreme Court, in adopting <em>Zapata </em>and reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss a derivative complaint, remanded to the trial court with instructions that it follow the following procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-10\">Upon remand plaintiffs shall be permitted to develop and present evidence on this issue, such as: (1) that the committee, though perhaps disinterested and independent, may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>have been <em>qualified </em>to assess intricate and allegedly false tax and accounting information supplied to it by those within the corporate structure who would benefit from decisions not to proceed with litigation, (2) that, in fact, false and/or incomplete information was supplied to the committee because of the nonadversarial way in which it gathered and evaluated information, and therefore (3) in light of these and other problems which arise from the structural bias inherent in the use of the board-appointed [SLCs], that the committee\u2019s decision with respect to the litigation eviscerates plaintiffs opportunities as minority shareholders to vindicate their rights[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-5\"><em>Alford, </em>358 S.E.2d at 328. In this passage, the <em>Alford </em>court thus identified the need to inquire into (1) the qualifications of the committee, (2) the adequacy of their investigation and the accuracy of information provided, and (3) any structural bias built into the SLC appointment process. Although purporting to be a <em>Zapata </em>inquiry, the inquiry actually ordered by the <em>Alford </em>court is merely a thorough version of the procedural inquiry under <em>Auerbach.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Given the level of scrutiny attainable under an inquiry into the SLC\u2019s independence and methodology, we are not persuaded by the pronouncement of some courts that adherence to the business judgment rule is wholly inadequate to protect shareholders rights. Instead, we conclude that a procedural review under the business judgment rule, although clearly the more deferential standard, nonetheless provides for a thorough review of an SLC\u2019s independence, good faith, and methodology, and such inquiry gives trial courts the ability to scrutinize SLC decisions and protect shareholders against collusive practices or inadequate investigations. Moreover, this approach protects against the danger of judicial overreach and \u201cavoid[s] the problem in the second level of the <em>Zapata </em>test, which requires the judge to exercise his or her own business judgment.\u201d <em>Houle, </em>556 N.E.2d at 59.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>extent that our view of the inquiry a court should make, as set forth above, differs from the traditional <em>Auerbach </em>standard, it should be considered an \u201cenhanced <em>Auerbach.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">One clear example of an SLC\u2019s unreasonable methodology is when the SLC itself defers to the decision of the directors, instead of making its own independent review of the transactions in question. In these situations, the SLC has cast aside its duty to conduct an independent review, and the directors cannot rely on its report for summary judgment. <em>See, e.g., Roberts, </em>404 So.2d at 632-33 (\u201cUpon finding that a special committee of disinterested directors has determined in good faith and after a <em>thorough investigation </em>that it is not in the company\u2019s best interests to allow an action to proceed, [the \u2018business judgment\u2019 rule] would not allow the courts to interfere with the committee\u2019s determination.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Hirsch v. Jones Intercable, Inc., </em>984 P.2d 629, 638 (Colo.1999) (\u201cThe purpose to be served by any [SLC] is to <em>substitute its independent ... judgment </em>for the judgment of the directors who have been accused of wrongdoing.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Einhorn v. Culea, </em>235 Wis.2d 646, 612 N.W.2d 78, 84 (2000) (\u201cIf the [SLC] is independent from the alleged wrongdoers, acts in good faith and conducts a <em>reasonable inquiry upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>which its conclusion is based, </em>the committee\u2019s recommendation not to proceed with a derivative action is viewed as a proper exercise of the directors\u2019 business judgment and the court will dismiss the action.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Thus, Maryland courts should limit their inquiry. As in <em>Auerbach, </em>the SLC\u2019s substantive conclusions are entitled to judicial deference, provided that the SLC was independent, acted in good faith, and made a reasonable investigation and principled, factually supported conclusions. We emphasize, however, that the directors are entitled to no presumption regarding the above requirements. To create grounds for summary judgment, the directors must state how they chose the SLC members and come forward with some evidence that the SLC conducted a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusion is based and that no significant business or personal relationships impugned the SLC\u2019s independence and good-faith, factual basis. Only then will the court have sufficient grounds to grant summary judgment on the basis of the SLC\u2019s report. Moreover, the plaintiff can still avoid summary judgment by presenting a genuine issue of material fact regarding these issues, in which case judicial review should be engaged and thorough. Such review is consistent with <em>Auerbach </em>and Maryland\u2019s business judgment rule, which \u201ccan be claimed only by <em>disinterested </em>directors whose conduct otherwise meets the tests of business judgment.\u201d <em>Werbowsky </em>362 Md. at 609, 766 A.2d at 138 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>John and Kevin have argued that we should abandon the SLC process altogether. In a motion to the Circuit Court on March 3, 2008, John and Kevin expressed their views on the SLC process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-5\">[The SLC process] is itself subject to abuse by corporate management, as the accused themselves hand-pick the members of the committee who will investigate the allegations. It is not surprising then that most often these handpicked committees \u201creport\u201d that the claims are not meritorious and the corporations then ask the court to dismiss the action based upon the report. That has happened here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0B\">Similarly, before this Court, John and Kevin argued at length that the SLC process itself created bias, analogizing that process to \u201cforum-shopping\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">[Cjourts which prohibit and \u201cuniversally condemn\u201d judge-shopping by attorneys, blithely approve a litigation committee process to resolve serious shareholder grievances that authorizes the accused directors to choose their own extrajudicial tribunal.... [We] submit that just as a litigant can readily find an \u201cindependent, qualified and objective expert\u201d to support any position, a competent director may also find an \u201cindependent, qualified, and competent business person\u201d to sanction the directors\u2019 challenged misconduct as an act of reasonable business judgment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">To be sure, John and Kevin\u2019s point addresses a valid issue, and one which we should not completely ignore. We acknowledge the likelihood that an SLC, more often than not, will side \u25a0with the corporation, rather than the shareholders, in its conclusions. The correct response, however, is not to abandon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>the SLC process altogether. We reaffirm our belief that the SLC process, when coupled with the thorough standard of judicial review we have described above, provides significant protection for minority shareholders. Under this inquiry, the court may examine any significant formal or informal relationship between the parties, including societal or personal influences. Whatever the SLC\u2019s conclusion may be, the process itself requires near-complete transparency from the directors and increases their accountability for their decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We now apply the above standards to the Circuit Court\u2019s review of the SLC opinion in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>A. The SLC\u2019s Independence and Good Faith</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Under our standard of review, the circuit court must first conclude that the SLC was independent and acted in good faith. As explained above, the SLC members are entitled to no presumption of independence and good faith, and the corporations must state in a motion for summary judgment how they chose the SLC members and come forward with some evidence that no significant relationships or influences impugned their \u201cdisinterested independence.\u201d <em>See Auerbach, </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1003. If the plaintiff, in responding, comes forward with evidence of such relationships or influences, the court should then consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact regarding independence or good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-8\">Here, the directors never attested to how they chose the SLC members or that the SLC members had no significant business, personal, or social relationships with the directors. Instead, they argued that the SLC was entitled to a presumption of independence and good faith, and from then on simply stated, without proving, that the SLC was independent. Thus, as explained above, the Circuit Court did not have sufficient grounds for summary judgment on the basis of the SLC\u2019s report, and we therefore vacate its judgment and remand for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>further proceedings. On remand, to create sufficient grounds on this issue, the directors would need to state how they chose the SLC members and assert that no significant business, personal, or social relationships impugned the SLC\u2019s independence or good faith. Then, if the plaintiffs raises a genuine issue of material fact, the court should complete a thorough investigation.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>In determining whether the SLC was sufficiently independent from the defendant-directors, the court should first consider any significant business relationship or affiliations between the SLC members and the defendant directors. <em>See Auerbach, </em>419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d at 1001 (examining whether SLC members had \u201cany prior affiliation with the corporation\u201d); <em>Hasan, </em>729 F.2d at 378-79 (holding that prior business relationships between SLC member and the defendants prevented a finding of independence). The court may also take notice of informal business influences and incentives potentially affecting the SLC. For example, in <em>Hasan, </em>the court observed that an' SLC member, who was \u201ca founding principal and 25% owner of a leasing and management company, also has a keen interest in attracting real estate developers.\u201d <em>Hasan, </em>729 F.2d at 379. Since one of the defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>was a prominent real estate developer, the court questioned whether that SLC member was independent, as he may have had a strong incentive to stay on good terms with the defendants. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The independence inquiry should not end with an examination of business relationships. In some instances, the plaintiff can raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the SLC\u2019s independence and good faith by presenting evidence of significant personal or social relationships. For example, the Delaware courts, whose \u201cindependence\u201d inquiry we find persuasive in crafting our standards,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> have recognized that corporate directors often share a parallel network of influence and relationships in the fundraising world, which, in some cases, may undermine an SLC member\u2019s ability to render an independent decision. <em>See, e.g., Lewis, </em>502 A.2d at 966-67 (concluding that a $10 million charitable pledge from a corporate CEO to the university of which an SLC member was president raised an issue of \u201cpotential conflicts of interest or divided loyalties [that], when considered as a whole, raise a question of fact as to whether [the SLC] could act independently\u201d); <em>In re Oracle, </em>824 A.2d at 930-33 (questioning independence of SLC members when defendants had made millions of dollars of donations to the members\u2019 university).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Finally, although we have declined John and Kevin\u2019s suggestion that we recognize a <em>per se </em>bias arising from the SLC appointment process, the court may properly examine the specific circumstances surrounding the selection and delegation of responsibility to the SLC in determining whether it has shown its independence. For example, in <em>Biondi v. Scrushy, </em>820 A.2d 1148 (Del.Ch.2003), the Delaware Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>Chancery relied on \u201can odd confluence of unusual and highly troubling facts\u201d regarding the appointment of the SLC to determine that it could not show its own independence. <em>Id. </em>at 1165-66. Specifically, the <em>Biondi </em>Court observed that an \u201cat best, begrudging and, at worst, inadequate, original delegation of authority\u201d to the SLC, when coupled with repeated public pronouncements of support for the defendants by corporate members (including the SLC chairman) during the investigation, created \u201ca reasonable doubt that its investigation was designed to paper a decision that had already been made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As this discussion shows, not all SLC appointment processes are equal.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">The court should require that the directors at least attest to the lack of a significant business, personal, or social relationship with the SLC members and state why they chose the SLC members and how they learned of them. Inquiring only into the SLC members\u2019 formal or financial ties with the defendants is inadequate. Nonetheless, the independence inquiry does not require the directors to show, beyond all doubt, that no conceivable theory of influence exists between them and the SLC.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> The defendants should state the nature of their prior relations with the SLC members. The defendants should address whether the SLC members have any joint pursuits outside of the business world, whether in recreational, social, religious, or non-profit organizations. Once the court has this information, it should be able to determine whether there were any further questions regarding the ability of the SLC to render an independent opinion on behalf of the corporation. But these questions must be addressed, and therefore we remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\n<em>B. The Reasonableness of the SLC\u2019s Methodology</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">John and Kevin challenged the procedure adopted by the SLC in this case with multiple allegations. Generally, John <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and Kevin argued that the SLC report was superficial and devoid of details. More specifically, John and Kevin challenged the scope of the SLC\u2019s investigation and charged that it provided a deferential standard of review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-4\">The committee sought to avoid a substantive review of the merits of the transaction by applying a \u201cbusiness judgment rule\u201d level of review to the transaction and the director-defendants\u2019 asserted justifications for it. But, the business judgment rule is inapplicable to self-dealing, interested director transactions.... Thus ... the committee applied an improper standard of review and, for this reason alone, the committee report may not support a motion to dismiss the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">On this point, John and Kevin further averred that \u201c[t]he committee could not identify any standard that they used to measure the asserted \u201creasonableness\u201d of the self-aggrandizing transaction.\u201d As explained below, the SLC report itself created a genuine issue of material fact regarding the reasonableness of the SLC\u2019s methodology, and the court therefore should have examined that methodology in more detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">The reviewing court must examine the methodologies and procedures of the SLC\u2019s investigation, and whether there was a reasonable basis for its conclusions. Again, the SLC is not entitled to a presumption that its investigation and conclusions were reasonable. Indeed, the court may find evidence of procedural unreasonableness in the report itself. <em>See Hasan, </em>729 F.2d at 378 (holding that the \u201creport itself raises serious questions about the integrity of his committee\u2019s findings\u201d). Moreover, the mere length of the report and the sheer volume of items considered should not be given undue weight by the court. Page totals are a shallow metric, especially given the \u201crelative ease with which a committee could construct a record of apparently diligent investigation after having predetermined the outcome of the investigation.\u201d <em>Abella, </em>546 F.Supp. at 799. <em>See also Oracle, </em>824 A.2d at 925 (rejecting the SLC\u2019s recommendation for failure to show independence, even though the SLC \u201creviewed an enormous amount of paper and electronic records!,] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 interviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>seventy witnesses, some of them twiee[,] ... [and] produced an extremely lengthy Report totaling 1,110 pages\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Under our standards, although the court should not question the SLC\u2019s substantive conclusions, it should examine what issues the SLC actually set out to address. The SLC cannot arrive at a reasonable answer if addresses the wrong issues. Thus, addressing the wrong issues is an example of unreasonable methodology.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Here, in reviewing the SLC\u2019s investigation, the court focused primarily on the sheer volume of the SLC\u2019s exhibits and report, stating, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">[Independent counsel] and the SLC were provided with approximately 1,716 [pages] of material by the corporations. The SLC conducted a 5 month investigation, during which it interviewed 11 individuals, including John and Kevin, believed to have knowledge regarding the claims in the Derivative Action. The resulting report consists of 30 pages accompanied by one appendix and 32 exhibits. It is clear from the amount of time and effort expended to conduct the investigation and produce a thorough report that the SLC acted in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Next, the court reviewed the reasonableness of each of the SLC\u2019s <em>findings, </em>holding they were reasonable.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Applying our above-described standards, we observe that the Circuit Court incorrectly applied a presumption that the SLC\u2019s methodology was reasonable. In its December 12, 2008, order and opinion, the Circuit Court referenced, in passing, its duty to inquire into \u201cthe process, scope, and thoroughness of work performed by the SLC.\u201d The court, however, stated that \u201cthe business judgment standard requires this Court to examine the work of the SLC with the presumption ... that its investigation was conducted within sound business judgment\u201d (emphasis added), then stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AE9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>As its opinion shows, the court believed that any further investigation into the SLC\u2019s report was unnecessary.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> While courts must defer to the SLC\u2019s <em>substantive conclusions, </em>they cannot afford any presumption of reasonableness to its methodology.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>The compensation of Cain and the other Directors was addressed by the SLC, whose decision must now be reviewed under the business judgment standard. The application of the standard is clearly bolstered by the report of the SLC and the compensation of Director Cain is found by this Court to come within the standard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-6\">[Moreover, the] sale of the stock was a part of an overall executive compensation plan. <em>Bender, supra, </em>is cited in support of the exercise of deference to the board\u2019s decisions as to the levels of compensation under the business judgment rule. The sale and grant of stock meets this test. John and Kevin have not alleged fraud or deceit in the Counter-Complaint which requires the examination by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>the Court of the process, scope and thoroughness of work performed by the SLC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Because the Circuit Court inappropriately afforded the SLC\u2019s methodology a presumption of reasonableness, its analysis on that point was inappropriately framed. The Circuit Court opinion discusses the length and thoroughness of the investigation, and concludes that the SLC did not engage in a cursory analysis. It appears, however, that the Circuit Court did not consider the scope of review and standards used by the SLC. Specifically, it is unclear whether, as John and Kevin allege, the SLC applied a \u201cbusiness judgment standard\u201d to the transactions at issue, or whether they engaged in an independent inquiry on behalf of the corporation. Indeed, a close examination of the SLC\u2019s report raises serious questions regarding the standard of review used by the SLC investigation, and seems to suggest that the SLC itself applied a deferential standard to the Board\u2019s previous actions, rather than stepping into the shoes of the corporation and making an independent decision. In reviewing the stock sales to the directors, the SLC concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-8\">The Board determined that the stock sales were to further solidify successful management for the future well being of the corporation. It goes without saying that it is common for corporations to give stock or stock options as part of compensation. Here, it has the purposes of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>further binding management and encouraging performance to enhance personal dividend income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-5\">The enhancement of control is a positive benefit for the corporations. The SLC finds those transactions to be well within the business judgment and done in good faith for the benefit of the corporation. <em>See Cummings v. United Artists Theater [Theatre </em>] <em>Circuit, Inc., </em>237 Md. 1, 22, 204 A.2d 795 (1964); <em>Mountain Manor Realty, Inc. v. Buccheri, </em>55 Md.App. 185, 198, 461 A.2d 45, 53 (1983).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4s\">But an issue of the stock that has the collateral effect of enhancing the power of incumbent management is not invalid if the transaction has as its principal purpose some proper corporate goal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-6\"><em>Mountain Manor Realty, Inc. </em>[55 Md.App. at 197], 461 A.2d at 52 (quoting <em>Heit v. Baird, </em>567 F.2d 1157, 1161 (1st Cir.1977)).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b409-7\">Further, the price received for those shares is more than in dollars. It rewards and expects services to be performed for the corporation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">It is unclear, from the above passage, whether the SLC independently determined that the stock sales were fair to the corporation or, as the emphasized language suggests, merely gave deference to the Board\u2019s determination under the business judgment rule.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">Comparing the Circuit Court\u2019s review with the standards described above, we are unable to give our blessing to its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>decision. The report, as submitted, did not provide sufficient explanation of its methodology to allow meaningful judicial review of the methodology\u2019s reasonableness. Therefore, the court should not have granted summary judgment, which it apparently did based on a presumption that the SLC\u2019s methodology was reasonable. <em>See Hirsch </em>984 P.2d at 636; <em>Roberts v. Alabama Power Co., </em>404 So.2d at 636. The SLC is entitled to no presumption of reasonableness in this inquiry, and the mere length of the report or volume of items considered will not win the day for the SLC. On remand, the Circuit Court shall analyze the thoroughness of the SLC\u2019s investigation and the reasonableness of the methodology it employed, consistent with our above-described standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">We next consider the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of John and Kevin\u2019s cross-claims on the grounds that they were precluded by <em>res judicata.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark><em> </em>John and Kevin filed a cross-claim alleging individual counts of oppression, which, as we described above, is a direct action. After resolving the derivative suit, the Circuit Court concluded that <em>res judicata </em>applied to all of John and Kevin\u2019s direct claims, holding that \u201cthere was a final judgment,-the claims are virtually identical, the parties are the same[,]\u201d and dismissed the cross-claim without reaching the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">The doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>or claim preclusion, prevents parties from re-litigating issues that have already been decided by the courts. The doctrine is applicable if the following requirements are met: \u201c[1] if there is a final judgment [on the merits] in a previous litigation [and 2] where the parties, the subject matter and causes of action are identical or substantially identical as to issues actually litigated and as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>to those which could have or should have been raised in the previous litigation.\u201d <em>R &amp; D 2001 v. Rice, </em>402 Md. 648, 663, 938 A.2d 839, 848 (2008) (citations omitted).<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\n<em>1. Final Judgment On The Merits</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A9I\">The doctrine\u2019s first requirement, that there be a previous final judgment on the merits, is not met when the earlier case was resolved without a judicial resolution of the factual dispute at issue. For example, in <em>Williams v. Messick, </em>177 Md. 605, 11 A.2d 472 (1940), a derivative suit that followed a \u201cdirect action\u201d requesting receivership, we stated that the <em>res judicata </em>issue turned on whether the court\u2019s termination of the \u201cdirect action\u201d involved a factual resolution of the claims. In that previous action, the court denied the plaintiffs request for appointment of a receiver. <em>See Williams v. Salisbury Ice Co., </em>176 Md. 13, 3 A.2d 507 (1939). In the later action, this Court observed such a judgment could be rendered either on the merits of the plaintiffs claim, or for reasons not related to the merits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b411-5\">Of course, an application for a receivership might be denied on either of two grounds; either because it was considered improper to grant it, whatever the complainant\u2019s right on the merits of the case averred, or because the rights were not established. And only an adjudication on the second ground would give rise to an estoppel by the decree against asserting those rights again in another action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\"><em>Messick, </em>177 Md. at 611, 11 A.2d at 475. The Court then examined the prior decision, in which it had held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>complaint did not demonstrate \u201cfraud, spoliation, or imminent danger of the loss of the property\u201d so as to necessitate the appointment of a receiver. <em>Salisbury Ice Co., </em>176 Md. at 27, 3 A.2d at 514. Because that prior decision was resolved on the merits of the plaintiffs claim, it formed a basis for <em>res judicata </em>in the later action. <em>Messick, </em>177 Md. at 612, 11 A.2d at 475. <em>See also Jessica G. v. Hector M., </em>337 Md. 388, 398-99, 653 A.2d 922, 927-28 (1995) (determining whether an earlier paternity suit by a mother precluded later paternity suit by the child by observing that the dispositive fact in other jurisdictions had been whether the mother\u2019s suit was resolved on a <em>factual finding </em>of non-paternity, or was resolved on grounds other than the merits); <em>Cassidy v. Bd. of Educ., </em>316 Md. 50, 52 557 A.2d 227, 228 (1989) (dismissal for failure to allege precondition to lawsuit was not a decision on the merits so as to allow <em>res judicata).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">Applying these standards to the derivative and direct causes of action here, we hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in the derivative action, based on a recommendation from the SLC, does not form a basis for <em>res judicata </em>on the direct action because it is <em>not a determination on the merits. </em>Like a court\u2019s refusal to appoint a receiver, a court\u2019s resolution of a derivative suit could either be on the merits, that is, if the complaint failed to state a claim, or merely because the SLC, considering a broad range of aspects, including some outside of the merits of the case, had reasonably concluded that dismissal was warranted. In this latter case, as we have described, the court\u2019s decision on whether to accept an SLC\u2019s recommendation <em>does not turn on the merits of the claim, </em>but rather on whether the SLC was independent, conducted a thorough investigation, and came to reasonable and principled conclusions. As the Sixth Circuit has recently detailed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-5\">[T]he focus of the [court\u2019s review of the SLC recommendation <footnotemark>50</footnotemark>] is not on the merits of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, but on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>whether maintenance of the suit would be in the company\u2019s best interest. This inquiry is one step removed from the actual merits and allows a special litigation committee to recommend dismissal, consistent with its business judgment, even if a derivative suit may ultimately be successful. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b413-5\"><em>Booth Family Trust, </em>640 F.3d at 139. Although, as the Circuit Court in this case observed, the SLC may address and resolve factual issues, <em>res judicata </em>requires a final <em>judicial </em>resolution of the merits of the case, not a final judgment rendered by private parties. Moreover, the SLC decision, itself, may turn on other considerations than the merits of the case, and, in an extreme case, the SLC may affect a dismissal even though the plaintiffs claims are meritorious. Thus, a trial court\u2019s resolution of a derivative complaint, when based on the recommendation of a Special Litigation Committee, cannot be said to be a final judicial resolution of the merits of the claims. Accordingly, the Circuit Court erred in dismissing Petitioners\u2019 direct action.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-7\">Finally, we reach the issue which began this litigation: whether the Stock Purchase Agreements entered into by the Boland children are enforceable. After the corporations sued to enforce the Agreement against Colleen Boland\u2019s estate, the estate, along with John and Kevin, resisted, arguing that the stock purchase agreements had been breached, that the contract had not endured past Mr. Boland\u2019s death, and that the Agreements were invalid and unenforceable contracts of adhesion. The Circuit Court disagreed, and held that the stock purchase agreement signed by Colleen Boland was valid and enforceable, granting summary judgment to the corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-8\">When reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment, the appellate court must determine whether there is a dispute as to a material fact sufficient to require an issue to be tried. <em>See Frederick Rd. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Brown &amp; Sturm, </em>360 Md. 76, 93, 756 A.2d 963, 972 (2000) (\u201c[A]n appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>court\u2019s review of the grant of summary judgment involves the determination whether a dispute of material fact exists.\u201d). \u201cSummary judgment is not a substitute for trial.... Evidentiary matters, credibility issues, and material facts which are in dispute cannot properly be disposed of by summary judgment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-5\">The question of whether a trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review on appeal.

We review the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and construe any reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the facts against the moving party.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">(Quotation marks and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 479, 914 A.2d 735, 741 (2007). \u201cMerely proving the existence of a factual dispute is not necessarily fatal to a summary judgment motion.\u201d <em>Appiah v. Hall, </em>416 Md. 533, 546, 7 A.3d 536, 544 (2010). A \u201cdispute as to facts relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a <em>material </em>fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Salisbury Beauty Schs. v.

Consideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">The first allegation we review under this standard is the Petitioners\u2019 claim that the stock purchase agreements were not supported by consideration. The Circuit Court held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-10\">There is ample consideration for the agreements.... [Colleen] received the stock, with a guaranteed purchaser should she choose to redeem it, at a readily determinable price. Shareholder agreements like the SPAs are vital for the protection of those financially interested in family-held corporations. As has been explained in an Illinois case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>construing a similar agreement: \u201cWhile the shareholder of a public-issue corporation may readily sell his shares on the open market ... his counterpart of the close corporation often has ... no ready market for his shares should he desire to sell.\u201d <em>Galler v. Galler </em>[32 Ill.2d 16], 203 N.E.2d 577, 583-84 (1964).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-4\">In return for a readily-determinable redemption price, Colleen surrendered her right to freely alienate the stock, so that it would stay in the Boland \u201cfamily.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">We agree with the Circuit Court that a right to redeem stock can be valuable consideration for a shareholder. Other courts have so held. For example, in <em>Mayer Hoffman McCann, P.C. v. Barton, </em>614 F.3d 893 (8th Cir.2010), the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals held that a buy-sell stock agreement provided sufficient consideration, i.e., a guaranteed buyer for stock which may have been difficult to alienate, in return for the shareholders\u2019 promise not to compete after ending their employment.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Yeng Sue Chow v. Levi Strauss &amp; Co., </em>49 Cal.App.3d 315, 122 Cal.Rptr. 816 (1975), the California Court of Appeals held that a stock repurchase agreement upon the death of the shareholder was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>valid and enforceable, observing that the \u201cguaranteed buyer\u201d was a significant guarantee for the deceased\u2019s estate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">It is a matter of common knowledge that in most instances there is no easily ascertainable market value for the shares of closely held corporations. As a consequence, the various formulae set for determining the option price (e.g., book or appraisal value, par value) provide the participant or his heir an <em>assured market at a fixed price </em>for the stock in the event of death, retirement or other termination of interest in the corporation.... If a repurchase plan were not in effect, the widow might find it impossible to sell her shares in the open market, and thus might be forced to sell to the surviving shareholders at an unreasonably low price, if they would purchase her stock at all. (Quotation marks omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Asv\"><em>Id. </em>at 820. <em>See also </em>O\u2019Neal and Thompson, 1 <em>Close Corporations and LLCs: Law and Practice </em>\u00a7 7:3 (Rev. 3rd Ed.2010) (\u201cOne of the most distinctive features of any closely held enterprise is the lack of a market for selling one\u2019s interest in the entity.... It is not surprising that many participants in closely held businesses are interested in ways to provide liquidity to themselves or their heirs upon their death, disability, retirement, or their leaving the business.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">John and Kevin do not dispute that the SPA\u2019s promise of redemption upon the death of a shareholder formed valid consideration for the contract. Instead, John and Kevin\u2019s consideration argument is based on an alternate theory of consideration, that is, an assurance that \u201cduring [Colleen\u2019s] lifetime, the companies would remain in the ownership and control of her parents, siblings, and select key employees, without the threat of new, unwanted, outside shareholders.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Even if this alternate theory of consideration fails, the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>tract would still be supported by the consideration identified by the circuit court. Because there is no factual dispute that the contract was supported by that consideration, in the form of a \u201cready buyer,\u201d we hold that the Circuit Court\u2019s finding that the SPAs were supported by consideration was proper.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\n<em>B. Duration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The second issue raised by John and Kevin is the intended duration of the Stock Purchase Agreements. The brothers observe that the SPAs have no stated duration in the agreements, and argue that \u201cthe purpose of the agreements were to insure absolute control by Mr. Boland ... [and that there is no evidence] that the stock purchase agreements were intended to serve as succession documents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The Circuit Court, however, disagreed that the intended duration of the SPAs was unclear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-8\">[T]he SPAs were <em>not </em>silent as to their duration, as they unambiguously made express provision for two eventualities: 1) purchase of stock by the corporation during the shareholder\u2019s life; 2) purchase of stock by the corporation at the time of the shareholder\u2019s death. As to the first eventuality, if the stock was redeemed during the shareholder\u2019s life, no stock would remain to trigger the second eventuality, and the SPA would lapse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-9\">If no stock was redeemed during the shareholder\u2019s life, death <em>would </em>trigger the second eventuality.... Thus, the implicit duration of the SPAs was the lifetime of Colleen, which turned out to be 25 years. The court finds that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>period of time to be reasonable, given the nature of the agreement and that the Boland children were gifted the stock during their youth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">As John and Kevin correctly observe, a contract may not exist in perpetuity in the absence of an express provision, and in such absence, \u201ca reasonable duration will be implied by the court.\u201d <em>Lerner v. Lerner Corp., </em>132 Md.App. 32, 45, 750 A.2d 709, 716 (2000). Yet, even absent any explicit length of time, the contract\u2019s duration may be defined by contingent future events. <em>See Pumphrey v. Pelton, </em>250 Md. 662, 665, 245 A.2d 301, 303 (1968) (\u201cThe fact that Clause 19 provides that it terminates upon the <em>expiration of the patents and copyrights </em>saves it from the rule that a contract may not exist in perpetuity in the absence of an express provision.\u201d (emphasis added)). As the Circuit Court observed, the duration of the SPAs until the death of the shareholder was <em>clearly an event anticipated, by the SPAs. </em>A provision in a stock purchase agreement providing for repurchase upon the shareholder\u2019s death is clearly intended to endure until the shareholder\u2019s death. Thus, although a court may imply a reasonable duration in the absence of any signal of duration in the contract, this step is not required here.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">\n<em>C. Invalidity of Contract Due to Alleged Improper Acts by Majority Shareholders</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">As we have alluded to above, the main thrust of John and Kevin\u2019s \u201ccontract\u201d argument is that the alleged threats and oppressive acts of the majority shareholders have invalidated the contract. The Circuit Court rejected these claims as an inappropriate attempt to \u201cbootstrap\u201d their direct claims into a traditional contract analysis. We agree with the Circuit Court that, if the contract was supported by consideration and otherwise valid, it should be enforced against the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">In reaching this holding, we are not completely unreceptive to the allegations by John and Kevin. Rather, we merely conclude that the brothers have raised them in the wrong venue. Pursuant to our above holding, John and Kevin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>will have an opportunity to have their direct claims, alleging oppression and requesting dissolution, heard. In the \u201cdissolution\u201d action, they may raise their claims regarding improper threats to use the corporate repurchase right contained in the SPAs. A shareholder\u2019s action for dissolution invokes the equitable jurisdiction of the court, and gives the court an opportunity to fashion appropriate relief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-4\">[Jjudicial dissolution of a corporation is viewed by courts as an extreme remedy. It has been said that a decree of dissolution will be entered only when no other adequate remedy is available. Many jurisdictions provide alternate remedies when a shareholder seeking dissolution of a corporationf.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b419-5\">Statutes in some jurisdictions provide a panoply of miscellaneous relief alternatives to dissolution, including canceling or altering any provision in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation, canceling, altering or enjoining any corporate act, directing or prohibiting any corporate act, the removal or appointment of a director or officer, requiring an accounting, ordering the payment of dividends, or awarding damages to the aggrieved party. These options may not be exclusive, and a court may be empowered to grant in its discretion other appropriate relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">16A William Meade Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 8043 (2003 Rev. Vol.). Although Maryland\u2019s dissolution statute does not explicitly contain such an enumeration of equitable remedies, <em>see </em>CA Section 3-413, neither does it foreclose them. On this point, we agree with the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 conclusion in <em>Edenbaum, </em>165 Md.App. at 260, 885 A.2d at 380, where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Acm\">While Corps. &amp; Ass\u2019ns \u00a7 3-413 only mentions dissolution as a remedy for oppressive conduct, we join other courts today which have interpreted their similar statutory counterparts to allow alternative equitable remedies not specifically stated in the statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">(Citations and quotation marks omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>(citing <em>Baker v. Commercial Body Builders, Inc., </em>264 Or. 614, 631-35, 507 P.2d 387, 395-96 (1973)). Thus, should John and Kevin convince the court on those claims, the court may fashion appropriate equitable relief, including the relief sought by them here. In particular, we believe that a court should carefully scrutinize any use of the \u201cinvoluntary\u201d buy-back provision, contained in Section 3 of the Stock Purchase Agreements.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In conclusion, our holding that the contract was enforceable against Colleen\u2019s estate does not give the corporations cover to use the SPAs in any manner they see fit, or to violate the rights of the minority shareholders. We merely conclude, as the Circuit Court did, that the Stock Purchase Agreement\u2019s repurchase upon death provision, a common feature of family-owned corporations, was a valid and enforceable contract in these circumstances. We therefore affirm the Circuit Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment with regard to the enforceability of the Stock Purchase Agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">IN THE DERIVATIVE ACTION, (CIRCUIT COURT CASE # 282138-V, APPELLATE NO. 123), JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.

Under Maryland law a self-dealing transaction requires close scrutiny of the court under the \"entire fairness test.\u201d May a circuit court properly find that a litigation committee\u2019s review of a self-dealing transaction was reasonable \u2014 and dismiss derivative litigation based upon that review \u2014 if the committee concededly applied a lessor standard of review to the challenged transaction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-9\">3. Minority shareholders brought individual, statutory claims of oppression against the controlling majority shareholders and board members. The circuit court expressly found that the allegations of the minority shareholders stated a claim for oppression. May the circuit court properly grant summary judgment against the minority shareholders on their oppression claims based upon asserted factual findings of a corporate litigation committee?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">In the declaratory judgment action, the Petitioners presented the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-11\">1. A corporation moved a court to dismiss derivative litigation based upon an internal corporate determination that pursuit of the derivative claims would not be in the best interest of the corporation. The court deferred to the corporation\u2019s business judgment and granted summary judgment in favor of the corporation, effectively dismissing the derivative claims. Does the summary judgment constitute a judgment on the merits that bars \u2014 as res judicata \u2014 the assertion of individual, non-derivative claims arising out of the same facts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-12\">2.

Although the corporations and directors initially moved to dismiss, the court granted summary judgment because, after the motion for reconsideration, the corporations and directors filed a \u201cMotion to Dismiss or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment, and ... the consideration of the Motion extended to documents outside the four corners of the Cross-Complaint[.]\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 2-322(c) (\u201cIf, on a motion to dismiss for failure of the pleading to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, matters outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion shall be treated as one for summary judgment[.]\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b372-10\">.

Earlier, in the September 5, 2008 memorandum opinion, which addressed certain aspects of the derivative action, the Court also addressed whether John and Kevin's \"direct claims\u201d were properly included in the declaratory judgment action as cross-claims under Maryland Rule 2-331(b), concluding that those \"[t]he allegations in the Cross-Claim do not arise out of the SPAs, therefore, the Cross-Claim must be struck.\u201d John and Kevin then moved the Court to reconsider striking their Cross-Claim, instead asking them to \"sever\u201d their individual claims of oppression.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">The Circuit Court held a hearing on January 16, 2009 to clarify the procedural posture of the two cases.

In Maryland, the business judgment rule is codified in Maryland Code (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 2-405.1 of the Corporations and Associations Article (\"CA\u201d). That section assigns the following duties to directors of a corporation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 A director shall perform his duties as a director, including his duties as a member of a committee of tire board on which he serves:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">(1) In good faith;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">(2) In a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-9\">(3) With the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">That section further provides that \u201c[a] person who performs his duties in accordance with the standard provided in this section shall have the immunity from liability [arising from performance of those duties]\u201d and that \"[a]n act of a director of a corporation is presumed to satisfy the standards of ... this section.\u201d CA \u00a7 2-405.1(c), (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b379-5\">. Traditionally, another way for the derivative plaintiff to avoid dismissal by the board was to bring a \"demand excused\u201d action. In early cases, this Court recognized that a plaintiff may be excused, in certain circumstances, from the demand requirement. <em>See Booth v. Robinson, </em>55 Md. 419 (1881) (holding demand excused when \"a majority of the directors are adverse to the interest of the plaintiffs, and are combined against them, and would, by means of the control that they exercise, frustrate and defeat any attempt to induce the corporation to take action for the redress of the wrongs alleged\u201d); <em>Davis v. Gemmell, </em>70 Md. 356, 376, 17 A. 259, 265 (1889) (holding demand excused if the directors or officers \"are themselves guilty of the wrong complained of\u201d). In such a lawsuit, the derivative plaintiff, upon a showing that demand was futile, was granted direct access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Over time, courts and legislatures have moved towards a \"universal demand\u201d requirement. <em>See generally Werbowsky v. Collomb, </em>362 Md. 581, 602, 766 A.2d 123, 135 (2001). This Court has yet to close the door on the \"futility\u201d exception to demand requirement, although we have recognized that it is applicable in narrow circumstances:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">We adhere, for the time being, to the futility exception, but, consistent with what appears to be the prevailing philosophy throughout the country, regard it as a very limited exception, to be applied only when the allegations or evidence clearly demonstrate, in a very particular manner, either that (1) a demand, or a delay in awaiting a response to a demand, would cause irreparable harm to the corporation, or (2) a majority of the directors are so personally and directly conflicted or committed to the decision in dispute that they cannot reasonably be expected to respond to a demand in good faith and within the ambit of the business judgment rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 620, 766 A.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">Under <em>Werbowsky, </em>a demand on the board may be required, or at least advisable, even though the board itself may not be in a position to render the decision itself, due to the nature of the allegations or the existence of adverse interests. Indeed, one justification for the expanded demand requirement is to give the corporation an opportunity to engage an SLC. <em>See Werbowsky, </em>362 Md. at 619, 766 A.2d at 144 (observing that a demand sent to the board members \u201cmay be their first knowledge that a decision or transaction they made or approved is being questioned, and they may choose to seek the advice of [an SLC] of independent directors, which has become a common practice\u201d). Thus, the line between a special litigation committee and a distinct \"demand committee\u201d has blurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">One byproduct of the narrowing \"futility\u201d exception is that the procedural distinctions between a \"demand excused\u201d and \"demand refused\u201d action may no longer be viable. Courts and commentators <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>have often drawn strict distinctions between the two actions. <em>See, e.g., </em>Dennis J. Block, Nancy E.

Although we remand on this issue solely because the directors did not make the statements of independence and good faith necessary to support a motion for summary judgment, we observe as well that the Circuit Court's inquiry into the SLC's independence and good faith was improperly narrow. Specifically, the court failed to address whether the directors had any significant business, social, or personal relationships with the SLC members. The court's analysis on this point is, in its entirety, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-6\">Upon the demand by John and Kevin, the Board of BTA and BTS set up a special litigation committee to investigate the merits of John and Kevin\u2019s allegations. Neither member of the SLC has been a Director of BTA or BTS, nor has either ever been employed by, done business with or provided services for either corporation. Both members of the SLC are highly experienced in business and corporate affairs. Additionally, the SLC retained independent counsel ... to assist in the review of the derivative suit and the preparation of their report. [Counsel] has never done business with or provided professional services for either BTA and BTS and has no future plans or future opportunity to do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b401-7\">The SLC conducted a comprehensive investigation lasting approximately 5 months. A 30 page Report with one appendix and 32 exhibits was produced as a result of the SLC's thorough examination of Plaintiff's claims. The Court, thus, finds that the SLC is independent from BTA and BTS's Boards of Directors and conducted its investigation in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">We think the SLC report itself suggests the need for the directors to come forward with some evidence supporting the independence and good faith of the SLC. Near the end of its report, the SLC raised, by itself the issue \u2014 the \"Adequacy of the Plaintiffs as Shareholder Representatives.\u201d After listing the factors a court usually considers, the SLC stated: \"Here, the majority shareholders disagree with the Plaintiffs and it is therefore obvious that they do not adequately represent all the shareholders.\u201d This reasoning is faulty because such a standard would effectively preclude <em>all </em>suits by minority shareholders in a close corporation. The suddenness of this conclusion, raised <em>sua sponte </em>by the SLC, invokes the question of whether the SLC was objectively considering the claims presented, or whether it had adopted the hostile attitude of the defendants in considering these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-9\">As potential evidence of this latter possibility, the SLC, although claiming that it \"has not attempted to nor could it understand the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>complicated family dynamics in play[,]\u201d opted to descend into the intrafamily struggle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-6\">[I]t is clear that the derivative claims appear to be pursued for reasons other than their merit.

Such factors include the legal opinion that the SPAs would be found enforceable by the court, the contention to restrain enforcement is designed to cause financial harm to the corporations and the contracts\u2019 terms are beneficial to the corporation.

The Circuit Court later reinforced that its decision in the derivative case came because it was satisfied with the work of the SLC.

What we and our colleagues have been asked to do in this case is wade in on an intra-family financial dispute in which siblings are vying for financial hegemony in their two family owned and operated corporations. Two of the Boland brothers seek to have this Court consider their siblings on the boards of directors \u201cas a serpent\u2019s egg\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because of the latters\u2019 approval of stock exchanges to each other in an alleged unseemly effort to take control of their corporations at the expense of the rest of the family. In the face of these accusations, the boards of directors of the corporations formed a committee, which included non-sibling disinterested directors, unrelated to the Boland corporations, to investigate the disgruntled brothers\u2019 claims and whether legal action should be undertaken. The committee recommended that pursuit of the claims in court would not be in the best interests of the corporations. The trial court, adhering to the business judgment of the disinterested committee, applied the business judgment rule to their investigation and recommendation and dismissed the disgruntled brothers\u2019 claims. That decision was affirmed in a thorough and evidently correct opinion by the Court of Special Appeals, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>Boland v.

I would instead give our historical deference, referred to as the business judgment rule, to decisions made as a result of the recommendation of a special litigation committee (SLC), which is comprised of members who are disinterested in the subject of their investigation and recommendation. Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s insistence on investigating any personal aspects of the lives of the members of the SLC to determine their disinterest and would hold that the directors are independent for the purposes of demand refusal where they are not financially involved in any way with the challenged board decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">To put the whole case in context:</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The boards of directors of the corporations, Boland Trane Services, Inc. and Boland Trane Associates, Inc., are comprised of five members, including three Boland siblings, Sean, James, and Louis, Jr., and two long-term employees of the corporations, Lawrence Cain and John Heise. In 2005, the boards of directors voted to sell stock to James, Louis, Jr., Mr. Cain, and Sean, Jr., Sean\u2019s son. Mr. Heise was not present at this meeting. Each director abstained from the vote on their purchase, and Sean did not vote on his son\u2019s purchase. After siblings John and Kevin, Petitioners, learned of these stock purchases, they challenged them in two separate actions before the Circuit Court for Montgomery County, both filed on May 1, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">In the first action, John and Kevin filed a cross-claim and counterclaim in an ongoing dispute between the corporations and the estate of their sister, Colleen Boland. In this dispute, the corporations sought to enforce, by declaratory judgment, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>shareholder purchase agreement that Colleen had signed prior to her death in which she had agreed to resell her stock to the corporations. John and Kevin, as shareholders, alleged that the directors\u2019 approval of the stock purchases by the directors and Sean, Jr. constituted oppression, fraud, illegality, breaches of the fiduciary duties of loyalty and good faith, and self-dealing.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">In another action, John and Kevin themselves filed a derivative complaint as shareholders, purportedly on behalf of the corporations, against Sean, James, Louis, Jr. and Mr. Cain, the four directors who voted in approval of the stock purchases. Similar to the direct claims in the first action, the derivative complaint alleged that the directors engaged in oppression, fraud, illegality, breaches of the fiduciary duties of good faith and loyalty and self-dealing when they approved the stock purchases. The two actions were consolidated by the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Thereafter, the boards of directors, in response to John and Kevin\u2019s previously-made demand,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> formed a special litigation committee,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to evaluate whether the corporations\u2019 pursuit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>John and Kevin\u2019s allegations was in the best interests of the corporation. On July 30, 2007, the circuit court stayed the consolidated case, including the declaratory judgment action involving John and Kevin\u2019s direct claims against the corporations and directors, to await a determination by the SLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The SLC was comprised of James J. Cromwell, Esq., and Charles J. Wolf, II, CPA, two individuals who had no interest in the disputed transactions. The SLC also engaged independent counsel, Albert D. Brault, Esq., who similarly had no interest in the transactions under scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">After a five-month investigation, the SLC determined that the pursuit of John and Kevin\u2019s claims was not in the best interests of the corporation, and thus recommended termination of the derivative actions, a decision commonly known as \u201cdemand refusal.\u201d Thereafter, on May 23, 2008, the defendant directors moved to dismiss, or in the alternative, for summary judgment in the derivative action. The circuit court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant directors in the derivative action, applying the business judgment rule and deferring to the business judgment of the corporations upon finding that the SLC conducted its investigation and reached its recommendation independently, reasonably and in good faith. Following the grant of summary judgment, the corporations and defendant-directors also moved for dismissal, or in the alternative summary judgment, as to John and Kevin\u2019s claims against the corporation and directors in the direct action, asserting that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>prevented John and Kevin from re-litigating claims that were already resolved by the circuit court in the derivative action. The circuit court agreed and dismissed John and Kevin\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">We have historically deferred to the board of directors\u2019s business judgment, presuming that their actions are in the best interest of their corporation unless otherwise demonstrat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>ed. In his treatise, <em>Maryland Corporation Law, </em>James J. Hanks, Jr. explains that the business judgment rule</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b425-5\">\u201cis a presumption that in making a business decision the directors of a corporation acted on an informed basis, in good faith and in the honest belief that the action taken was in the best interests of the company.\u201d Thus the board\u2019s \u201cdecisions will not be disturbed if they can be attributed to any rational business purpose. A court ... will not substitute its own notions of what is or is not sound business judgment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Section 6.8, at 189 (2007 Supp.), quoting <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 812 (Del.1984) overruled on other grounds by <em>Brehm v. Eisner, </em>746 A.2d 244 (Del.2000), and <em>Sinclair Oil Corp. v. Levien, </em>280 A.2d 717, 720 (Del.1971). Under this standard, Maryland courts review internal disputes of shareholders challenging the decisions of the board of directors by asking \u201cwhether any rational business person could have reached that result, proceeding independently and in good faith with the best interests of the corporation in mind.\u201d <em>Bender v. Schwartz, </em>172 Md.App. 648, 667, 917 A.2d 142, 152 (2007), citing <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">For more than a hundred and fifty years, we have employed a presumption of validity upon the decisions of the board of directors made on behalf of the corporation and later challenged by shareholders. In the mid-19th century, we held in <em>Anacosta Tribe v. Murbach, </em>13 Md. 91, 94-95 (1859), that the corporation\u2019s own regulations, rather than the equitable powers of the court, were to generally govern disputes between shareholders themselves or with directors. In 1864, we observed in <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Rail Road Company, </em>21 Md. 50, 92 (1864), that \u201cthe decision of questions of expediency, as to the fitness of the means employed, are properly confided by the law to the Board of Directors. Courts of Justice will not pass upon them \u2014 they are manifestly incompetent to the task \u2014 and to attempt to do so, would often defeat the ends of the law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>In 1894, in <em>Shaw v. Davis, 78 </em>Md. 308, 316-17, 28 A. 619, 621, we reiterated our refusal to review \u201cinternal disputes between shareholders\u201d or shareholders and directors, \u201cunless there be something illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent.\u201d In <em>Shaw, </em>a minority shareholder sought to enjoin his company from entering in a lease. We refused the intervention and opined that we should \u201cleave all such matters to be disposed of by the majority of stockholders in such a manner as their interests may dictate,\u201d 78 Md. at 316, 28 A. at 621, rather than to the will of a minority shareholder with the assistance of the courts, absent a showing of fraud, illegality or conduct showing ultra vires, to avoid contravening the ideals of free government:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b426-4\">And if the proposed lease be not <em>ultra vires </em>or unlawful or fraudulent, no court, at the instance of a minority stockholder, or at the instance of anyone else, has the power or the right to restrain the majority from dealing with the property as they may deem most advantageous to their own interests. Any other doctrine would put it in the power of a single stockholder, owning but one share out of many hundreds, to transfer the entire management of a corporation to a court of equity and would effectually destroy the right of the owners of the property lawfully to control it themselves. It would make a court of equity practically the guardian, so to speak, of such a corporation, and would substitute the chancellor\u2019s belief as to what contracts a corporation ought, as a matter of expediency, or policy, or business venture to make, instead of allowing such questions to be settled by the persons beneficially interested in the property. No such arbitrary or dangerous power has ever been claimed by any court, and, if laid claim to, it would never be tolerated in a free government.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b426-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 328-29, 28 A. at 625. We also concluded that the corporation, rather than the minority shareholder, was adversely affected by the disputed lease, and thus \u201cevery litigation must be in the name of the company, <em>if the company really desire it.\u201d Id. </em>at 317, 28 A. at 621 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>Although the business judgment rule may be an exercise in restraint, it is not a \u201crubber stamp.\u201d At the turn of the twentieth century, in <em>Du Puy v. Transportation &amp; Terminal Company, </em>82 Md. 408, 83 A. 889 (1896), we found the fraud necessary under the business judgment rule to intervene when two minority shareholders claimed that the corporation\u2019s majority shareholder, board of directors, and appointed trustee had engaged in a series of fraudulent acts to wind up the solvent corporation. Shortly after the minority shareholders, the Du Puys, had purchased shares, the president of the board of directors and the majority shareholder took the Du Puys\u2019 money for themselves and wound up the corporation by appointing a trustee who agreed to distribute the corporation\u2019s assets to members of the board and associates of the majority shareholder. In intervening, we recognized the risk of inefficiency and continued fraudulent and wrongful conduct were we not to act and maintained that a receiver appointed by the circuit court, rather than the court itself, would review the corporation\u2019s actions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b427-5\">It is not for us to say what particular assets or property a receiver can, when appointed, recover. It is enough for the purposes of this case for us to be able to see from the record that wrong and fraud have been perpetrated, and that wrong and that this is an eminently fit case for the appointment of a receiver to unmask and rip open whatever is not beyond the reach of a successful assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 442, 33 A. at 895.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">In 1907, in <em>Sloan v. Clarkson, </em>105 Md. 171, 66 A. 18, we applied the business judgment rule to review a demand refusal in a shareholder derivative action. In that case, the corporation refused the demand of a minority shareholder and director, Frank S. Clarkson, to require majority director, majority shareholder, and corporate officer, E. Eugene Sloan, to produce accounting records of his work for the corporation. As the managing agent of the corporation, Sloan was entrusted with overseeing its entire business, collecting its profits and taking a commission for himself before handing over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>remainder to the corporation. Clarkson\u2019s bill alleged, and neither Sloan nor the corporation in their demurrer denied, that the refusal of his demand by the majority of directors was the result of fraudulent and improper motives. The circuit court overruled the demurrer and we affirmed, holding that the corporation and Sloan must provide an answer because the business judgment rule enunciated in <em>Shaw </em>and <em>Du Puy </em>did not insulate the corporation where, if proven, the demand was refused with a fraudulent or improper motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Thus, our business judgment rule is premised on the belief that the will of the majority, and the decisions of experienced business professionals on the board of directors, should be afforded a presumption of validity, unless a <em>minority shareholder shows </em>that such acts are fraudulent, illegal, conduct of ultra vires, or grossly negligent. <em>McQuillen v. National Cash Register Co., </em>112 F.2d 877, 883 (4th Cir.1940) (applying Maryland law); <em>see also Williams v. Salisbury Ice Co., </em>176 Md. 13, 23, 3 A.2d 507, 512 (1939) (\u201cThere must be proof of fraud, and the onus of that proof is upon the complainant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">When the Maryland General Assembly enacted the Director\u2019s Standard of Care provision, Section 2-405.1(a) of the Corporations <em>&amp; </em>Associations Article, Maryland Code, in 1976, it embodied the business judgment rule. Section 2-405.1(a) requires a director to act \u201c(1) In good faith; (2) In a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the corporation; and (3) With the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances.\u201d Maryland Code, (1975, 2007 Repl.Vol.), Section 2-405.1(a) of the Corporations &amp; Associations Article. At the time the Section 2-405.1(a) was enacted, it was \u201cwell established that courts generally will not interfere with the internal management of a corporation.\u201d <em>Devereux v. Berger, </em>264 Md. 20, 31-32, 284 A.2d 605, 612 (1971). In 1999, the General Assembly expressly enacted the business judgment presumption by adopting Section 2-405.1(e), which states that \u201c[a]n act of a director of a corporation is presumed to satisfy the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>standards of subsection (a) of this section.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AtB\">In 2001, in <em>Werbowsky v. Collomb, </em>362 Md. 581, 766 A.2d 123, we reviewed the application of the business judgment rule in shareholder derivative actions. We declined to fully adopt the approach in <em>Aronson v. Lewis, </em>473 A.2d 805, 814 (Del.1984), which held that a shareholder\u2019s pre-suit demand on the corporation may be excused where there is a reasonable doubt as to whether the directors were independent and whether the challenged transaction was the product of proper business judgment. In so doing, we reasoned that the value in the demand requirement is tied to business judgment rule protection enjoyed by directors against inappropriate challenges of minority shareholders:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">The demand requirement <em>is </em>important. Directors are presumed to act properly and in the best interest of the corporation. They enjoy the benefit and protection of the business judgment rule, and their control of corporate affairs should not be impinged based on non-specific or speculative allegations of wrongdoing. Nor should they, or the corporation, be put unnecessarily at risk by minority shareholders bent simply on mischief, who file derivative actions not to correct abuse as much to coerce nuisance settlements.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A00n\"><em>Id. </em>at 618-19, 766 A.2d at 144. We concluded that, \u201cIf demand is made and refused, that decision, and the basis for it, can be reviewed by a court under the business judgment rule standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 766 A.2d at 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The robustness of the business judgment rule is now being questioned by the majority\u2019s adoption in shareholder deriva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>tive actions of what it calls a middle ground in the application of the business judgment rule to acts of an SLC. <em>Auerbach v. Bennett, 47 </em>N.Y.2d 619, 419 N.Y.S.2d 920, 393 N.E.2d 994 (1979), and <em>Zapata Corporation v. Maldonado, </em>430 A.2d 779 (Del.1981), are the two leading approaches nationally to judicial review of demand refusals. The <em>Auerbach </em>standard adheres to the New York business judgment rule and limits judicial review to the disinterested independence of the SLC members and the reasonableness of the investigation\u2019s procedures and conclusions. <em>See </em>3 93 N.E.2d at 1001-02. Delaware\u2019s <em>Zapata </em>standard utilizes a two-prong approach, placing the burden on the corporation to demonstrate the SLC\u2019s independence, good faith and the reasonableness of its investigation and conclusion and when met, then permits the court to use its own \u201cindependent business judgment\u201d to determine whether the SLC decision was in the best interests of the corporation. <em>See </em>430 A.2d at 788-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The majority\u2019s adoption of \u201cenhanced Auerbach,\u201d also known as the first prong of the <em>Zapata </em>standard, removes the presumption of our traditional business judgment rule in favor of the corporation. This ruling is contrary to our jurisprudence and the goal of acknowledging the will of the majority, absent a showing of director abuse by the plaintiff shareholder; our standard, like New York\u2019s <em>Auerbach </em>standard, has placed the burden on the plaintiff shareholder to demonstrate that the director action, including a demand refusal, was made unreasonably, in bad faith, or while the director was on both sides of the transaction and thus interested.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court reviewed the SLC\u2019s report under the deferential business judgment rule as recognized by the Court of Special Appeals as one to defer \u201cto the decision of the board or committee not to pursue litigation unless the stockholders can show either that the board or committee\u2019s investigation or decision was not conducted independently and in good faith, or that it was not within the realm of sound business judgment.\u201d <em>Boland, </em>194 Md.App. at 499, 5 A.3d at 119, quoting <em>Bender, </em>172 Md.App. at 666, 917 A.2d at 152. The SLC members and counsel were disinterest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>ed and independent, the circuit court found, because each individual had never \u201cbeen employed by, done business with or provided services for either corporation.\u201d The trial judge also found that the SLC\u2019s investigation and conclusions were made in good faith and reasonably in light of their \u201ccomprehensive investigation lasting approximately 5 months,\u201d including interviews with John and Kevin as well as 9 other individuals, a 30 page report and 32 exhibits. The circuit court held, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed in its reported opinion, that John and Kevin as derivative plaintiffs failed to rebut the presumption that the SLC, as the disinterested directors for the corporations, acted in the best interests of the companies. Just as did our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals, I would affirm the reasoned application by the circuit court of the business judgment rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">In addition to removing the presumption of business judgment rule, however, the majority also further requires the judiciary to enter the bowels of the corporation to determine the SLC independence. The majority defines the standard of independent business judgment to require an individual on the SLC to have no consequential formal, informal, professional or personal ties with the directors who are parties to the case, to the extent that the circuit court is required to conduct a background check on the SLC members and its independent counsel and require the SLC and the board of directors to disclose to the court their social, personal and other business affiliations. This standard is unworkable and intrusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">We review the independence of SLC members, specifically their care, attention and sense of individual responsibility, to ensure that each member is \u201cin a position to base his decision on the merits of the issue rather than being governed by extraneous considerations or influences.\u201d <em>Kaplan v. Wyatt, </em>499 A.2d 1184, 1189, quoting <em>Aronson, </em>473 A.2d at 816. The SLC members, James J. Cromwell, Esq., and Charles J. Wolf, II, CPA, and their independent counsel, Albert D. Brault, Esq., each asserted their disinterest and independence from the Board Defendants in the SLC report. There was no proof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>of any financial interest or involvement in the stock purchases at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In affirming the circuit court\u2019s finding of SLC independence, the Court of Special Appeals observed that \u201c[tjhere never has been a serious assertion by the appellants of lack of independence or good faith on the part of Cromwell or Wolfe or their counsel, Brault.\u201d 194 Md.App. at 512, 5 A.3d at 127. As the opinion stated, the SLC members could not be disqualified merely because the corporations and their directors were based on the fact that SLC members were appointed by the board of directors, as interested directors may appoint the SLC under Maryland law. <em>Id. </em>at 512 n. 16, 5 A.3d at 127 n. 16, quoting <em>Rosengarten v. Buckley, </em>613 F.Supp. 1493, 1499 (D.Md.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The majority, though, asserts that the circuit court\u2019s review of professional ties of the corporations and the SLC members was inadequate. Rather, the majority opines that the corporation must demonstrate that the SLC members experienced no influence from the interested directors, emanating from any professional, recreational, social, religious, or non-profit organization affiliations. Six degrees of separation, however, could potentially remove the \u201cinfluence\u201d from participating on an SLC.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">The majority\u2019s independence inquiry beckons the question: how far must the circuit court go in order to establish the independence of the SLC members? For that matter, as the corporation now must bear the burden of proving the SLC\u2019s independence under the majority\u2019s standard, how much must the SLC members and Board Defendants disclose to show the SLC\u2019s ability to make an independent decision? Will the circuit court review the per stirpal lineage of each SLC member and explore whether an SLC member is within six degrees of separation from the members of the board of directors? Where a minority shareholder was once required to prove fraud, illegality or ultra vires on the part of the board of directors to proceed beyond a demand refusal, <em>Sloan v. Clarkson, </em>105 Md. 171, 66 A. 18 (1907), the majority now <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>encourages the shareholder to pursue a derivative action, upon a simple showing that the SLC members and interested directors are members of collegial groups, such as, for example, the Maryland State Bar Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The independence of the SLC members and their counsel only should turn on whether they are financially interested in the board of directors\u2019s action or decision at issue. Rather than a review of the multifarious personal and professional relationships that will become unworkable and unnecessarily intrusive, a review of the members\u2019 financial relationship with the challenged transaction selves as a bright-line per capita approach to director independence. In this case, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County and the Court of Special Appeals properly concluded that, having no prior employment, business and thus financial connection to the boards\u2019 approval of stock purchases, Mr. Cromwell, Mr. Wolfe and Mr. Brault were all sufficiently disinterested to reach a decision regarding John and Kevin\u2019s demand without the inappropriate influence of the defendant directors. As to the derivative action, the circuit court properly applied the business judgment rule to the SLC report and granted summary judgment in favor of the corporations and the defendant directors.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">The circuit court also correctly applied the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>to John and Kevin\u2019s counterclaim and cross-claim that alleged the same facts as those underlying the derivative action. \u201cRes judicata literally means \u2018a thing adjudicated,\u2019 and generally indicates \u2018[a]n affirmative defense barring the same parties from litigating a second lawsuit on the same claim....\u2019\u201d <em>Lizzi v. Washington Metropolitan Area, Transit Authority, </em>384 Md. 199, 206, 862 A.2d 1017, 1022 (2004), quoting Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1336-37 (8th ed.2004). \u201cThe doctrine embodies three elements: (1) the parties in the present litigation are the same or in privity with the parties to the earlier litigation; (2) the claim presented in the current action is identical to that determined or that which could have been raised and determined in the prior litigation; and (3) there was a final judgment on the merits in the prior litiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>tion.\u201d <em>R &amp; D 2001, LLC v. Rice, </em>402 Md. 648, 663, 938 A.2d 839, 848 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">In this case, there is no dispute that the parties are identical or that the factual basis for John and Kevin\u2019s direct action do not diverge from that of the derivative action. Rather, the majority maintains that the circuit court\u2019s grant of summary judgment did not reach the merits of the derivative claim, but only the independence, good faith and reasonableness of the SLC and its investigation. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">A case need not reach trial before a court\u2019s resolution serves as a final judgment on the merits for <em>res judicata </em>purposes. <em>See deLeon v. Slear, </em>328 Md. 569, 616 A.2d 380 (1992); <em>Adkins v. Allstate Insurance Co., </em>729 F.2d 974, 976 n. 3 (4th Cir.1984) (\u201cFor purposes of <em>res judicata, </em>summary judgment has always been considered a final disposition on the merits.\u201d). In <em>deLeon v. Slear, </em>328 Md. 569, 616 A.2d 380 (1992), we observed that \u201csummary judgment for the defendant is a valid and final judgment\u201d and that the doctrine of <em>res judicata </em>barred subsequent identical claims between the same parties or parties sharing privity with those of the earlier litigation. 328 Md. at 580, 616 A.2d at 385, citing Section 19, Comment g, of the Restatement (Second) of Judgments (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the circuit court\u2019s prior grant of summary judgment against John and Kevin\u2019s derivative claims, which mirror the claims raised directly,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> serve as a final judgment on the merits for purposes of <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b421-9\">.

In a derivative action, shareholders pursue corporate rights, including challenging the actions of a board member as a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the corporation, that the corporation itself did not assert on its own. <em>Werbowsky v.

Laureate Education, Inc., </em>411 Md. 317, 983 A.2d 408 (2009), and determined that the business judgment rule did not apply to direct claims, but <em>Shenker </em>addressed only whether the board of directors owes the common law fiduciary duties of candor and maximization of shareholder value to shareholders directly in the context of a cash-out merger transaction following the board\u2019s decision to sell the corporation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
