Based upon the record, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Appellant had knowledge of the risk that resulted in injuries, when, in making a delivery during the course of his employment, he chose to walk through a stream of running water that flowed across a parking lot. Therefore, we hold that it was error for the trial court to resolve the question of assumption of the risk on summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">Appellant sued Coakley &amp; Williams Construction, Inc. (\u201cCoakley\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d or \u201cCross-Appellant\u201d) and Forsgate Ventures II, LLC (\u201cForsgate\u201d or \u201cAppellee\u201d) in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on November 13, 2008. Appellant alleged that at approximately 11 o\u2019clock in the morning on December 21, 2005, he was walking through the parking lot toward the back entrance of his place of employment, located at 22610 Gateway Center Drive in Clarksburg, Maryland (\u201cthe Gateway Center\u201d), when he slipped, fell, and injured<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> himself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>on what he surmised to be \u201cblack ice\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> while wadding through a stream of water that created a path through an otherwise icy parking lot. At the time of the incident, Appellant had been a courier, with some supervisory duties over the \u201ctransportation department,\u201d for Diagnostic Pathology Services, Incorporated. Appellant\u2019s responsibilities included transporting lab specimens from off-site doctors\u2019 offices back to the laboratory located at the Gateway Center, a combination warehouse/office/strip center complex. Appellant described normally parking in spots located behind the building in one, long parking lot shared by employees of other businesses in the building. On the day of his injury, Appellant parked in this rear parking lot even though there was a front and side parking lot with spaces available to him and other employees of Diagnostic. Due to construction at the Gateway Center, Appellant alleged that water was being pumped into the parking lot where he was walking, resulting in a stream of water an inch deep and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>between two and three feet wide running through the lot into a drain. Appellant alleged that he slipped and fell on black ice, which he could not see and did not know was in the path that he chose to take through the otherwise wet and icy parking lot. As pertinent, we shall discuss additional facts regarding the circumstances of Appellant\u2019s injury <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">Appellee Forsgate allegedly owned and controlled the Gateway Center building, and Appellee Coakley, itself or through its agents, allegedly pumped water out of pipes in a nearby construction site and drained water into the parking lot causing the black ice to form. Appellant alleged that Forsgate was negligent in its failure to maintain the parking lot, that Coakley was negligent in failing to prevent a stream of water from flowing onto the parking lot, thereby causing the black ice to form, and that both entities were negligent for failing to prevent, warn of, or remove the black ice. Coakley filed a third party complaint against Judd Fire Protection, LLC (\u201cJudd\u201d or \u201cCross-Appellee\u201d) alleging that Judd, as its subcontractor hired for maintenance on the building\u2019s fire sprinkler system, was responsible for the alleged water flow onto the property. Forsgate filed a third-party complaint against Diagnostic.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">On October 15, 2009, nearly one year after filing the original complaint, Appellant filed an amended complaint naming Transwestern/Carey Winston, LLC (\u201cTranswestern\u201d) and The Brickman Group Ltd. LLC (\u201cBrickman\u201d) as defendants. The amended complaint alleged that as the management company for the Gateway Center, Transwestern had a duty to maintain the parking lot in a safe condition. Additionally, Appellant claimed that Brickman, the company under contract for snow and ice removal for the property, had the duty to properly remove snow and ice from the premises, including the duty to prevent, warn of, or remove black ice and water so that it was safe for all users of the building to traverse the parking lot. Brickman moved to dismiss the amended complaint for violation of the statute of limitations, and the motion was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>Prior to trial, Coakley, Forsgate, Transwestern, Diagnostic, and Judd moved for summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At a hearing on March 3, 2010, the trial judge granted summary judgment in favor of each of the original defendants and third-party defendants on the ground that Appellant had assumed the risk of his injury.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The trial judge had before him for consideration on the issue: Appellant\u2019s deposition testimony, in which he responded to questions from counsel for Forsgate, Coakley, Judd and Diagnostic; Appellant\u2019s Affidavit; Answers to Interrogatories; and Complaint. From these documents, several allegations are consistent: that Appellant believed that he took a safe path to the building by choosing to walk through a running stream of water; that he did not believe ice could form beneath running water; that he had walked through the same stream at least 5-7 times during the week prior to his fall without incident; that the conditions in the parking lot were more wet and less icy on the morning of his accident than the night before; and that he did not see ice in the path he chose to take.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">Appellant did not recall very much about the weather conditions on the day of his injury. He testified in his deposition that it was \u201ca little overcast,\u201d and possibly \u201cfreezing the day before\u201d but he could not recall with clarity whether there had been freezing temperatures on the morning of his injury. Appellant testified that, the day before his injury, there was water and ice \u201cin the same general area\u201d where he fell and that he had noticed that area \u201cwas slippery\u201d and even warned co-workers to be careful. His testimony indicated, however, that his awareness of the conditions on the lot differed between the night before and the day of the incident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>Q. Was it water and the same kind of general condition you observed the next morning?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-4\">A. It was a little different. It was \u2014 it was a little bit more runnier than it was the night before. Night before, it was, like, pretty much you could tell it was all ice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Appellant testified that there \u201cwas ice everywhere,\u201d but then clarified the location of visible ice in the parking lot and testified that he could not see ice in the path he ultimately chose to walk through:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">Q. What did you observe of the lot as you were \u2014 when you pulled into it that morning, the condition of the lot?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">A. It was pretty wet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-8\">Q. Okay. Where was the ice located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-9\">A. In that general area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-10\">Q. Same area where you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-11\">A. Right. There was spots of it all over and the loading dock \u2014 It was ice everywhere.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-12\">Q. Why did you feel that area was safe when you walked on it? A. Because it had running water. You couldn\u2019t really see any ice, just the running water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-13\">Q. So just so the record\u2019s clear, could you see any evidence of ice in the area that you stepped when you \u2014 in the area that you fell in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-14\">A. Well, there was flowing about an inch of water, so I assumed that it would be safe to walk through that area. Q. The question is could you see any ice when you walk\u2014 A No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-15\">Q. \u2014through the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-16\">A. Could not see any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>Q. Okay. Now, so when you were asked before about ice being all over this general area, were the three areas that you pointed out the only areas that you can remember that there was ice in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-5\">A. Yeah, it was vague that whole day, but I would not walk through the ice, I would walk through the water. I\u2019d rather get wet than slip. So I walked through the ice \u2014 I mean through the water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">Appellant\u2019s earlier deposition testimony revealed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-7\">Q. I mean, you\u2019re a grown man. You know that if you walk on ice that you could possibly slip.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-8\">A. Oh, yes, I avoided the ice. You could see some spots of ice and some not. Of course I wouldn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-9\">Q. You could possibly slip on ice, you were aware of that? A. Of course. That\u2019s why I was kind of using the cars to kind of steady me through that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-10\">Q. And you saw that there was ice in that area, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-11\">A. There was ice everywhere out there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">Ultimately, Appellant used a diagram to illustrate the location of three patches of ice on the parking lot, the drain toward which the stream of water was flowing, the parked cars, and the building. Appellant was consistent in his description of the dimensions of the stream of water through which he walked. He described it as one inch deep and two to three feet wide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-13\">Q. And when you say there\u2019s a flow of water, how much water are we talking about? How deep?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-14\">A. Probably about \u2014 I\u2019d say about like that, because it didn\u2019t come over my shoes or anything .... say about an inch.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-15\">Q. I\u2019m trying to get \u2014 how wide was the stream? Was it a foot, two feet, three feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>A. Probably about two, three feet. It was a pretty good stream.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-5\">Q. So then what \u2014 you walked \u2014 when you walked in the stream, is that when you fell? Or was it beside the stream? A. It was water everywhere, so you had to walk through it. There was water coming from all directions. And then I got, like I say, it was about there, and I started just to walk towards this X and went through the water.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Appellant also testified that he had walked through this area previously:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-7\">Q. How many times had you walked through' this water area before you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-8\">A. Every day I went to work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-9\">Q. So you said it had been there about a week?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-10\">A. Uh-huh, yeah.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-11\">Q. So you had walked through there\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-12\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-13\">Q. \u2014five to seven times?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-14\">A. Probably, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-15\">Q. And then had you walked back through there on the way out from work at the end of the day?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-16\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-17\">Q. And I guess you had walked through there from time to time more than one time per day; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-18\">A. Yes, uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-19\">Q. Had you ever fallen before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-20\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-21\">Q. Did you see what you actually fell on?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-22\">A. No. All I know is both feet went out from under me. Appellant also testified that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-23\">A. When I fell I could feel my hand hit the ice. It was, like, wet and that sort of thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-24\">Q. Wdiat was wet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-25\">A. The ground. \"When I fell, my elbow hit and my hands went and hit the ground, and that\u2019s basically how I could tell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>it was black ice, because the fact that I could feel it on my hand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">He explained that he thought he was taking the safest route through the parking lot:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">Q. On Exhibit 2 you circled some areas of ice. And those are areas of ice that you saw before you fell, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alj\">A. Yes, uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-7\">Q. And how did you know to avoid those areas? How did you know that was ice before you fell?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-8\">A. Well, you do see some rough edges and things like that. That\u2019s where when I picked a spot, I picked a spot that looked to be the safest. So I felt that I could make it through that area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-9\">Q. Were you walking through that area at the time of the fall?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-10\">A. Yes. I figured since it was water flowing it wouldn\u2019t be any ice there, because the water was flowing, which would make sense. And that\u2019s why I felt if I go through that water, I would have less chance of slipping.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">The trial judge concluded that this case did not differ materially from prior ice and snow slip and fall cases that this Court and the intermediate appellate court have considered, and the trial judge found that Appellant had \u201cassumed the risk of falling on ice as a matter of law.\u201d The ruling stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-12\">In this case, shorn of extraneous material, this case arises out of a slip and fall on ice. The plaintiff in this case arrived for work at 11:00 a.m. on December 21, 2005. While driving to work, the plaintiff observed ice everywhere on the employer\u2019s parking lot. Plaintiff testified that there had been freezing temperatures in the morning of December 21, 2005. He also testified that he had observed water and ice on the parking lot the evening before in the exact same area where he fell. In addition, the plaintiff testified that he remembers that the area in question had been slippery the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>evening before his fall. Plaintiff even advised one of his colleagues that prior evening that the colleague should be careful, i.e[.], very careful, because it was slippery in the parking lot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-5\">[A]t the time of the events in question, the plaintiff exited his vehicle, was walking toward his place of employment, and he was aware of ice and water on the ground. Plaintiff says that he attempted to avoid the ice that he saw by walking through an area of the parking lot [where] there was a lot of water flowing through it. And while attempting to walk through this particular portion of the parking lot, the plaintiff slipped and fell.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-6\">The plaintiff testified at page 34 of his deposition that he was aware of ice in the parking lot, that he was aware that ice was slippery----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">Plaintiff also testified in response to questions on page 141 [of his deposition] that he was aware of black ice and he could feel it under the slushy water.[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-8\">Lots of other testimony and documents in evidence, but I think I have cogently summarized the core facts. The Court of Appeals and the Court of Special Appeals have made it abundantly clear that when someone is aware of icy conditions in an area and nevertheless elect[s] to proceed through those areas they assume the risk as a matter of law. While I agree that the various factual permutations of cases are somewhat different, they\u2019re not materially different. <em>Allen v. Marriott, </em>183 Md.App. 460 [961 A.2d 1141], is in my judgment on point. As was further explicated by the Court of Special Appeals recently in the <em>Muscatello </em>case, 189 Md.App. 620 [985 A.2d 156]. Both Judge Hollander in <em>Muscatello </em>and Judge Moylan in <em>Marriott </em>extensively survey, review, discuss, dissect all of the appellate cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>There\u2019s no need for me to do it here. I conclude that the plaintiff assumed the risk of falling on ice as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Consequently, all of the motions for summary judgment based on assumption of the risk will be granted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Appellant appealed this ruling to the Court of Special Appeals, contesting the grant of summary judgment in favor of Coakley, Forsgate, and Transwestern, as well as the earlier motion to dismiss in favor of Brickman. Coakley filed a cross-appeal on the grounds that the trial judge erred in granting Judd\u2019s motion for summary judgment on Coakley\u2019s third-party complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Prior to proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, we issued a writ of certiorari, on our own initiative. <em>Poole v. Coakley &amp; Williams Constr., </em>417 Md. 501, 10 A.3d 1180 (2011). We now address the following questions, restated for brevity and clarity:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-8\">1) Whether the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Coakley and Forsgate based upon the allegation that Appellant assumed the risk of his injury;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-9\">2) Whether the decisions of <em>Allen v. Marriott Worldwide Corp., </em>183 Md.App. 460, 961 A.2d 1141 (2008), <em>cert. denied, Allen v. Marriott, </em>408 Md. 149, 968 A.2d 1065 (2009), and <em>Thomas v. Panco Mgmt. of Md., LLC, </em>195 Md.App. 245, 6 A.3d 304 (2010), <em>cert. granted, Thomas v. Panco Mgmt., </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011), as applied to Appellant\u2019s case, are erroneous; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-10\">3) Whether the trial judge erred granting Transwestern and Briekman\u2019s motions, for summary judgment and to dismiss, respectively, based upon Appellant\u2019s non-compliance with the statute of limitations;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">We also address Coakley\u2019s cross-appeal, which asks \u201cwhether the summary judgment entered in favor of Judd should be reversed, if the summary judgment entered in favor of Coakley is reversed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">We shall reverse the grant of summary judgment entered in favor of Coakley and Forsgate because, on the basis of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>record before the trial court, Appellant did not assume the risk of his injury as a matter of law. We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Transwestern, and the dismissal in favor of Brickman, because the claims against both were barred by Appellant\u2019s failure to comply with the three year statute of limitations for bringing civil claims. Additionally, we disavow today the reasoning related to assumption of the risk in <em>Allen.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>On Coakley\u2019s cross-appeal, we reverse the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Judd because sufficient' evidence was presented regarding its contingent liability to Coakley in the instance that Coakley is found liable to Appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">When reviewing an entry of summary judgment, we have stated:</p>\n<p id=\"AvH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number><em>Walk v. Hartford Cas. Ins. Co., </em>382 Md. 1, 14, 852 A.2d 98, 105-06 (2004). Summary judgment is not proper where there is a genuine dispute of material fact, which includes disputes over reasonable factual inferences. <em>See Fenwick Motor Co. v. Fenwick, </em>258 Md. 134, 136, 265 A.2d 256, 257 (1970) (considering the \u201cthe propriety of granting summary judgment ... where the facts enumerated in the supporting affidavits [were] conceded for the purposes of the motion but where the inferences that [could] be reasonably drawn from them [were] hotly contested,\u201d and holding that \u201cthe genuine dispute of fact contemplated by Maryland Rule 610 d[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] includes disputes both over facts and factual inferences.... \u201d); <em>Barb v. Wallace, </em>45 Md.App. 271, 278, 412 A.2d 1314, 1318 (1980) (stating \u201c[t]he facts here are susceptible of more than one permissible inference and the choice between these inferences should be made by the trier of fact and should not be resolved on a motion for summary judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>The standard of review is <em>de novo. See Jurgensen v. New Phoenix, </em>880 Md. 106, 843 A.2d 865 (2004). The standard of review of a grant of summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>See Pelican Nat\u2019l Bank v. Provident Bank of Md., </em>381 Md. 327, 849 A.2d 475 (2004). Whether summary judgment was granted properly is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>We reiterate that in reviewing a grant of summary judgment under Maryland Rule 2-501[f], we independently review the record to determine whether there exists any genuine issue of material fact and whether the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Jurgensen, </em>380 Md. at 114, 843 A.2d at 869. We review the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party and construe any reasonable inferences which may be drawn from the facts against the movant. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b157-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>An assumption of the risk defense, properly asserted, may be grounds for entering summary judgment for a defendant, or otherwise finding that the defense has been established as a matter of law, but this is only true when \u201cthe undisputed facts permit but one reasonable determination,\u201d namely, that the plaintiff has assumed the risk as a matter of law. <em>Hooper v. Mougin, </em>263 Md. 630, 635, 284 A.2d 236, 239 (1971); <em>accord Chalmers v. Willis, </em>247 Md. 379, 385, 231 A.2d 70, 73 (1967). Thus, \u201c[i]n the usual case, [the plaintiffs] knowledge and appreciation of the danger will be a question for the jury; but where it is clear that any person of normal intelligence in [the plaintiffs] position must have understood the danger, the issue must be decided by the court.\u201d <em>Gibson v. Beaver, </em>245 Md. 418, 421, 226 A.2d 273, 275 (1967) (quoting William L. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 55 at 310 (2d ed. 1955)); <em>see </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496D cmt. e (1965) (\u201cWhether the plaintiff knows of the existence of the risk, or whether he understands and appreciates its magnitude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>and its unreasonable character, is a question of fact, usually to be determined by the jury under proper instructions from the court.

Use of the phrase \u201cobjective test\u201d in Maryland case law has created confusion because it suggests further overlap with the doctrine of contributory negligence, when the concepts are, in fact, distinct.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> As this Court stated in <em>Warner:</em></p>\n<p id=\"A0i\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>171 Md. at 359-60, 189 A. at 264; <em>Bull S.S.

Either defense may exist without the other, but, of course, \u201c[t]he same conduct on the part of the plaintiff may ... amount to both assumption of risk and contributory negligence, and may subject [the plaintiff] to both defenses.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 280-81, 592 A.2d at 1122, (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496A cmt. d). For example, a plaintiffs \u201cconduct in accepting the risk may be unreasonable and thus negligent, because the danger is out of all proportion to the interest he is seeking to advance, as where he consents to ride with a drunken driver ... or dashes into a burning building to save his hat.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, the traditional basis for distinguishing the two doctrines is that \u201cassumption of risk is a matter of knowledge of the danger and voluntary acquiescence in it, while contributory negligence is a matter of some fault or departure from the standard of conduct of the reasonable person, however unaware, unwilling, or even protesting the plaintiff may be.\u201d <em>Prosser and Keeton </em>\u00a7 68, at 482. There is, however, another distinction between the doctrines which has not heretofore been fully explained in Maryland, namely that the standard for imputing knowledge to a plaintiff under assumption of the risk is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Contributory negligence, of course, means negligence which contributes to cause a particular accident which occurs, while assumption of risk of accident means voluntar[il]y incurring that of an accident which may not occur, and which the person assuming the risk may be careful to avoid after starting. Contributory negligence defeats recovery because it is a proximate cause of the accident which happens, but assumption of the risk defeats recovery because it is a previous abandonment of the right to complain if an accident occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>[I]n theory at least, a subjective one, geared to the particular plaintiff and his situation, rather than that of the reasonable person of ordinary prudence who appears in contributory negligence.

Thus, <em>the plaintiff'will not be heard to say that he did not comprehend a risk which must have been quite clear and obvious to him. </em>There are some things ... which are so far a matter of common knowledge in the community, that in the absence of some satisfactory explanation a denial of such knowledge simply is not to be believed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\"><em>Prosser and Keeton </em>\u00a7 68, at 487-88 (emphasis added); <em>C &amp; M Builders, LLC v.

In cases of assumption of risk, however, the plaintiffs own testimony as to what he knew, understood, or appreciated, is not necessarily conclusive. There are some risks as to which no adult will be believed if he says that he did not know or understand them. Thus an adult who knowingly comes in contact with a fire will not be believed if he says that he was unaware of the risk that he might be burned by it; and the same is true of such risks as those of drowning in water or falling from a height, in the absence of any special circumstances which may conceal or appear to minimize the danger. One who has spent a substantial time upon particular premises ordinarily would be found in fact to understand and appreciate the normal, ordinary risks of those premises, such as the danger from moving trains in a railroad switching yard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496D cmts. c <em>&amp; </em>d.

This \u201cobjective standard\u201d language, as used in our case law, stands for the proposition that \u201cthere are certain risks which any one of adult age must be taken to appreciate,\u201d and, in those cases, a simple denial from a plaintiff concerning his or her knowledge of such a risk will not be sufficient to avoid judgment for the defendant as a matter of law. <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 421, 226 A.2d at 275 (quoting Prosser, \u00a7 55, at 310); <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 91, 702 A.2d at 734; <em>Crews, </em>358 Md. at 644, 751 A.2d at 490 (\u201cCourts will not be swayed by a plaintiffs <em>subjective </em>denial that he or she did not comprehend the extent of a <em>dearly obvious </em>danger.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">Indeed, we have held consistently that \u201cwhen it is clear that a person of normal intelligence in the position of plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger, the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added); <em>accord Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 421, 226 A.2d at 275.

When a risk is a foreseeable consequence of engaging in a particular activity, dvwe have reasoned that there is an implied consent to relieve others of liability for injury and assumption of the risk may be established as a matter of law. <em>American Powerlifting Assoc. v.

In <em>Gibson, </em>this Court charged the plaintiff \u201cwith knowledge of the heaviness of a [large] hose ... in which there was fuel oil and of the possible physical effects on a man of his age of the effort to lift it or drag it through the snow,\u201d adding, \u201c[i]f he did not appreciate this sooner, he must have when he took hold of the hose.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422, 226 A.2d at 275-76.

Also in <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>it was clear that the plaintiff assumed the risk of injury when he voluntarily worked near an unguarded hole because the danger of falling was obvious. 420 Md. 268, 295-96, 22 A.3d at 883.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Our recent snow and ice cases are instructive, yet distinguishable, from the facts of this case. While this Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Morgan State, ADM P\u2019ship, </em>and <em>Sckroyer, </em>focused on the voluntariness of the plaintiffs\u2019 actions, each case also stands for the proposition that the knowledge undoubtably acquired from encountering <em>visible </em>snow and ice may be imputed to the plaintiff as a matter of law. <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 519, 919 A.2d at 27 (involving a plaintiff who slipped <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and fell on visibly icy parking lot while visiting her daughter\u2019s college); <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 88-89, 702 A.2d at 733 (involving a plaintiff who slipped and fell on a visibly icy walkway while making a delivery at a building owned by the defendants); <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 288-89, 592 A.2d at 1125-26 (involving a plaintiff who slipped and fell while traversing a visibly icy hotel parking lot); <em>see Warsham v.

Thus, neither Dean Prosser\u2019s observation, nor our cases employing it, are dispositive in the instant case. As discussed <em>supra, </em>Appellant testified repeatedly that he saw ice in certain areas of the parking lot, but that he did not see ice, or suspect that it could be, in the stream of water that he believed would be a safe path to the building. It may be a \u201cmatter of common knowledge that ice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>is slippery,\u201d but one\u2019s ability to identify black ice, when by its nature it is not perceivable or knowable until the moment of experience, means the danger is not necessarily patent.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Cf. Shea, </em>76 Mo.App. at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">We have consistently held that a plaintiff does not consent to waive claims for liability beyond \u201cthose risks which might reasonably [have been] expected to exist.\u201d <em>Bull S.S.

Even if the physical layout of the parking lot, including: the location of the visible ice, the stream, the drain, the cars, etc. were undisputed, the issue of Appellant\u2019s knowledge concerning the very existence of the dangerous condition, <em>i.e., </em>the black ice beneath the stream of water that covered the path he trod, was subject to more than one reasonable inference.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201cWhere there is a dispute whether the risk is assumed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>or not, that question is usually left to the jury.\u201d <em>Bull S.S.

In the present case, the record suggests that the presence of black ice was more akin to an \u201cunusual danger,\u201d so that consideration by the trier of fact was necessary to determine if it was \u201cassumed or not.\u201d <em>Bull S.S. Lines, </em>196 Md. at 526, 77 A.2d at 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">As pointed out <em>supra, </em>the focus in an assumption of the risk case is on the plaintiffs subjective knowledge, as \u201cthe doctrine of assumption of risk will not be applied [as a matter of lawjunless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>clearly </em>establish that the risk of danger was <em>fully </em>known to and <em>understood </em>by the plaintiff.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added); <em>accord Chalmers, </em>247 Md. at 391, 231 A.2d at 76 (\u201cWe have held that the doctrine of assumption of risk should be applied, as a matter of law, in cases ... where the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences deducible therefrom clearly establish that the risk of the danger ... was fully known to and understood by the plaintiff whose consent thereto may be implied.\u201d) (Hammond, C.J. dissenting). Our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>prior case law suggesting an \u201cobjective\u201d test remains binding, however, because \u201cwhen it is clear that a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger, the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added). Therefore, for a plaintiff to have knowledge of the risk, as a matter of law, there must be undisputed evidence that he or she had actual knowledge of the risk prior to its encounter. Actual knowledge can be proven, for example, by evidence of the particular plaintiffs subjective knowledge of a risk, e.g. previous experience with or sensory perception of the danger, or objective knowledge of a risk that the law deems \u201cso obvious that it could not have been encountered unwittingly.\u201d <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 294, 22 A.3d at 882.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">On the basis of this record, the trial judge should not have drawn the conclusion that Appellant, as a matter of law, actually knew of the risk of slipping on \u201cblack\u201d ice, because it is unclear whether he had subjective knowledge of the risk, nor is the risk one that \u201ca person of normal intelligence\u201d in the position of Appellant \u201cmust have understood.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123.

Appellant challenges the validity of the intermediate appellate court\u2019s decision in <em>Allen, </em>as applied to his case, on the grounds that \u201cit created a constructive knowledge test with an objective standard borrowed from contributory negligence.\u201d Although we have endeavored to clarify the applicable knowledge standard, <em>supra, </em>additionally, we conclude that the application of the rationale developed in <em>Allen, </em>improperly invades the province of the jury. Accordingly, we hold that to the extent <em>Allen </em>suggested that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>compilation of facts and inferences, amounting to less than actual knowledge, may be sufficient to impute knowledge to a plaintiff as a matter of law, that case is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Allen, </em>the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Marriott Corporation, on the ground that one of its guests, Mr. David Allen, had assumed the risk of slipping and falling on black ice while walking across the parking lot from the entrance of the hotel to his wife\u2019s car. <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 462, 478-80, 961 A.2d at 1142, 1151-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Notwithstanding the fact that black ice is, by its nature, invisible or difficult to see, the <em>Allen </em>Court stated \u201cthe path to knowledge is not limited to the sense of sight alone .... [k]nowledge springs not only from direct sense perception but from the drawing of inferences from circumstantial evidence. Induction is as worthy a highway to knowledge as is sensation.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 473, 961 A.2d at 1149. The court concluded that because the plaintiff had testified that he observed visible ice and snow in the vicinity prior to his slip and fall and \u201cacknowledged his general familiarity with the phenomenon of black ice\u201d that \u201cwhen the bits and pieces of information about the appellant\u2019s awareness of risk came together, they were enough, objectively, to achieve critical mass\u201d and so \u201c[t]he question was properly one of law for the court to decide on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 476, 478-79, 961 A.2d at 1150-51. The <em>Allen </em>Court bolstered its holding with the following reasoning, in which we also find error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">To assume a risk as a matter of law, a plaintiff, objectively speaking, must have reason to know of the risk. In a case such as this, the risk is that of slipping on ice. The required knowledge is not knowledge that ice is actually present. It is the appreciation of the reasonable likelihood that, under the weather conditions and other circumstances, ice might well be present. The assumed risk is not that of stepping on ice per se. The assumed risk is that of stepping onto an unknown surface with an awareness that it might well be icy. With white ice, you see it is there.

When it is clear, however, \u201cthat a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger, the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in order for a plaintiff to have assumed the risk of his or her injuries as a matter of law, we require that a plaintiff \u201cmust\u201d have known that the risk was \u201cactually present,\u201d not that he or she \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d or \u201ccould\u201d have known that the risk \u201cmight well be present.\u201d <em>See Kasten Constr.

Heddinger, </em>373 N.W.2d 486, 490 (Iowa 1985) (\u201c[A]ssumption of risk is a matter of whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, not whether the plaintiff should have known of it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The <em>Allen </em>court\u2019s formulation diminishes the requirement that a plaintiff actually and fully know and understand the risk he or she is confronting and proposes that a plaintiff may be judicially charged with knowledge in a circumstance where he or she should <em>infer </em>the existence of a dangerous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Maryland jurisprudence, however, directs that courts may only impute knowledge to the plaintiff, as a matter of law, when there is undisputed evidence of awareness, <em>e.g., </em>physical interaction with or sensory perception of the dangerous condition in the case of <em>Schroyer, ADM P\u2019ship, </em>or <em>Morgan State; </em>the risk of danger is so obvious that any person of normal intelligence -will be taken to comprehend it, as in <em>Gibson </em>or <em>C &amp; M; </em>or the risk is an usual and foreseeable consequence of the plaintiffs conduct, as in <em>Cotillo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">Beyond these circumstances, we have held that \u201c[w]here there is a dispute whether the risk is assumed or not, that question is usually left to the jury[,]\u201d <em>Bull S.S. Lines, </em>196 Md. at 526, 77 A.2d at 146, because the role of the fact finder is to assess the credibility of the evidence and draw a conclusion from among the inferences which may be reasonably drawn from that evidence. <em>See American Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 12:53, at 433 (\u201cOnly where reasonable men could not differ as to the conclusion to be reached, the court itself may determine the issue.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">In <em>Allen, </em>the plaintiff testified that he had crossed the parking lot without incident after the snowfall but prior to his slip and fall. Also, while he observed visible ice and snow piled against the curb of the parking lot, he had not seen any in the area of the lot on which he stepped, and did not see the ice upon which he fell. The intermediate appellate court aptly defined \u201cblack ice,\u201d and described the \u201cmeaningful contrast\u201d between \u201cwhite ice\u201d and \u201cblack ice,\u201d as \u201cbetween essentially visible ice and essentially invisible ice.\u201d 183 Md.App. at 469-470, 961 A.2d at 1146-47. Whereas the <em>Allen </em>Court did not find the invisibility of the black ice to be a significant factor in withholding judicial imputation of knowledge to the plaintiff, this Court does. 183 Md.App. at 472-73, 961 A.2d at 1148-49. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>While, indeed, \u201cthe path to knowledge is not limited to the sense of sight alone,\u201d it is not for the courts, as a matter of law, to determine that although a danger was, by its nature, imperceptible by direct sensation, \u201cinferences from circumstantial evidence\u201d were drawn by a particular plaintiff. <em>Allen, 183 </em>Md.App. at 473, 961 A.2d at 1149. The <em>Allen </em>Court\u2019s statement that the requisite knowledge at the time of injury is not knowledge that ice is <em>actually </em>present, but, rather, \u201cthe appreciation of the reasonable likelihood that, under the ... circumstances ice <em>might well be </em>present\u201d negates the legal truism that assumption of the risk \u201crests upon an intentional and voluntary exposure to a <em>known </em>danger and, therefore, <em>consent </em>on the part of the plaintiff to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him and to take his chances from harm from a <em>particular </em>risk.\u201d <em>Crews, </em>358 Md. at 640-41, 751 A.2d at 488 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, it was error to find, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff in <em>Allen </em>had knowledge of the risk of slipping on black ice when the evidence showed only an \u201cawareness that it might\u201d exist and an inference could have been drawn that it \u201cmay be there.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 479-80, 961 A.2d at 1152. Rather, for a court to impute knowledge as a matter of law, the evidence and all permissible inferences must make clear that the plaintiff had full, actual, and subjective knowledge of the risk or that \u201ca person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger.\u201d <em>See Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added). In the absence of this level of proof, any determinations as to \u201cbits and pieces of information\u201d required to achieve a \u201ccritical mass\u201d sufficient to impute knowledge to a plaintiff, is a puzzle properly put together by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">In the present case, the trial court, in granting summary judgment, drew inferences in favor of the Appellees in reliance upon <em>Allen </em>and determined that the Appellant assumed the risk of his injuries. It was not proper to impute knowledge to Appellant as a matter of law because, under these circumstances, there was insufficient evidence of Appellant\u2019s actual subjective knowledge of the risk, nor was it \u201cclear that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>person of normal intelligence in [Appellant\u2019s position] must have understood the danger\u201d of black ice beneath the stream of water. <em>See Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123. Therefore, the issue of whether Appellant knew about the risk of the danger of slipping on black ice should have been resolved by the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">IY.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We now address Coakley\u2019s cross-appeal, in which Coakley seeks reversal of the trial judge\u2019s entry of summary judgment in Judd\u2019s favor, so that Coakley can preserve its indemnity and contribution claims against Judd. Coakley impleaded Judd by filing a third-party complaint alleging that if any water did drain into the parking lot, causing the black ice to form, then it was Judd who caused the condition while it was performing work on the fire sprinkler systems of the building unit at the Gateway Center that Coakley was constructing. Judd moved for summary judgment, asserting that there were no material facts in dispute regarding its liability for Appellant\u2019s injury because Judd was not on the job site until December 21, 2005, the date of the injury, and because Appellant testified that the water stream under which the black ice formed had been flowing a week prior to that date. Coakley\u2019s opposition to Judd\u2019s motion alleged generally that if the trial judge determined that summary judgment was not available to Coakley on Appellant\u2019s claim, it could not be available to Judd on the claims in the third-party complaint. Coakley attached its contract with Judd as an exhibit to its motion. The trial judge granted Judd\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the claims in the third-party complaint. We now reverse that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">\u201cThird party complaints are dealt with in Rule 2-332 and are for the purpose of suing a person who is not already a party to the action and who is or may be liable to the defendant for all or part of a plaintiffs claim against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Goldstein &amp; Baron Chartered v.

Consequently,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AL\">when an impleaded party files a motion for summary judgment on the third-party claim, the issue is not whether the defendant is liable to the plaintiff.

Arguing that Appellant\u2019s action was time-barred, Appellee Brickman obtained a favorable ruling on its motion to dismiss at a pre-trial hearing on January 6, 2010, and Appellee Transwestern, adopting Brick-man\u2019s argument, obtained summary judgment on its motion on March 3, 2010.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Both parties argued, and the trial judge ruled, that the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d which tolls the running of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>limitations period until the plaintiff \u201cdiscovers, or through the exercise of due diligence, should have discovered, the injury,\u201d was inapplicable such that Appellant\u2019s action was time-barred by the expiration of the statute of limitations. Appellant contests these rulings on two grounds. First, Appellant argues that he did not have \u201cactual or constructive knowledge\u201d that either Transwestern or Brickman was a potential tortfeasor prior to the expiration of the limitations period and, therefore, the \u201cdiscovery rule\u201d should apply. As a secondary, alternative argument, Appellant contends that the trial judge \u201cimproperly made a factual finding that Appellant did not act with reasonable diligence to discover the names of the additional Appellees, when clearly this is a question that should have been submitted to the jury.\u201d Neither argument is persuasive, and the trial judge\u2019s rulings on Appellees\u2019 motions are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Motions to dismiss, like motions for summary judgment, are reviewed for legal correctness. <em>See Doe v.

Such statutes are designed to balance the competing interests of each of the potential parties as well as the societal interests involved. Thus, one of the purposes of such statutes is to assure fairness to a potential defendant by providing a certain degree of repose. This is accomplished by encouraging promptness in prosecuting actions; suppressing stale or fraudulent claims; avoiding inconvenience <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>that may stem from delay, such as loss of evidence, fading of memories, and disappearance of witnesses; and providing the ability to plan for the future without the uncertainty inherent in potential liability.

Indeed, \u201cwhen the date of the breach [or injury] and the discovery of the breach [or injury] are the same, the discovery rule is satisfied,\u201d and the statute of limitations will not be tolled. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number><em>Bragunier Masonry Contractors, Inc. v.

Appellant contends that his claim did not \u201caccrue\u201d against Transwestern and Brickman until September 30, 2009, in accordance with the \u201cdiscovery rule,\u201d because he could not have known of the other potential defendants until his Interrogatories to Appellee Forsgate, served on February 17, 2009, were answered. Appellant received answers to his propounded interrogatories on September 30, 2009.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The service date itself was two months after the expiration of the statute of limitations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The fact that Appellant relied upon Forsgate\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Answers to Interrogatories to glean the names of other potential tortfeasors, namely Transwestern and Brickman, does not mean that he may appeal to the discovery rule in order to change the date of the accrual of his cause of action. This is so because Appellant\u2019s actual knowledge of the date of the alleged tortious conduct that resulted in his injury was never in doubt. The limitations period had begun to run from the date of injury, December 21, 2005, and Appellant is \u201ccharged with knowledge of facts that would have been disclosed by a reasonably diligent investigation.\u201d <em>O\u2019Hara v.

Indeed, \u201c[t]he beginning of limitations is not postponed until the end of an additional period deemed reasonable for making [an] investigation .... From that date the statute itself allows sufficient time \u2014 three years \u2014 for reasonably diligent inquiry and for making a decision as to whether to file suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Lutheran Hosp., </em>60 Md.App. at 237-38, 482 A.2d at 27-28.) Thus, the three year statute of limitations for civil actions was, as a matter of law, sufficient time for Appellant to discover that Transwestern was the management company for the building and that Brickman was contracted by Transwestern to perform snow removal at the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">There was no fact-finding required to determine when Appellant was on \u201cnotice of the nature and cause of his ... injury.\u201d <em>Frederick Rd., </em>360 Md. at 96, 756 A.2d at 973; <em>cf. Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. at 637, 431 A.2d at 681. Therefore the rulings granting summary judgment in favor of Transwestern and dismissal in favor of Brickman were appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Appellant also decries the trial judge\u2019s admonition that he did not engage in \u201creasonable diligence to discover the names of additional Appellees,\u201d and that the factual question of Appellant\u2019s diligence was a question for the jury, citing our decision in <em>Frederick Road, </em>360 Md. at 103-04, 756 A.2d at 976. To the contrary, because there was no fact-finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>required to determine the accrual date, the question of Appellant\u2019s diligence is immaterial. <em>See Frederick Rd., </em>360 Md. at 95, 756 A.2d at 973. The discovery rule provides that the \u201ccause of action accrues when the claimant in fact knew or reasonably should have known of the wrong.\u201d <em>Poffenberger, </em>290 Md. at 636, 431 A.2d at 680. By Appellant\u2019s own admission, the injury and discovery of the injury occurred on the same day.

This Court observed in <em>Schroyer v.

Indeed, the four other jurisdictions, in addition to Maryland, which presently recognize contributory negligence, along with assumption of the risk, recognize that a \"subjective\u201d knowledge standard is applied to assumption of the risk, and an \"objective\" or \"reasonable person\" standard is applied to contributory negligence. <em>See Ammons v. Tesker Mfg.

The intermediate appellate court, for example, aptly summarized the distinction between contributory negligence and assumption of the risk, when the questions are posed to the jury, in <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co. v.

In order to succeed on a defense based on its theory of assumption of risk, [defendant] would bear a somewhat heavier burden of proof: that [plaintiff] actually <em>knew </em>of the potential danger of overhead electric wires and actually <em>knew </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>presence of this particular wire when he voluntarily subjected himself to a risk of contact with the wire by climbing the tree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-8\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b166-5\">.

The Court of Appeals of Missouri stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">It is a matter of common knowledge that ice is slippery, and that when it is built up in courses of block upon block it may slip. But[,] as to this[,] plaintiff had the same knowledge that defendant had. The dangers then of slipping or falling was as patent to the plaintiff as they were to defendant\u2019s foreman. Such danger or risk then was one of those ordinarily incident to plaintiff's employment, and for which he can not, on the plainest principles of law, hold his employer responsible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em>Shea, </em>76 Mo.App. at 33. In light of <em>Shea, </em>we believe that Prosser\u2019s often quoted observation is inapposite here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. We do not decide that a slip and fall on black ice case could never be resolved as a matter of law because there could be evidence to show that the particular plaintiff did know of the risk of encountering the condition, he understood the risk and voluntarily encountered it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. We note additionally that the trial judge implied that Appellant had knowledge of the existence of \"black ice,\u201d as a matter of law, because of his \u201ctestimony on page 141 that he was aware of black ice and he could feel it under the slushy water.\u201d In fact, Appellant only testified that \"[wjhen I fell, my elbow hit and my hands went and hit the ground, and that\u2019s basically how I could tell it was black ice, because the fact that I could feel it on my hand ... I could feel the ice under the water[,]\u201d in order to describe his awareness of black ice after his fall. Apparently, the trial judge reasoned that Appellant could not have identified the substance immediately after his fall without some prior knowledge that black ice was present. Thus, the trial judge reasoned, because Appellant was able to name it, he must have known it was there. This is not the test for the knowledge prong of the assumption of the risk defense. The disputed question was what Appellant knew or must have known at the time of the encounter with the dangerous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>condition, not what he surmised or hypothesized immediately after his fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">Moreover, even if we were to assume that the trial judge only inferred from Petitioner's testimony that he was aware of the phenomenon of black ice, the ultimate question of the Petitioner's knowledge of the presence of black ice under the stream of water was for the jury to decide.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\">. A jury\u2019s evaluation of the evidence of knowledge will not be so limited. In determining the extent of the plaintiff's knowledge, the jury will consider the weight and credibility of the evidence using the preponderance of the evidence standard. <em>See Darcars Motors of Silver Spring, Inc. v.

In ruling on Transwestern's motion for summary judgment, the trial judge invoked the relation back doctrine stating: \u201cI hold that such like naming \u2014 when you first name a party, a new party to a suit that\u2019s not a misnomer, a misjoinder, a miswhatever, such does not relate back when an entirely new party is named.\u201d Appellant, however, expressly argued in the trial court and before this Court that the relation back doctrine does not apply to this case. Rather, Appellant urges us to apply the discovery rule to his case and not the relation back doctrine. We take this opportunity to explain the application of the relation back doctrine. Appellant\u2019s Amended Complaint named Transwestern and Brickman as \"new parties\u201d so it did not \"relate back\u201d to the time of the filing of his original complaint; therefore, the limitations period was not \u201ctolled\u201d under the doctrine. <em>See Pines Point Marina v. Rehak, </em>406 Md. 613, 640-41, 961 A.2d 574, 590 (2008) (holding that \"the filing within the period of limitations of an assertion of a claim which is deficient or wrong in form or otherwise technically defective will toll the statute of limitations to the extent that the filing of a correct assertion of claim after the expiration of the statute will relate back to and validate the original assertion of claim, as long as the corrected statement does not introduce a new cause of action or a new theory of liability or new parties\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>accord Crowe </em>v. <em>Houseworth, </em>272 Md. 481, 486, 325 A.2d 592, 595-96 (1974) (noting that in Maryland the doctrine of \"relation back\u201d may not be used to add a new defendant after the limitations period for the cause of action has run); <em>see also Ferguson v.

Other exceptions to the discovery rule are also inapplicable. The \"continuing harm theory\" tolls the statute of limitations in cases where there are continuous violations. Violations that arc continuing in nature are not barred by the statute of limitations merely because some occurred earlier. <em>MacBride, </em>402 Md. at 584, 937 A.2d at 240; <em>see Shell Oil Co. v.

There was no continuing harm in this case, as Appellant did not allege ongoing tortious conduct, but only that resulting in a single injury incurred on one day. Further, the doctrine, if applicable, would not toll the statute of limitations if the plaintiff \u201csooner knew or should have known of the injury or harm.\u201d <em>MacBride, </em>402 Md. at 586, 937 A.2d at 241, (quoting <em>Duke St. Ltd.

Appellant admits that he had actual knowledge of the injury at the time it occurred, and thus this exception is further inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Also, there was no allegation of fraud used to conceal the cause of action that would justify a tolling of the statute of limitations. <em>See Bragunier, </em>368 Md. at 628, 796 A.2d at 755 (citing Md.Code (1973, 1998 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 5-203 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\"If the knowledge of a cause of action is kept from a party by the fraud of an adverse party, the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue at the time when the party discovered, or by the exercise of ordinary diligence should have discovered the fraud.\u201d)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
