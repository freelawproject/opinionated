R0D0WSKY (retired, specially assigned), J.</author>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">Petitioner, Gary James Smith (Smith), was convicted at a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of depraved heart second-degree murder and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The court sentenced him to thirty years confinement for murder and to a second consecutive twenty year sentence on the handgun charge, with all but five years suspended and five years probation to be served upon release. The principal issue at trial was whether the deceased, Michael McQueen, Jr. (McQueen), was murdered or committed suicide. Smith appealed, contending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the trial court had erroneously excluded certain defense evidence relating to McQueen\u2019s state of mind. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, 196 Md.App. 494, 10 A.3d 798 (2010), concluding that the excluded evidence was too remote and not reliable. This Court granted Smith\u2019s petition for certiorari. <em>Smith v. State, </em>418 Md. 587, 16 A.3d 977 (2011). The lead question presented by the petitioner is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-6\">\u201c1. In this case where homicide versus suicide was the cornerstone issue, did the Court of Special Appeals err in affirming the trial court\u2019s decision to admit prosecution evidence of the decedent\u2019s \u2018normal\u2019 state of mind but refused to admit equally relevant defense evidence of the decedent\u2019s \u2018depressed\u2019 state of mind?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">As explained below, we shall hold that the trial court abused its discretion in excluding the evidence proffered by the accused.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Undisputed Background Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">McQueen died in the early morning hours of Tuesday, September 26, 2006. The cause of death was a contact, non-through-and-through gunshot wound to the right temple. He died in the living room of an apartment in Gaithersburg that McQueen and Smith shared, beginning in early September 2006. McQueen was age twenty-two at the time, and Smith was age twenty-three. Both were former Army Rangers who, for two different periods, had served together in the same intelligence unit in Afghanistan. McQueen was a private, and Smith was his sergeant.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">McQueen returned from his third Afghanistan deployment to Fort Benning, Georgia in late June 2006. While at Fort Benning, McQueen, in early August 2006, was arrested for DWI in Acworth City, Georgia. Evidence proffered by Smith concerning McQueen\u2019s arrest is the basis of the issue before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">McQueen, on August 22, went on terminal leave and traveled north in a new car. His intention was to live in the Washington, D.C. area, rooming with a Ranger buddy, Ronny McKay. McQueen\u2019s plan was to attend the University of the District of Columbia and then transfer to Howard University, but he missed the registration for the Fall 2006 Term.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">McQueen had told his mother that he had fallen in love with a young woman named Tina, who also served in the Army. On his way north from Fort Benning to Washington, McQueen visited in North Carolina for over a week with a close friend from the Rangers, Justin Jones. While there, McQueen told Jones about the Georgia DWI. When asked by the State, in its case-in-chief, whether McQueen was \u201coverly distraught, or upset about\u201d his arrest, Jones testified that McQueen was \u201cpretty calm about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">In North Carolina, Jones and McQueen also talked about the possibility of Tina\u2019s being pregnant. Jones testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>\u201cTina was a very attractive woman. As far as her being pregnant, like I said, he did feel some concern just because it wasn\u2019t a planned thing. And you know, but he didn\u2019t feel \u2014 he wasn\u2019t overly worried about it. It was just one of those things that could be possible, and it ended up being not true anyway. She wasn\u2019t pregnant, so.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">McQueen\u2019s plan to share living quarters with McKay did not work out, because McKay was living with his then girlfriend/future wife. When McQueen got to Washington, he stayed for a few days with Smith, his mother, and his grandmother until the two former Rangers occupied their Gaithersburg apartment under a lease signed September 2, 2006. Smith and McQueen had almost no living room furniture, and, on the fateful night, they were still keeping a considerable amount of clothing on the living room floor. Smith was attending school while McQueen had no fixed schedule. Smith did not testify, but he told the police that, in the evenings, he and McQueen went to the bars \u201ca lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">On the morning of Monday, September 25, McQueen and McKay spoke on the telephone about attending a job fair on Wednesday, the twenty-eighth. In that conversation McQueen \u201cwas basically saying that he can\u2019t live with [Smith] anymore.\u201d McQueen said, \u201cHe is not right in the head.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">Smith also told the police that when he returned to the apartment from school late on the afternoon of Monday, the twenty-fifth, he and McQueen smoked some marijuana, had dinner, and drank a couple of beers. Thereafter, they went to the VFW Post in Gaithersburg where they consumed several inexpensively priced mixed drinks and played pool until approximately 11:00 p.m. They then went to the Village Caf\u00e9 where a patron treated each of them to a beer which neither finished. On autopsy, McQueen\u2019s blood alcohol content ranged from .20 percent per volume in the heart to .13 percent peripherally. There was no evidence from witnesses who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>observed the two ex-Rangers that evening of any bad feelings between them.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">A few minutes before 1:00 a.m. on Tuesday, September 26, the Montgomery County police responded to a 9-1-1 call that had been placed by Smith. Arriving at the apartment house in less than a minute, they found Smith outside, hysterical and with blood on his face, hands, and clothing. In the living room of the apartment was McQueen, dead from a gunshot wound to the right temple, but there was no gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">McQueen was found seated in a metal framed chair with a mesh scoop or sling type seat. His head had fallen back over the top of the chair. On the left side of his lap was a marijuana grinder. His right arm hung down over the right arm of the chair. On the floor to the right of the chair (from the perspective of one seated in the chair) were a bottle of beer and a television game joystick. The chair faced a wall against which were a television set, that was playing, and a monitor for electronic games, that was not playing. Several feet to the front of the chair was a loop-type, gun-locking device.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">There was a considerable amount of blood to the right of the chair. On the carpet at the rear of the chair was a greater concentration of blood. In the latter area, blood had drained from McQueen\u2019s wound when his head flopped to the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">In the bloodied area of the carpet was a section in which there was either no blood, or a considerably lesser amount of blood in relation to its surroundings. The parties at times called this section \u201cthe void.\u201d It is the field on which the battle of the experts was principally waged in this case. The outline of the void is roughly \u201cV\u201d shaped, with the angle of the V pointed toward the chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">Smith\u2019s Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">Smith was arrested and was interrogated, in taped interviews. He gave three versions of what had transpired after the two ex-Rangers had left the Village Caf\u00e9 and before he made the 9-1-1 call. In all three versions, Smith stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>he dropped McQueen off at the apartment and continued on to his mother\u2019s house in order to pick up laundry because he had no clean socks to wear to school the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">In the first version, Smith stated that he was not in the apartment when the shot was fired. He said he came home to find McQueen slumped in the chair and, when he realized McQueen was not drunk, but that there was blood on the floor, he checked McQueen\u2019s neck and wrist for a pulse, but found none. He said there was no weapon in the apartment and suggested possible suspects, including some \u201cHispanic Mexican\u201d guys in the community with whom he said McQueen had argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">In the second version, Smith said that there was a gun in the apartment, a .88 caliber, five shot revolver, that belonged to Smith and that was kept hidden in a counter in the apartment. In this version, Smith reiterated that he returned to the apartment, found McQueen, and touched the body. He said that he panicked because the gun was his, his fingerprints would likely be on it, and because there was marijuana on McQueen\u2019s lap. He drove to nearby Lake Needwood, where he removed the four remaining bullets from the gun and separately threw it and the bullets into the water. Later, directed by Smith, the police recovered the weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">In the third version, Smith said that he brought his gun from his mother\u2019s when he picked up the laundry off of the porch at her house. He said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-8\">\u201cI put it in a case because I was going to go back over there and take the rest of my stuff with Mike\u2019s truck and I wanted the .38 there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-9\">\u201cSo, I put it in a case inside of the little shaving kit pouch and put it inside the bottom drawer. When I was there I realized I couldn\u2019t fit the whole plastic case into my car so I was like I really don\u2019t want to leave the gun out here so I grabbed it and put it in the laundry basket underneath some of the laundry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-10\">Smith further stated that, back at the apartment,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>\u201cI took [the gun] into the house. I just put it in my pocket and took it upstairs. I put it on the floor. I was like, you see this one, right, Mike? He goes \u2018yeah.\u2019 I said \u2018Okay. Watch out. It\u2019s loaded.\u2019 I went into the back bathroom. I was going number two. I came out and as I was walking out in the hallway I was about inside the room and I heard the bang.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Smith touched the body, panicked, and threw the gun and bullets into Lake Needwood.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">This case was tried for twelve days, excluding jury selection. In its case-in-chief, the State presented twenty-two witnesses. The defense, in its case, presented twenty-five witnesses, including persons who had testified in the State\u2019s case. There were nine rebuttal witnesses called by the State, and the defense called one surrebuttal witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">The central issue at trial was whether McQueen\u2019s death was a murder or a suicide. The jury was so advised by both parties in their opening statements. Expert evidence addressed to the issue was presented by both parties. Lay evidence addressed to the issue was presented by the State and admitted. Lay evidence addressed to the issue was proffered by the defense and not admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\"><em>Expert Testimony </em>\u2014 Blood <em>Splatter</em></p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">An assistant medical examiner, Dr. Carol H. Allan, determined that the manner of death was homicide. She was unable to reach that conclusion from the physical evidence, but based her conclusion on the police investigation. She found no blood splatter on the deceased\u2019s right hand, but acknowledged that that absence did not exclude suicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">The blood splatter expert for the State was Dr. William Vosburgh, the Director of the Consolidated Forensic Laboratory for the District of Columbia. In his opinion, the portion of the void toward the chair was formed by the outline of Smith\u2019s right tennis shoe which had blood splatter on the right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>side and top. Under this view, the void was formed when blood was ejected from McQueen\u2019s head immediately following the entry of the bullet, with the blood landing on the carpet around Smith\u2019s foot. This would place Smith at the time of the shot to the right of the chair, within contact range of McQueen\u2019s temple. Dr. Vosburgh also discerned on the carpet the outline of a left hand and opined that it was caused by blood that created a mist that fell over and around the hand and between the fingers of a person standing to the right of the chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">This opinion was contradicted by the defense blood splatter expert, Professor Herbert MacDonnell, the founder of the International Association of Blood Stain Pattern Analysts. Professor MacDonnell was contacted by the State in August 2007 as a possible expert. After studying pictures of the blood splatter, Professor MacDonnell caused Smith\u2019s sneakers, pants, shirt and the section of carpeting containing the blood stains to be hand delivered to him in upstate New York for his further study. Four days later, Professor MacDonnell was discussing the case with the defense legal team.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In his opinion, the outline of the void was inconsistent with its having been formed by Smith\u2019s right sneaker. From the blood splatter on McQueen\u2019s shoulder and upper arm, the witness concluded that the deceased\u2019s right hand and arm were raised when the shot was fired. He also disagreed with Dr. Vosburgh\u2019s view that an apparent palm print in the carpet was caused by a mist of blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Barton Epstein, who had thirty-two years experience with the Minnesota State Crime Laboratory, was called by the defense and accepted as an expert in blood stain pattern analysis. In his opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-8\">1. the void was not formed by the outline of Smith\u2019s right tennis shoe;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-9\">2. the blood on Smith\u2019s pants and right shoe dripped from the wound toward the carpet and was not blood propelled by pressure from the wound on impact of the bullet; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>3. the impression of a left hand on the carpet is a contact stain formed by placing the hand, with blood on the palm, on the carpet. The impression did not result from a mist of blood passing around, and through the fingers, of a hand at some elevation above the carpet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Vincent DiMaio, M.D., also called by the defense, qualified as an expert in forensic pathology. He is the editor-in-chief of the periodical, <em>Gunshot Wounds. </em>In Dr. DiMaio\u2019s opinion, the manner of McQueen\u2019s death was suicide. He based this opinion on a number of factors, including the nature of the contact wound, the blood alcohol level, the absence of motive for murder,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the gunshot residue (GSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In its rebuttal case, the State called Jonathan Arden, M.D., a medical examiner of twenty years experience. He testified that there were two major flaws in Dr. DiMaio\u2019s opinion. First, Dr. DiMaio did not account for the blood splatter evidence, particularly that on Smith\u2019s trousers. Second, the scene was \u201cstaged,\u201d in that there was no gun found at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\"><em>Expert Testimony </em>\u2014 GSR</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Gunshot residue consists of particles of three elements: antimony, barium, and lead. Under the circumstances at issue here, the only source of GSR was the primer of a handgun cartridge. The State\u2019s GSR expert, Alfred Schwoeble, explained that GSR particles are classified by the number of these elements that they contain. When all three elements are present in a particle, in a fused state, it is called \u201cunique.\u201d When two of the elements are present in a particle, it is \u201cconsistent\u201d with gunshot residue. If only one element is present in a particle, it is a \u201csingle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">Mr. Schwoeble\u2019s examination of the forensic evidence taken from McQueen and from Smith revealed that the back of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>McQueen\u2019s right hand contained over twenty-five unique and over fifty consistent particles. There were 345 single particles. The palm of his right hand contained more than twenty-three unique particles, more than twenty-two consistent particles, and 570 singles. The back of Smith\u2019s right hand contained two unique, two consistent, and nineteen single particles, while the palm of his right hand contained three unique, three consistent, and twenty-one single particles.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Mr. Schwoeble further testified that activity was the greatest cause of loss of GSR particles from a hand.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on the GSR, Mr. Schwoeble was unable to conclude who the shooter was.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Dr. DiMaio based his opinion in part on the GSR forensics. He explained that while the absence of GSR is not proof that one is not the shooter, the presence of GSR is significant, and he found the number of unique particles on McQueen\u2019s hands to be \u201cmost[ ] interesting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\"><em>Lay </em>Evidence\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">\n<em>McQueen\u2019s State of Mind</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">In its case-in-chief, and in rebuttal, the State presented a parade of witnesses who testified, <em>inter alia, </em>concerning McQueen\u2019s state of mind. McQueen\u2019s mother was the leadoff witness.' She was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-10\">\u201c[STATE]: Was there anything, and I\u2019m asking this question in the context of during the time he was in the military all the way up to the day he died, was there anything about Michael that you would think he was depressed, that he was depressed, anxious, suicidal, upset, anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-11\">\u201c[MRS. McQUEEN]: Absolutely not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-12\">She was not aware that McQueen had been arrested for DWI in Georgia in August. Mrs. McQueen talked on the telephone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>to her son two days before his death, and he did not seem depressed in that conversation.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">The State called McQueen\u2019s father, and asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-6\">\u201cQ. At any time, in his life, especially during the last year or so, did you notice anything about Michael that would make you think that he was depressed or anxious or upset or even suicidal?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b633-7\">\u201cA. No.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">McQueen\u2019s friend from the Rangers, Ronny McKay, with whom McQueen initially planned to live in the District of Columbia area, also testified concerning McQueen\u2019s state of mind. He saw no signs suggesting that McQueen was depressed either in September of 2006, or \u201csince [McQueen had] been back in June 2006\u201d from his third deployment. Similarly, Justin Jones, who first met McQueen at Ranger indoctrination in September 2003, testified that McQueen was, \u201c[n]ot at all\u201d depressed when the latter \u201ccame home in 2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">Jones testified on the fifth trial day. At the conclusion of his redirect examination, the State, at the bench, inquired whether the defense intended to produce the Georgia trooper who had arrested McQueen for DWI. The State was unwilling to bring Jones back from Texas to rebut the trooper\u2019s evidence and wished to put on, at that time, Jones\u2019s proof that McQueen was not unduly concerned about the DWI. The court excused the jury, and a lengthy conference ensued in which Smith pointed out that the State \u201cwent back a year.\u201d The court told the defense that, \u201cyou\u2019re going to have to persuade me that [the trooper\u2019s evidence is] admissible.\u201d The matter was left on the basis that counsel would attempt jointly to interview the trooper by telephone so that the court could more clearly be advised of the anticipated testimony. Counsel were unable to reach the trooper. When the jury returned, Jones testified, over objection, that McQueen was not unduly concerned over the pending DWI.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">On the sixth day of trial, the court took up Smith\u2019s oral motion <em>in limine </em>that the trooper be permitted to testify. There was an extended argument. Again Smith referred to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the State\u2019s evidence that went back \u201cmonths and years, months and months[,] and a year or more\u201d concerning McQueen\u2019s state of mind. The court considered the proffer to be that the trooper would testify that McQueen said (expletive reinserted): \u201c T don\u2019t need this [shit] in my life at this point.\u2019 \u201d Relying on <em>Robinson v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 246, 503 A.2d 725, <em>cert. denied, </em>306 Md. 289, 508 A.2d 489 (1986), discussed <em>infra, </em>the court ruled that the trooper\u2019s evidence was not trustworthy, was too remote, and was not relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">The defense, nevertheless, persisted. On the tenth trial day, Smith produced the arresting officer, John Hegger, in person.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His testimony was taken out of the presence of the jury. Officer Hegger testified that, after McQueen had been arrested and brought to the police station, and while the breathalyzer was warming up, he had a conversation with McQueen.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">\u201c[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Tell us about the conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">\u201c[OFF. HEGGER]: He basically appeared to be depressed, stressed about the situation, he was fidgeting. At one point, he, he put his hands down in his head, and he said this is the last thing I need in my life right now, on top of all the other, excuse my wording, other shit going on in my life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">\u201cAnd he kind of rested his head in his hands. And I, and I kind of just kept on doing my thing, and I said, you know, I understand, you\u2019ll get through it, kind of just trying to move along.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">The court ruled that this testimony was inadmissible, reasoning, in relevant part, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">\u201cThis Court ruled that this testimony is not helpful, it is so remote from the factual situation that we have before this Court. It won\u2019t be helpful at all, that it was a traumatic experience, that I think it\u2019s a reasonable, I think I can take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>a reasonable inference, nobody likes getting arrested for DWI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u201cI\u2019ve, in another life, arrested many people for DWI, many, more than this young man. And the notion that a person would say, I don\u2019t want this, can I get out of it, I\u2019ve got a lot going on [in] my life, I don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t need this right now, and any such statement is hardly relevant in a case where it\u2019s alleged that someone took their own life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In the State\u2019s rebuttal case, a number of Rangers testified on a number of points. Their testimony on McQueen\u2019s state of mind is reviewed below. William Burkett had been deployed four times with Smith. He had also been McQueen\u2019s supervisor in Afghanistan, where he had been in a social setting with McQueen \u201ctwo, three, four times.\u201d Asked if McQueen appeared to be depressed when drinking, Burkett replied, \u201cNot that I observed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">William Ryan was another supervisor of McQueen\u2019s in Afghanistan. Ryan served two deployments, beginning around May 2004 and ending in March 2006. He testified that, \u201c[f]rom where we deployed, and having spen[t] time over the holidays, and all that, I was not worried about [McQueen\u2019s] emotional state.\u201d Steven Porto, a former Ranger, testified that he met McQueen in 2005. The witness was in social settings with McQueen \u201ca little bit,\u201d because they \u201creally didn\u2019t have a lot of time in the [S]tates.\u201d He was asked, \u201cDid you ever see Mike McQueen after he had been drinking enough to where he maybe felt his liquor?\u201d Porto said that McQueen could handle his liquor. Asked if, when McQueen was drunk, he appeared to be depressed, Porto testified, \u201cNever.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">In its opening summation to the jury, the State argued that \u201cthere is no evidence in this case that Michael McQueen was either depressed or suicidal.\u201d Further, the State argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u201cNothing to indicate that he\u2019s a depressed individual when he drinks. He\u2019s morose? He\u2019s funny. Nobody in this case has been able to even suggest that he was depressed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Smith submits that the proffered testimony of Officer Hegger was relevant and admissible. He cites <em>Case v. State, </em>118 Md.App. 279, 702 A.2d 777 (1997), in which the issue was whether the manner of death was accident or homicide. There, the Court of Special Appeals determined that the decedent\u2019s state of mind was \u201cof significant consequence\u201d to that issue. <em>Id. </em>at 284, 702 A.2d at 779. This reasoning applies, <em>a fortiori </em>says Smith, to a murder/suicide issue. Smith also notes that <em>Case </em>did not even discuss the time frame within which the statements were made. Smith further contends that the statements made to Officer Hegger were not too remote to preclude admissibility and, citing <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 762 A.2d 125 (2000), contends that remoteness goes only to the weight of the evidence. Smith also asserts that there was a \u201cdisparity in treatment of the two sides\u2019 evidence\u201d relating to McQueen\u2019s state of mind, and that that disparity was \u201cpatently unfair and unduly prejudicial to Petitioner\u2019s defense.\u201d The exclusion was not harmless error because the testimony was of significant consequence to his foundational contention, Smith concludes.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The State\u2019s position begins with the principle that the admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court that should not be disturbed absent error or a clear abuse of that discretion. <em>Myer v. State, </em>403 Md. 463, 476, 943 A.2d 615, 622 (2008). The State asserts that the excluded evidence is irrelevant because it was incompetent and remote.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> It is said to be incompetent because \u201cMcQueen never said anything, directly or inferentially, to Officer Hegger about being suicidal or even entertaining suicidal thoughts.\u201d The statement to Officer Hegger, the State urges, \u201cdoes not declare a state of mind or emotional predisposition at all, much less a suicidal one.\u201d It is \u201conly a reaction to an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>undesirable situation.\u201d From McQueen\u2019s reference to \u201cother problems\u201d in his life, it does not follow, says the State, that he was depressed or suicidal. Further, inasmuch as the other problems were not specified, the jury could only speculate as to whether they would be significant enough to cause McQueen to want to kill himself. Alternatively, the State posits that, even if the jury could legitimately discern a suicidal intent at the time of the statement to Officer Hegger, there was no evidence that permitted an inference that this same \u201cideation\u201d existed at the time of the shooting one and one-half months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">In addition to <em>Robinson, </em>66 Md.App. 246, 503 A.2d 725 (1986), on which the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals relied, the State also finds persuasive <em>Pettie v. State, </em>316 Md. 509, 560 A.2d 577 (1989), discussed <em>infra. </em>On the harmless error issue, the State asks us to conclude that the evidence of Smith\u2019s guilt was overwhelming.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Officer Hegger\u2019s proffered testimony consists of two types of evidence. The first was Officer Hegger\u2019s direct observation, expressed as a \u201ccollective fact,\u201d see <em>Connor v. State, </em>225 Md. 543, 552, 171 A.2d 699, 704 (1961), when he said that McQueen \u201cbasically appeared to be depressed, stressed about the sit\u00faa,tion[.]\u201d The second type of evidence was McQueen\u2019s statement that, in effect, he did not need a DWI charge in addition to the other adversities or disappointments in his life. The statement was offered for the truth of its content, was hearsay, and was inadmissible, unless it fell within the exclusion provided in Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(3) for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZ_\">\u201c[a] statement of the declarant\u2019s then existing state of mind, emotion, sensation, or physical condition (such as intent, plan, motive, design, mental feeling, pain, and bodily health), offered to prove the declarant\u2019s then existing condition or the declarant\u2019s future action, but not including a statement of memory or belief to prove the fact remembered or believed unless it relates to the execution, revocation, identification, or terms of declarant\u2019s will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>Both types of evidence must be relevant to be admissible. Md. Rule 5-402. As defined in Md. Rule 5-401, \u201c \u2018[rjelevant evidence\u2019 means evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">\u201cThere are two components to relevant evidence: materiality and probative value.\u201d 1 <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 185, at 773 (4th Strong ed. 1992) (McCormick) (footnote omitted). A material proposition is also called a \u201c \u2018consequential fact.\u2019 \u201d 1 <em>Weinstein\u2019s Evidence </em>\u00b6 401[03], at 401-10 (1980). \u201cMateriality looks to the relation between the proposition for which the evidence is offered and the issues in the case.\u201d McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 773. Probative value is \u201cthe tendency of evidence to establish the proposition that it is offered to prove.\u201d McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">Materiality</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">The State asserts that Officer Hegger\u2019s testimony falls short of demonstrating that McQueen was going to commit suicide. That argument erroneously seeks to apply a sufficiency of the evidence type of standard to determine materiality. Here, the proposition Smith sought to prove was that the manner of McQueen\u2019s death was suicide. Officer Hegger\u2019s testimony need only have a \u201ctendency\u201d to make that proposition \u201cmore probable.\u201d Md. Rule 5-401. The State would have the materiality of Hegger\u2019s testimony determined in a vacuum, devoid of consideration of the other circumstances in the case. Here, at the time of the Hegger proffer, the defense had produced its forensic experts\u2019 testimony contradicting the State\u2019s opinion evidence. And, Dr. DiMaio had opined that the manner of death was suicide. The Hegger evidence makes it more probable, in conjunction with the opinions of the defense forensic experts, that the defense\u2019s ultimate proposition of suicide might be accepted.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-8\">\u201cUnder our system, molded by the tradition of jury trial and predominantly oral proof, a party offers his evidence not <em>en masse, </em>but item by item. An item of evidence, being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>but a single link in the chain or proof, need not prove conclusively the proposition for which it is offered. It need not ever make that proposition appear more probable than not. Whether the entire body of one party\u2019s evidence is sufficient to go to the jury is one question. Whether a particular item of evidence is relevant to his case is quite another. It is enough if the item could reasonably show that a fact is slightly more probable than it would appear without that evidence. Even after the probative force of the evidence is spent, the proposition for which it is offered still can seem quite improbable. <em>Thus, the common objection that the inference for which the fact is offered \u2018does not necessarily follow\u2019 is untenable, </em>it poses a standard of conclusiveness that very few single items of circumstantial evidence ever could meet. A brick is not a wall.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMc\">McCormick, \u00a7 185, at 776 (footnotes omitted; emphasis added). The circuit court\u2019s ruling on the testimony of Officer Hegger rested, in part, on the court\u2019s prior experience as a police officer and its conclusion that arrests for DWI are not suicide inducing, so that the criticism above applies to that analysis as well. The proffered proof was material-consequential.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">Remoteness</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">When ruling on the testimony of Officer Hegger, the circuit court referred to its ruling when the proffer was based on the representations of counsel. In its brief, the State quotes at length from that ruling, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-6\">\u201c \u2018What we have here are approximately 30 days prior to Mr., prior to the demise of this young man in this case, he is alleged to have said to a state trooper who placed him under arrest for a DUI, something to the effect, I believe he used an explicative, deleted word, T don\u2019t need this in my life at this point.\u2019 And that is sought to be admitted in this case to show that he was despondent and that that despondency subsequently led to his suicide some 30 days later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-7\">\u201c \u2018Well, let\u2019s see what the Court of Special Appeals says about that. First of all, I agree with [defense counsel] that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>statements like that may be admitted into evidence, but the Court says if the case law legitimizing the admission of declarations based upon this notion of continuity in time of states of mind almost universally imposes a very tight limit on the lapse of time involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201c \u2018We have found no case and the appellate points us to none extending this notion to continuity over a period even approaching 30 days. Here[,] in this case[,] it was between August the 4th and September the 3rd [sic ]. And then the [C]ourt goes on to say McCormick addresses this notion of relevance being strained beyond the breaking point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">\u201c \u2018And so, in reliance upon <em>Robinson v. State, </em>which I find to be as close to on point as any case, in fact it\u2019s the only case that could be arguably directly on point, the Court will not allow such a statement in. I don\u2019t find it to be trustworthy. There\u2019s no support for its trustworthiness and it is certainly far too remote in time for it to be admitted in evidence in this case. Notwithstanding that, I don\u2019t find it to be, that particular statement or those statements to be relevant and for those reasons any such statements concerning the DWI will not be permitted.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The emphasis in this analysis is on remoteness, <em>i.e., </em>part of the probative value aspect of relevancy.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">We review for an abuse of discretion the exclusion of evidence on the ground of irrelevancy. <em>See Martinez v. State, </em>416 Md. 418, 420, 7 A.3d 56, 57 (2010) (holding that trial court abused its discretion in prohibiting accused from cross-examining attempted murder victim about his potential bias because State dismissed unrelated charges against victim); <em>Martin v. State, </em>364 Md. 692, 695, 775 A.2d 385, 387 (2001) (holding that trial court\u2019s exclusion of proof that prosecution witness intended to file a civil lawsuit against accused was an abuse of discretion); <em>Calloway v. State, </em>414 Md. 616, 637, 996 A.2d 869, 880 (2010) (holding that trial court abused its discretion in limiting defense\u2019s cross-examination of former cell mate about his hope of State\u2019s leniency); <em>State v. Cox, </em>298 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Md. 173, 184, 468 A.2d 319, 324 (1983) (holding that trial court abused its discretion when it sustained State\u2019s objection on relevancy grounds to cross-examination of victim about criminal assault charge brought against third party in separate incident and later recanted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">\u201cA homicide victim\u2019s state of mind is unquestionably relevant to the defense theory that [the victim] committed suicide.\u201d <em>United States v. Veltmann, </em>6 F.3d 1483, 1494 (11th Cir.1993). In that case, the deceased died in a fire caused by arson. The issue was whether the fire was set by the deceased or by her husband and son to collect life insurance. The alleged victim was addicted to prescription pain killers and was an abuser of alcohol. The district court had excluded testimony of a creditor and former paramour of the alleged victim that had been offered under Fed. R. of Evid. 803(3), on which Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(3) is based. The witness had testified on deposition that \u201c[a] few months before she died, [the victim] talked to [the witness] about the possibility of her death, and instructed him to see [the victim\u2019s son] about being paid when she was gone. She mentioned suicide several times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1489.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b641-5\">The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that the testimony \u201cwas admissible under the state of mind exception, and while conceivably cumulative, its import was such that exclusion violated defendants\u2019 right to put on a defense. This abuse of discretion requires reversal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b641-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1493.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Relying on <em>In re Fill, </em>68 B.R. 923 (Bankr.S.D.N.Y.1987), in which hearsay promises to repay a loan were admitted, despite having been made six years before actual repayment, and ultimately on <em>McCormick on Evidence </em>\u00a7 292, at 844-45 (Cleary 3d ed.1984), the Eleventh Circuit concluded that the continuity in time aspect of Fed.R.Evid. 803(3) must be determined \u201c <em>\u2018in light of all of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 1494. Applying that standard to the case before it, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0\">\u201cWhere one threatens suicide, talks about what should be done in [the! event of her death, and dies within months <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>under suspicious circumstances including the presence of a suicide note[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and other witnesses corroborating her depression and suicidal ideation, we do not believe uncertainty over the exact date of the suicide threats should preclude admission of those statements to show state of mind.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1494 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">We agree \"with <em>Veltmann </em>and hold that, where possible suicide is an issue, remoteness of evidence, under Maryland Rule 5 \u2014 803(b)(3), bearing on the deceased\u2019s state of mind, must be determined under all of the circumstances. Consequently, it was error for the circuit court to apply, based simply on the lapse of time, a limitation of thirty days preceding McQueen\u2019s death to the admissibility of Hegger\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\"><em>Veltmann </em>may also be analogized factually to the case before us. Although the content of the excluded telephone conversation between the victim and the former paramour included a reference to suicide, the time lag between that conversation and the victim\u2019s death was greater than that between McQueen\u2019s statements to Hegger and McQueen\u2019s death. Further, although a suicide note was ultimately found in <em>Veltmann, </em>the direct proof of suicide in the instant matter lies in the defense forensic testimony. We have already held, above, that the Hegger testimony need not have explicitly referenced suicide in order to be material.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">There are other circumstances in the instant matter that bear on remoteness. The State announced in its opening statement that it would prove that McQueen was not suicidal. In its case-in-chief, the State produced lay witnesses who testified, based on observations going all the way back to McQueen\u2019s deployments in Afghanistan, that he was not depressed or suicidal. This set a standard, for purposes of this case, as to what the State considered to be proof that was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>too remote to be probative. The State then opposed Smith\u2019s proffer that was based on personal observations made, and statements heard, less than two months before McQueen\u2019s death. Indeed, after the exclusion of the Hegger proffer, the State presented, in rebuttal, three lay witnesses who testified that, while on active duty, McQueen was not depressed, even though the jury never heard the Hegger evidence that was favorable to Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">On this aspect of the case, Smith submits that the circuit court\u2019s ruling operated unfairly, and we agree. This Court has recognized a principle of fundamental fairness in the trial of cases, and, in criminal causes, it has been applied for the benefit of the State and of the accused. <em>See Elliott v. State, </em>417 Md. 413, 10 A.3d 761 (2010) (fundamental fairness required disclosure of State\u2019s confidential informant because it was necessary for the defense to prepare); <em>Dillard v. State, </em>415 Md. 445, 3 A.3d 403 (2010) (fundamental fairness violated when, after two jurors, during recess, had commended police officer/prosecution witness on his investigation, trial court did not conduct <em>voir dire </em>to determine if the two jurors could reach an impartial verdict); <em>Mitchell v. State, </em>408 Md. 368, 969 A.2d 989 (2009) (after defense, in closing argument, properly referred to the absence of testimony from specific individuals, the State, under the principle of fundamental fairness, could point to subpoena power available to the defense, even though \u201cinvited response\u201d rule did not apply).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><em>Robinson v. State, </em>66 Md.App. 246, 503 A.2d 725, does not persuade us to the contrary of the above conclusions. Jacqueline Robinson was convicted of assault with intent to disable and use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The victim was her paramour. She had been quarreling with him in July 1984. The State, in its case, proved that she had applied for a handgun permit on August 4, picked up the handgun on September 1, and shot the victim on September 3, 1984. The defense was accident. On cross-examination of the gun dealer, Robinson was not permitted to elicit that she had told the dealer, on August 4, that she was purchasing the handgun to protect herself.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>The primary basis for the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 affirmance was that the evidence was not reliable. The court agreed with the trial judge who said, \u201c T don\u2019t think that a person when asked or when volunteering why they purchased a gun would indicate that they were doing it for the purpose of a homicide, if that were their purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 260-61, 503 A.2d at 732. The Court of Special Appeals recognized that the state of mind testimony had \u201csecondary relevance\u201d to the implied assertion in the State\u2019s proof that Robinson harbored a malicious intent on August 4. The court, however, concluded that the ruling fell within that band of trial court discretion where the ruling could go either way.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">If a person, on day one, is angry enough to intend to shoot another person, it may well be that, because of the cooling off effect of the passage of time, a shooting occurring thirty days later may not manifest a continuation of that intent. We are not persuaded, however, that that rationale applies when the inquiry is the motive for suicide. The latter determination necessarily must consider all of the circumstances bearing on the victim\u2019s psyche. <em>Robinson </em>is not helpful here for the additional reason that it did not deal with evidence produced by the adversary addressed to a state of mind existing months, and even years, before the critical time, in order to prove continuation of that state of mind up to critical time.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">For these reasons, we hold that the circuit court abused its discretion when it concluded that the proffered testimony was too remote to be relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">Trustworthiness</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">The Court of Special Appeals also found the Hegger proffer unreliable, saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cHere the trial court specifically addressed the trustworthiness of the statements when it stated: T find there\u2019s just not one scintilla of evidence to suggest that the reaction to being arrested for a serious charge and comments made during that process [were] somehow related to any notions of suicide.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number><em>Smith v. State, </em>196 Md.App. at 521, 10 A.3d at 814. It appears to us that the above-quoted approach goes more to the materiality of the proffer than to its trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">Trustworthiness in the subject context is explained in <em>Robinson </em>as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">\u201cThe case law and the opinion writers are unanimous that with respect to this and any other spontaneous declaration, there must be assurances of reliability. 6 J. Wigmore, <em>Evidence </em>(3d ed.1940), \u00a7 1725, at 80, points out that such declarations, \u2018must appear to have been made in a natural manner and not under circumstances of suspicion.\u2019 McCormick [2d ed.1972] speaks to the same requirement, at 695:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADC\">\u201c \u2018The special assurance of reliability for declarations of present state of mind rests, as in the case with declarations of bodily condition, upon their spontaneity and probable sincerity. This is assured by the requirements that the declarations must purport to relate to a condition of mind or emotion existing at the time of the statement and must have been made under circumstances indicating apparent sincerity.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">66 Md.App. at 260, 503 A.2d at 732.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-8\">The State calls our attention to <em>Pettie v. State, </em>316 Md. 509, 560 A.2d 577 (1989), a case involving the reliability of an attempted suicide that does not deal with a hearsay declaration of state of mind. While he was an inmate at the Maryland Correctional Training Center, Pettie was charged with sexual assault on another inmate. About six hours after the victim reported the incident to the prison authorities, a third inmate summoned a correctional officer to Pettie\u2019s cell. The third inmate stated that he had found a suicide note. Pettie was lying face down in his bunk, non-responsive but conscious, with a cut on his left wrist that bled only slightly. At trial, the State introduced evidence that Pettie attempted suicide, on the theory that it demonstrated consciousness of guilt. This Court reversed without reaching that issue. We pointed out that the State never introduced, directly or indirectly, any evidence of the content of the suicide note, there was no knife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>in Pettie\u2019s hand or in his cell, and the wound bled only slightly. We concluded that \u201cit is equally plausible, given the State\u2019s lack of evidence, that Pettie feigned attempted suicide to invite mitigation in the sentence he then served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 520, 560 A.2d at 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The State submits that, as in <em>Pettie, </em>the evidence of a suicidal state of mind based on the Hegger proffer is too ambiguous to be admissible. From the standpoint of reliability, we conclude that it is unlikely that McQueen\u2019s statement to Hegger was false and made for the purpose of obtaining favorable treatment from Hegger. When the statement was made to Hegger, McQueen had already been arrested and taken to the police station. Matters had progressed far beyond the point where Hegger could give McQueen a \u201cbreak.\u201d The fact that McQueen\u2019s statement does not explicitly refer to suicide does not deprive it of the tendency to make suicide more probable.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">For all the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the proffered Hegger evidence was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The Court of Special Appeals alternatively concluded that, if the Hegger proffer were admissible, the error in excluding it was nevertheless harmless. That court pointed to the forensic evidence produced by Smith and to his statement to the police that McQueen had killed himself. 196 Md.App. at 524, 10 A.3d at 814-15. From this, the court concluded that \u201cthere was a sufficient basis for the jury to determine whether McQueen died at his own hands or at the hands of appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 523, 10 A.3d at 815. This is not the correct standard, and it ignores the problem of persuasion of the trier of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-9\">The Maryland standard for judging harmless error in a criminal case was articulated in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\u201c[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d at 678 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-6\">In this case, the State produced evidence from which the jury could find consciousness of guilt on Smith\u2019s part based on temporarily disposing of the weapon, that he was the shooter based on the State\u2019s forensics, that McQueen, during his military career and during his terminal leave, never manifested depression or suicidal tendencies, and that Smith lied to the police. There was also evidence from which the jury could find that McQueen was the shooter, based on the defense forensics, and that there was no motive for Smith to kill McQueen. Because the relevant Hegger proffer was excluded, the State was able to argue to the jury that there was no evidence of depression or suicidal tendencies from anyone who had come in contact with McQueen. We are unable to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the error in no way influenced the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR MONTGOMERY COUNTY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">COSTS TO BE PAID BY MONTGOMERY COUNTY, MARYLAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">.

Based on McKay's testimony that McQueen no longer wanted to live with Smith, the State suggested to the jury in final argument that, on the fateful night, McQueen had so stated to Smith, who became \"upset.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b632-13\">. Smith\u2019s hands were not bagged until the police arrived at the apartment, after he had been to the lake and back.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b634-11\">. Witness Hegger was a police officer of Acworth City, Georgia, a community about forty minutes northwest of Atlanta when he arrested McQueen.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b636-7\">. The State treats as the proffered evidence the circuit court's summary of the statements of counsel made on the sixth trial day. The operative proffer is Officer Hegger\u2019s testimony that later was taken out of the presence of the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b642-8\">.
