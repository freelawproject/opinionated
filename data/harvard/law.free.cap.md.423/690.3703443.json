After Harford Memorial Hospital (\u201cHarford\u201d) declined to renew the privileges of Dr. Linda Freilich,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> she sued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>for damages. Harford claimed immunity under HCQIA.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit Court for Harford County granted summary judgment to Harford, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed. We granted <em>certiorari, Freilich v. Upper Chesapeake Health Sys., Inc., </em>418 Md. 586, 16 A.3d 977 (2011), to answer the following question as phrased in the petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">In the context of a summary judgment proceeding is the presumption of HCQIA immunity rebutted upon the showing of material facts in dispute regarding the physician\u2019s reporting of substandard medical care and attempts to improve the quality of care in the hospital system?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">We shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals. Although we hold that evidence of retaliatory motive on the part of a disciplinary body is relevant when offered to rebut the presumption of HCQIA immunity, special standards must be met in order for such evidence to defeat summary judgment. Evidence of retaliation will not prevent summary judgment on HCQIA immunity unless it can permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that (1) the defendant failed to comply with the standards for immunity set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a) or (2) the action was not a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9). We explain this below as we discuss these sections of HCQIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">Between 1982 and 1997, Petitioner Dr. Freilich practiced medicine at two hospitals in Harford County: Harford Memorial Hospital (\u201cHarford\u201d) and Fallston General Hospital (\u201cFallston\u201d). The hospitals were operated by Upper Chesapeake Health System (\u201cUpper Chesapeake\u201d), a nonprofit corporation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She specialized in internal medicine and nephrology.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">During her time at the hospitals, Dr. Freilich was the subject of numerous complaints. Although some of the complaints addressed her competence as a physician, most of them alleged unprofessional behavior and violations of ethics rules. At least 35 complaints were filed against Dr. Freilich by doctors and members of the hospital staff, and at least 33 complaints were filed by patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Dr. Freilich argues generally that the complaints against her were made in retaliation for her legitimate reporting of substandard medical care and efforts to improve the hospitals. But she offers no evidence of retaliatory motive \u201cin detail and with precision,\u201d as required to fend off summary judgment,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with regard to any of the following complaints alleged about her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">\u2022 Dr. Freilich \u201ctold [a] patient he was just fat and go on a diet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-8\">\u2022 She told a nurse, \u201cWe don\u2019t want you here. Get out. I can make life miserable for you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-9\">\u2022 Dr. Freilich told a hospital employee, \u201cEvery time I am written up, I will write you up ten times.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-10\">\u2022 When a nurse wanted to give pain medication to an alcoholic with pancreatitis, Dr. Freilich allegedly said, \u201cI want him to be miserable. He did this to himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>\u2022 She told a patient who smokes, \u201cI hate people who smoke.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u2022 She told a patient, \u201cYou are a three-time loser and you will be back.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">\u2022 She publicly humiliated a patient and then told another patient who had observed the incident that \u201cshe could avoid that embarrassment if the patient would stop coming to the emergency room in a drunken stupor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u2022 She was uncooperative with patients\u2019 requests for transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-7\">\u2022 She was \u201cuncooperative numerous times in notifying families of patient deaths.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-8\">\u2022 In 1997, patients were surveyed about their satisfaction with their attending emergency room doctor. No other physician had more than one person choose \u201cdissatisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat dissatisfied,\u201d but Dr. Freilich had nine people (out of 22) choose that option.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-9\">\u2022 Thirty-three patients independently complained to the hospital about Dr. Freilich.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-10\">\u2022 After losing privileges at Fallston, she told a patient at Harford, in a semi-public room, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing you are in here because too many people go out of Fallston in boxes.\u201d The patient was \u201chorrified.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-11\">\u2022 She told a patient\u2019s daughter \u201cin essence that ICU physicians were trying to kill her mother and that she needed to get to the hospital immediately.\u201d This was apparently because of a disagreement between Dr. Freilich and another doctor about how a certain patient should be treated. The daughter reported this incident to three different people at the hospital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-12\">\u2022 Dr. Freilich \u201cviolated the privacy of a 17 year old admitted to the BHU\u201d by releasing information regarding his admission and positive test results to his parents without first discussing it with the attending psychiatrist. (The MEC Subcommittee believed that she may not have been aware of a law regarding the privacy of emancipated minors and mental health records.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>\u2022 She failed to comply with MEC\u2019s recommendation that she seek counseling and follow a treatment plan (if needed) in 1996, resulting in revocation of her privileges in 1997.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u2022 She refused to meet about the concerns and complaints against her.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u2022 On the application for renewal of privileges at Harford, she made misrepresentations about her loss of privileges at Fallston. She incorrectly stated that there \u201cwere never any quality concerns\u201d with her work, \u201cno witnesses or corroboration of any unprofessional behavior\u201d on her part and \u201cin fact, the only witness, a patient of [hers], completely supported [her] testimony.\u201d Her excuse for making the misstatement about the witnesses was that she \u201cthought witness means something like the witnesses who sign in a will.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">\u2022 She documented that she had examined patients and put the documentation in their medical records, but patients denied that she had examined them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-7\">\u2022 She gave \u201cuntruthful testimony\u201d before the hearing committee. In particular:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-8\">\u2022 She prepared a binder full of \u201cthousands\u201d of signatures on a petition for her to keep her privileges. She represented to the hearing committee that the signatures were of her patients when, in fact, she had found people who were not her patients and asked them to sign.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-9\">\u2022 Even though she had met numerous times with the committee at both hospitals to discuss her behavior, she testified under oath, \u201cI was never told my behavior was inappropriate.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-10\">\u2022 She later admitted to having been told that she had behavioral problems at other institutions where she worked, and when the examiner asked her where exactly, she responded, \u201cI really wasn\u2019t thinking of any other institutions.\u201d When pressed about her previous statement, she said, \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>There were fewer instances, according to evidence from Dr. Freilich, in which complaints were made by persons with a retaliatory motive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">\u2022 Dr. Freilich refused to allow a patient to die because she believed he was no longer terminal, and she followed the statutory procedure for transfer to another doctor. The result, she says, was that she was written up for \u201cnot being cooperative.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-6\">\u2022 Dr. Freilich complained that the Social Service Department was inefficient and was not performing its job properly. The retaliation, she says, was a complaint filed against her regarding her interaction with a family on the telephone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u2022 A patient who was abusing diuretics and laxatives, which Dr. Freilich said can be consistent with suicidal intentions, was admitted 30 times to Harford without being referred to a psychiatrist. Dr. Freilich discovered this oversight and immediately transferred her to Fallston for a psychiatric evaluation. The ER personnel were not prepared to receive the patient, and the MEC accused Dr. Freilich of having abandoned the patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">\u2022 She complained to Pam Aitken, Program Administrator of the Transitional Care Unit (\u201cTCU\u201d) at Harford,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> regarding a patient with skin problems. According to Dr. Freilich, Aitken wrote a retaliatory letter to the Medical Director of the TCU, Dr. Suresh Dhanjani, setting forth four complaints against Dr. Freilich:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-9\">\u2022 (1) She failed to provide proper treatment to a patient with a necrotic ulcer because she didn\u2019t know it was necrotic, even though there was documentation in the patient\u2019s record showing that she was indeed aware of the condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-10\">\u2022 (2) She told the wife of another doctor\u2019s patient that \u201cher husband was dying,\u201d that the Transitional Care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>Unit was an inappropriate place for him, and that he needed to be placed in long-term care. She said the same thing to other staff members in the nurse\u2019s station, a \u201cvery public place ... accessible by family, patients and other staff, resulting in a violation of confidentiality.\u201d This incident led to a \u201clong conversation with the patient\u2019s wife to \u2018calm her down,\u2019 and, indeed it appears that arrangements were already in the works to have the patient go home with appropriate home care.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u2022 (3) She performed a consult on a patient before the order for a consult was obtained from the attending physician.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-5\">\u2022 (4) She spoke about patients while in open areas in which staff and patients could hear, including saying that a certain patient was not an appropriate admission to the rehabilitation unit and would not get better or benefit from being there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-6\">\u2022 An ongoing conflict existed between Dr. Freilich and Dialysis Management of Maryland (\u201cDMM\u201d). Dr. Freilich states that although her \u201ccompany submitted the low bid\u201d to perform dialysis services at Upper Chesapeake, \u201cthe contract was given to an out of county contractor, Dialysis Management of Maryland which began operations in 1995; however the dialysis services did not improve.\u201d As a result, she \u201ccontinued to complain about quality issues\u201d on the dialysis unit, and in return received what she called \u201cretaliation ... via sham complaints.\u201d On the record before us, at most five of those complaints were in the record considered by the Board:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-7\">\u2022 She said \u201cget the hell out\u201d to a nurse and that she did not want the nurse or her dialysis machines in Harford County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-8\">\u2022 She stated in front of a patient that \u201cDMM was at [Fallston] because the bosses were white males and \u2018good old boys\u2019 and [Fallston] was a country club where patients were brought in to waste time and fill beds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>\u2022 She complained about \u201cproviding incorrect dosages of Epogen, using incorrect sizes of dialyzers and staffing issues,\u201d which led to sham \u201cquality assurance\u201d evaluations of Dr. Freilich by dialysis nurses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-4\">\u2022 She admonished \u201ctwo contracted dialysis nurses\u201d for abandoning a patient on dialysis and nearly causing his death. They filed retaliatory complaints against her, with one of the nurses even admitting that Dr. Freilich was the subject of a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">\u2022 A dialysis nurse complained \u201cabout several incidents with Dr. Freilich, including confrontations in front of patients, Dr. Freilich trying to persuade her to quit [and] change her testimony.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Petitioner points to nothing in the record to show that these retaliatory-based complaints served as the basis for the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">Investigations and Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">After Fallston suspended Dr. Freilich\u2019s privileges on July 9, 1997, citing \u201cunprofessional behavior,\u201d Harford began investigating her as well.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Harford\u2019s Medical Executive Committee (\u201cMEC\u201d) convened a subcommittee on December 18, 1997, to investigate her alleged misconduct in the hospital\u2019s psychiatric unit. In response, Dr. Freilich voluntarily withdrew from the psychiatric unit but continued practicing in other parts of the hospital. The subcommittee met again on February 19, 1998, and recommended that Dr. Freilich \u201ccontinue to remain off the [psychiatric unit].\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Incidentally, Dr. Freilich\u2019s appointment at Harford was scheduled to expire on December 31, 1998, which required her to file an application for reappointment with Upper Chesapeake. As we explain later, Dr. Freilich made several incorrect and misleading statements about her suspension at Fallston.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">In response to Dr. Freilich\u2019s application, Harford\u2019s Credentials Committee proposed a \u201cconditional one year reappointment\u201d during which she would be monitored for professionalism and behavior issues.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The MEC agreed and recommended a one year reappointment. Fourteen physicians and five non-physicians voted on this recommendation. Ultimate authority, however, rested with Harford\u2019s Board of Directors, which decided to reappoint Dr. Freilich for only four months, during which time \u201cmanagement, legal counsel and the Medical Staff\u2019 were to investigate the complaints against her. The Board was to meet at the conclusion of the four months and decide whether to fully reappoint her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">During Dr. Freilich\u2019s conditional four-month reappointment, a committee of seven physicians, chaired by Dr. Barry Wohl, investigated her case. Dr. Freilich met personally with the committee and communicated with Dr. Wohl by letter several times. The committee met three times during Dr. Freilich\u2019s conditional reappointment. Ultimately, Dr. Wohl\u2019s committee recommended that Dr. Freilich be required to complete a communication course.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">The MEC, however, disagreed and recommended that the Board simply deny Dr. Freilich\u2019s application for reappointment.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Board adopted the MEC\u2019s recommendation on April 13, 1999, deciding not to reappoint Dr. Freilich. The Board provided her with temporary privileges, however, so</p>\n<p id=\"AhR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>that she could appeal and have a hearing as provided under Harford\u2019s bylaws.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">At Dr. Freilich\u2019s request, Upper Chesapeake convened an Ad Hoc Hearing Committee (\u201cHearing Committee\u201d), consisting of four physicians and a hearing officer, to hear her objections to the Board\u2019s decision. The Hearing Committee met several times between September 30, 1999, and January 11, 2000, listening to testimony from Dr. Freilich, members of Dr. Wohl\u2019s committee, and others. On January 27, 2000, the Hearing Committee unanimously recommended a conditional one-year reappointment, as originally proposed by the Credentials Committee.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The Board\u2019s Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The Board met to consider the Hearing Committee\u2019s recommendation on February 8, 2000. Concluding that Dr. Freilich\u2019s behavior was not \u201cremediable,\u201d the Board voted not to change its decision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The next week, Dr. Freilich formally requested appellate review, as provided under Harford\u2019s bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Harford\u2019s Appellate Review Committee convened on March 16, 2000, hearing testimony from Dr. Freilich, Dr. Margaret Vaughan on behalf of the hospital, and legal counsel for both parties. The committee consisted of three non-physicians and one physician, who served as chairman. On March 30, the committee issued a report affirming the Board\u2019s decision not to reappoint Dr. Freilich. The report indicated that the primary reason for rejecting the MEC\u2019s recommended year of privileges with monitoring was that Dr. Freilich \u201clacked personal insight or understanding of the fact that she has caused multiple problems, which is a prerequisite to their remediabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>ty.\u201d The Board .met on April 11, 2000, and voted to affirm its decision. The four physician members of the Board abstained from this vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Lawsuit</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Dr. Freilich filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Harford County, naming Upper Chesapeake, the Board, and individual members of the Board as defendants. She alleged breach of contract and misapplication of Harford\u2019s bylaws and sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After a hearing, the Circuit Court granted the defense motion for summary judgment on all counts, based on HCQIA immunity. The Circuit Court reasoned that, \u201cwhen examined in its totality, the entire one year, nine month multi-step fact finding process satisfies the HCQIA\u2019s standard of objective reasonableness.\u201d Thus, it held that the defendants were \u201cimmune from any and all claims for money damages.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and Dr. Freilich filed a timely petition for <em>certiorari, </em>on the issue of HCQIA immunity, which we granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Congress enacted HCQIA to encourage peer review and monitoring of physicians. <em>See </em>H.R.Rep. No. 99-903, at 2 (1986), <em>reprinted in </em>1986 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6287, 6384 (observing that HCQIA\u2019s purpose is to \u201cimprove the quality of medical care by encouraging physicians to identify and discipline other physicians who are incompetent or who engage in unprofessional behavior\u201d); <em>Bryan v. Holmes Regional Med. Ctr., </em>33 F.3d 1318, 1321 (11th Cir.1994) (same). Part of Congress\u2019 strategy was to provide qualified immunity for those who discipline ineffective physicians.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11111(a)(1). Thus, as we observed fifteen years ago, \u201cHCQIA provides participants in peer review activities with qualified immunity from liability for monetary damages in suits brought by the physicians who were the subjects of these review activities.\u201d <em>Goodwich v. Sinai Hosp., </em>343 Md. 185, 196-97, 680 A.2d 1067, 1073 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">To qualify for immunity, the disciplinary action must have been a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d that complied with the standards set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Those standards are that the action was taken</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>(1) in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\">(2) after a reasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">(3) after adequate notice and hearing procedures are afforded to the physician involved or after such other procedures as are fair to the physician under the circumstances, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">(4) in the reasonable belief that the action was warranted by the facts known after such reasonable effort to obtain facts and after meeting the requirement of paragraph (3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-7\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(l)-(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">The burden on the issue of immunity rests with the plaintiff, as immunity is presumed unless the plaintiff rebuts it \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a) (\u201cA professional review action shall be presumed to have met the ... standards necessary for [immunity] unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-9\">A number of courts have observed that the presumption of immunity creates an \u201cunusual\u201d standard for summary judgment. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">[T]he rebuttable presumption ... creates an unusual summary judgment standard that can best be expressed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>follows: \u201cMight a reasonable jury, viewing the facts in the best light for [the plaintiff], conclude that he has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendants\u2019 actions are outside the scope of \u00a7 11112(a)?\u201d If not, the court should grant the defendant\u2019s motion. In a sense, the presumption language in HCQIA means that the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the peer review process was <em>not </em>reasonable. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-4\"><em>Bryan, </em>33 F.3d at 1333; <em>see also Gordon v. Lewistown Hosp., </em>423 F.3d 184, 202 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that HCQIA\u2019s \u201cpresumption of immunity creates an unusual standard for reviewing summary judgment orders, as the plaintiff bears the burden of proving that the professional review process was not reasonable and thus did not meet the standard for immunity\u201d). We explained this standard in <em>Goodwich:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b753-5\">[T]he proper summary judgment standard in [a HCQIA] case is whether [the plaintiff] produced sufficient evidence of the existence of a genuine dispute as to the material fact of whether [the professional reviewer] was entitled to the qualified immunity prescribed by the HCQIA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-6\"><em>Goodwich, </em>343 Md. at 207, 680 A.2d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">Dr. Freilich claims that she has rebutted the presumption of immunity by presenting evidence that Harford retaliated against her for her reports of substandard care and attempts to improve the quality of care at the hospital. In her words,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASA2\">Appellees are not entitled to HCQIA immunity because they failed to meet the HCQIA immunity requirements. Appellees failed to make a reasonable effort to obtain the facts, they did not act with the reasonable belief that their actions were warranted by the known facts, and they did not act with the reasonable belief that their actions were in furtherance of quality health care. Appellees\u2019 denial of Dr. Freilich\u2019s hospital privileges was in retaliation of Dr. Freilich\u2019s reporting of substandard care.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b753-8\">We understand her argument to be that evidence that some people might have complained about her with a retaliatory motive creates a material question of fact regarding whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>the hospital\u2019s actions met the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">Harford responds that a retaliatory \u201csubjective bad faith whistleblower animus [does not] magically generate[ ] a material fact dispute regarding the Hospital\u2019s entitlement to HCQIA immunity.\u201d Instead, Harford asserts, immunity under HCQIA is determined by an \u201cobjective reasonableness standard\u201d entirely unrelated to subjective motivation, retaliatory or otherwise.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Although we agree with Harford that the plaintiff bears the burden of showing a material fact dispute, we disagree with its theory that retaliatory animus by the hospital is entirely irrelevant to HCQIA immunity. As our cases indicate, the \u201cobjective reasonableness test\u201d looks to the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d to determine whether a defendant has met the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA. <em>Goodwich, </em>343 Md. at 208, 213, 680 A.2d at 1079, 1081. Therefore, any evidence is relevant if it could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude that the immunity standards were not met. This includes evidence that retaliatory animus prevented the defendant from making \u201ca reasonable effort to obtain the facts\u201d or supplanted the required \u201creasonable belief\u2019 that the professional review action was \u201cwarranted by the facts\u201d and \u201cin the furtherance of quality health care.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(1)-(4). It also includes evidence that the action was \u201cprimarily based on ... any ... matter that does not relate to the competence or professional conduct of a physician,\u201d including retaliatory animus, because such an action is not a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d and therefore cannot qualify for immunity. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">Yet Dr. Freilich is incorrect to the extent that she argues her reports of substandard care to the hospital are sufficient, without evidence of retaliation, to rebut the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>sumption of immunity. Without any evidence of a connection between a professional review action and its allegedly illegitimate basis, courts cannot presume that one exists. <em>See, e.g., Chalal v. Nw. Med. Ctr., Inc., </em>147 F.Supp.2d 1160, 1172 (N.D.Ala.2000) (granting summary judgment because there was \u201cno evidence on record to suggest that the Hospital did not act \u2018in the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care[.]\u2019 \u201d (quoting 42 U.S.C. 11112(a)(1))); <em>Egan v. Athol Mem. Hosp., </em>971 F.Supp. 37, 42-43 (D.Mass.1997) (granting summary judgment because the \u201cPlaintiff ... presented no evidence that the professional review action ... was motivated by anything other than a reasonable belief that it would further quality health care\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">Thus, retaliatory animus is neither the panacea that Dr. Freilich believes it to be nor entirely irrelevant as Harford maintains. Instead, evidence of retaliation is simply one of several factors to be considered when determining whether, in the totality of the circumstances, the professional review action satisfied the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA. We next address the primary cases cited by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Dr. Freilich\u2019s Cases</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Dr. Freilich asserts that the relevant cases stand for the proposition that \u201cmaterial facts in dispute regarding the reporting of substandard medical care\u201d prevent summary judgment on HCQIA immunity. The two cases upon which she principally relies, however, support our interpretation, not hers. <em>See Clark v. Columbia/HCA Info. Servs., Inc., </em>117 Nev. 468, 25 P.3d 215 (2001); <em>Ritten v. Lapeer Reg'l Med. Ctr., </em>611 F.Supp.2d 696, 720 (E.D.Mich.2009). <em>Clark </em>held that to overcome the presumption of immunity, the plaintiff must present evidence capable of showing \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the [professional review action] was not based on a reasonable belief that it was in furtherance of quality health care.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>25 P.3d at 222. <em>Clark </em>did not hold that a physician\u2019s reporting of substandard medical care, without more, staves off summary judgment against her on the immunity issue. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b756-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>In <em>Clark, </em>the plaintiff presented evidence showing that \u201cthe reason for his dismissal was his apparently good faith reporting of perceived improper hospital conduct to the appropriate outside agencies, or whistleblowing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, in <em>Clark, </em>\u201cthe only findings the board made in support of its decision [were] related to Clark\u2019s external reporting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223. Such direct evidence of retaliation could certainly have led a rational trier of fact to conclude that the hospital\u2019s action was not based on the furtherance of quality health care.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Here, on the other hand, there is no evidence that the Board\u2019s decision was based on impermissible factors. Dr. Freilich has produced evidence that some doctors and nurses may have filed sham complaints against her because of her reporting, but she has no evidence that those allegedly sham complaints served as the basis for the Board\u2019s decision. In this regard, we agree with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that \u201cconclusory statements attacking individual items of evidence considered by the reviewers\u201d cannot rebut the presumption of immunity under HCQIA. <em>Meyers v. Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp., </em>341 F.3d 461, 469 (6th Cir.2003).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Dr. Freilich\u2019s other primary case, <em>Ritten, </em>is readily distinguishable as well. The plaintiff in <em>Ritten </em>had direct evidence of retaliation sufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that the hospital \u201cdid not make [its] decision \u2018in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>reasonable belief that the action was in furtherance of quality health caret.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Ritten, </em>611 F.Supp.2d at 720. As the court observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-4\">[T]he record here features direct evidence of retaliation.... According to Plaintiff, [his supervisor] told him that \u2018if you don\u2019t transfer that patient out of here, you may lose your job.\u2019 Roughly three weeks later, [the supervisor] summarily suspended Plaintiffs staff privileges ... thereby terminating his ability to practice at this hospital. (Citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b757-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 716-17. Here, Dr. Freilich has no such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">In short, the cases cited by Dr. Freilich do not support her argument that <em>any </em>evidence of retaliatory complaints is sufficient to rebut the presumption of immunity. Rather, those cases are consistent with our holding that the presumption of immunity is not rebutted unless the plaintiff produces evidence that could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, in the totality of the circumstances, that the professional review action did not meet the four-part test for immunity set forth in HCQIA.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> This requires that she prove retaliation by the hospital in making its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Harford\u2019s Reliance on <em>Goodwich</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-8\">As we indicated earlier, we do not adopt Harford\u2019s proposed ban <em>on </em>retaliatory motivation evidence. Harford relies primarily on <em>Goodwich to </em>support its thesis that a hospital\u2019s motivation is irrelevant under HCQIA. It quotes a portion of that case in which we observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-9\">Even if the second opinion requirement was initiated out of fear of litigation, rather than patient care concerns, neither evidence of that fact nor the inferences from such evidence rebuts the presumption of reasonableness the [professional review] action enjoys. This evidence may support an inference of bad faith on [the hospital\u2019s] part; however, as we have already pointed out, what is relevant here is the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>objective reasonableness of the hospital\u2019s actions, not its subjective intent or motivation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-4\"><em>Goodwich, </em>343 Md. at 208, 680 A.2d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Although this selective quotation lends superficial support for Harford\u2019s position, our holding in <em>Goodwich </em>was more nuanced. In that case, the plaintiff argued that two letters from the chairman of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department tended to prove that the hospital dismissed him because of a fear of litigation instead of a desire to further quality health care. <em>Id </em>These letters, however, were not connected to the hospital\u2019s professional review action. As we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-Q\">Dr. Goodwich\u2019s reliance on these two letters improperly focuses on what is more accurately characterized as the hospital\u2019s prehminary conduct, while failing to address the basis for [the hospital] taking the professional review action that it did; this focus does not address, not to mention rebut, the evidence that was before the [Medical Executive Committee] when it abridged Dr. Goodwich\u2019s hospital privileges.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\"><em>Id </em>The letters were not relevant because they did not bear on the professional review action in question. Indeed, the letters were written five and two years prior to Dr. Goodwich\u2019s dismissal, which took place when the review body had more and different evidence before it. <em>Id </em>This explains why we held that the evidence of \u201csubjective intent or motivation\u201d did not bear on the \u201cobjective reasonableness of the hospital\u2019s action\u201d in that case. <em>Id </em>We do not read <em>Goodwich </em>as standing for the proposition that evidence of improper motives is <em>always </em>irrelevant under HCQIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Indeed, we held in <em>Goodwich </em>that a hospital\u2019s action is not immune unless it was \u201cundertaken in the reasonable <em>belief </em>that quality health care was being furthered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 680 A.2d at 1078 (quoting <em>Imperial v. Suburban Hospital Ass\u2019n, Inc., </em>37 F.3d 1026, 1030 (1994) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a))). The relevant inquiry, we said, is whether \u201cthe <em>basis </em>for ... the professional review action\u201d was reasonable. <em>Id. </em>at 208, 680 A.2d at 1079. No standard that looks to a person\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>\u201cbelief\u2019 and \u201cbasis\u201d can exclude all evidence of improper motivation. In other words, the hospital or other entity must actually hold the belief <em>and </em>the basis for the belief must be reasonable. \u201c[Tlhe standard is an objective one which looks to the totality of the circumstances [to determine whether] the action was objectively reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208, 680 A.2d at 1078. When retaliation was the \u201cbasis\u201d of an action, a rational trier of fact could conclude that it was not preceded by a \u201creasonable effort to obtain the facts of the matter\u201d or \u201cundertaken in the reasonable belief\u2019 that it was \u201cwarranted by the facts\u201d and \u201cin furtherance of quality healthcare.\u201d <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(l)-(4). In short, retaliation can be relevant to HCQIA immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">Another provision of the HCQIA statute also supports our conclusion above. Under \u00a7 11151(a), if the hospital\u2019s action was \u201cprimarily based on . .. any ... matter that does not relate to the competence or professional conduct of a physician,\u201d then it is not a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9) and cannot qualify for immunity under HCQIA. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11111(a)(1). Therefore, actions primarily based on retaliatory animus cannot be immune, as they are \u201cprimarily based on [a] matter that does not relate to the competence or professional conduct of a physician.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Totality of the Circumstances Standard and its Application</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">The lesson we take from <em>Goodwick </em>and several federal cases interpreting HCQIA is that evidence of retaliatory animus is one of many types of evidence that can contribute, in the totality of the circumstances, to a finding that an action did not meet the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA. The existence of some evidence that complaints were made by a disciplined physician about substandard care at the hospital, or that certain hospital staff filed complaints to retaliate for complaints by the physician, is relevant, but will not always rebut the presumption of immunity. The presumption of immunity under HCQIA entitles a defendant to summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>judgment if and only if the plaintiff fails to present evidence that could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, in the totality of the circumstances, that the action (1) failed to meet the standards for immunity set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(l)-(4) or (2) was not a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Such is the case here. Although Dr. Freilich has presented some evidence of retaliatory complaints by the staff, her effort to rebut the presumption of immunity fails because her \u201cretaliatory\u201d evidence is insufficient to permit a rational trier of fact to conclude that the <em>hospital\u2019s </em>refusal to renew her privileges failed to meet the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA. This is because, although Dr. Freilich broadly alleges that all of the hospital\u2019s conduct was retaliatory, and she presents evidence that some of the staff complaints filed against her were retaliatory, she points to <em>no </em>evidence that retaliation had anything to do with the Board\u2019s decision to refuse her privileges. If all of the complaints made about Dr. Freilich were based on retaliation, or even if the majority of them were, we might view the case differently. But, as we said, she offered no evidence of retaliatory motive with respect to a large majority of the complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Some of the complaints made about Dr. Freilich were specifically disputed by her. She disputed five complaints in a letter to Dr. Wohl, in response to his letter setting forth the complaints. She also disputed several complaints arising out of the dialysis unit in a memorandum to Dr. Nowakowski, head of Upper Chesapeake\u2019s Nephrology Division. Although we cannot confirm, from the record before us, whether the MEC ever made findings of fact as to exactly what happened with respect to these disputed complaints, such omission is not fatal to the Board\u2019s immunity because the sheer number of complaints, coming from such a variety of sources, is compelling. Dr. Freilich has not pointed to record evidence that she produced evidence tending to refute even half of these.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>picture emerges that, although each incident may not have happened exactly as the complainant portrayed it, Dr. Freilich conducts herself in a manner that causes offense to patients, nurses, other doctors, and other hospital personnel. A reasonable person on the Board, reviewing this large volume of complaints, could be persuaded that Dr. Freilich\u2019s conduct was detrimental to the quality of health care in the hospital because it was distracting, created emotional distress, and detracted from a teamwork approach to the care of patients. As Dr. Vaughan stated before the Appellate Review Committee,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-5\">There has been a tremendous administrative and emotional burden associated with Dr. Freilich and her behavior. I personally have spent more time in six years \"with her and issues related to her than all of the other physicians in the medical staff combined from both hospitals and I dare say there are a number of staff members who would be able to say the same thing[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b761-6\">[PJatients and family have been hurt by her attitude and her communication. The hospital and the physicians on the medical staff have been put at risk because of her behavior and lack of communication. She has created a tremendous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>administrative burden on me and many others and the hospit\u00e1l reputation has suffered irreparably in the community as a result of her and her behavior toward patients and family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">There is no evidence that Dr. Vaughan possessed a retaliatory motive in recounting her history of dealing with complaints against Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-6\">A few incidents bear repeating, for they provide insight into the extent of Dr. Freilich\u2019s inability to conduct herself in a professional manner around the hospital. When a nurse suggested giving pain medication to an alcoholic with pancreatitis, Dr. Freilich allegedly said, \u201cI want him to be miserable. \u2018 He did this to himself.\u201d She also allegedly told a patient\u2019s daughter that the physicians who were treating her mother \u201cwere trying to kill her.\u201d She was alleged to breach patient confidentiality and privacy, publicly humiliate patients, and numerous other instances of what Dr. Robert Roca called \u201cbehavioral eccentricity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b762-7\">As we mentioned, a highly significant incident of her unprofessional behavior relates to her lack of honesty, as revealed in her written application for reappointment at Harford. The application required her to state whether \u201cany hospital ever suspended, diminished, revoked or failed to renew [her] privileges,\u201d and if so, to \u201cprovide a full statement of explanation.\u201d In an effort to discount her suspension from Fallston, she stated, \u201cThere were no witnesses or corroboration of any \u2018unprofessional behavior\u2019 on my part. In fact, the only witness, a patient of mine, completely supported my testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This was patently false.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">Indeed, the limited excerpts from the hearings at Fallston contained in the record show that there were at least three witnesses who testified against her. One of these was Dr. Vaughan, the senior vice-president for medical affairs, who also wrote a letter in response to Dr. Freilich\u2019s application, explaining that \u201ca number of witnesses appeared and eorrobo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>rated allegations of unprofessional behavior on [her] part.\u201d The report of Fallston\u2019s Hearing Committee additionally notes that \u201c[t]he hearing was conducted over a three day period ... during which extensive testimony, documentary evidence, and argument of counsel was received and considered.\u201d Moreover, the committee found that \u201c[t]he oral testimony on behalf of the Hospital was credible\u201d and \u201cthe evidence showed that the MEC actions were both reasonable and supported by substantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-4\">As we have recently held, a physician\u2019s dishonesty in official applications is a serious matter for which discipline is appropriate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-5\">A physician\u2019s submission of false information ... in license renewal applications impedes the Board\u2019s ability to make accurate determinations about a physician\u2019s continued fitness .... [F]alse information could form the basis upon which the Board renews or grants a license, potentially to an unfit applicant. The Board is entitled to expect truthful submissions^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-6\"><em>Kim v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>428 Md. 523, 32 A.3d 30 (2011) (upholding the decision of the Maryland State Board of Physicians to fine and suspend a physician who failed to disclose on his renewal application that he had been sued for malpractice). Dr. Freilich\u2019s excuse for the misstatement about the witnesses was that she \u201cthought witness meant something like the witnesses who sign in a will.\u201d Yet Dr. Freilich has produced nothing to show that the hearing(s) at Fallston were devoid of evidence against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">Additionally, the transcript of the hearing before the Appellate Review Committee provides evidence that Dr. Freilich was untruthful during this phase of the investigation as well. She testified that the signatures on a petition to reinstate her were of her patients, only to admit under cross-examination that some of the signatures she obtained were of other people. She also testified that she \u201cwas never told [her] behavior was inappropriate,\u201d even though she had met numerous times with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>the MEC and the Hearing Committee to discuss her unprofessional behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\">Her appellate brief paints a misleading picture of the various committees who reviewed her conduct. She states: \u201cDespite the reappointment recommendations by 1) the Credentials Committee of UCHS\u2019 Medical Staff, 2) The Medical Executive Committee (MEC), and 8) the Ad Hoc Hearing Committee ... each a committee of medical doctors, Appellee\u2019s lay board improperly and wrongfully terminated Appellant\u2019s HMH hospital privileges.\u201d Yet these committees did not cleanly recommend that she be reappointed. They recommended a conditional one-year reappointment during which she would receive counseling and be monitored for professionalism and behavior issues, and would have the opportunity, in the words of the Hearing Committee, \u201cto prove her willingness to adjust her style and methods of operation to accommodate the hospital\u2019s legitimate concerns relating to her interactions with hospital staff and patients.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> What is more, although the MEC initially recommended a one-year conditional reappointment, it ultimately recommended, after Dr. Wohl\u2019s committee completed its investigation and reported its findings, that Dr. Freilich not be reappointed at all. Thus, rather than supporting her cause of action, the recommendations of these committees lend credence to the Board\u2019s ultimate refusal to renew her privileges.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">Dr. Freilich also scored considerably worse than her colleagues on a patient satisfaction survey. No physician had more than one patient choose \u201cdissatisfied\u201d or \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d except Dr. Freilich, who had nine patients (out of 22) choose one of those options. Indeed, as we indicated earlier, the hospital received thirty-three complaints from patients about Dr. Freilich.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">At the very end of Harford\u2019s three-year investigation, which involved numerous hearings by various hospital committees, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the Appellate Review Committee decided to uphold the decision to dismiss her because its report concluded, based on all the evidence, that her behavioral problems were \u201cnot remediable.\u201d It relied primarily on her apparent unwillingness to admit or remedy her behavior problems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-4\">Given the long history of the problems Dr. Freilich has created with her attitude and behavior, and given the fact that she has acquiesced to the idea of seeking some form of professional help, both at Fallston General Hospital and Harford Memorial Hospital, only when her privileges were directly threatened, the committee concludes that there is a strong reason to believe that the problems are not remediable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Especially telling for the committee was her unwillingness to forthrightly address her problems, even at the final stage of the review process before the Hearing Committee:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">A review of her testimony before the Ad Hoc Hearing Committee, particularly with respect to her exhibit which she represented to be a petition from her patients when in fact she knew it contained multiple signatures of people who were not her patients, was less than forthright.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-7\">Her evasive testimony about whether she had been counseled about her behavior and her testimony regarding her behavioral problems at other institutions was also less than forthright. Her testimony regarding the lack of counseling was of particular concern given the significant amount of documented counseling she had received over many years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">The report of the Appellate Review Committee also highlighted Dr. Freilich\u2019s lack of self-awareness, even after all the complaints against her:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-9\">[Although there] is ample evidence in the record that Dr. Freilich\u2019s demeanor and attitude has led to problems with patients and their families far beyond those experienced by any other physician on the Medical Staff ... [she] clearly lacked personal insight or understanding of the fact that she has caused multiple problems, which is a prerequisite to their remediability. She decidedly refused to accept any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>significant degree of personal responsibility for or ownership of the multiple and varied confrontations, conflicts, and problems which have been clearly documented to have involved her via her actions and statements to patients, families, and staff at Harford Memorial Hospital.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-4\">It is clear that the hospital ultimately declined to renew Dr. Freilich\u2019s privileges because it concluded that she had no capacity to recognize that her conduct was unduly disruptive to hospital operations, and that one more year of monitoring her, with hopes of change, was futile. The Board legitimately perceived that Dr. Freilich was not going to remedy her disruptive behavior. There is nothing in the record to indicate that she was dismissed in retaliation for her complaints about substandard care.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">We return to the standard for summary judgment under HCQIA. Summary judgment for the defense may be granted if the plaintiff has failed to present evidence that could lead a rational trier of fact to conclude, in the totality of the circumstances, that the action (1) failed to meet the standards for immunity set forth in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11112(a)(1)-(4) or (2) was not a \u201cprofessional review action\u201d as defined in 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11151(9). As a shorthand summary, the defendants have immunity under Section 11112(a)(l)-(4) if (1) they reasonably believed they were furthering quality health care; (2) made a reasonable effort to obtain the facts; (3) held adequate hearings; and (4) reasonably believed action was warranted by the facts. As for (1) and (2), undeniably, the hospital investigated Dr. Freilich\u2019s conduct for over two years, holding at least twelve hearings, and the investigation garnered enough evidence to support a reasonable belief that Dr. Freilich disrupt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>ed hospital caregivers with her unprofessional conduct. Moreover, Dr. Freilich provided no evidence that the Board did not act \u201cin the reasonable belief that the action was in the furtherance of quality health care[.]\u201d There is simply no evidence that the Board did not act in good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-4\">Nor has Dr. Freilich presented evidence capable of showing that the Board failed to make a \u201creasonable effort to obtain the facts.\u201d She argues that by failing to consider her reporting of substandard care, the Board demonstrated \u201ca deliberate ignorance of those important facts.\u201d Yet there is no indication that those facts were \u201cimportant,\u201d as they did not serve as the basis for the Board\u2019s decision. The Board had plenty of evidence supporting its decision to dismiss her based solely on the non-retaliatory complaints, her application for renewal, and her testimony during the investigation and hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">We decline to hold that simply because a physician can point to instances where hospital personnel, such as nurses, may have filed complaints against the physician in retaliation for the physician\u2019s complaints about substandard care, which complaints are included in evidence considered by the disciplinary body, the physician\u2019s claim survives the hospital\u2019s summary judgment motion under HCQIA \u2014 no matter how bad the physician\u2019s <em>other </em>conduct may be. Such a holding would unfairly undermine the protections offered by HCQIA, and unduly handcuff peers and hospital administrators who must assess complicated fact situations in the course of peer review or disciplinary action. In sum, although Dr. Freilich alleges retaliation generally, she has not connected it to the Board\u2019s decision to terminate her privileges. Thus, she has not produced evidence sufficient to convince a rational trier of fact that Harford failed to satisfy the standards for immunity set forth in HCQIA. Summary judgment is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-11\">.

Dr. Freilich also sued for declaratory and injunctive relief, but those claims are not before us. The question presented in Dr. Freilich\u2019s petition for <em>certiorari </em>deals only with HCQIA immunity, and HCQIA immunity applies only to claims for damages. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 11111(a); <em>see also Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., </em>308 F.3d 25, 44 (1st Cir.2002) (holding that \u201cFICQIA immunity only covers liability for damages\u201d). Dr. Freilich also failed to raise claims for declaratory and injunctive relief in her briefs. Therefore, even though Dr. Freilich\u2019s attorney mentioned the possibility of declaratory and injunctive relief during oral argument, those claims are not before us, and we will not disturb their disposition in the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b742-11\">.
