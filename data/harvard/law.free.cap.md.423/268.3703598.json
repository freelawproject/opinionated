The petition charged that the respondent violated Rules 3.3, Candor Toward the Tribunal<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and 8.4, Misconduct,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct, as adopted by Maryland Rule 16-812, and Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 8-606, \u201cMaking false entries in public record and related crimes,\u201d of the Criminal Law Article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>We referred the ease, pursuant to Rules 16-752(a),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to the Honorable Philip T. <em>Caroom, of </em>the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, for hearing pursuant to Rule 16-757(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Following the hearing, at which the petitioner and the respondent presented evidence and the respondent testified, Judge Caroom found facts by the clear and convincing standard, <em>see </em>Md. Rule 16 \u2014 757(b),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> from which he then drew conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>This disciplinary action had its genesis in litigation between divorced parties to resolve a dispute arising out of the sale of their former marital home. The respondent became involved in the litigation when McNamee, Hosea, Jernigan and Kim, the law firm at which the respondent then was an associate, was retained by a title insurance company to represent and protect the interests of the purchasers of that property, and he was assigned the representation. The litigation, which named, as defendants, his former wife, the purchasers and others, was initiated on behalf of the former husband by the complainant, Laura Penn Shanley, an attorney with whom the respondent had some history. He was, during law school, a law clerk at a law firm where Ms. Shanley was a young associate and \u201ctheir relations were not good.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Maintaining that, because the sale had been completed before suit was filed and, in any event, Ms. Shanley\u2019s client \u201cpreviously had executed a quit claim deed in favor of [his ex-wife, the seller],\u201d there was no basis for naming his clients in the litigation or the accompanying Notice of <em>Lis Pendens, </em>the respondent filed a motion to dismiss both. After speaking with the respondent, reviewing a copy of the contract of sale that the respondent provided at her request and discussing the matter with her client, Ms. Shanley \u201cagreed to dismiss [the respondent\u2019s clients] from the law suit.\u201d She faxed the respondent, accepting his offer to draft the stipulation of dismissal of the complaint as to the respondent\u2019s clients. More particularly, she advised him \u201cto dismiss all claims <em>against all parties except Ms. Lee (Valentin) </em>[, her client\u2019s former wife and the seller of the property,] and to terminate the <em>lis pendens.\u201d </em>The respondent, in response, prepared, as to his clients only, a \u201cStipulation of Dismissal\u201d and a \u201cNotice of Termination of <em>Lis Pendens,\u201d </em>which he faxed to Ms. Shan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>ley and the seller\u2019s counsel. Ms. Shanley modified the respondent\u2019s draft of the stipulation of dismissal, which she signed and, pointing out that she had modified, and how, his version, returned with the Notice of Termination of <em>Lis Pendens. </em>Her draft included in the title of the paper, in addition to the respondent\u2019s clients, all of the parties named in the complaint, \u201cincluding other parties who had been served but who had not yet answered,\u201d who also were included in the certificate of service. \u201cVisually, the two versions of the Stipulation of Dismissal were quite distinct. Respondent\u2019s was one page, other than its certificate of service, with the title, \u2018Stipulation of Dismissal\u2019 being only three words on a short single line; Shanley\u2019s had a four line title including 34 words and consisted of three pages including a certificate of service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The respondent filed his version of the Stipulation of Dismissal and Notice of Termination of <em>Lis Pendens, </em>cutting Ms. Shanley\u2019s signatures from the documents she signed and, using a photocopy machine, pasting them on a redline version of the ones he had prepared. \u201cHe testified that he looked at Shanley\u2019s fax of her draft of the stipulation and notice of termination \u2018not realizing\u2019 that these were any different from what he had faxed to Shanley.\u201d Ms. Shanley was named in the \u201cnormal certificate of service\u201d and, so, received a copy of what the respondent filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Although, as the parties stipulated, the respondent\u2019s clients were not actually prejudiced and, therefore, there was no need to correct the dismissal that the respondent filed, Ms. Shanley was upset that the respondent, without her permission, \u201cfile[d] his version of the \u2018Stipulation of Dismissal,\u2019 artificially attaching [her] signature to it.\u201d She believed her version was preferable because it \u201csimultaneously eliminatefd] all improper parties\u201d and \u201cavoid[ed] the possibility of confusion in the clerk\u2019s office.\u201d Ms. Shanley took her upset and displeasure to the respondent\u2019s supervising attorney, who, after a conference call, notable for the difficulties in communication occasioned by the arguments between the respondent and Ms. Shanley, decided to, and did, \u201ctake over\u201d the representation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>firm\u2019s clients, removing the respondent from the case. The respondent was terminated shortly thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">The hearing court also addressed the \u201cdisputed allegations and circumstantial inferences which relate to this matter.\u201d Those matters implicated the credibility of the respondent and the complainant. Thus, it found that the respondent \u201cintentionally ... scissor and taped Shanley\u2019s signature onto a paper which she had not authorized and approved pursuant to Rule l-311(b).\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In so finding, it rejected the respondent\u2019s prepetition assertions that he \u201chad authority\u201d to file the altered documents and his testimony that this was an innocent mistake, caused by his \u201cthinking that Shanley\u2019s draft of the Stipulation of dismissal was identical to his own.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">With regard to the former, the respondent told his supervising attorney, that he had left Ms. Shanley a voice mail message informing her that \u201c \u2018if he did not hear from her within 2 days, he would file the altered documents.\u2019 \u201d The hearing court found the evidence to the contrary to be more persuasive. It observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-6\">\u201cIn fact, Respondent\u2019s then-assistant, Ms. Jarboe testified that he had instructed her to mail the documents for filing immediately \u2014 without waiting for any response. Further, Shanley credibly testified that she never received any such voice mail from Respondent. In support of her testimony, the court received Shanley\u2019s meticulous phone records from the dates in question. (See exhibit 1, pages 23-30, reflecting a number of phone messages and calls about this incident, but not the phone message which Respondent unpersuasively testified he had left).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">The hearing court also found it significant that the respondent, during the conference call between Ms. Shanley, the respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>dent and the supervising attorney, berated Ms. Shanley, telling her, \u201cIt was not our job to correct your mistakes and we\u2019re not going to file a stipulation for the rest of your defendants and we\u2019re not going to pay for the filing fee.\u201d For this finding, the court again credited Ms. Shanley\u2019s, rather than the respondent\u2019s, testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As to the latter,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201c[The respondent] suggested that he did the cutting and taping without having read any of Shanley\u2019s documents and without having noticed the differences. He stated that his sole purpose in doing this was to satisfy the McNamee firm\u2019s custom of filing \u2018everything\u2019 on redline stationery. He also said he did this because he was aware that \u2018some judges, such as Judge Dudley whom [he] had clerked for\u2019 will reject faxed or photocopied signatures. He suggested that his intention was to \u2018make the document an original\u2019 by signing his side of the page.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Stating its belief that \u201cno reasonable attorney could avoid noticing the differences between Shanley\u2019s draft and Respondent\u2019s draft,\u201d the hearing court did not find the respondent\u2019s testimony on the point credible.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It noted, in that regard, \u201cif Respondent had failed to notice the difference between Shanley\u2019s document and his own, there would have been no genuine reason to make any alteration at all \u2014 he could simply have signed and filed Shanley\u2019s draft.\u201d This finding is reflective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>the court\u2019s view of the respondent\u2019s other explanation, that the cutting and pasting was necessary to comply with firm policy as to filing papers, that they be on the firm\u2019s redline paper. Observing that the original draft sent to Ms. Shanley was not prepared on redline paper and emphasizing that the supervising attorney indicated that the policy was \u201c \u2018generally to file everything on redline paper,\u201d the court found this explanation \u201cincredible as well.\u201d It concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-4\">\u201cThe court infers based on the clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent\u2019s reason for altering the stipulation of dismissal and filing it in the manner he did was his frustration and impatience with Shanley due to her potentially causing him extra work when he already had offered her the favor of preparing a dismissal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">On the other hand, the hearing court found that \u201cRespondent believed that he was justified in this Rule violation.\u201d It accepted his credibility on this point \u201cbecause: (1) Respondent\u2019s method of altering the document was so obvious that he could not have expected it to deceive anyone; and (2) Respondent promptly sent a copy of the obviously altered document to Shanley who could not fail to notice the unauthorized alteration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The hearing court concluded that the respondent committed only one of the charged rule and statutory violations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">\u201cAs to MRPC 8.4(d), the court does find that Respondent\u2019s conduct was \u2018prejudicial to the administration of justice\u2019 because: a) Respondent acted with a deliberate disregard of Rule l-311(b) when he purported to offer to the court a document which had been signed and approved by another attorney; in fact, that document was not approved by that attorney \u2014 even though she might have lacked a substantive basis to object to it; and b) respondent took this action without prior appropriate communication to opposing counsel under circumstances which Respondent had reason to believe would cause an unnecessary conflict with opposing counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>It compared that Rule and the circumstances of this case constituting its violation to Maryland Rule 3.4(c), pursuant to which a lawyer is precluded from \u201cknowingly disobeying] an obligation under the rules of a tribunal except for an open refusal based on an assertion that no valid obligation exists.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">No violation of Rule 8.4(b) was found because the court concluded that \u00a7 8-606 of the Maryland Code (2002) Criminal Law Article, on which it depended, was inapplicable in this situation. That statute, by its terms, applies to \u201cpublic records\u201d and, it determined, the paper the respondent filed became a \u201cpublic record\u201d only after it was filed; thus, when it was altered, it was a private document. As the hearing court had found, as a fact, that the respondent honestly believed he had a legal right to do what he did, and \u201cbecause no reasonable person could believe that someone would be \u201cdeceived\u201d by a document which plainly was irregular on it face,\u201d it rejected Bar Counsel\u2019s argument that, by altering the Stipulation of Dismissal, the respondent engaged in conduct involving \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit\u201d or misrepresentation. Interpreting the \u201cfalse statement of material fact or law\u201d that Maryland Rule 3.3 prohibits a lawyer from making to a tribunal as involving substantive representations, as opposed to \u201cprocedural matters involving documents\u2019 status as originals, copies or composites,\u201d the court exonerated the respondent of a violation of that Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">The hearing court determined that there were mitigating factors in this case. Most notably, it acknowledged the testimony of the two character witnesses called on the respondent\u2019s behalf. One of the named partners in the firm with which the respondent is associated, testified to hiring the respondent while the disciplinary matter was pending, and being impressed with his work habits. He also indicated that he is a very competent litigator, as to whom his only concern is his aggressiveness and combativeness, which he noticed seemed to be changing. The other character witness, who had known the respondent for the previous 4 to 5 months, spoke from his experience as a mentor of younger attorneys. He advised that he believed the respondent to be \u201c \u2018definitely one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>who could and should continue to practice law ... [and who] understands his error now, having had [extensive conversations] with himself and Tolzman on a number of occasions.\u201d Although the court concluded that it is \u201csomewhat blemished by his complete lack of candor with the tribunal during his defense in this matter,\u201d the respondent\u2019s expression of remorse \u2014 his assertion that he was \u201cabout as remorseful as [he] can be\u201d \u2014 was noted. In that regard, the respondent credits his Counseling/mentoring with John Gardner and his attendance at legal ethics programs. Concerning the fact that the respondent never apologized to Ms. Shanley, the court presented, and thus apparently accepted, his explanations, initially, that it was not done because the respondent and Ms. Shanley argued during the conference call and then he was taken off the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Bar Counsel takes no exceptions<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> to either the findings of fact made, or the conclusions of law drawn, by the hearing court. Not so the respondent. He \u201ctakes exception to the hearing judge\u2019s factual findings subsequent to the disputed \u2018Stipulation of Dismissal\u2019 Transaction.\u201d More particularly, he is concerned with the findings in paragraph 25, including its subparts. He argues that they are \u201cimmaterial to the charges filed against Respondent.\u201d In support of that argument, the respondent points out that he was charged only with engaging in misconduct related to the stipulation and, in confirmation, emphasizes that the hearing court said as much. He concludes, relying on Rule 16-751(c), <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Fezell, </em>361 Md. 234, 247, 760 A.2d 1108, 1114 (2000); <em>Attorney Griev. v. Alison, </em>349 Md. 623, 641, 709 A.2d 1212, 1221 (1998); <em>Bar Ass\u2019n of Balto. City v. Cockrell, </em>270 Md. 686, 692, 313 A.2d 816, 819 (1974), all relating to the sufficiency of a petition for disciplinary action \u201cto inform the respondent of any professional misconduct charged,\u201d that \u201cthe hearing judge erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>making findings of fact regarding matters for which Respondent has not been charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">We shall overrule the exception. We observe that the findings to which the respondent takes exceptions appear in the section of the court\u2019s findings captioned <em>\u201cAdditional findings as to disputed allegations and circumstantial evidence.\u201d </em>That section consists of two findings encapsulated in two \u201cparagraphs,\u201d 24 and 25. In Paragraph 24, although it finds that he acted intentionally, the court accepted the respondent\u2019s credibility in determining that he believed he was legally justified in altering the stipulation. The respondent, curiously, does not except to this finding even though, logically, it suffers from the same deficiency of those that follow. There is a reason that he does not object, as the finding states, in making it, the court was resolving a question of credibility necessary to the resolution of the disciplinary charges. What was at issue in the case was not what the respondent had done; rather, it was why he did it, with what intent or motive did he act? How the respondent accomplished the alteration, whether in a practiced way to avoid detection or as he did here, and whether and how he disclosed what he had done were pertinent to the determination of that intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">The same analysis applies to Paragraph 25. What the respondent did when confronted with the alteration and how he defended the disciplinary action brought as a result are relevant to a determination of his intent in, and justification for, making the alteration. Offering a justification on the basis of consent, when the evidence belies such a justification, is an appropriate factor to be considered when assessing credibility. So, too, is behavior that suggests that there is a reason, other than justification, premised on the other party\u2019s fault. Certainly, testimony that simply is not supported, and indeed is contradicted and, thus undermined, by the facts may be considered on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">There is, moreover, ample evidence to support the findings of fact made by the hearing court and, just as important, those factual findings justify the conclusions drawn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>from them. Exceptions will be overruled when the findings are not clearly erroneous. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. McCoy, </em>369 Md. 226, 235, 798 A.2d 1132, 1137 (2002). <em>See Attorney Griev.

Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 592-94, 911 A.2d 440, 443-45 (2006), Bar Counsel recommends, <em>see </em>Rule 16-758(b)(2),<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 90 days. This is an appropriate sanction, he submits, because, \u201c[ajlthough there was no immediate injury as a result of Respondent\u2019s misconduct, the trial court found that Respondent\u2019s conduct was both deliberate and intentional, and his assertion of remorse during trial [was] blemished by his lack of complete candor with the court.\u201d The respondent\u2019s time at the bar and his experience with the judicial system, <em>i.e., </em>serving as a law clerk to a circuit court judge, augurs in favor of the sanction, he continues, referencing the American Bar Association\u2019s sanction standards.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> One with that experience base, Bar Counsel maintains, \u201cshould know that cutting and pasting opposing counsel\u2019s signature, or anyone\u2019s signature, onto a document and filing same with the court is a violative conduct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The respondent also makes a recommendation as to sanction. He believes, however, that a public reprimand, rather than a period of suspension, is adequate to protect the public, the purpose of attorney discipline, citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Davis, </em>375 Md. 131, 167, 825 A.2d 430, 451 (2003) and <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Brown, </em>353 Md. 271, 295, 725 A.2d 1069, 1080 (1999), while not punishing the erring attorney. Conceding that his misconduct was serious, he notes that it also was \u201cprocedural in nature and reflected a communication breakdown amongst counsel.\u201d Such conduct, he admits, never should have occurred; problems between counsel, disagreements, could and should be resolved by counsel communicating with one another in a professional manner. Nevertheless, the respondent emphasizes that his conduct \u201cdoes not rise to the level of intentional lies and untruths.\u201d The respondent also finds it significant that his conduct did not change the disposition of the case for the parties on which he and Ms. Shanley were focused. Indeed, he points out, \u201cit has been stipulated that there was no actual prejudice to Respondent\u2019s clients and opposing counsel did not feel compelled to file any motion to correct the composite stipulation of dismissal filed by Respondent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">As important, the respondent submits that his case, the facts and circumstances, and the mitigation offered and proven, compares quite favorably with <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

Ironically, his affixing of signatures foisted more work onto himself; Respondent made timely good faith efforts to rectify consequences of his misconduct, to the extent that he was able before he taken off the case; Respondent gave a full and free disclosure to the disciplinary board and had a cooperative attitude toward the proceedings; Respondent, a member of the bar for four (4) years, was relatively inexperienced in the practice of law, especially in real property litigation, and was unsure \u2018how to handle the legal difficulties with the case when he was at the McNamee firm because he was \u201ctoo afraid to ask for help.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">And he proffers his mentorship with a 28 year veteran of the bar and his study of legal ethics. Moreover, the respondent maintains that he has already been sanctioned: \u201che lost his job with the McNamee firm and will forever have the stigma of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">It is well-settled that the purpose of disciplinary proceedings is to protect the public rather than to punish the erring attorney. <em>Attorney Griev.

Therefore, the public interest is served when sanctions designed to effect general and specific deterrence are imposed on an attorney who violates the disciplinary rules, <em>see Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. at 262-63, 619 A.2d at 105; <em>Attorney Griev.

Alison, </em>317 Md. 523, 540-41, 565 A.2d 660, 668 (1989), and those sanctions demonstrate to members of the legal profession the type of conduct that will not be tolerated. <em>Attorney Griev.

Comm\u2019n v. Pollack, </em>289 Md. 603, 609, 425 A.2d 1352, 1355 (1981). In that regard, in every case, we consider the nature of the ethical duties violated in light of any aggravating or mitigating circumstances. <em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 598-99, 911 A.2d at 447-48. The attorney\u2019s prior grievance history, as well as facts in mitigation, constitutes part of those facts and circumstances. <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoe</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number><em>bus, </em>276 Md. 353, 362, 347 A.2d 556, 561 (1975). We also look to our past cases involving attorney discipline when imposing sanctions. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Thompson, </em>376 Md. 500, 520, 830 A.2d 474, 486 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">To be sure, \u201ca persistent or more egregious course of conduct in violation of our disciplinary rules may lead to much more severe sanctions.\u201d <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>300 Md. 306, 314, 477 A.2d 1190, 1194 (1984). We have also recognized that an attorney\u2019s voluntary termination of the misconduct, accompanied by an appreciation of the serious impropriety of that past conduct and remorse for it, is evidence that the attorney will not hereafter engage in such unethical conduct if permitted to continue practice. <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Freedman, </em>285 Md. 298, 300, 402 A.2d 75, 76 (1979). The likelihood of repetition is a factor to be considered in determining the appropriate sanction. In <em>Freedman, </em>taking that factor into account resulted in a reprimand, rather than a suspension, as the Attorney Grievance Commission had urged. Of course, conduct that is an aberration can be so egregious as to warrant the imposition of a significant sanction. <em>Protokowicz, </em>329 Md. at 263, 619 A.2d at 105 (1993). Our approach to sanctioning attorneys is, thus, consistent with, and reflects, that recommended by American Bar Association\u2019s Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (ABA Standards). ABA Standards For Imposing Lawyer Sanctions 9.32 (1992); <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. 448, 488-89, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996). The four questions that ABA Standard 3.0, ABA Standards at 17, pose for the sanctioning court, <em>i.e., </em>\u201c(1) What is the nature of the ethical duty violated?; (2) What was the lawyer\u2019s mental state?; (3) What was the extent of the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer\u2019s misconduct?; and (4) Are there any aggravating or mitigating circumstances?,\u201d mirror many of the considerations herein above enumerated. Standard 9.32 prescribes other factors, <em>id. </em>at 41-42, that we agree are relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cAbsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>consequences of mis-conduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We shall hold that the appropriate sanction in this case is a reprimand. <em>See Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Mahone, </em>398 Md. 257, 269-270, 920 A.2d 458, 465 (2007); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v.

It involved an attorney found by the hearing court \u201cdeliberately and intentionally, and not negligently,\u201d 379 Md. at 510, 842 A.2d at 766, to have violated, <em>inter alia, </em>Rules 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4(d), by misrepresenting to the trial court (1) that he had filed a set of interrogatories, which were never answered when, in fact, he never filed those interrogatories; (2) that he had not received requested documents from opposing counsel in response to discovery when, in fact, he had received those documents; and (3) that a pre-trial protective order entered by a motions judge had precluded him from conducting discovery when, in fact, the order was a limited one and did not preclude him from conducting discovery. 379 Md. at 509-510, 842 A.2d at 765-66. This Court did not accept the findings that Hermina deliberately and intentionally misled the judge in asserting that he had filed a set of interrogatories or that he misrepresented that he had not received certain requested discovery from opposing counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 514-16, 842 A.2d at 768-69. On the other hand, we</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_l\">\u201cconcluded that Hermina violated MRPC Rules 3.3(a)(1) by misrepresenting the content and effect of Judge Rupp\u2019s pretrial protective order and falsely claiming that he had been precluded from conducting discovery, 3.4(c) by failing to respond to discovery requests and by failing to participate in the pre-trial conference and cooperate in preparing a joint pre-trial statement, and 8.2 by recklessly accusing Judge Kavanaugh of participating in an inappropriate ex parte conference. Those conclusions suffice to establish a violation of MRPC 8.4(a), (c), and (d) as well.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 521, 842 A.2d at 772. Nevertheless, under all of the circumstances, including the absence of any prior misconduct and Hermina\u2019s commendable <em>pro bono </em>activities, this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>determined the appropriate sanction for Hermina\u2019s misconduct to be a reprimand. <em>Id. </em>at 522, 842 A.2d at 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">In <em>Stancil, </em>the respondent attorney was found by the hearing court to have violated DR 2-110(B)(4) (predecessor of Rule 1.16), by failing to withdraw when discharged by his former client, DR 1-102(A)(4) (predecessor of Rule 8.4(c)), and DR 1-102(A)(5) (predecessor to Rule 8.4(d)) by misrepresenting the true nature of payments he made to his former client and paying that former client $1,400 to discourage him from filing a complaint with The Commission. 296 Md. at 329, 463 A.2d at 790-91. This Court sustained the Rule violations, but rejected the sanction recommendation of suspension, instead imposing a reprimand. We explained that Stancil\u2019s misconduct was mitigated by the fact that, at the time of the violations, he was subjected to considerable harassment by his client, and we concluded that the primary motivation for making the $1,400 payment, rather than to avoid a disciplinary proceeding, may have been to compromise the client\u2019s civil claim against him, thus avoiding further harassment by the client, and protecting his standing in the community. <em>Id. </em>at 332-33, 463 A.2d at 792. Citing, in addition, Stancil\u2019s spotless 10-year reputation as an attorney and the lack of any evidence to show that the client had suffered any harm as a result of Stancil\u2019s violations, <em>id. </em>at 333, 463 A.2d at 792, the Court stated \u201cthat under certain circumstances a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction when an attorney has been found to have violated various disciplinary rules, including [8.4(c) and (d) ].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 331, 463 A.2d at 791.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">As indicated, the violations in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>in addition to the then equivalent of Rule 8.4(d), included two others, the predecessors to Rules 8.4(b) and (c), more directly implicating his honesty and fitness to practice. In arriving at the appropriate sanction in that case, the Court was persuaded by the facts that the attorney was a neophyte, the misrepresentations and his admission to lying occurred on the same day, and thereafter he expressed contrition. <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. at 55-56, 400 A.2d at 417-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The cases cited by Bar Counsel in support of the recommended 90 day suspension are all distinguishable from the present case and involved more egregious misconduct. Therefore, they are not impediments to the reprimand sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Professing not to be able to find cases directly on point, ie., cases in which both a violation of Rule 3.3(a) and Rule 8.4(d) were found, he relies on cases in which, in addition to the Rule 8.4(d) violation, there is another Rule 8.4 violation, in each case Rule 8.4(c). These cases are apposite, Bar Counsel submits, for the reason that, \u201cthey are similar to the case at issue because they all consist of intentional and/or deliberate conduct in submitting a document with a false or forged signature.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">To be sure, this Court, over time, has become \u201c \u2018much less lenient toward any misconduct involving theft, misappropriation, fraud, or deceit.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Griev.

Our analysis, as our discussion confirmed, made clear that what the appropriate sanction should be was dependent on the nature, level and objective of the fraud or deceit. <em>Gordon, </em>413 Md. at 57, 991 A.2d at 57.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>In <em>Babbitt, </em>300 Md. at 640, 479 A.2d at 1374, the misconduct was the falsification of a Calvert County Use and Occupancy Permit. Obtaining the permit was a prerequisite to the securing of a home construction loan and the responsibility of the attorney, who had failed to secure it before the settlement. <em>Id. </em>at 639, 479 A.2d at 1374. Sustaining findings that he violated Rules 3.3(a) and 8.4(d), the Court imposed a 60-day suspension, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-5\">\u201cThe Respondent, by his own admission, was responsible for the creation of the Permit as part of the settlement documents in the [client] transaction. Though no direct monetary benefit inured to the Respondent as a result of the settlement, the bogus Permit did in fact mislead the Lender, the [client], and the settlement attorney into believing that all conditions precedent to settlement and closing were met.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 641, 479 A.2d at 1375. These facts are very different from those of this case. Here, the respondent and Ms. Shanley agreed to the terms of the Dismissal as to the respondent\u2019s clients and his misconduct did not have any adverse impact on the rights of any other parties to the litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">The attorney\u2019s misconduct in <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Maxwell, </em>307 Md. 600, 516 A.2d 570 (1986), was the delivery of a deed, which he notarized, to his client\u2019s bail bondsman with the signature of \u201cRonald Jaxson,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 602, 528 A.2d at 571, when, in fact, \u201cRonald Jaxson\u201d did not exist, and the attorney had witnessed one of his clients sign the deed in that name. <em>Id. </em>at 602-603, 516 A.2d at 571. This constituted violations of the Disciplinary Rules prohibiting the making of a false statement of law or fact and engaging in conduct involving dishon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>esty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation, the predecessor to Rule 8.4(c), for which the Court imposed a 90 day suspension. Although the attorney\u2019s behavior was not necessarily self-serving or profitable, the misrepresentation was made in order to obtain something that otherwise would have been unobtainable \u2014 bond for his client. <em>Id. </em>Again, that is not this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The Petitioner last cites <em>Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. at 592-94, 911 A.2d at 443-45. There, an attorney was suspended after he forged his wife\u2019s signature on an MVA Gift Certification form, in order to avoid paying tax on the vehicle and having it inspected. The Court noted that, \u201c[although the financial incentive to use [the] Gift Certification form was minimal, Respondent was nevertheless attempting to avoid paying the <em>5% </em>sales tax and having the vehicle inspected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 594, 911 A.2d at 445. His attempt to deceive the MVA for personal benefit was clear; here, however, we simply do not have that same clear intent to deceive.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In the present case, the hearing court determined, indeed, it was stipulated, that the respondent\u2019s misconduct did not prejudice and was not detrimental to his clients, and while his alteration of the stipulation was intentional, he honestly believed that he was legally authorized to do so. In that respect, the respondent\u2019s misconduct was not willful. Moreover, his motivation for the alteration was not fraudulent. He did not benefit in any way from his actions. In fact, the respondent lost his job as a result. In addition, we consider whether the attorney showed remorse for his misconduct and whether the conduct is likely to be repeated and whether the attorney has a prior history of disciplinary matters. <em>Attorney Gviev. Comm\u2019n v. Hill, </em>398 Md. 95, 103, 919 A.2d 1194, 1198 (2007). Albeit \u201csomewhat blemished,\u201d the court determined the respondent has expressed remorse for his misconduct. In addition, the respondent has taken it upon himself to seek rehabilitation through ethics counseling with both John Gardner, Esquire, a member of the bar for 28 years, and his current employer, Le Viness, Tolzman and Hamilton, P.A. The respondent, in the words of one of his mentors, John Gardner, is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u201cdefinitely one who could and should continue to practice law. He understands his error now, having had extensive discussions with [me] and [Mr.] Tolzman on a number of occasions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">These remedial actions dramatically reduce the likelihood that the conduct will be repeated. Additionally, Respondent has no record of any prior disciplinary action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The petitioner makes the point, with which we fully agree, that the misconduct in this case is serious. From that premise, it concludes the period of suspension it recommends is not simply justified, but required for the protection of the public. We do not agree. A reprimand under the circumstances <em>sub judice </em>will protect the public and also impress upon the respondent the seriousness of the misconduct in which he engaged. <em>See Mahone, </em>398 Md. at 269-270, 920 A.2d at 465; <em>Attorney Griev.

But, on the merits of the sanctioning decision, it is very different from the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Gordon, </em>the attorney falsified signatures, but in a way indicating that the misrepresentation that resulted was at a level and for a purpose much different that the alteration made by the respondent. At the summary judgment stage of a contract action, in which a material issue was whether his client signed the contract, Gordon submitted what appeared to be an original signature page signed by his client in the year 2000, <em>id. </em>at 50, 991 A.2d at 53, but was actually a signature page that had been signed by the client the night before. <em>Id. </em>Gordon did not inform the other party or the court of the misrepresentation until they had found the original signature page, after he had filed pleadings falsely suggesting that the document was the original signature page. <em>Id. </em>at 51, 991 A.2d at 53-54.

Whether Respondent intended to deceive the other attorney or not, he deceived the court when he presented a document that falsely purported to be signed by opposing counsel. This deserves more than a slap on the wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The AGC characterizes Respondent\u2019s conduct as \u201cthe cutting and pasting of a signature onto a document filed with the court without the authority or knowledge of the signatory,\u201d and points to the Circuit Court\u2019s finding of a violation of Maryland Rule 8.4(d). The Majority reports that the AGC argues that this misconduct is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-6\">serious[,] and relying on cases in which the falsification of documents resulted in a sanction of suspension from practice, <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Babbitt, </em>300 Md. 637, 642, 479 A.2d 1372, 1375 (1984); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Maxwell, </em>307 Md. 600, 516 A.2d 570 (1986); <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Sweitzer, </em>395 Md. 586, 592-94, 911 A.2d 440, 443-45 (2006), [recommends] that the respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 90 days.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">(Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Majority Op. at 281, 31 A.3d at 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Although conceding that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was serious, the Majority characterizes it as \u201cprocedural in nature and reflecting] a communication breakdown amongst counsel.\u201d Maj. Op. at 282, 31 A.3d at 520. I have searched for and not found any cases recognizing a \u201cprocedural forgery.\u201d A forgery by any other name is still a forgery. The document Respondent filed with the court was never seen or approved by Laura Penn Shanley, and she was chagrined when she learned that her \u201csignature\u201d appeared on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">Citing <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Hermina, </em>379 Md. 503, 510, 522, 842 A.2d 762, 766, 773 (2004) and two decades-old <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>cases, the Majority concludes that a reprimand is a sufficient discipline. With respect to the older cases, the Majority cannot help but concede, however, that \u201cthis Court, over time, has become \u2018much less lenient toward any misconduct involving theft, misappropriation, fraud, or deceit.\u2019 <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Gordon, </em>413 Md. 46, 57, 991 A.2d 51, 57 (2010) (quoting <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Weiss, </em>389 Md. 531, 551, 886 A.2d 606, 617 (2005))\u201d (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The Majority analyzes <em>Hermina </em>as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-5\">Nevertheless, under all of the circumstances, including the absence of any prior misconduct and Hermina\u2019s commendable <em>pro bono </em>activities, this Court determined the appropriate sanction for Hermina\u2019s misconduct to be a reprimand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJBJ\">In contrast to <em>Hermina, </em>the Majority points to no commendable pro bono activities performed by Respondent. The Majority does not say much about Respondent in mitigation, as there is not much to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-6\">The [Rjespondent, in the words of one of his mentors, John Gardner, is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-7\">\u201cdefinitely one who could and should continue to practice law. He understands his error now, having had extensive discussions with [me and a named partner at his employing firm] on a number of occasions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">These remedial actions dramatically reduce the likelihood that the conduct will be repeated. Additionally, Respondent has no record of any prior disciplinary action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Maj. Op. at 292-93, 31 A.3d at 527. Several discussions with his new boss cannot fairly be said to \u201cdramatically reduce the likelihood that the conduct will be repeated,\u201d as the majority concludes. Nor can losing one job and finding another. This conduct was intentional misrepresentation to a court utilizing a forged document which, undeniably, violated Section 8.4(d). To impose only a reprimand for such conduct fails to protect the public, because it diminishes the high standards we have held attorneys to with respect to honesty and accuracy of the documents they file in court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-10\">The Majority concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>The petitioner makes the point, with which we fully agree, that the misconduct in this case is serious. From that premise, it concludes the period of suspension it recommends is not simply justified, but required for the protection of the public. We do not agree. A reprimand under the circumstances <em>sub judice </em>will protect the public and also impress upon the respondent the seriousness of the misconduct in which he engaged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Maj. Op. at 293, 31 A.3d at 527. I submit that filing a forged document with the court, whether' in a fit of pique at the other attorney or sheer aggressive behavior, is not to be so easily forgiven.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In conclusion, I dissent from the Majority\u2019s imposition of only a reprimand, and agree with Bar Counsel\u2019s recommendation that the Respondent be suspended from the practice of law for 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Judge BATTAGLIA and Judge BARBERA authorize me to state that they join in the views expressed in this dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
