I\u2019ve been sitting back hearing all that\u2019s going on and not saying a word. Now all the bullshit stops here with your ex. I\u2019ve decided to write to you first instead of getting my people involved. I\u2019m pretty sure you know who I run with. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t give a fuck about you, your man, or your family. All I care about is Marshall. Now to the point, If [sic] your man keeps talking shit to my brother he is then going to have a big problem with me and trust me \u2014 he nor you want that. Don\u2019t get it twisted don\u2019t think for a second that I can\u2019t do much because I\u2019m in prison. I\u2019ve got plenty of soldiers on the street ready to put in work. So all these games you little kids are playing stops at this. I\u2019m gonna close with telling you that I don\u2019t give a damn who you show this letter to mom, Dad, police, who ever. It won\u2019t stop what I\u2019m telling you. Everything will be fine as long as you and your man leaves my little brother <em>alone. </em>If not there will be no more words about this.

Below the signature was a triangle inside of which were the numbers 4-13-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">Sheryl received Petitioner\u2019s letter on January 30, 2008, and turned it over to the State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County. On February 8, 2008, in the District Court of Maryland for Caroline County, the State\u2019s Attorney filed a two count charging document that contained the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-11\">\n<em>COUNT 1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">(Retaliate-Witness)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-12\">Penalty: 5 Years &amp;/or $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>[The] State\u2019s Attorney for Caroline County, upon information, does present that Matthew Wayne Tracy, on or about January 30, 2008 at or near 26927 Boyce Mill Road, Greensboro, Caroline County, Maryland, ... did intentionally threaten to harm with the intent of retaliating against Sheryl [ ], a witness for giving testimony in an official proceeding, contrary to (Article CR, Section 9.303) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-5\">COUNT 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-6\">(Intimidate/Influence Juror)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-7\">Penalty: 5 Years &amp;/or $5,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b52-8\">And the State\u2019s Attorney aforesaid, does further present that Matthew Wayne Tracy, on or about January 30, 2008 at or near 26927 Boyce Mill Road, Greensboro, Caroline County, Maryland, ... did by threat endeavor to influence and/or impede Sheryl [ ], a witness, in the discharge of her official duty, contrary to (Article CR, Section 9.305.(a)) of the Annotated Code of Maryland, and against the peace, government and dignity of the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-9\">(Emphasis in original). As a result of Petitioner\u2019s prayer for a jury trial, his case was transferred to the Circuit Court for Caroline County, where a jury convicted him of both charges. For the conviction on Count 1, the Circuit Court imposed a sentence of 5 years to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction, all of which was suspended. For the conviction on Count 2, the Circuit Court imposed a 4 year sentence to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction, consecutive to any sentence that Petitioner (1) was then serving, and (2) had received but was not yet serving. No portion of that sentence was suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-10\">After the judgments entered on those verdicts were affirmed by the Court of Special Appeals in an unreported opinion, Petitioner filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, in which he presented two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>1. Is the evidence sufficient to support conviction under either statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-4\">2. Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the evidence is sufficient, was it improper to convict Petitioner under both statutes for the single act of writing a letter suggesting a threat of harm if the witness gave harmful testimony in a pending case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">This Court granted the petition. 414 Md. 330, 995 A.2d 296 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the holding of the Court of Special Appeals that the State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that Petitioner violated \u00a7 9-305(a) of the Criminal Law Article. We shall also hold, however, that the threat, \u201cI will have you harmed <em>if </em>you testify\u201d is proscribed by CL \u00a7 9-302 rather than by CL \u00a7 9-303. We shall therefore reverse the judgment affirming Petitioner\u2019s conviction on Count 1. In light of these holdings, Petitioner\u2019s second question is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">The State\u2019s case against Petitioner included the following written STIPULATIONS OF FACT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-10\">1) There were criminal charges filed on behalf of Sheryl [ ] against Marshall Ebling in the District Court of Maryland for Caroline County, Case No. 3J16341, on or about December 13, 2007. This case was disposed of by plea on February 11, 2008.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-11\">2) The Defendant, Matthew Tracy:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-12\">a) is Marshall Ebling\u2019s half-brother;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-13\">b) was incarcerated in the Western Correctional Institute, a facility of Maryland Department of Corrections, at all times pertinent to this case and specifically on January 28, 2008;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-14\">c) was at the time a validated member of the gang known as \u201cDead Man Incorporated\u201d and bears a tattoo evidencing this status;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-15\">d) on or about December 28, 2007 wrote and mailed the letter at issue herein to Sheryl [] from the Western Correctional Institute;.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>3) Detective Patrick Word is acknowledged as an expert on gangs and gang related activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s opening statement included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-7\">This whole case is about a letter. [Petitioner] is incarcerated in the Department of Corrections.... During the Fall of 2007 [Sheryl], who you saw earlier, and you will hear from, was dating [Petitioner\u2019s] half-brother, Marshall Ebling. That relationship ended badly on December 12th of 2007. As a result, of that bad ending, a criminal case was filed against Mr. Ebling in which [Sheryl] was the complainant and the victim. That case was resolved by Mr. Ebling\u2019s guilty plea on February 11, 2008. So the window of time we are dealing with is from December 12th through February 11, 2008. [Petitioner] wrote [Sheryl] a letter. You will get to read that letter. And that letter contains statements, again, which you will have in front of you in the jury room, which the State considers an attempt to intimidate or influence or impede [Sheryl\u2019s] participation in a criminal case against [Petitioner\u2019s] half brother. It also considers that letter a threat to retaliate against [Sheryl], if she goes forward with participating in the case against [Petitioner\u2019s] half brother. And that\u2019s what this case is about. That letter. So please pay attention to that. That case that I was referring to was filed on December 13th, 2007, the day after the fight that broke up the relationship between Mr. Ebling and [Sheryl]. The letter that you are going to see is dated January 3rd, I\u2019m sorry, December 28th, 2007, two days later, and before the trial date in February of 2008. And that\u2019s really .... at this point that\u2019s all I can tell you. That\u2019s what you are going to have to focus on, that letter and the testimony from the witnesses here. And its your judgment as to whether that letter was a threat to retaliate, or an attempt to influence [Sheryl].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">(Emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">The jury received undisputed evidence that Ebling had been arrested after Sheryl notified the police that he had broken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>her car\u2019s windshield, and the criminal charges arising out of that incident were scheduled for trial on February 11, 2008. Sheryl testified that, in January of 2008, Ebling told her that she would be \u201cgetting a letter.\u201d Ebling testified that (1) no such conversation took place, (2) he had never told Petitioner about his upcoming trial, and (3) in a telephone conversation, he had told Petitioner about threats he had received from a neighbor named \u201cJoey.\u201d According to Ebling, Petitioner wrote the letter to put a stop to those threats.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">The following transpired during Detective Word\u2019s direct examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">Q: Now, Detective Word, you are familiar with [the above quoted letter] marked Exhibit 1A earlier?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">A: I am. Yes, I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">Q: ... Detective going through the letter from top to bottom, can you identify areas which you perceive to be gang-related or ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">A. I do, actually there are several that I\u2019ve had a chance to review and make notes on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-11\">Q: Okay. Let\u2019s deal with the ... in line items. I\u2019ll direct your attention to the sentence I\u2019ve decided to write to you first instead of getting my people involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-12\">A: Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-13\">Q: Now, reference to my people, what would, based on your experience and knowledge of gang activities, what would that be in reference to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-14\">A: My opinion is, and based on my experience, that that would be a reference to his particular gang which is DMI. Q: And further down the letter, the reference in the words you know who I run with.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-15\">A: Yes, also another reference to his gang, DMI.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-16\">Q: Further down from that, and Your Honor, I apologize to the jury in Court in advance, but I am going to read this verbatim. I don\u2019t give a fuck about you, your mom, or your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>family. All I care about is Marshall. That focuses on the specific individual?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">A: It ... it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Q: Further down, don\u2019t get twisted. Don\u2019t think for a second that I can\u2019t do much because I am in prison. I\u2019ve got plenty of soldiers on the street ready to put in work.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">A: Put in work is definitely a gang reference.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Q: I think the question, Detective was specifically ready to put in work is a reference to one member asking another to do a specific action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">A: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">Q: And there are no limitations on that action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">A: No, there are not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-12\">Q: Then, subsequent to that, so all these games you little kids are playing stops at this; Is that consistent with the language that went before in terms of requiring a specific action?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">A: My Opinion based on my experience, yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-14\">Q: Subsequent to that, I am going to close by telling you that I don\u2019t give a damn who you show this letter to mom, dad, police, whoever, it won\u2019t stop what I am telling you. A: Also a specific gang reference relating back to the putting in work and the uh, threatening nature of the letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-15\">Q: Further down, everything will be fine as long as you, and your man leaves my little brother alone. If not, there will be no more words about this. I hope you picked the right thing to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-16\">A: That\u2019s correct, also, very, based on my opinion and experience, also goes to the threatening nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-17\">The following transpired during Detective Word\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Q: If ... if Mr. Tracy was acting so lawlessly, and I remember the DMI as you had ... Dead Man Incorporated, why wouldn\u2019t he just come out and say don\u2019t testify against my brother?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">A: Well, I can\u2019t answer I don\u2019t know what was in his mind when he wrote this. Reading it on its face, he is a DMI member, he\u2019s self-admitted to DMI. Actually, if he\u2019s not threatening somebody, he\u2019s ... he\u2019s publicly proclaiming that he is DMI. And he\u2019s certainly at risk of violating DMI rules if he comes into Court and either denounces, or through a letter denounces any of his membership. It\u2019s the threatening nature of the letter which, in my opinion is, shows that he is ... is operating within the gang rules. Q: Well, what I am saying is, wouldn\u2019t he just make a threat? I mean it\u2019s ... it\u2019s pretty innocuous as a threat. Wouldn\u2019t he say I want you to do X or stop doing X? A: I can\u2019t say ... I can\u2019t testify as to why he didn\u2019t use those ... those specific words, other than the fact that most correctional inmates know that their mail is reviewed and scanned, and if a corrections officer didn\u2019t pick this up or see this as a threat, doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that it\u2019s not a threat. A lot of their mail is ... is coded, and information that goes to the outside to other gang members, or to somebody who is receiving an intimidating or threatening letter would be coded. And sometime\u2019s it\u2019s difficult for correction officers on the inside to necessarily pick up those codes. Law enforcement professionals and other corrections intelligence officers are able to pick up those coded messages, decode them, and provide that information either to investigators or prosecutors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">As noted above, the jury convicted Petitioner of both Count 1 and Count 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The State\u2019s case against Petitioner proceeded on the theory that, by writing the above quoted letter to Sheryl, Petitioner intended to in essence \u201cchase her off the witness stand.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s argument that the evidence was insuffi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>cient to prove that theory is controlled by <em>Smith v. State, </em>415 Md. 174, 999 A.2d 986 (2010), in which this Court affirmed a possession of marijuana conviction. In that case, officers executing a search warrant \u2014 at a residence of another person \u2014 found the petitioner and four other individuals seated at a table in the center of which was an ashtray that contained a burning marijuana \u201cblunt.\u201d While rejecting the petitioner\u2019s arguments that his \u201cmere presence\u201d in the vicinity of the blunt was insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that he exercised any \u201cdominion or control over the blunt,\u201d this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">We stated in <em>State v. Smith, </em>374 Md. 527, 534, 823 A.2d 664, 668 (2003), that the finder of fact has the \u201cability to choose among differing inferences that might possibly be made from a factual situation.... \u201d That is the fact-finder\u2019s role, not that of an appellate court. Professor Douglas Lind explains that \u201c[t]he term \u2018inference\u2019 refers to the logical process that takes place when, within the context of a group of propositions (i.e., an \u2018argument\u2019), one proposition (the \u2018conclusion\u2019) is arrived at and affirmed on the basis of other propositions (the \u2018premises\u2019) that are accepted at the beginning point of the process.\u201d Douglas Lind, <em>Logic and Legal Reasoning </em>4-5 (2001). In other words, \u201c[a]n inference is a factual conclusion that can rationally be drawn from other facts.\u201d Clifford S. Fishman, <em>Jones on Evidence </em>\u00a7 4:1 (7th ed. 1992 &amp; Supp.2009-2010). \u201cIf fact A rationally supports the conclusion that fact B is also true, then B may be inferred from A.\u201d <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">We do not second-guess the jury\u2019s determination where there are competing rational inferences available. We give deference \u201cin that regard to the inferences that a fact-finder may draw.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 534, 823 A.2d at 668. In <em>Smith, </em>we relied on language from a Washington case, <em>State v. Bencivenga, </em>137 Wash.2d 703, 974 P.2d 832 (1999), where evidence of a defendant\u2019s intent was at issue. The Washington Supreme Court opined that</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">[njothing forbids a jury, or a judge, from logically inferring intent from proven facts, so long as it is satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>that the state has proved that intent beyond a reasonable doubt. An essential function of the fact finder is to discount theories which it determines unreasonable because the finder of fact is the sole and exclusive judge of the evidence, the weight to be given thereto, and the credibility of witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 834-35 (citations omitted). We need not decide whether the jury could have drawn other inferences from the evidence, refused to draw inferences, or whether we would have drawn different inferences from the evidence. <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 557, 823 A.2d at 682.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Accordingly, the proper standard of review to be applied here is that set forth in <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), where the U.S. Supreme Court stated that \u201cthe critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction ... is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318-19, 99 S.Ct. at 2788-89, (emphasis in original). <em>See also Allen v. State, </em>402 Md. 59, 76-77, 935 A.2d 421, 431 (2007) (\u201c[W]e review a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a jury trial by determining whether the evidence, viewed in a light most favorable to the prosecution, supported the conviction ..., such that any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 533, 823 A.2d at 668 (2003) (\u201cThe standard for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency, is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>Moye </em>[v. <em>State], </em>369 Md. [2] at 12, 796 A.2d [821] at 827 (2002) (\u201cThe standard for appellate review of evidentiary sufficiency is whether any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>State v. Albrecht, </em>336 Md. 475, 478, 649 A.2d 336, 337 (1994) (citations omitted) (\u201c[W]e review the evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the light most favorable to the State, giving due regard to the trial court\u2019s finding of facts, its resolution of conflicting evidence, and, significantly, its opportunity to observe and assess the credibility of -witnesses.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">It is not our role to retry the case. <em>Allen, </em>402 Md. at 77, 935 A.2d at 431; <em>Taylor [v. State], </em>346 Md. [452] at 457, 697 A.2d [462] at 465 [(1997)]. Because the fact-finder possesses the unique opportunity to view the evidence and to observe first-hand the demeanor and to assess the credibility of witnesses during their live testimony, we do not reweigh the credibility of witnesses or attempt to resolve any conflicts in the evidence. <em>Tarray v. State, </em>410 Md. 594, 608, 979 A.2d 729, 737 (2009); <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 533-34, 823 A.2d at 668. We defer to the jury\u2019s inferences and determine whether they are supported by the evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 557, 823 A.2d at 682.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-6\">That standard applies to all criminal cases, regardless of whether the conviction rests upon direct evidence, a mixture of direct and circumstantial, or circumstantial evidence alone. <em>Smith, </em>374 Md. at 534, 823 A.2d at 668.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 183-5, 999 A.2d at 990-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">As to Petitioner\u2019s argument that his letter <em>might </em>have been written with the intent to protect his half brother from harassment rather than with the intent to torpedo a pending criminal case, in <em>Dixon v. State, </em>302 Md. 447, 455, 488 A.2d 962 (1985), this Court quoted with approval the following \u201csufficiency\u201d analysis set forth in <em>Cooper v. State, </em>220 Md. 183, 152 A.2d 120 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">The question is not whether we <em>might </em>have reached a different conclusion from that of the trial court, but whether the trial court had before it sufficient evidence upon which it could fairly be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt of the defendant\u2019s guilt of the offense charged[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 192, 152 A.2d at 124.

We must therefore determine whether that conduct constituted a violation of CL \u00a7 9-303 and/or CL \u00a7 9-305. The statutes at issue in the case at bar are included in the <em>\u201cObstructing Justice </em>\u201d subtitle (Subtitle 3) of the Criminal Law Article, and both were amended in 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">CL \u00a7 9-305</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Preventing \u201cthe due execution of justice, as by interfering with witnesses,\u201d was a common law misdemeanor.

Intimidating or corrupting juror, states,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">(a) <em>Prohibited. </em>\u2014 A person may not, by threat, force, or corrupt means, try to influence, intimidate, or impede a juror, a witness, or an officer of a court of the State or of the United States in the performance of the person\u2019s official duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">(b) Penalty. \u2014 A person who violates this section is guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction is subject to impris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>onment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $10,000 or both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">A \u201cwitness,\u201d as that term is defined in CL \u00a7 9-301,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has an \u201cofficial duty\u201d to testify truthfully when he or she has been <em>served </em>with a subpoena issued under the authority of a court of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">The theory of Petitioner\u2019s case was that he did not write the letter with the intent \u201cto influence, intimidate, or impede\u201d Sheryl. The closing argument of Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel included the following comments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">I told you that this case would come down to two questions, two questions that you basically have to answer. The first and foremost is whether my client, Mr. Tracy had knowledge of the proceedings against his brother. After all, how can you threaten somebody or retaliate against them by testifying in a case that you have no knowledge of.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">The State didn\u2019t bring any witnesses in here to say, to make the link between my client and the proceedings facing his brother. Also, I indicated that the second question that we\u2019d need to ask that would be up to you is whether, if there was a threat, whether that threat was an intent to retaliate or whether it was ... had an intent to intimidate and influence [Sheryl], It\u2019s not enough that simply because [Sheryl] is a witness in a crime, or that ... that nobody can make a threat ... threat against her. No, that threat has to be specifically targeted to insure that she won\u2019t testify, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>to intimidate her against testifying, and that\u2019s simply not the case here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">Mr. Tracy is not here for making ... for writing an inappropriate letter. What he\u2019s here for is intimidating, influencing, or impeding a witness. There\u2019s been no evidence that he made a threat to [Sheryl] that, in order for her not to testify, to appear to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Petitioner now argues that he is entitled to a reversal of his conviction under Count 2 because the State did not produce evidence that Sheryl had been served with a subpoena to testify in District Court Case No. 3J16341. While we do have discretion to review \u201cunpreserved\u201d arguments, we decline to consider this one. Had Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal on the ground that the State had failed to establish that Sheryl had been subpoenaed to testify as a State\u2019s witness in the case of <em>State v. Marshall Ebling, </em>the State could have requested \u201cleave to reopen its ease-in-chief\u201d to produce that evidence. Because this \u201csufficiency\u201d argument was not made at a time when the Circuit Court could have exercised discretion to permit the State to reopen its case-in-chief, we shall not review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">CL \u00a7 9-303</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">It is clear that in Count 1 of the charging document, Petitioner was charged with threatening to harm Sheryl <em>if she </em>testified for the State in the case of <em>State v. Marshall Ebling, </em>rather than <em>because </em>she had reported Ebling\u2019s past criminal conduct. Petitioner now argues that his conviction under CL \u00a7 9-303 must be reversed because that statute does not proscribe threats uttered with the intent to prevent a victim or witness from taking action in the future. Although this argument was not presented to the Circuit Court, for the reasons stated in <em>Moosavi v. State, </em>355 Md. 651, 662-63, 736 A.2d 285, 291 (1999), we shall exercise our discretion to determine the relationship between CL \u00a7 9-302 and CL \u00a7 9-303.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>It is clear from an examination of the statutes enacted to protect victims and potential witnesses that the General Assembly intended that those persons be protected against two types of verbal and nonverbal criminal conduct: (1) conduct undertaken with the intent to retaliate against a person who <em>has </em>reported a crime, or <em>has given </em>testimony in a criminal case, and (2) conduct undertaken with the intent to prevent a victim or witness from reporting a crime that he or she has not yet reported and/or to prevent a victim or witness for testifying in a proceeding that has not yet taken place. From our review of the applicable statutes and the relevant legislative history, we conclude as follows: The threat, \u201cI will harm you <em>because </em>you reported a crime\u201d is proscribed by CL \u00a7 9-303(a)(2). The threat, \u201cI will harm you <em>because </em>you testified\u201d is proscribed by CL \u00a7 9-303(a)(l). The threat, \u201cI will harm you <em>if </em>you report the crime\u201d is proscribed by CL \u00a7 9-302(a)(2)(iii). The threat, \u201cI will harm you <em>if </em>you testify\u201d is proscribed by CL \u00a7 9-302(a)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">CL \u00a7 9-302 and CL \u00a7 9-303 were originally enacted by the same piece of legislation \u2014 Senate Bill (SB) 261, Chapter 223 Acts of 1993. The legislative history of SB 261 includes the following testimony from the Honorable Alexander Williams Jr., then the State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_\">.... Murders and other violence, much of it related to drug trafficking, has continued to increase not only in our county but also in other areas of the State \u2014 particularly Baltimore City. Along with this rise in violence we continue to see an increased hesitancy on the part of witnesses to testify about what they saw. It is not simply the case of idle threats and unwarranted perceptions on the part of witnesses and victims. We have had witnesses murdered in Prince Georges County. Others have been beaten, terrorized, and threatened. The problem is real, immediate, and growing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">SB-261 grew out of discussions in my office about how to deal with this threat to our criminal justice system. It is extremely difficult and expensive to give direct police pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>tection to victims and witnesses and that protection is available in only the rarest of cases. Beyond that, we decided the next best thing would be to draft a comprehensive bill to deal with the problem in a couple of different ways. It represents our best attempt to improve a very difficult situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-4\">This bill attacks the problem in a number of ways ... SB-261 creates four new crimes which prohibit bribing witnesses and assaulting 6r threatening to assault witnesses or victims. These new crimes and the harsh penalties attached to them, should provide increased deterrence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The legislative history also includes a \u201cbill analysis,\u201d confirming that the \u201cfour new crimes\u201d prohibit</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-6\">(1) a person from conferring, offering to confer, or agreeing to confer a benefit upon a victim or witness with the intent to influence the victim or witness to testify falsely or withhold testimony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-7\">(2) a person from harming or injuring any person or damaging or destroying any property or threatening to harm or injure any person or damage or destroy any property with the intent to influence a victim or witness to avoid legal process summoning the victim or witness to testify or be absent from an official proceeding to which the victim or witness has been legally summoned;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-8\">(3) a person from intentionally harming or injuring any person or damaging or destroying property with the intent of retaliating against a victim or witness for giving testimony in an official proceeding or for reporting a crime; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-9\">(4) a person from intentionally inducing or attempting to induce a victim or witness to testify falsely, avoid legal process summoning the victim or witness to testify, or be absent from an official proceeding to which the victim or witness has been legally summoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-10\">As a result of the enactment of Chapter 223, the following statutes were included in Article 27 of the Maryland Code, effective October 1, 1993:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-11\">\u00a7 767</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>(A) A PERSON MAY NOT CONFER, OFFER TO CONFER OR AGREE TO CONFER A BENEFIT UPON A VICTIM OR WITNESS WITH THE INTENT TO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-5\">(1) INFLUENCE THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO TESTIFY FALSELY OR WITHHOLD TESTIMONY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">(2) INDUCE A THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO AVOID LEGAL PROCESS SUMMONING THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO TESTIFY OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-7\">(3) INDUCE THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO BE ABSENT FROM AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING TO WHICH THE VICTIM OR WITNESS HAS BEEN LEGALLY SUMMONED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-8\">\u00a7 768</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-9\">(A) A PERSON MAY NOT HARM OR INJURE ANY PERSON OR DAMAGE OR DESTROY ANY PROPERTY OR THREATEN TO HARM OR INJURE ANY PERSON OR DAMAGE OR DESTROY ANY PROPERTY WITH THE INTENT TO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-10\">(1) INFLUENCE THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO TESTIFY FALSELY OR WITHHOLD TESTIMONY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-11\">(2) INDUCE A THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO AVOID LEGAL PROCESS SUMMONING THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO TESTIFY OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-12\">(3) INDUCE THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO BE ABSENT FROM AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING TO WHICH THE VICTIM OR WITNESS HAS BEEN LEGALLY SUMMONED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-13\">\u00a7 769</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-14\">(A) A PERSON MAY NOT INTENTIONALLY HARM OR INJURE ANY PERSON OR DAMAGE OR DESTROY ANY PROPERTY WITH THE INTENT OF RETALIATING AGAINST A VICTIM OR WITNESS FOR GIVING TESTIMONY IN AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING OR FOR REPORTING A CRIME.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-15\">(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-16\">\u00a7 770</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>(A) A PERSON MAY NOT INTENTIONALLY INDUCE OR ATTEMPT TO INDUCE A VICTIM OR WITNESS TO:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">(1) TESTIFY FALSELY OR WITHHOLD TESTIMONY</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">(2) AVOID LEGAL PROCESS SUMMONING THE VICTIM OR WITNESS TO TESTIFY; OR</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-7\">(3) BE ABSENT FROM AN OFFICIAL PROCEEDING TO WHICH THE VICTIM OR WITNESS HAS BEEN LEGALLY SUMMONED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In <em>Gillespie v. State, </em>370 Md. 219, 804 A.2d 426 (2002), this Court stated that \u201c[w]e interpret statutes to give every word effect, avoiding constructions that render any portion of the language superfluous or redundant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 804 A.2d at 427. In <em>W. Corr. Inst. v. Geiger, </em>371 Md. 125, 807 A.2d 32 (2002), we stated that \u201cin determining a statute\u2019s meaning, courts may consider the context in which a statute appears, including related statutes and, even when a statute is clear, its legislative history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 143, 807 A.2d at 42. Applying these principles of statutory interpretation, we conclude that the words \u201cretaliating against a victim or witness for giving testimony\u201d in Art. 27, \u00a7 769 are applicable to acts of retaliation against a victim or witness who has already testified, while Art. 27, \u00a7 768 is applicable to criminal conduct undertaken with the intent to prevent a victim or witness from testifying in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-9\">In 1996, former \u00a7\u00a7 767 through 769 were transferred to \u00a7\u00a7 761 through 763.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Effective October 1, 1996, these statutes, in pertinent part, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-10\">\u00a7 761.

His convictions under both statutes should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">For purposes of Title 9, Subtitle 3 of the Criminal Law Article, Sheryl L. was both \u201cvictim\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a \u201cwitness.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In December of 2007, Sheryl L. reported that her windshield had been broken by Ebling, Tracy\u2019s brother.
