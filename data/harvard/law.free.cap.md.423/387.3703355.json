Petitioner\u2019s personal injury claim stems from a slip and fall incident on \u201cblack ice\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that occurred on the premises of the apartment complex. Respondents filed, and the court granted, a motion for judgment at the end of Petitioner\u2019s case based on Petitioner\u2019s alleged assumption of the risk. Based on the record before us, we cannot say, as a matter of law, that Petitioner assumed the risk of slipping and falling on black ice when she exited her apartment building. Therefore, we shall hold that the trial judge erred by failing to submit the issue of assumption of the risk to the jury for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">On February 21, 2007, Petitioner lived in the Foxfire Apartments complex in Laurel, Maryland, with her daughter and granddaughter. Petitioner had resided in her apartment since 1998. The evidence produced at trial showed that the primary means of egress from the apartment complex to the parking lot where Petitioner kept her car was a central, covered flight of stairs, followed by four additional stairs that led to a sidewalk. There was also a separate, back exit from the central stairway that led to an \u201cunpaved, dirt area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">Petitioner testified that the front of her apartment complex did not get much direct sunlight. Consequently, in the winter months snow and ice would melt more slowly than in other locations. Petitioner also stated that she knew that when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>snow and ice melted, the sidewalk would become wet and that icy conditions could develop in freezing temperatures.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">At approximately 8:30 a.m. on the morning of the injury, Petitioner left her apartment to go to work. Petitioner walked down the steps of the primary exit and over the sidewalk to the parking lot, where she noticed some patches of ice and snow. When she arrived at her vehicle, she had to hold onto it for support due to the surrounding conditions. When Petitioner returned from work between 2:30 and 3:00 p.m., the temperature had \u201cwarmed up\u201d and she noticed that the ice and snow had melted but that the sidewalks were wet.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">Petitioner left her apartment again at approximately 6:00 p.m. on the evening of the accident to drop off her granddaughter at a youth group meeting at a nearby church. Petitioner returned home at approximately 6:15 p.m. When she arrived home, Petitioner again noticed that the sidewalk in front of her apartment was wet, but she saw no sign of salt or melting pellets on the sidewalk or walkway. At approximately 8:00 p.m., Petitioner left her apartment to pick up her granddaughter from the meeting. Petitioner alleges that she had just stepped down from the last step of the stairway onto the sidewalk when she slipped and fell on ice, which she could not see and did not know was on the stairway. After the fall, Petitioner\u2019s neighbor, Jean Gillette, came outside to assist Petitioner. As Ms. Gillette stepped off of the last step onto the sidewalk she too slipped, but did not fall, on what she described as \u201cblack ice.\u201d As a result of the incident, Petitioner suffered a compound fracture in her right leg. She filed a negligence action in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County against Respondents. At trial, Lawrence Dinoff, qualified as an expert in \u201cforensic architecture,\u201d described in his testimony the peculiar characteristics of the sidewalk that allowed it to foster the accumulation of ice when it became wet from melted snow. In addition to testifying that the high temperature on the day of the accident was fifty-one degrees, Mr. Dinoff stated that the temperature did not go below freezing until about \u201can hour before ... [Petitioner\u2019s] fall occurred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>At the conclusion of Petitioner\u2019s presentation of her case, Respondents moved for judgement, asserting the defenses of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. While the trial judge denied the motion as to contributory negligence, he granted the motion for judgment on the grounds that Petitioner had assumed the risk of her injury as a matter of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Noting that the Court of Special Appeals had decided <em>Allen v. Marriott Worldwide Corp., </em>183 Md.App. 460, 961 A.2d 1141 (2008), <em>cert. denied, Allen v. Marriott, </em>408 Md. 149, 968 A.2d 1065 (2009) the previous day, the trial court concluded that Petitioner had knowledge of the risk of slipping on black ice as a matter of law. In addition, as to the voluntariness requirement of the assumption of the risk defense, the court rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that <em>Rountree v. Lerner Dev. Co., </em>52 Md.App. 281, 447 A.2d 902 (1982), controlled, and ruled that Petitioner had encountered the danger voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-4\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed. <em>Thomas v. Panco Mgmt. of Md., LLC, </em>195 Md.App. 245, 6 A.3d 304 (2010). Also relying on the reasoning of <em>Allen, </em>it concluded that Petitioner had knowledge of the risk of slipping on black ice. The court also concluded that Petitioner had assumed the risk of her injury voluntarily, and opined that <em>Rountree </em>was no longer good law. We granted Petitioner\u2019s writ of certiorari, <em>Thomas v. Panco Mgmt., </em>418 Md. 190, 13 A.3d 798 (2011), which asked us to determine \u201c[w]hether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court concluding, as a matter of law, that the Petitioner knowingly and voluntarily assumed the risk of slipping on \u2018black ice\u2019 when she left her apartment.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We review the trial court\u2019s grant of Respondents\u2019 motion for judgment <em>de novo, </em>considering the evidence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>reasonable inferences drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-519; <em>C &amp; M Builders, LLC v. Strub, </em>420 Md. 268, 290, 22 A.3d 867, 880 (2011); <em>Scapa Dryer Fabrics, Inc. v. Saville, </em>418 Md. 496, 503, 16 A.3d 159, 163 (2011). Under Maryland Rule 2-519,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> when a defendant moves for judgment based on an affirmative defense, or upon the legal insufficiency of the plaintiffs evidence, the trial judge must determine if there is \u201cany evidence, no matter how slight, that is legally sufficient to generate a jury question,\u201d and if there is, the motion must be denied and the case submitted to the jury. <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 290, 22 A.3d at 880 (quoting <em>Tate v. Bd. of Educ., </em>155 Md.App. 536, 545, 843 A.2d 890, 895 (2004)). It is only when the \u201cfacts and circumstances only permit one inference with regard to the issue presented,\u201d that the issue is one of law for the court and not one of fact for the jury. <em>Scapa, </em>418 Md. at 503, 16 A.3d at 163. An appellate court must review the grant or denial of a motion for judgment by conducting the same analysis as the trial judge. <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 291, 22 A.3d at 880; <em>Tate, </em>155 Md.App. at 545, 843 A.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Thus, the grant of Respondents\u2019 motion for judgment based on assumption of the risk was appropriate only if all evidence and reasonable evidentiary inferences, viewed in a light most favorable to Petitioner, could have led only to the conclusion that she assumed the risk of her injuries. <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 291, 22 A.3d at 880. In arguing that the motion was improperly granted, Petitioner first contends that in <em>Allen, </em>the Court of Special Appeals misinterpreted Maryland\u2019s assumption of the risk doctrine and that the <em>Allen </em>holding, relied upon by the trial court and the intermediate appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>court in the instant case, invaded the province of the jury by allowing judges to weigh evidence and impute constructive knowledge of a risk to a plaintiff as a matter of law. Secondly, Petitioner argues that the courts\u2019 disavowal of <em>Rountree </em>and their interpretation of the voluntariness element in instant case will bar recovery for all tenants who slip and fall on ice in the common approaches and walkways of their apartment complexes. We agree and shall address each of these contentions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">In Maryland, there are three requirements that a defendant must prove to establish the defense of assumption of the risk: (1) the plaintiff had knowledge of the risk of the danger; (2) the plaintiff appreciated that risk; and (3) the plaintiff voluntarily confronted the risk of danger. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 90-91, 702 A.2d at 734. The question of whether the plaintiff had knowledge and appreciation of the particular risk at issue is ordinarily a question for the jury, \u201cunless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>clearly </em>establish that the risk of danger was <em>fully </em>known to and <em>understood </em>by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Schroyer v. McNeal, </em>323 Md. 275, 283, 592 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1991) (quotation omitted) (emphasis added). Where it is clear, however, \u201cthat a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger, the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added); <em>accord Gibson v. Beaver, </em>245 Md. 418, 421, 226 A.2d 273, 275 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\"><em>Allen v. Marriott Worldwide Corp., </em>183 Md.App. 460, 961 A.2d 1141 (2008), was decided during the course of the trial in instant case. As discussed, <em>supra, </em>both the trial court and the intermediate appellate court relied on that case to conclude that Petitioner had knowledge of the risk of slipping on ice as a matter of law. <em>Allen </em>has since been disavowed by this Court in <em>Poole v. Coakley &amp; Williams Constr., Inc., </em>423 Md. 91, 31 A.3d 212, 2011 WL 5100994 (2011). <em>Poole </em>presented similar facts and legal questions to those in the instant case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the main issue for resolution being whether Petitioner in that case knew of the risk of slipping and falling on black ice as a matter of law. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Poole, </em>we explained the essential portions of the <em>Allen </em>opinion of which we disapproved. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">In <em>Allen, </em>the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the trial judge\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant, Marriott Corporation, on the ground that one of its guests, Mr. David Allen, had assumed the risk of slipping and falling on black ice while walking across the parking lot from the entrance of the hotel to his wife\u2019s car. <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 462, 478-80, 961 A.2d at 1142, 1151-52.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azqf\">Notwithstanding the fact that black ice is, by its nature, invisible or difficult to see, the <em>Allen </em>court stated that \u201cthe path to knowledge is not limited to the sense of sight alone.... Knowledge springs not only from direct sense perception but from the drawing of inferences from circumstantial evidence. Induction is as worthy a highway to knowledge as is sensation.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 473, 961 A.2d at 1149. The court concluded that because the plaintiff had testified that he observed visible ice and snow in the vicinity prior to his slip and fall and \u201cacknowledged his general familiarity with the phenomenon of black ice\u201d that \u201cwhen the bits and pieces of information about the appellant\u2019s awareness of risk came together, they were enough, objectively, to achieve critical mass\u201d and so \u201c[t]he question was properly one of law for the court to decide on summary judgment.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 476, 478-79, 961 A.2d at 1150-51. The <em>Allen </em>court bolstered its holding with the following reasoning, in which we also find error:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-7\">To assume a risk as a matter of law, a plaintiff, objectively speaking, must have reason to know of the risk. In a case such as this, the risk is that of slipping on ice. The required knowledge is not knowledge that ice is actually present. It is the appreciation of the reasonable likelihood that, under the weather conditions and other circumstances, ice might well be present. The assumed risk is not that of stepping on ice per se. The assumed risk is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that of stepping onto an unknown surface with an awareness that it might well be icy. With white ice, you see it is there. With black ice, you infer the likelihood that it may be there. Either establishes the element of awareness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><em>Poole v. Coakley &amp; Williams Constr., Inc., </em>423 Md. 91, 31 A.3d 212 (2011). In granting Respondents\u2019 motion for judgment, the trial court in instant case relied primarily on the <em>Allen </em>court\u2019s reasoning, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-5\">I find this is almost exactly the <em>Allen </em>case. The test as set forth in the <em>Allen </em>decision is [that] a plaintiff objectively speaking must have reason to know of the risk. In a case such as this, the risk is that of slipping on ice. The required knowledge is not knowledge that ice is actually present, which is what we all were talking about prior to yesterday, but it is the appreciation of the reasonable likelihood that under the weather conditions and other circumstances, ice might well be present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-6\">The assumed risk is not that of stepping on ice, per se. The assumed risk is of stepping onto an unknown surface with an awareness that it might well be icy. With white ice, you see it there. With black ice, you infer the likelihood that it may be there. Either establishes the element of awareness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-7\">So, I do find that as a matter of law, she was or should have been aware of the risk, that she appreciated it because she said she was familiar with it, and that she voluntarily assumed that risk by undertaking to cross it that day.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">On review, the intermediate appellate court similarly found <em>Allen </em>to be apposite in the present case. It stated: \u201cWe agree with [the trial judge] that the uncontradicted first-level facts developed in this case objectively showed that [Mary] Thomas, like David Allen, had at the time of her fall, knowledge of the risk that she might be stepping down upon ice and that a reasonable person in her position would have appreciated the danger of that action.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>195 Md.App. at 256, 6 A.3d at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>It was error for the trial court to rule, as a matter of law, that Petitioner had knowledge of the risk for the same reasons we explained in <em>Poole, </em>namely that the <em>Allen </em>case expanded the knowledge prong of the assumption of the risk test to permit the trial judge to impute knowledge under circumstances where the risk of danger may not have been fully known to and understood by the plaintiff. Thus, we restate our reasoning in <em>Poole </em>at length because of its applicability to the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\"><em>Allen </em>expands the knowledge prong of the assumption of the risk test to permit the trial judge to impute knowledge under circumstances where the risk of danger may not have been fully known to and understood by the plaintiff, thereby enlarging the category of cases in which a court may impute knowledge to a plaintiff as a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">As explained, <em>supra, </em>\u201cthe doctrine of assumption of risk will not be applied [as a matter of law] unless the undisputed evidence and all permissible inferences therefrom <em>clearly </em>establish that the risk of danger was <em>fully </em>known to and <em>understood </em>by the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added). When it is clear, however, \u201cthat a person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger, the issue is for the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, in order for a plaintiff to have assumed the risk of his or her injuries as a matter of law, we require that a plaintiff \u201cmust\u201d have known that the risk was \u201cactually present,\u201d not that he or she \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d or \u201ccould\u201d have known that the risk \u201cmight well be present.\u201d <em>See Kasten Constr. Co. v. Evans, </em>260 Md. 536, 544-45, 273 A.2d 90, 94 (holding that even though defendant argued that plaintiff, a utility linesman, \u201cshould have known\u201d of the danger involved in climbing a utility pole, the issue was properly one for the jury because there were no signs of structural instability, and his knowledge of the danger was not clear and undisputed); <em>cf. McClearn </em>[v. <em>Southeast Concrete </em>Co.], 253 Md. [135] at 139, 251 A.2d [896] at 899 (stating that plaintiff was experienced in the cement finishing business, and therefore \u201ccertainly <em>must </em>have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>aware\u201d of the danger of directing the driver in the process of backing up a cement truck) (emphasis added); <em>see also Martin v. Heddinger, </em>373 N.W.2d 486, 490 (Iowa 1985) (\u201c[Assumption of risk is a matter of whether the plaintiff knew of the risk, not whether the plaintiff should have known of it.\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-4\">The <em>Allen </em>court\u2019s formulation diminishes the requirement that a plaintiff actually and fully know and understand the risk he or she is confronting and proposes that a plaintiff may be judicially charged with knowledge in a circumstance where he or she should <em>infer </em>the existence of a dangerous condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-5\">Maryland jurisprudence, however, directs that courts may only impute knowledge to the plaintiff, as a matter of law, when there is undisputed evidence of awareness, <em>e.g., </em>physical interaction with or sensory perception of the dangerous condition in the case of <em>Schroyer, ADM P\u2019ship, </em>or <em>Morgan State; </em>the risk of danger is so obvious that any person of normal intelligence will be taken to comprehend it, as in <em>Gibson </em>or <em>C &amp; M; </em>or the risk is an usual and foreseeable consequence of the plaintiffs conduct, as in <em>Cotillo.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">Beyond these circumstances, we have held that \u201c[wjhere there is a dispute whether the risk is assumed or not, that question is usually left to the jury[,]\u201d <em>Bull S.S. Lines [v. Fisher ], </em>196 Md. [519] at 526, 77 A.2d [142] at 146, because the role of the fact finder is to assess the credibility of the evidence and to draw a conclusion from among the inferences which may be reasonably drawn from that evidence. <em>See American Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 12:53, at 433 (\u201cOnly where reasonable men could not differ as to the conclusion to be reached, the court itself may determine the issue.\u201d)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-7\">In <em>Allen, </em>the plaintiff testified that he had crossed the parking lot without incident after the snowfall but prior to his slip and fall. Also, while he observed visible ice and snow piled against the curb of the parking lot, he had not seen any in the area of the lot on which he stepped, and did not see the ice upon which he fell. The intermediate appellate court aptly defined \u201cblack ice,\u201d and described the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201cmeaningful contrast\u201d between \u201cwhite ice\u201d and \u201cblack ice,\u201d as \u201cbetween essentially visible ice and essentially invisible ice.\u201d 183 Md.App. at 469-470, 961 A.2d at 1146-47. Whereas the <em>Allen </em>court did not find the invisibility of the black ice to be a significant factor in withholding judicial imputation of knowledge to the plaintiff, this Court does. 183 Md.App. at 472-73, 961 A.2d at 1148-49. \"While, indeed, \u201cthe path to knowledge is not limited to the sense of sight alone,\u201d it is not for the courts, as a matter of law, to determine that although a danger was, by its nature, imperceptible by direct sensation, \u201cinferences from circumstantial evidence\u201d were drawn by a particular plaintiff. <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 473, 961 A.2d at 1149. The <em>Allen </em>court\u2019s statement that the requisite knowledge at the time of injury is not knowledge that ice is <em>actually </em>present, but, rather, \u201cthe appreciation of the reasonable likelihood that, under the ... circumstances ice <em>might well be </em>present\u201d negates the legal truism that assumption of the risk \u201crests upon an intentional and voluntary exposure to a <em>known </em>danger and, therefore, <em>consent </em>on the part of the plaintiff to relieve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him and to take his chances from harm from a <em>particular </em>risk.\u201d <em>Crews, </em>358 Md. at 640-41,751 A.2d at 488 (internal quotations omitted) (emphasis added). Thus, it was error to find, as a matter of law, that the plaintiff in <em>Allen </em>had knowledge of the risk of slipping on black ice when the evidence showed only an \u201cawareness that it might\u201d exist and an inference could have been drawn that it \u201cmay be there.\u201d <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 479-80, 961 A.2d at 1152. Rather, for a court to impute knowledge as a matter of law, the evidence and all permissible inferences must make clear that the plaintiff had full, actual, and subjective knowledge of the risk or that \u201ca person of normal intelligence in the position of the plaintiff <em>must </em>have understood the danger.\u201d <em>See Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283-84, 592 A.2d at 1123 (emphasis added). In the absence of this level of proof, any determinations as to \u201cbits and pieces of information\u201d required to achieve a \u201ccriti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>cal mass\u201d sufficient to impute knowledge to a plaintiff, is a puzzle properly put together by the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">In the instant case, there were factual issues creating a jury question as to Petitioner\u2019s knowledge of the risk of slipping on black ice. In ruling on the knowledge prong, the trial judge found the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\">In this case, there is no dispute about the underlying facts ... that the sidewalk was wet. It was observed to be wet and known to be wet by the plaintiff on the four other occasions that she traversed it that day. [A]nd ... that the weather was getting colder. She said she saw no salt or any evidence of any salting being done. And that she was aware, as were all of her neighbors, that water would collect in that area, melting snow made the sidewalks wet, and thus they all took due care being cautious and looking for ice. She didn\u2019t see any sign of any maintenance activity that day, that evening. She wasn\u2019t looking for salt, and she wasn\u2019t looking for ice. And nonetheless, she did attempt to traverse that wet area and fell.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s ruling, the facts do not point only to the conclusion that Petitioner assumed the risk of her injuries. <em>See C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 291, 22 A.3d at 880; <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 421, 226 A.2d at 275; Stuart Speiser, Charles Krause <em>&amp; </em>Alfred Gans, <em>The American Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 12:53, at 433 (2008) (hereinafter <em>American Law of </em>Torts) (\u201cOnly where reasonable men could not differ as to the conclusion to be reached, the court itself may determine the issue.\u201d). Likewise, the permissible inferences from the undisputed evidence do not clearly establish that the risk of danger was fully known to and understood by the Petitioner. <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Indeed, several of the facts relied upon by the trial court in the present case to grant judgment as a matter of law, including the fact that Petitioner did not see any maintenance activity or salt on the walkway, could lead just as easily to the inference that Petitioner did not have knowledge of the \u201cessentially invisible\u201d ice. <em>Allen, </em>183 Md.App. at 469-70, 961 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>A.2d at 1147. Other facts, selectively disregarded by the court, further support this position. For example, the weather in the days leading up to the accident was warm and dry, there was a high temperature of fifty-one degrees on the day of the accident, and the temperature had just fallen below freezing in the hour before the accident occurred. Also, the walkways had been traversed previously that day without incident by Petitioner and, while they appeared wet, there was no visible accumulation or puddles of water. Further, Petitioner\u2019s neighbor testified that when she came out to render assistance to Petitioner, she saw no ice on the walkway in the vicinity of Petitioner\u2019s fall, and the spot where Petitioner fell appeared to be water rather than ice. Also, Petitioner presented the testimony of a forensic architect, Mr. Dinoff, who testified, \u201c[Y]ou can have ice in a very thin layer on a concrete sidewalk that will not appear slippery because it\u2019s not thick enough to overcome the natural traction of a rough sidewalk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">As explained, <em>supra, </em>granting a motion for judgment under Maryland Rule 2-519 is only appropriate if all evidence and reasonable evidentiary inferences, viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party, lead to only one conclusion \u2014 here, that Petitioner assumed the risk of her injuries. <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 291, 22 A.3d at 880; <em>Scapa, </em>418 Md. at 503, 16 A.3d at 163; <em>Tate, </em>155 Md.App. at 545, 843 A.2d at 896. If there is \u201cany evidence, no matter how slight, that is legally sufficient to generate a jury question,\u201d then the motion must be denied and the case submitted to the jury. <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 290, 22 A.3d at 880 (quoting <em>Tate, </em>155 Md.App. at 545, 843 A.2d at 895). As we explained in <em>Poole, </em>knowledge should not be imputed as a matter of law where the facts or the reasonable inferences from the facts are in dispute. <em>Poole v. Coakley &amp; Williams Constr., Inc., </em>423 Md. 91, 31 A.3d 212 (2011); <em>C &amp; M Builders, </em>420 Md. at 291, 22 A.3d at 880. Given the evidence and testimony summarized above, it is clear that this standard was not followed because the facts and inferences applicable to the issue of Petitioner\u2019s knowledge lend themselves to more than one conclusion. Therefore, whether Petitioner assumed the risk of her injuries <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>was a question of fact and should have been answered by the trier of fact, in this case the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">Petitioner also contends that the grant of Respondents\u2019 motion for judgment was improper because she did not encounter the danger voluntarily, and thus did not assume the risk of her injuries. Relying on <em>Rountree v. Lerner Dev. Co., 52 </em>Md.App. 281, 447 A.2d 902 (1982), Petitioner contends that Respondents, by failing to provide her with a reasonably safe means of ingress to and egress from her apartment, constrained her freedom of choice and coerced her into encountering the risk of slipping on black ice.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">This Court in <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>endorsed the principle announced by Prosser and relied upon by the intermediate appellate court in <em>Rountree </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-8\">[T]here can be no restriction on the plaintiffs freedom of choice either by the existing circumstances or by coercion emanating from the defendant. This is so because even where the plaintiff does not protest, the risk is not assumed where the conduct of the defendant has left [the plaintiff] no reasonable alternative.

Our post <em>Rountree </em>case law has not implicitly overruled <em>Rountree, </em>as suggested by the trial court and intermediate appellate court in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">In <em>Rountree, </em>the plaintiff, a tenant, slipped and fell on ice while leaving her apartment to go to work. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 282, 447 A.2d at 902-03. There was evidence that she exited from the only means of egress from the building. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 283-85, 447 A.2d at 903-04. According to the facts presented, the plaintiff knew about the ice and snow outside of her apartment, and she had decided to leave for work later than usual because she believed that the conditions outside would improve or that maintenance would clear the hazard. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 283, 285, 447 A.2d at 903-04. Despite the plaintiffs efforts to wait for the conditions to improve, and her efforts to use care while exiting her apartment, she slipped on the ice and sustained injuries while walking to her car. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 283-84, 447 A.2d at 903-04. The trial court ruled that she had assumed the risk of her injuries as a matter of law. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 282, 447 A.2d at 903.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">On appeal, the intermediate appellate court held that the plaintiffs knowledge of the danger, <em>ie., </em>the risk of slipping on ice, was not dispositive because knowledge \u201cis simply one of two limitations on the defense of assumption of risk----\u201d <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 284, 447 A.2d at 904. The court quoted Prosser to explain that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The second important limitation upon the defense of assumption of risk is that the plaintiff is not barred from recovery unless his choice is a free and voluntary one. There must first of all, of course, be some manifestation of consent to relieve the defendant of the obligation of reasonable conduct. It is not every deliberate encountering of a known danger which is reasonably to be interpreted as evidence of such consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\"><em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 284, 447 A.2d at 904 (quoting William L. Prosser, <em>Handbook of the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 68, at 450 (4th ed.1971) (hereinafter Prosser, 4th ed.)).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">While the <em>Rountree </em>court found that there was clear and decisive evidence of a \u201cdeliberate encountering of a known danger\u201d by the plaintiff, it also pointed out that \u201cthe tenant had a right to egress from her apartment\u201d and \u201ca right to assume that the landlord would take all appropriate steps to make safe egress possible.\u201d <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 285, 447 A.2d at 904. Thus, the court noted that the plaintiffs conscious decision to encounter the risk may not have been voluntary, and again quoted Prosser:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">Even where the plaintiff does not protest, the risk is not assumed where the conduct of the defendant has left him no reasonable alternative. Where the defendant puts him to a choice of evils, there is a species of duress, which destroys all idea of freedom of election. Thus ... a tenant <em>does not assume the risk of the landlord\u2019s negligence in maintaining a common passageway when it is the only exit to the street. </em>In general, the plaintiff is not required to surrender a valuable legal right, such as the use of his own property as he sees fit, merely because the defendant\u2019s conduct has threatened him with harm if the right is exercised.... By placing him in the dilemma, the defendant has deprived him of his freedom of choice, and so cannot be heard to say that he has voluntarily assumed the risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-8\"><em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 285-86, 447 A.2d at 904 (quoting Prosser, 4th ed. \u00a7 68, at 451). The intermediate appellate court found that because there was no evidence that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>plaintiff had a reasonably safe alternative route of egress from her apartment, she had not voluntarily assumed the risk of her injuries as a matter of law; rather, the issue of voluntariness was \u201cat the very least\u201d a question for the jury. <em>Rountree, 52 </em>Md.App. at 286, 447 A.2d at 905. The court also noted, however, that \u201c[i]f there had been evidence in this case that there was a reasonable and safe alternative route of egress open to the [plaintiff] and that she deliberately chose the shorter but more dangerous route, that might well establish as a matter of law that she was guilty of having assumed the risk.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the trial court erroneously concluded that <em>Rountree </em>was no longer good precedent, and erred when it decided that Petitioner voluntarily assumed the risk of her injury as a matter of law. The trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_S\">I, frankly, don\u2019t believe that this analysis by Judge Moylan in 1982 is the law in Maryland any longer. All of the cases that he cited in the <em>Allen </em>case, <em>Schroyer, ADM Partnership, </em>and <em>Morgan State </em>post-date <em>Rountree </em>[sic] by a great deal of time. I don\u2019t believe that the voluntariness is this. I believe that taking Judge Moylan\u2019s argument here really, in essence, does make the landlord the guarantor of any harm to the tenants, which is not the law in Maryland.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>I don\u2019t find that the mere fact that she was a tenant means that any otherwise voluntary acceptance of the risk or confrontation of the risk somehow becomes involuntary because of the tenant relationship.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-4\">There were alternatives, some of which were discussed here. And the alternative of not taking her granddaughter out for that event, and knowing that you\u2019d have to pick her up again after the temperature had dropped under those circumstances.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The intermediate appellate court also believed that our recent snow and ice cases implicitly overruled <em>Rountree, </em>explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZm\">\u201c[I]t does not appear that the Court of Appeals would presently completely endorse our holding in <em>Rountree. </em>It no longer can be said that the assumption of the risk doctrine is inapplicable simply because the plaintiff is provided with no alternative <em>safe path </em>to reach his or her destination. Nevertheless, we <em>infer </em>from <em>Morgan State </em>that for an act to be voluntary, the plaintiff must still have some safe alternative <em>course of action </em>\u2014 such as those suggested in <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 520, 919 A.2d 21. The safe alternative course of action, often, can simply be to refuse to take the risk.... In this case, although Thomas did not have an alternative safe path to her car, she did have a sale alternative course of action. One alternative course of action was to call the maintenance department at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>her apartment complex and ask them to put down salt or some other substance that would melt the ice.... Alternatively, as [the trial judge] suggested, she could have refused to take her granddaughter to the church.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b456-5\"><em>Thomas, </em>195 Md.App. at 261-62, 6 A.3d at 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">We disagree with the intermediate appellate and trial courts\u2019 conclusion that <em>Rountree </em>is no longer good law. Insofar as it applies to a tenant\u2019s right to a reasonably safe means of ingress and egress from his or her property, <em>Rountree </em>is consistent with our case law. The factual scenarios presented in our more recent snow and ice decisions, where we concluded that assumption of the risk was established as a matter of law, each occurred outside of the landlord-tenant relationship, and involved plaintiffs who were not coerced by the defendant into encountering the risk as they were either \u201cconfronted by a choice of risks\u201d or \u201cdriven by [their] own necessities to accept [the] danger.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735; <em>see Morgan State Univ. v.

Lamy, </em>320 Md. 33, 575 A.2d 1235 (1990); <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. 418, 226 A.2d 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">Our opinion in <em>Gibson v. Beaver, </em>245 Md. 418, 226 A.2d 273, although it pre-dates <em>Rountree, </em>is consistent with the concept of voluntariness as explained in <em>Rountree. </em>In <em>Gibson, </em>the plaintiff suffered a heart attack while pulling a fuel hose approximately one hundred feet from an oil truck to his house. <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 419-21, 226 A.2d at 274-75. We rejected the plaintiffs argument that, due to his subjective belief that his actions were necessary to obtain oil, he had not encountered the risk of his injury voluntarily. <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422-23, 226 A.2d at 276. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-8\">The plaintiff takes a risk <em>voluntarily ... </em>where the defendant has a right to face him with the dilemma of \u2018take it or leave it\u2019 \u2014 in other words, where [the] defendant is under no duty to make the conditions of their association any safer than they appear to be. In such a case it does not matter that [the] plaintiff is coerced to assume the risk by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>some force not emanating from [the] defendant such as poverty, dearth of living quarters, or a sense of moral responsibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\"><em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422-23, 226 A.2d at 276 (quotation omitted). In <em>Gibson, </em>as in several of our <em>post-Rountree </em>snow and ice cases, discussed <em>infra, </em>the fuel supplier had a right to present the plaintiff with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d situation, and the plaintiff voluntarily chose to encounter the risks associated with taking the oil out of his own necessity. <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422-23, 226 A.2d at 276. In contrast, the landlord in <em>Rountree </em>did not have the right to deprive his tenant of a reasonably safe means of egress from her apartment. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 285, 447 A.2d at 904. A landlord has an affirmative duty to provide his or her tenants with a reasonably safe means of passage to and from their homes. <em>Langley Park Apartments, Sec. H., Inc., </em>234 Md. at 407, 199 A.2d at 623 (\u201c[W]here a landlord leases separate portions of his property to different tenants and reserves under his control the passageways and stairways, and other parts of the property for the common use of all the tenants he must then exercise ordinary care and diligence to maintain the retained portions in a reasonably safe condition.\u201d). Indeed, Prosser, after quoting Cardozo\u2019s maxim: \u201cThe timorous may stay at home,\u201d noted that \u201cplaintiffs who enter business premises as invitees and discover dangerous conditions, such as slippery floors and unsafe stairways, may be found to assume the risks when they nevertheless proceed freely and voluntarily to encounter them.\u201d <em>Prosser and Keeton \u00a7 </em>68 at 486. The Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496C, comment, d, describes a situation where:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-6\">the plaintiff enters the land or uses the chattels of the defendant, or enters into some other relation with him, without any right or privilege to do so other than that derived from the defendant\u2019s consent to the relation itself. ... [T]he defendant is under an initial duty of reasonable care ... but is relieved of this responsibility when the plaintiff, knowing of the danger, enters and accepts the risk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In these cases, the plaintiffs are \u201cdriven by [their] own necessities to accept [the] danger,\u201d and therefore \u201cthe situation is not to be charged against the defendant.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496E cmt. b). Prosser also noted, however, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b458-5\">The defendant may be under a legal duty, which he is not free to refuse to perform, to exercise reasonable care for the plaintiffs safety, so that the plaintiff has a corresponding legal right to insist on that care. In such a case it is commonly said that the plaintiff does not assume the risk when he proceeds to make use of the defendant\u2019s services or facilities, notwithstanding his knowledge of the danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWm\"><em>Prosser &amp; Keeton </em>\u00a7 68, at 492 (noting that one cannot \u201cset up assumption of risk\u201d to defeat recovery by a plaintiff negligently barred from \u201cpremises upon which the plaintiff has a contractual right to enter,\u201d and citing, <em>inter alia, </em>eases specifically dealing with tenants\u2019 property rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">Under the facts presented in this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lamy, </em>the plaintiff traveled to a grocery store two days after a snow storm, knew the condition of the premises, and nonetheless chose to step over packed snow while encumbered with bags of groceries. <em>Lamy, </em>320 Md. at 35-36, 575 A.2d at 1236. Plaintiff argued that <em>Rountree </em>applied because there were \u201cno alternative safe routes of exit because as a business invitee she has a right of egress.\u201d <em>Lamy, </em>320 Md. at 42, 575 A.2d at 1239. While we declined to specifically address the issue of voluntariness, we made clear that <em>Rountree </em>would not apply, because, unlike the tenant in <em>Rountree, </em>the plaintiff had a safe alternative to confronting the danger, as \u201cshe safely entered the A &amp; P one way and exited in a different way.\u201d <em>Lamy, </em>320 Md. at 43, 575 A.2d at 1240. Also, she testified that she considered waiting in front of the grocery store for her friend to bring the car around, so that she could load the groceries without encountering ice. Accordingly, the court held that she had \u201cmade a voluntary choice to reach her car in the manner that she did.\u201d <em>Lamy, </em>320 Md. at 44, 575 A.2d at 1240. Further, the plaintiffs decision to travel to the grocery store <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and encounter the danger was voluntary because it was based on her own necessity rather than on any compulsion emanating from the defendant. <em>See Prosser and Keeton </em>\u00a7 68, at 490-92.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\"><em>ADM P\u2019ship </em>involved a plaintiff who slipped and fell on a visibly icy walkway while making a delivery at a building owned by the defendants. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 88-89, 702 A.2d at 733. While holding that the plaintiff voluntarily encountered the risk, as a matter of law, under the facts of that case, this Court in <em>ADM P\u2019ship </em>endorsed the principle encompassed in Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 496E, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-5\">(1) A plaintiff does not assume a risk of harm unless he voluntarily accepts the risk.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-6\">(2) The plaintiffs acceptance of a risk is not voluntary if the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct has left him no reasonable alternative course of conduct in order to</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-7\">(a) avert harm to himself or another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">(b) exercise or protect a right or privilege of which the defendant has no right to deprive him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\"><em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 496E). The plaintiff claimed that she knew the risk involved in traversing the icy sidewalk, but that she had no reasonable alternative and thus did not voluntarily enter into the situation, because she believed her employer would have fired her if she failed to deliver the package she was carrying. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 89-90, 702 A.2d at 733. We rejected the plaintiffs argument in <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>agreeing with the trial court\u2019s determination that the plaintiff had several alternatives to encountering the hazardous situation, including refusing to deliver the package. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, 348 </em>Md. at 99-101, 702 A.2d at 738-39. We noted that \u201c[njeither [the plaintiffl\u2019s employer nor the defendant ever demanded that she traverse the ice and snow covered walkway against her will,\u201d and that there was \u201cnot a shred of evidence from which Martin\u2019s concern for her job if the delivery were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>not made can be inferred.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, 348 </em>Md. at 99, 101, 702 A.2d at 738-39.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Similarly, in <em>Morgan State, </em>we held that the plaintiff who chose to visit her daughter at college after a snow storm voluntarily encountered the risk that she would slip and fall while walking across the parking lot, despite her testimony that, because her daughter needed money, she had no alternative to encountering the danger. <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 519-20, 919 A.2d at 27-28. The plaintiff also argued that, under <em>Rountree, </em>Morgan State University owed her daughter a duty to maintain a reasonably safe mode of ingress and egress from the dormitory and that because plaintiff was visiting her daughter, she was owed the same duty. <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 522-23, 919 A.2d at 29. We declined to apply <em>Rountree, </em>noting that, unlike <em>Rountree, </em>the case at hand did \u201cnot involve a situation where [plaintiffs] daughter (a tenant) was trapped inside her dormitory because of ice and snow, and, while trying to leave the dormitory, slipped and fell on the ice.\u201d <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 522-23, 919 A.2d at 29-30.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">Further distinguishing <em>Rountree, </em>this Court noted in <em>Morgan State </em>that \u201cthe fact that [plaintiff] wanted to bring her daughter money for gas d[id] not render her actions involuntary.\u201d <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 520, 919 A.2d at 28. We said that \u201c[Plaintiff] had alternatives in this case \u2014 as soon as she heard the ice underneath her tires, she could have turned her car around and gone home or arranged an alternative plan by which to get her daughter money, instead of voluntarily proceeding in the face of danger by leaving her car and traversing across ice and snow.\u201d <em>Morgan State, </em>397 Md. at 520, 919 A.2d at 28. Indeed, the circumstances surrounding the plaintiffs injuries were more like the situation in <em>Gibson </em>as the plaintiff was properly confronted with a \u201ctake it or leave it\u201d situation, and, thus in the language of <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>was \u201cdriven by [her] own necessities to accept [the] danger.\u201d <em>Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 422-23, 226 A.2d at 276; <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>In <em>Schroyer, </em>the plaintiff arrived at a hotel shortly after snow had fallen. She noted that the area in front of the main entrance to the hotel had been cleared of ice and snow, but saw that the rest of the parking lot had not. Despite this knowledge, she requested a hotel room closest to an exit so that she could easily carry her paperwork from her car to her room. <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 278-79, 592 A.2d at 1120-21. While the room was accessible from the main lobby, the plaintiff chose to move her car away from the cleared area and park on packed ice and snow for the convenience of transporting her paperwork a shorter distance. <em>See Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 278-79, 592 A.2d at 1120-21. Upon returning to her car from her room, she slipped and fell.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">We held that the plaintiff assumed the risk of her injuries as a matter of law because it was clear \u201con this record, that [plaintiff] took an informed chance. Fully aware of the danger posed by an ice and snow covered parking lot and sidewalk, she voluntarily chose to park and traverse it, albeit <em>carefully, </em>for her own purposes, <em>i.e., </em>her convenience in unloading her belongings.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 288, 592 A.2d at 1125. In the language of <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>the plaintiff was \u201cconfronted by a choice of risks,\u201d and chose the more dangerous route. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735. This is in accord with the <em>Rountree </em>court\u2019s admonition that \u201c[i]f there had been evidence ... that there was a reasonable and safe alternative route of egress open to the [plaintiff] and that she deliberately chose the shorter but more dangerous route, that might well establish as a matter of law that she was guilty of having assumed the risk.\u201d <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 286, 447 A.2d at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">As to the voluntariness of Petitioner\u2019s conduct, we confirm that we did not overrule <em>Rountree </em>in our prior case law and have no reason to disavow its reasoning in this case. Thus, the trial and intermediate appellate court erred in inferring from the <em>post-Rountree </em>case law that a tenant assumes the risk of injury as a matter of law despite having no reasonably <em>safe path </em>to exit the apartment, as long as there is a reasonably safe alternative <em>course of action. </em>The intermediate ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>pellate court emphasized that a \u201csafe alternative course of action, often, can simply be to refuse to take the risk.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>195 Md.App. at 261-62, 6 A.3d at 314. The trial judge stated that Petitioner could have \u201cnot tak[en] her granddaughter out\u201d and Respondents\u2019 make much of the fact that \u201cthere were no adverse consequences if [Petitioner\u2019s] granddaughter did not attend the church meeting that evening.\u201d If this were the law in the landlord-tenant context, it would mean that a tenant, faced with a danger brought on by the landlord\u2019s negligence in failing to maintain a reasonably safe means of ingress to and egress from the leased premises, will have consented to relieve the landlord of this duty solely by exercising his or her right of access. A tenant may not be forced to surrender such a valuable legal right simply because the landlord\u2019s negligence has threatened him with harm if the right is exercised. <em>Rountree, </em>52 Md.App. at 285-86, 447 A.2d at 904 (quoting Prosser, 4th ed. \u00a7 68, at 451). Indeed, this situation falls within the admonition stated in the Restatement (Second) and quoted approvingly by this Court in <em>ADM P\u2019ship </em>that a \u201cplaintiffs acceptance of a risk is not voluntary if the defendant\u2019s tortious conduct has left him no reasonable alternative course of conduct in order to ... exercise or protect a right or privilege of which the defendant has no right to deprive him.\u201d <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 93, 702 A.2d at 735 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 496E); Prosser, 4th ed. \u00a7 68, at 451 (\u201cWhere the defendant puts [the plaintiff] to a choice of evils, there is a species of duress, which destroys all idea of freedom of election. Thus ... a tenant does not assume the risk of the landlord\u2019s negligence in maintaining a common passageway when it is the only exit to the street.\u201d). Therefore, in the present case, the trial court erred in holding, as a matter of law, that Petitioner\u2019s reasonable alternative to encountering the danger was to abandon her right of egress.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Because a tenant is entitled to a reasonably safe means of ingress and egress from the property that he or she rents, <em>Langley Park Apartments, Sec. H. Inc., </em>234 Md. at 407, 199 A.2d at 623, it is only when the tenant has a reasonably safe <em>alternative path </em>that there exists a \u201cchoice of risks\u201d sufficient to demonstrate a tenant\u2019s consent to relieve the landlord of this duty when the tenant chooses to traverse the more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>dangerous route. <em>See Gibson, </em>245 Md. at 421, 226 A.2d at 275 (\u201cthe defense of assumption of risk rests upon the plaintiffs consent to reheve the defendant of an obligation of conduct toward him.... \u201d); <em>Prosser and Keeton </em>\u00a7 68, at 490-92. Further, the tenant\u2019s right of to ingress and egress is not contingent on the purpose of his or her trip and a landlord may not negate his or her own duty to maintain a reasonably safe means of tenant access by claiming that a tenant\u2019s egress was unnecessary, and therefore a voluntary encountering of the risk. In other words, unlike contributory negligence, the reasonableness of the plaintiffs conduct is not an element of the defense of assumption of the risk, as it does not factor into the voluntariness inquiry. <em>See </em>Fowler V. Harper, Fleming James, Jr. &amp; Oscar S. Gray, <em>Harper, James, and Gray on Torts </em>\u00a7 21.3, at 274 (3d. ed.2007) (\u201cThe encountering of risks ... however unnecessary \u2014 to the point, even, of foolhardiness \u2014 should ordinarily be understood as an aspect of the actor\u2019s own negligence rather than as consent ... that another should subject the actor to negligence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Thus, in the present case, it was error for the trial judge to determine, as a matter of law, that Petitioner voluntarily assumed the risk of her injuries. There was evidence presented at trial about a rear exit from the central stairway which led onto an \u201cunpaved dirt area.\u201d Petitioner\u2019s expert witness, Mr. Dinoff, opined, however, that it was \u201cclearly not a safe alternative way of getting out of [the] building,\u201d apparently because it was not paved and not \u201creliably illuminated at night.\u201d Respondents did not attempt to demonstrate that the back exit was a reasonably safe alternative. The trial court granted Respondents\u2019 motion for judgment based, not on the existence of an alternative exit, but instead, upon the existence of \u201calternatives\u201d including \u201cnot taking her granddaughter out for that event,\u201d and its interpretation that <em>Rountree </em>was \u201cnot the law in Maryland any longer.\u201d Thus, given the evidence that there were at least two ways out of the building, the credibility of Mr. Dinoff s testimony about the relative safety of each path was an issue to be decided by the trier of fact. <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 313-14, 730 A.2d 181, 195 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>(1999) (\u201cIn a jury trial, judging the credibility of witnesses is entrusted solely to the jury, the trier of fact; only the jury determines whether to believe any witnesses, and which witnesses to believe.\u201d). On remand, it will be within the province of the jury to determine the issue of voluntariness in this case, namely whether there was more than one reasonably safe exit from Petitioner\u2019s building, and if so, whether Petitioner deliberately chose the more dangerous route.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Further, in the present case, Respondents moved for judgment at the end of Petitioner\u2019s case on the grounds of contributory negligence and assumption of the risk. While the trial judge granted the motion as to assumption of the risk, he denied it as to contributory negligence, concluding that Petitioner did not act unreasonably, as a matter of law. The judge stated: \u201cI think that the alternatives and the reasonableness of her conduct under those circumstances is something that the jury can consider, could have considered, but for the ruling on assumption of the risk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The defense of assumption of the risk involves a \u201cmanifestation of consent to relieve the <em>defendant </em>of the obligation of reasonable conduct\u201d towards the plaintiff. <em>ADM P\u2019ship, </em>348 Md. at 92, 702 A.2d at 734 (quotation omitted) (emphasis added); <em>accord Crews v.

The contributory negligence of the plaintiff is identified by an objective standard as \u201c[i]t is the doing of something that a person of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>ordinary prudence would not do, or the failure to do something that a person of ordinary prudence would do, under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Baltimore Cnty., </em>232 Md. at 362, 193 A.2d at 37 (quotations omitted).

Conversely, the facts may warrant conflicting results under the theories, for example, \u201c[a] plaintiff who proceeds reasonably, and with caution, after voluntarily accepting a risk, not unreasonable in itself, may not be guilty of contributory negligence, but may have assumed the risk.\u201d <em>Schroyer, </em>323 Md. at 283, 592 A.2d at 1123 (citing <em>Pinehurst Co. v.

Contrary to the trial judge\u2019s assertion in the present case, <em>Rountree </em>did not make a landlord a guarantor of any harm to tenants.

It specifically emphasized, however, that \"[wjhether the landlord did or did not is another issue and not the one upon which [the] case was decided.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Assumption of the risk is a defense to negligence.

Conversely, if this Court were to accept, as suggested by the courts below, that <em>Rountree </em>is no longer good law, then tenants forced to confront known dangers would always be held to have assumed the risk of a landlord's negligence in failing to maintain a reasonably safe means of egress from the property.
