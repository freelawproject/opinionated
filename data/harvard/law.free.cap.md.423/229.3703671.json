Mr. Pautsch sought judicial review of the Commission\u2019s decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which affirmed in a Memorandum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>Opinion penned by Judge Barry G. Williams, in which he reasoned that there was \u201ccompetent, material and substantial evidence to support\u201d the Commission\u2019s decision, and \u201cthere [was] no evidence to support the allegation that the decision of the Maryland Real Estate Commission was either arbitrary or capricious.\u201d The Court of Special Appeals affirmed in an unreported opinion,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> concluding that the Commission\u2019s \u201cestimation of [Mr. Pautsch\u2019s] trustworthiness was neither arbitrary nor capricious,\u201d and that Mr. Pautsch \u201cfailed to demonstrate any factual or legal error in the Commission\u2019s decision.\u201d We granted certiorari, <em>Pautsch v. Maryland Real Estate Commission, </em>418 Md. 587, 16 A.3d 977 (2011), to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-5\">1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in holding that a four year old conviction for sexual child abuse warrants revocation of Petitioner\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license \u201c[b]e-cause licensure would place members of the public in [Petitioner\u2019s] trust\u201d especially when such a conclusion could apply to <em>any </em>crime and particularly since Petitioner\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>vietions had absolutely no nexus to his work as a real estate broker?

In adopting the ALJ\u2019s finding of fact that \u201c[Petitioner] has and continues to be a respected real estate broker in Anne Arundel County and carries a reputation of professionalism, diligence and respect [and] [h]is real estate practices have never been affected by felonies that he committed or the therapy that he receives,\u201d was it arbitrary and capricious for the Commission to nevertheless conclude that revocation of Petitioner\u2019s real estate license was appropriate because his crimes \u201cundermine his trustworthiness in dealing with the public during the course of providing real estate brokerage services, and negatively impact his character and reputation\u201d?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">We shall hold that the Commission\u2019s determination that there was a nexus between Mr. Pautsch\u2019s real estate licenses and his conviction for child sexual abuse was supported by substantial evidence and that the Commission\u2019s prescribed sanction, revocation, was neither arbitrary nor capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">In July of 2007, the Commission issued a \u201cStatement of Charges and Order for Hearing,\u201d which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-7\">\n<em>STATEMENT OF CHARGES AND ORDER FOR HEARING</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-8\">On February 5, 2007, the Maryland Real Estate Commission filed a complaint against the Respondent, Joel Pautsch, a real estate broker with Providence Realty, LLC. Based on the complaint, and an investigation, the Commission has determined that charges against the Respondent are warranted. Accordingly, in this Order, the Commission will set forth the charges against the Respondent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>The Statement of Charges alleged that Mr. Pautsch violated Section 17 \u2014 322(b)(24)(i) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, because he had been convicted of sex abuse with a minor and child abuse by a parent, and as such, that his real estate license was subject to suspension or revocation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJs\">\n<em>Charges Against the Respondent</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">The Maryland Real Estate Commission hereby charges the Respondent with violating the Real Estate law, Maryland Annotated Code, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-101 et seq. The specific violations of the law are set forth below. The Respondent is advised that these charges, if established following a hearing may result in a suspension or revocation of any real estate license the Respondent currently holds. In addition, in appropriate cases, the Commission may impose a monetary fine of up to $5000.00 per violation, pursuant to Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-322(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-5\">It is alleged that the Respondent has been convicted in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County in <em>State of Maryland v. Joel T. Pautsch, </em>Case No. 02-K-06-001728 IF of Sex Abuse with a Minor, a felony. It is additionally alleged that the Respondent has been convicted in the Circuit Court for <em>Anne Arundel County in State of Maryland v. Joel T. Pautsch, </em>Case No. 02-K-07-000140IN of Child Abuse by Parent, a felony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">Based on the above, it is alleged that the Respondent has violated, and is subject to, Business Occupations and Professions Article, \u00a7\u00a7 17-322(b)(24) and (25) and 17-322(c), which provide:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-7\">\u00a7 17-322 Denials, reprimands, suspensions, revocations, and penalties-Grounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-8\">(b) Grounds: \u2014 Subject to the hearing provisions of \u00a7 17-324 of this subtitle, the Commission may deny a license to any applicant, reprimand any licensee or suspend or revoke a license if the applicant or licensee:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>(24) under the laws of the United States or any state, is convicted of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-4\">(i) a felony;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-5\">(25) engages in conduct that demonstrates bad faith, incompetency, untrustworthiness or that constitutes dishonest, fraudulent or improper dealings</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-6\">(c) Penalty.-(l) Instead of or in addition to suspending or revoking a license, the commission may impose a penalty not exceeding $5000.00 for each violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">The Statement of Charges also reflected that the Commission delegated the task of conducting Mr. Pautsch\u2019s hearing to an administrative law judge at the Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">The ALJ held a hearing during which she heard from an investigator for the Commission who authenticated various exhibits, including reports documenting the Anne Arundel County Police Department\u2019s investigation of Mr. Pautsch, charging documents, docket sheets from Mr. Pautsch\u2019s criminal cases in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, an application to the District Court of Maryland (sitting in Anne Arundel County) for charges against Mr. Pautsch, and a document relating to Mr. Pautsch\u2019s registration as a sex offender. The ALJ heard from nine other witnesses, including Mr. Pautsch himself, and those who were associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>him, such as colleagues and friends, his pastor, and a former client, and also received several exhibits including a record of Mr. Pautsch\u2019s psychotherapy treatment, letters written on his behalf, and a resume of Mr. Pautsch\u2019s professional history and accomplishments.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">In her proposed decision<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> to the Commission, the ALJ made the following findings of fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-6\">1. On January 29, 2007, the Respondent pled guilty to the felony charges of Sex Abuse with a Minor and Child Abuse by Parent in the Anne Arundel County Circuit Court. The victims of the Respondent\u2019s crimes were his daughter and his niece.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b287-7\">2. On March 23, 2007, as a result of the Respondent\u2019s guilty pleas, the Honorable Joseph P. Manck sentenced him to four years in jail with three years suspended. Four months of the year to be served were in the Anne Arundel County Detention Center, with the remaining eight months on house arrest, at which time the Respondent was allowed to work. Judge Manck required the Respondent to register as a child sex offender, to have no unsupervised encounters with minors, and to continue counseling. Judge Manck also ordered that the Respondent be on probation for five years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>The ALJ also made findings regarding Mr. Pautsch\u2019s rehabilitation efforts and other mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-5\">3. The Respondent is currently involved in a church recovery program called \u201cCelebrate Recovery\u201d which is a biblically based twelve step recovery program that addresses many types of addiction issues; it is not limited to alcohol and drug addictions. At least three times per week, he is involved in a Celebrate Recovery activity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-6\">4. The Respondent currently attends therapy and counseling with Jim Gach, Clinical Social Worker. From June 2006 through November 2007, he received psychotherapeutic treatment from James R. David, Ph.D., a private practice psychotherapist and Board certified sex therapist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-7\">5. The Respondent has never previously been the subject of a complaint to the Commission. He has and continues to be a respected real estate broker in Anne Arundel County and carries a reputation of professionalism, diligence and respect. His real estate practices have never been affected by the felonies that he committed or the therapy that he receives.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">The ALJ also captioned a recommendation for sanction as \u201cConclusions of Law\u201d:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-9\">Based upon the foregoing Findings of Fact and Discussion, I conclude, as a matter of law, that the Respondent\u2019s real estate broker\u2019s license should be not be [sic] revoked, but should be suspended for six months to allow additional treatment and therapy prior to the resumption of real estate activities. Md.Code Ann., \u00a7 17-322(d) (Supp.2007). Additionally, I conclude, that a civil penalty of $10,000 is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>appropriate in this case. McLCode Ann. \u00a7 17-322(c) (Supp. 2007).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">Thereafter, the Commission adopted, in a proposed order,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, but rejected the ALJ\u2019s recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>mended sanction of a six-month suspension in favor of revocation. The Commission stated that it disagreed with the ALJ\u2019s recommendation for sanction for a number of reasons, to include that Mr. Pautsch had violated Section 17 \u2014 322(b)(24)(i) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article under circumstances similar to those in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 786 A.2d 763 (2001), which involved the discipline of an attorney after he was convicted of stalking a thirteen year-old boy and also advised Mr. Pautsch of his right to file exceptions. Thereafter, Mr. Pautsch did file exceptions to the Commission\u2019s proposed order,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> which precipitated a hearing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> After the hearing on the exceptions was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>held, during which Mr. Pautsch argued that the \u201cCommission improperly considered only one of five factors in determining that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s licensefs] should be revoked,\u201d the Commission issued a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">In its final order,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Commission adopted the findings of the ALJ and began its analysis by summarizing evidence in the record relating to Mr. Pautsch\u2019s convictions:</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>On January 29, 2007, the Respondent was convicted of two felony counts, sex abuse of a minor and child abuse by a family member, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. The victims of his abuse were his daughter and his niece. The first count to which the Respondent pled guilty, child abuse by a family member of the child, covered a time period from April 27, 1988 through April 27, 1991 (Case No. K-2007-140). The second count to which he pled guilty, sex abuse of a minor, the respondent being the parent of the minor, was count three of the information in Case No. K-2006-1728 and covered the time from October 1, 2003 through January 20, 2006. He was sentenced on March 23, 2007 in the case involving his niece to four years in jail with three years suspended. He was to serve four months in the Anne Arundel County Detention Center, with the remaining eight months on house arrest. He was placed on probation for five years. One of the terms of probation was that he have no unsupervised encounters with children. He was sentenced on the same day in the case involving his daughter to three years in jail, consecutive to the jail sentence in the other case, with the jail time suspended, and the same terms of probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">According to the police report of investigation (Commission\u2019s Exhibit # 6), the Respondent admitted to inappropriate contact with his daughter on a number of occasions, as well as with two nieces, with one niece two to three years before the interview and with the second niece a number of years earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Thereafter, the Commission, in its final order, found that Mr. Pautsch violated Section 17-322(b)(24)(i) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article relating to the effect of a conviction of a felony and discussed the ALJ\u2019s rationale for recommending a six-month suspension of his license:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-4\">It is clear from the records that Respondent violated Section 17-322(b)(24)(i) Business Occupations and Professions (\u201cBOP\u201d) Article, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland. </em>The question for the Commission is what the appropriate sanction should be. The ALJ recommended a six-month suspension of the Respondent\u2019s license based on her finding that there was no nexus between the felonies committed and the activities the Respondent would perform under his real estate license. She noted that he had no prior complaints against him with the Commission, and had not committed any illegal acts in the course of the real estate business. She also noted that he was involved in counseling, therapy, and recovery groups and found that he was credible in his assurance that he would continue in those activities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">In framing its analysis, the Commission stated that it \u201cmust look to five factors in determining what will be an appropriate sanction,\u201d as mandated by Section 17-322(d) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, Maryland Code (1989, 2004 Repl.Vol.):<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-6\">(d) <em>Facts considered.\u2022 </em>\u2014 The Commission shall consider the following facts in the granting, denial, renewal, suspension, or revocation of a license or the reprimand of a licensee when an applicant or licensee is convicted of a felony or misdemeanor described in subsection (b)(24)(i) and (ii) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-7\">(1) the nature of the crime;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-8\">(2) the relationship of the crime to the activities authorized by the license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>(3) with respect to a felony, the relevance of the conviction to the fitness and qualification of the applicant or licensee to provide real estate brokerage services;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-4\">(4) the length of time since the conviction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-5\">(5) the behavior and activities of the applicant or licensee before and after the conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">The Commission emphasized the similarity in the circumstances and implications of Mr. Pautsch\u2019s child abuse and sex abuse crimes with that in <em>Thompson, </em>which also did not occur while the attorney was representing a client:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">In rendering the Recommended Decision, the ALJ rejected the Commission\u2019s citation of the case of <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Thompson, </em>367 Md. 315, 786 A.2d 763 (2001), based on the argument of Respondent\u2019s counsel that the attorney was stalking a child in predatory fashion while his client was not a threat, a risk, or a predator. However, this distinction does not go to the holding of the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision, which the Commission finds controlling in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\">In the <em>Thompson </em>case, the respondent attorney had been convicted of stalking a thirteen-year old boy in violation of the Montgomery County Code. He was sentenced to six months incarceration, with all time suspended, three years probation, one hundred hours of community service and a $1,000 fine. The violation did not involve or occur during his representation of a client, and his plan for his future legal practice tended \u201cto minimize the potential for interactions with children directly as clients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 323, 786 A.2d 763. The Circuit Court Judge who heard the case recommended to the Court of Appeals that the complaint be dismissed in part because \u201cthe Respondent\u2019s conduct did not \u2018evince a character trait relevant or critical to the practice of law,\u2019 and therefore, did not \u2018reflect[] adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321, 786 A.2d 763.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-9\">The Court of Appeals looked instead to the nature of the offense committed, and concluded that the attorney\u2019s actions did \u201cnot resemble, by any standard, those of a responsible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>mature, and trustworthy adult, and clearly violated the unquestioned limits of appropriate adult-child interactions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325, 786 A.2d 763.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">The Commission reasoned that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s crimes, like that in <em>Thompson, </em>involved preying on the vulnerabilities of a child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-5\">The crimes committed by the Respondent involve adult-child interactions. As such, these interactions must be reviewed with close scrutiny. As stated by the Court in <em>Thompson, Id. </em>at 327 [786 A.2d 763]: \u201cBecause of the disparities of power, intellect, maturity, and judgment between the two, children are often without the resources and capabilities, both mentally and physically, to protect themselves from harm. The burden, therefore, is on the adult to act responsibly in his or her interactions with children to preserve their best interests, not to prey on their innocence.\u201d As in <em>Thompson, </em>the Commission finds that the criminal activities of the Respondent do not resemble those of a responsible, mature, and trustworthy adult, and clearly violated the unquestioned limits of appropriate adult-child interaction. <em>Id. </em>at 325 [786 A.2d 763].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Insofar as the second, obviously pivotal to our analysis, aspect, that being the relationship of the crime to the activities authorized by the license, the Commission determined that Mr. Pautsch \u201cmay come into contact with unsupervised children during the course of activities authorized by a real estate license\u201d due to the use of \u201clock box\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> systems:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">The second factor is the relationship of the crime to the activities authorized by the license. Because a real estate license allows an individual access to private homes, and to the residents of those homes, the Commission must take an especially close look at licensees who have been convicted of crimes related to children. Although the Respondent was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>convicted of crimes involving family members, the Commission is nonetheless cognizant of the fact that the Respondent may come into contact with unsupervised children during the course of activities authorized by a real estate license such as use of the \u201clock box\u201d system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">The Commission also emphasized that the concept of trust, as articulated in <em>Thompson, </em>affected their conclusion regarding nexus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-6\">The Commission must also look to the element of trust, as the Court of Appeals did in <em>Thompson. </em>Finding that the attorney\u2019s conduct showed that he could not be trusted around children, the Court said, \u201cThe concept of trust is an inseparable element of any attorney\u2019s practice. It is inconceivable, therefore, how we may authorize and trust Respondent with the enumerable confidential, fiduciary, and trust-based relationships that attorneys, by their profession, are required to maintain in their dealings with their client or the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327 [786 A.2d 763], Real estate licensees similarly owe a duty of trust to the public they serve in a number of ways: handling of monies entrusted by a party to a transaction; keeping the confidences of their clients; treating all parties to the transaction fairly; and protecting the public against fraud, misrepresentation or unethical practices in the real estate field. The Commission concludes that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s history of untrustworthy behavior with children, over a fifteen-year period, goes directly to his trustworthiness and thus negatively affects his ability to engage in activities authorized by a real estate license.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">Regarding the third factor, the Commission determined that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s convictions negatively impacted his fitness and qualifications to \u201cprovide real estate brokerage services,\u201d citing several other of this Court\u2019s attorney grievance decisions for the proposition that professional licenses could be indefinitely suspended or revoked \u201cbased on criminal conduct which is not directly related to the profession which is licensed\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>The third factor is the relevance of the conviction to the fitness and qualifications of the licensee to provide real estate brokerage services. A licensee is required to be of good character and reputation in order to hold a license. See \u00a7 17-305(b) BOP Article, <em>Annotated Code of Maryland. </em>Although Respondent and his witnesses have argued that he is not a threat to the community and that his crimes were not related to his fitness and qualifications to provide real estate services, the commission notes a number of Maryland cases where license holders have been indefinitely suspended or revoked based on criminal conduct which is not directly related to the profession which is licensed. See <em>Thompson, op. cit; Attorney Grievance Commission v. Painter, </em>356 Md. 293 [739 A.2d 24] (1977) [ (1999) ]; <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Lazerow, </em>320 Md. 507 [578 A.2d 779] (1990); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. 184 [747 A.2d 657] (2000); <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373 [758 A.2d 117] (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">With respect to the fourth factor, the Commission reasoned that the length of time of Mr. Pautsch\u2019s abuse of children coupled with the brevity in the amount of time since his convictions were considerations that affected their decision to revoke:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-5\">The fourth factor to be considered is the length of time since the conviction. The Respondent was convicted on January 29, 2007 for sexual abuse incidents which had occurred over a period of fifteen years. He has pleaded guilty to abusing his own daughter over a three-year period. Less than two years time has elapsed since the Respondent\u2019s conviction. After serving a term of confinement of four months and eight months of house arrest, he began his five-year probationary period. He is currently on probation and will remain on that status for several more years. It has been the practice of the Commission not to give a license to a convicted felon until that person has been on probation for a long enough period of time to give the Commission confidence that he or she has shown satisfacto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>ry compliance with the terms ordered by the judge. <em>In the Matter of the Application of Enoch Moon </em>(Case No.2007RE-695; <em>In the Matter of the Application of Hugh N. Addo </em>(Case No. 05-594425); <em>In the Matter of the Application of Joerg Eichelberger </em>(Case No.2005-RE-2610).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Relatedly, the Commission also determined that Mr. Pautsch had a behavioral pattern of re-offending:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-5\">The Commission also notes the long period of time over which the Respondent committed acts of abuse. His illegal conduct extended over a period of more than fifteen years based on the counts to which he pled guilty. Furthermore, according to the police report of investigation, in 2002 he had \u201capologized\u201d to one of his nieces for his earlier abuse of her. However, he pled guilty to sexually abusing his own child from 2003 to 2006, subsequent to the \u201capology\u201d. Based on this history, the Commission believes that a significantly longer period of time is required to assure itself, and the public, that the Respondent has \u201crecovered\u201d and will continue to comply with the terms ordered by the judge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">In analyzing the fifth factor mandated by Section 17-322(d) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, the Commission discussed Mr. Pautsch\u2019s efforts to rehabilitate himself through treatment programs, but placed those efforts in the context of his \u201cviolating] the most basic trust and duty of a parent to preserve the best interests of his child\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">The fifth factor to be considered is the behavior and activities of the licensee before and after the conviction. The ALJ credited the Respondent with taking responsibility for his actions and pleading guilty, and cited the counseling and treatment in which he was engaged. The Commission accepts the ALJ\u2019s findings in this regard, but believes that they do not outweigh the other four factors outlined above. As already noted, the Respondent has demonstrated a pattern of sexual abuse over a fifteen-year period. As a result of that abuse, he violated the most basic trust and duty of a parent to preserve the best interests of his child, not to prey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>on her innocence. Evidence before the Commission indicates that he is currently involved in therapy and recovery programs and the Commission notes his apparent affirmative response to treatment; however, it does not find it determinative, of itself, here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The Commission summarized its conclusions and ultimately determined that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s \u201creal estate license should be revoked\u201d:<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-7\">After weighing all five factors, the Commission concludes that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s criminal convictions are serious in na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>ture, undermine his trustworthiness in <em>dealing </em>with the public during the course of providing real estate brokerage services, and negatively impact his character and reputation. He abused both his niece and daughter over a lengthy period of time; is not far removed in time from the last incident of abuse; and has not yet established a sufficient history of recovery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-4\">Therefore, the Commission has concluded that the Respondent\u2019s real estate license should be revoked. If, at some time in the future, he is able to show a \u201ctrack record sufficient to restore a level of trustworthiness and fitness\u201d to hold a real estate license, he may reapply. <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 332, 786 A.2d at 774.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Section 10-222(a) of the State Government Article provides that \u201ca party who is aggrieved by the final decision in a contested case is entitled to judicial review of the decision.\u201d Section (h) of 10-222 sets forth the scope of judicial review of the final order of an agency:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-7\">(h) <em>Decision. </em>\u2014 In a proceeding under this section, the court may:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-8\">(1) remand the case for further proceedings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-9\">(2) affirm the final decision; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-10\">(3) reverse or modify the decision if any substantial right of the petitioner may have been prejudiced because a finding, conclusion, or decision:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-11\">(i) is unconstitutional;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-12\">(ii) exceeds the statutory authority or jurisdiction of the final decision maker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-13\">(iii) results from an unlawful procedure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-14\">(iv) is affected by any other error of law;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-15\">(v) is unsupported by competent, material, and substantial evidence in light of the entire record as submitted; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-16\">(vi) is arbitrary or capricious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>In reviewing the factual findings of the Commission and its sanction, we adhere to the tenets articulated in <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-4\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-5\">In applying the substantial evidence test, a reviewing court decides whether a reasoning mind reasonably could have reached the factual conclusion the agency reached. A reviewing court should defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is <em>prima facie </em>correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-6\">Despite some unfortunate language that has crept into a few of our opinions, a court\u2019s task on review is <em>not </em>to substitute its judgment for the expertise of those persons who constitute the administrative agency, Even with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency. Thus, an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts. Furthermore, the expertise of the agency in its own field should be respected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b301-7\">[N]o statutory provision or Court of Appeals administrative law opinion has been called to our attention which requires that the imposition of a lawful and authorized sanction, within the discretion of the administrative agency, be justified by findings of fact.... [CJourts owe a higher level of deference to functions specifically committed to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>agency\u2019s discretion than they do to an agency\u2019s legal conclusions or factual findings. Therefore, the discretionary functions of the agency must be reviewed under a standard more deferential than ... the substantial evidence review afforded any agency\u2019s factual findings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\">In sum, when the discretionary sanction imposed upon an employee by an adjudicatory administrative agency is lawful and authorized, the agency need not justify its exercise of discretion by findings of fact or reasons articulating why the agency decided upon the particular discipline. A reviewing court is not authorized to overturn a lawful and authorized sanction unless the disproportionality [of the sanction] or abuse of discretion was so extreme and egregious that the reviewing court can properly deem the decision to be arbitrary or capricious. Furthermore, the employing agency does not have the burden, in the reviewing court, of justifying such a sanction. Instead, in accordance with the principle that the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, the burden in a judicial review action is upon the party challenging the sanction to persuade the reviewing court that the agency abused his discretion and that the decision was so extreme and egregious that it constituted arbitrary or capricious agency action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhM\"><em>Id. </em>at 571-572, 580-81, 873 A.2d at 1154-55, 1159-60 (footnotes omitted) (citations omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">With respect to his first certiorari question, Mr. Pautsch argues that the Commission concluded, without substantial evidence, that there was a nexus between his criminal convictions and his position as a real estate professional, as required by Section 17-322(d)(2) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">(d) <em>Facts considered. </em>\u2014 The Commission shall consider the following facts in the granting, denial, renewal, suspension, or revocation of a license or the reprimand of a licensee when an applicant or licensee is convicted of a felony or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>misdemeanor described in subsection (b)(24)(i) and (ii) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-4\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-5\">(2) the relationship of the crime to the activities authorized by the license;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">(3) with respect to a felony, the relevance of the conviction to the fitness and qualification of the applicant or licensee to provide real estate brokerage services[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In addition, Mr. Pautsch insists that our decision must take into account the \u201cpolicy of the State to encourage employment of nonviolent ex-offenders,\u201d pursuant to Section 1 \u2014 209(c) of the Criminal Procedure Article, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">(c) <em>State policy. </em>\u2014 It is the policy of the State to encourage the employment of nonviolent ex-offenders and remove barriers to their ability to demonstrate fitness for occupational licenses or certifications required by the State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Supp.).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Further, Mr. Pautsch asserts that the Commission could not revoke his licenses, unless \u201cthere [was] a direct relationship between [his] previous conviction and [his] specific occupational license,\u201d pursuant to Section 1-209(d) of the Criminal Procedure Article, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-10\">(d) <em>Prohibition; exception. </em>\u2014 A department may not deny an occupational license or certificate to an applicant solely on the basis that the applicant has previously been convicted of a crime, unless the department determines that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-11\">(1) there is a direct relationship between the applicant\u2019s previous conviction and the specific occupational license or certificate sought; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-12\">(2) the issuance of the license or certificate would involve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of specific individuals or the general public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>In deriving a nexus between Mr. Pautsch\u2019s convictions and the activities engendered under his real estate license, the Commission found convincing the fact that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s real estate licenses allow \u201caccess to private homes, and to the residents of those homes\u201d by virtue of a \u201clock box\u201d system:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az0\">Because a real estate license allows an individual access to private homes, and to the residents of those homes, the Commission must take an especially close look at licensees who have been convicted of crimes related to children. Although the Respondent was convicted of crimes involving family members, the Commission is nonetheless cognizant of the fact that the Respondent may come into contact with unsupervised children during the course of activities authorized by a real estate license such as use of the \u201clock box\u201d system.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">As reflected in the transcript of the administrative hearing before the ALJ, which the Commission entered into evidence,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Mr. Pautsch testified that, when he \u201cshow[s] homes, people are typically not there,\u201d and that he uses a \u201ckey lock box that registers [him] at the house\u201d to do so:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">When I show homes, people are typically not there. If they are there, they\u2019re there with adults. When I do show houses I have to make an appointment with them and I have to use a key lock box that registers me at the house and so there\u2019s not even an opportunity without being incriminated to ever have contact with children.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Mr. Pautsch, however, asserts that because the record is \u201cabsolutely devoid of any testimony or documentary evidence that refers to or explains the lock box system,\u201d the Commission could not rely on the lock box system as one of its considerations. In essence, he argues that there needed to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>expert or other testimony adduced to apprise the Real Estate Commission regarding how a lock box and its myriad iterations operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">In <em>Noland, </em>however, we recognized our longstanding practice of respecting an agency\u2019s expertise \u201cin its own field\u201d when we conduct our review of its decisions. 386 Md. at 572, 873 A.2d at 1154-55. In the instant case, it is difficult to comprehend how the Commission, as the regulatory body for the real estate profession in Maryland, is not specially equipped to comprehend the functionality of lock box systems, notwithstanding allegations that the systems are multifaceted, especially because, of the Commission\u2019s nine members, five are licensed real estate professionals. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (2000, 2004 Repl.Vol.), Section 17-202(a) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Mr. Pautsch also disputes the Commission\u2019s reliance on our decision in <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 315, 786 A.2d at 763, in which we indefinitely suspended an attorney after he had been convicted of stalking a thirteen-year old boy, albeit not within the framework of his law practice. Specifically, Mr. Pautsch asserts that the legal profession is governed by higher standards of conduct than the real estate profession, and thus, that the Commission was not at liberty, whatsoever, to consult our attorney grievance jurisprudence for guidance. In its brief, the Commission responds that, like lawyers, real estate professionals \u201cpractice in a very public context and, once licensed, bear the imprimatur of the State,\u201d and that our attorney grievance jurisprudence \u201cprovides standards that can be applied to real estate brokers, as persuasive authority if not as direct precedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">The Commission, in its final order, embraced the reasoning contained in <em>Thompson, </em>because Mr. Thompson\u2019s conviction of stalking a thirteen-year old boy did not \u201cinvolve or occur during his representation of a client,\u201d and his plan for his future legal practice tended to \u201cminimize the potential for interactions with children directly as clients,\u201d <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 323, 786 A.2d at 768, as compared to Mr. Pautsch\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>convictions, which did not occur during the exercise of his duties as a real estate professional. The Commission\u2019s finding that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s convictions for child abuse were analogous to those in <em>Thompson </em>was based on Exhibit # 6 before the Commission, which was summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-4\">According to the police report of investigation (Commission\u2019s Exhibit # 6), the Respondent admitted to inappropriate contact with his daughter on a number of occasions, as well as with two nieces, with one niece two to three years before the interview and with the second niece a number of years earlier.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">The Commission found it significant that the <em>Thompson </em>opinion analyzed the character traits that were lacking when a professional committed child stalking:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-6\">The Circuit Court Judge who heard the case recommended to the Court of Appeals that the complaint be dismissed in part because \u201cthe Respondent\u2019s conduct did not \u2018evince a character trait relevant or critical to the practice of law\u2019, and therefore, did not \u2018reflect[ ] adversely on his fitness as a lawyer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321 [786 A.2d 763]. The Court of Appeals looked instead to the nature of the offense committed, and concluded that the attorney\u2019s actions did \u201cnot resemble, by any standard, those of a responsible, mature, and trustworthy adult, and clearly violated the unquestioned limits of appropriate adult-child interaction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 325 [786 A.2d 763].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">Looking again to <em>Thompson, </em>the Commission found that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s exploitation of the \u201cdisparities of power, intellect, maturity, and judgment\u201d between himself and minor children reflected an unqualified lack of responsibility, maturity, and trustworthiness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b306-8\">As stated by the Court in <em>Thompson, Id. </em>at 327 [786 A.2d 763]: \u201cBecause of the disparities of power, intellect, maturity, and judgment between the two, children are often without the resources and capabilities, both mentally and physically, to protect themselves from harm. The burden, therefore, is on the adult to act responsibly in his or her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>interactions with children to preserve their best interests, not to prey on their innocence.\u201d As in <em>Thompson, </em>the Commission finds that the criminal activities of the Respondent do not resemble those of a responsible, mature, and trustworthy adult, and clearly violated the unquestioned limits of appropriate adult-child interaction. <em>Id. </em>at 325, 786 A.2d 763.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">According to the Commission, Mr. Pautsch\u2019s case \u201cpresent[ed] a more compelling case for discipline than Thompson,\u201d because Mr. Pautsch actually sexually abused children.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">Referring to our analysis in <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 315, 786 A.2d at 763, the Commission analogized Mr. Thompson\u2019s ability to engage in \u201ctrust-based relationships\u201d in the legal profession after being convicted of victimizing a minor child to Mr. Pautsch\u2019s ability to engage in trust-based relationships in the real estate profession after doing the same.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Commission noted that, in <em>Thompson\\, </em>we determined that \u201cthe concept of trust\u201d was an \u201cinseparable element of any attorney\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>practice\u201d and that it was \u201cinconceivable ... how we may authorize and trust [Mr. Thompson] with the enumerable confidential, fiduciary, and trust-based relationships that attorneys, by their profession, are required to maintain in their dealings with their client or the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 327, 786 A.2d at 771. Comparing Mr. Pautsch\u2019s crimes with that in <em>Thompson, </em>the Commission similarly determined that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s \u201chistory of untrustworthy behavior with children, over a fifteen-year period, goes directly to his trustworthiness and thus negatively affects his ability to engage in activities authorized by a real estate license.\u201d The Commission found that the real estate profession, like the legal profession, entailed several duties to clients and the public alike:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\">Real estate licensees similarly owe a duty of trust to the public they serve in a number of ways: handling of monies entrusted by a party to a transaction; keeping the confidences of their clients; treating all parties to the transaction fairly; and protecting the public against fraud, misrepresentation or unethical practices in the real estate field.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">With respect to the issue of nexus, the Commission also found that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s child abuse convictions negatively impacted Mr. Pautsch\u2019s fitness to be a real estate professional. In so doing, the Commission referred to Section 17-305(b) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, which states that a real estate professional \u201cshall be of good character and reputation,\u201d and referred to various attorney grievance cases, including <em>Thompson, </em>in which this Court determined that misconduct which was not directly related to the practice of law nevertheless bore negatively upon an attorney\u2019s fitness to practice.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In <em>Attorney Grievance v. Childress, </em>360 Md. 373, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>758 A.2d 117 (2000), for instance, the Commission found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>persuasive that this Court deemed an attorney\u2019s solicitation of sex over the internet with who he believed to be minor girls \u201clikely to impair public confidence in the profession, [have] an impact on the legal profession, and engender disrespect for the court,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 386, 758 A.2d at 123, despite Mr. Childress\u2019s claim that his \u201cconduct was purely personal\u201d and \u201cunrelated to the practice of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381-82, 758 A.2d at 121. The Commission also found instructive that, in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Dechowitz, </em>358 Md. 184, 747 A.2d 657 (2000), this Court determined that an attorney\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute marijuana was \u201ca criminal act that reflects adversely on his honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190, 747 A.2d at 660. Further, as it bore on its determination of nexus, the Commission found useful our decision in <em>Attorney Grievance v. Painter, </em>356 Md. 293, 739 A.2d 24 (1999), in which we characterized an attorney\u2019s convictions on handgun and battery charges \u201cas prejudicial to the administration of justice and maybe even as impacting adversely that attorney\u2019s fitness to practice law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 305, 739 A.2d at 31. Similarly, the Commission was influenced by our decision in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Lazerow, </em>320 Md. 507, 578 A.2d 779 (1990), in which we disbarred a non-practicing attorney for \u201cus[ing] in excess of $ 200,000 of home purchasers\u2019 down payments, statutorily required to be held in escrow accounts, to pay bills\u201d in connection with his construction of low income housing. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 578 A.2d at 779.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Clearly, there was substantial evidence upon which the Commission relied to support its finding that there was a nexus between Mr. Pautseh\u2019s convictions and his professional activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Relatedly, however, Mr. Pautsch asserts that Section 1-209 of the Criminal Procedure Article, Maryland Code (2001, 2008 Repl.Vol., 2009 Supp.) precluded the Commission from revoking Mr. Pautsch\u2019s license because that statute requires a \u201cdirect relationship\u201d to be shown between the convictions and a \u201cspecific occupational license.\u201d Mr. Pautsch argues that this statute establishes the policy of the State to require a direct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>relationship. The Commission responds that Section 1-209 is inapplicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Mr. Pautsch has raised Section 1-209 of the Criminal Procedure Article for the first time in these judicial review proceedings before this Court, even though the statute became effective on October 1, 2009, some five months before he briefed the issues in the Court of Special Appeals. Therefore, any consideration of Section 1-209 may not be preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Even were we to address Mr. Pautsch\u2019s argument regarding the statute, however, Section 1-209 was not in effect at the time that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s licenses were revoked. Thus, retroactivity would be implicated, and we have long adhered to four principles in such matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">(1) statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent appears; (2) a statute governing procedure or remedy will be applied to cases pending in court when the statute becomes effective; (3) a statute will be given retroactive effect if that is the legislative intent; but (4) even if intended to apply retroactively, a statute will not be given that effect if it would impair vested rights, deny due process, or violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A35\"><em>State Ethics Comm\u2019n v. Evans, </em>382 Md. 370, 381, 855 A.2d 364, 370 (2004), quoting <em>Allstate Insurance Co. v. Kim, </em>376 Md. 276, 289, 829 A.2d 611, 618 (2003). We have distilled the above principles into a two-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">First, we must determine whether the Legislature intended the statute to have the kind of retroactive effect that is asserted. That implicates the first and third principles. Applying the presumption of prospectivity, a statute will be found to operate retroactively only when the Legislature \u2018clearly expresses an intent that the statute apply retroactively.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-8\">If we conclude that the Legislature <em>did </em>intend for the statute to have retroactive effect, we must then examine whether such effect would contravene some Constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>right or prohibition. That implicates the second and fourth principles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-5\"><em>Evans, </em>382 Md. at 381-82, 855 A.2d at 370, quoting <em>Kim, </em>376 Md. at 289-90, 829 A.2d at 618-19. The presumption against retroactivity is rebutted only when there are \u201cclear expressions in the statute to the contrary\u201d by way of \u201cexpress language or necessary implication.\u201d <em>McHale v. DCW Dutchship Island, LLC, </em>415 Md. 145, 159, 999 A.2d 969, 977 (2010) (internal citations omitted). Moreover, \u201ca statute, though applied only in legal proceedings subsequent to its effective date and in that sense, at least, prospective, is, when applied so as to determine the legal significance of acts or events that occurred prior to its effective date, applied retroactively.\u201d <em>Kim, </em>376 Md. at 289-90, 829 A.2d at 618-19, quoting <em>State Comm\u2019n on Human Rel. v. Amecom Division, </em>278 Md. 120, 123, 360 A.2d 1, 3-4 (1976). Thus, \u201c[c]ontext becomes important.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Pautsch, however, cites us to nothing in the legislative record, nor have we found anything in that record, that would rebut the presumption against retroactivity.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">We note, finally, that the policy implicated by Section 1-209 of the Criminal Procedure Article does not apply to Mr. Pautsch, as he is not a \u201cnonviolent ex-offender\u201d as the statute demands. Section l-209(b) expressly excludes convictions for crimes of violence \u201cas defined in \u00a7 14-101 of the Criminal Law Article\u201d from its coverage. Section 14-101(a)(16) of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2002, 2007 Supp.), defines \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as including \u201csexual abuse of a minor,\u201d for which Mr. Pautsch stands convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">Mr. Pautsch, in his second certiorari question, asserts that the revocation of his licenses was arbitrary and capricious.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> He asserts that the Commission\u2019s adoption of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ALJ\u2019s mitigating findings of fact, coupled with nothing \u201cto refute these findings,\u201d precluded the Commission from departing from the ALJ\u2019s recommended sanction of a six month suspension.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Commission responds that, as a discretionary matter, it was entitled to determine that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s mitigating evidence was unavailing to overcome the \u201cCommission\u2019s overriding responsibility to protect the public.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">In <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 556, 873 A.2d at 1145, we reviewed the Maryland Aviation Administration\u2019s termination of the employment of a paramedic, who had twice struck a combative psychiatric prisoner with a closed fist. The ALJ from the Office of Administrative Hearings found that Mr. Noland had not violated the \u201cManagement\u2019s Workplace Violence Policy,\u201d because he \u201c\u2018did not strike the Patient out of anger, but rather to prevent or reduce possible exposure to an infectious disease,\u2019 \u201d and his \u201c \u2018actions were not done for the purpose of intimidation, or for the purpose of harming, damaging, or causing injury to persons or property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 562, 873 A.2d at 1149. The ALJ recommended a sanction of suspension rather than termination, in part, because Mr. Noland had never been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>subject to disciplinary action and had always received \u201csuperi- or\u201d or \u201cexceed[s] standards\u201d on his employment evaluations. <em>Id. </em>at 563-64, 873 A.2d at 1149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">Thereafter, the Administration filed exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s decision, and the Secretary appointed a designee to consider them. The designee adopted all of the ALJ\u2019s findings and sustained all of the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law save one: that Mr. Noland had not violated the Management\u2019s Workplace Violence Policy. The designee \u201cdisagree[d], as a matter of law, with the reasoning of the ALJ,\u201d explaining that he believed that \u201c[striking a restrained and handcuffed patient with a closed fist is not acceptable,\u201d that it was \u201can unjustified act of violence,\u201d and that it was intended \u201cto intimidate the patient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564-565, 873 A.2d at 1150. Ultimately, the designee concluded that termination was the appropriate sanction, adding that, considering the \u201cfacts of the incident,\u201d Mr. Noland\u2019s \u201cstellar record was irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 564-565, 873 A.2d at 1150.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Mr. Noland sought judicial review, arguing that the Administration\u2019s sanction was arbitrary and capricious. The Circuit Court agreed and reversed the Administration\u2019s sanction, reasoning that the agency gave \u201cinsufficient consideration to what the court believed were substantial mitigating factors.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 567, 873 A.2d at 1152. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed, reasoning that \u201cwhile it may \u2018always be unwarranted conduct for a physician or a paramedic to strike his or her patient, that does not mean that the force is always excessive under the circumstances, especially where that individual is acting in self-defense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 569, 873 A.2d at 1153.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">We reversed and ordered that the Administration\u2019s sanction be affirmed. In framing our analysis, we instructed that, \u201c[a] reviewing court is not authorized to overturn a lawful and authorized sanction unless the disproportionality [of the sanction] or abuse of discretion was so extreme and egregious that the reviewing court can properly deem the decision to be arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 581, 873 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>1160, quoting <em>MTA v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 291, 799 A.2d 1246, 1255-56 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Because the Administration was authorized by law to terminate an employee, the burden fell upon Mr. Noland to demonstrate that the sanction \u201c \u2018was so extreme and egregious\u2019 that it amounted to \u2018arbitrary or capricious\u2019 action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 873 A.2d at 1161. In concluding that Mr. Noland failed to meet his burden of proof, we stated that evidence that \u201c\u2018it was never warranted to strike a patient,\u2019 \u201d coupled with the details of Mr. Noland\u2019s misconduct, was sufficient to \u201cpreclude a reviewing court from holding that the administrative decision was arbitrary or capricious.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 582, 873 A.2d at 1161.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">In the case before us, it is undisputed that Section 17-322(b)(24)(i) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article authorizes the Commission to \u201csuspend or revoke\u201d a real estate professional\u2019s licenses if, \u201cunder the laws of the United States or of any state,\u201d he is convicted of \u201ca felony.\u201d Beyond lawfulness and authority, then, the only issue is whether Mr. Pautsch has shown that the Commission\u2019s sanction was so extreme and egregious that it amounted to arbitrary and capricious agency action. Based upon the testimony and the exhibits before it, the Commission found that Mr. Pautsch had been engaged in sexually abusive behavior towards minor children throughout a \u201cfifteen-year period,\u201d and that, according to the Commission, showed a lack of responsibility, maturity, and trustworthiness on the part of Mr. Pautsch, as a real estate professional, which prevents a finding that the Commission\u2019s sanction was arbitrary or capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.

There is no need to interpret these provisions so that \u00a7 17-322(b)(24)(i) excludes felonies that could also fall within \u00a7 17-322(b)(25). Moreover, under Appellant's theory, the highly relevant factors of \u00a7 17-322(d) could not apply to these felonies because they apply only to \"a felony or misdemeanor described in subsection (b)(24)(i) and (ii) of this section.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b308-6\">.

Within two years, however, the Supreme Court of Oregon, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number><em>Kerley v. Real Estate Agency, </em>337 Or. 309, 96 P.3d 1211 (2004) affirmed the revocation of the license of a real estate professional for convictions unrelated to his work as an agent and broker, thereby limiting the <em>Dearborn </em>analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Mr. Pautsch also proffers the case of <em>In the Matter of Dillingham, </em>257 N.C. 684, 127 S.E.2d 584 (1962) for the proposition that a conviction for operating a disorderly house (prostitution) was unrelated to his licensure as a real estate broker. The court, under the statute in effect at the time, determined that revocation of the license was not appropriate. Subsequently, under a statute that spoke more to the Maryland statutory scheme in issue here, the Court revoked the license of a real estate professional, and noted \"In <em>Dillingham, </em>the Court found the words \u2018any of the acts mentioned herein\u2019 must mean \u2018the acts of a real estate broker or real estate salesman <em>for which a license is required'. </em>A license is required in order to sell or offer to sell, buy or offer to buy any real estate. N.C.G.S. Sec. 93A-2. That the current statute omits the words 'any of the acts mentioned herein' is significant: unless the specific provision provides otherwise, the amended statute permits the Commission to suspend or revoke a license issued pursuant to N.C.G.S. Sec. 93A-4 for any of the acts enumerated in N.C.G.S. Sec. 93A-6(a)l-12 without regard to whether the acts were connected in any way with the pursuit of the licensed privilege of a real estate broker or salesman.\u201d <em>Watson v. North Carolina Real Estate Comm\u2019n, </em>87 N.C.App. 637, 362 S.E.2d 294, 301 (1987), <em>cert. denied, </em>321 N.C. 746, 365 S.E.2d 296 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Mr. Pautsch also refers us to <em>Missouri Real Estate Commission v. Berger, </em>764 S.W.2d 706 (Mo.App.1989) as identical to his case. Mr. Berger had been convicted of conspiracy to distribute cocaine in federal court, but the only evidence before the ALJ was the conviction itself and nothing beyond, even with regard to Mr. Berger's participation in the crime. Such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Another case Mr. Pautsch poses as influential is <em>Powell v. Paine, </em>221 W.Va. 458, 655 S.E.2d 204 (2007), in which a public high school teacher was charged with felony child abuse for beating his son and pled guilty to one count of domestic battery. Thereafter, the Superintendent of Schools recommended to the county board of education that his teaching license be suspended pursuant to a statute which required \"a <em>rational nexus </em>between the conduct of the teacher and the performance of his or her job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 208. The board upheld the suspension. The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia reversed, determining that there was no finding regarding \"how Appellant's cruelty toward his son can, will or even may be anticipated to affect Appellant's performance of his school job,\u201d and the record was devoid of any evidence of nexus. <em>Id. </em>at 210-11. Again, such is not the case here.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Mr. Pautsch also refers us to <em>Brewer </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>93 Cal.App.3d 358, 155 Cal.Rptr. 643 (1979), in which the California intermediate appellate court determined that there was no proof of nexus between the conviction for annoying and molesting children and fitness to sell cars. The only evidence was Mr. Brewer\u2019s conviction for the crime without more. Again, such is not the situation in the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b312-8\">. Initially, Mr. Pautsch asserts that the sanction given in <em>Thompson, </em>367 Md. at 315, 786 A.2d at 763, that of an indefinite suspension, was not the same sanction given him by the Commission, revocation. Section 17-322(b) of the Business Occupations and Professions Article, however, does not authorize the Commission to \"indefinitely suspend\u201d a real estate professional\u2019s license.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b313-5\">. Relatedly, Mr. Pautsch asserts that <em>Attorney Grievance v. Marcalus, </em>414 Md. 501, 996 A.2d 350 (2010) is relevant to the issue of sanction, because Mr. Pautsch \u201cconfessed his indiscretion,\u201d \"asked for forgiveness,\u201d and was not deemed \"a threat to the community\u201d by his board certified sex therapist. The suggestion appears to be that the existence of mitigation <em>per se </em>always requires a lesser sanction, which is not valid. We have disbarred attorneys in the face of mitigating evidence. See <em>Attorney Grievance v. Coppola, </em>419 Md. 370, 397-401, 19 A.3d 431, 447-49 (2011), for example, in which we disbarred an attorney for misconduct related to assisting in the forging of estate documents despite the presence of mitigation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b313-6\">. Preliminarily, Mr. Pautsch asserted that the Commission \u201cfailed to properly exercise discretion,\u201d in considering the length of time since his convictions, because it considered its practice \u201cnot to give a license to a convicted felon until that person has been on probation for a long enough period of time to give the Commission confidence that he or she has shown satisfactory compliance with the terms ordered by the judge.\u201d This argument has no merit, however, as the Commission also considered and found persuasive the fact that Mr. Pautsch\u2019s \"sexual abuse ... had occurred over a period of fifteen years,\u201d as opposed to the length of time since his conviction, which the Commission found was \u201cless than two years.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
