Vol.), \u00a7 14-404 of the Health-Occupations Article, provides, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board of Physicians (\u201cBoard\u201d) has the authority to sanction a physician licensed in Maryland if the licensee: \u201cis guilty of: Immoral ... or unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine,\u201d \u00a7 14-404(a)(3); \u201cWillfully makes or files a false report or record in the practice of medicine,\u201d \u00a7 14-404(a)(ll); or \u201cWillfully makes a false representation when seeking or making application for licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine,\u201d \u00a7 14-404(a)(36). This case calls upon us to determine whether the Board erred in finding that Petitioner Charles Y. Kim violated each of the above subsections of \u00a7 14-404,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> when he falsely indicated on an application for renewal of his license that he was not involved in a medical malpractice action. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the Board committed no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Petitioner came to the United States in 1973. He received his initial license to practice medicine in Maryland in 1977. He practices in the area of Obstetrics and Gynecology and is board certified.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In June 2005, a medical malpractice lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, naming Petitioner as a defendant (\u201cthe Wagner case\u201d). Petitioner answered the complaint in July 2005, and was deposed in November 2005. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>Wagner case was pending when, on February 23, 2006, Petitioner filed an application for renewal of his privileges at Frederick Memorial Hospital. The application asked: \u201cHave any professional liability or malpractice claims been made against you during the past two years?\u201d Petitioner initially marked \u201cNo\u201d in response to that question but then amended his response and marked \u201cYes.\u201d Petitioner also submitted a handwritten addendum to the application. The addendum provided additional information about three malpractice matters: two concluded matters and the Wagner case, which was scheduled to be tried in November 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">Then, on August 15, 2006, Petitioner filed with the Board an application for Renewal of Medical License (\u201cthe application\u201d). The application included three questions relevant to the present matter, to all of which Petitioner responded \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">CHARACTER AND FITNESS QUESTIONS</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">6.

Are you, or any member of your immediate family or household, currently a party in a medical malpractice case?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">In November 2006, Petitioner\u2019s counsel was attempting to schedule a Case Resolution Conference (\u201cCRC\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for an unrelated matter. During the conversation with the Assistant Attorney General who was prosecuting the matter on behalf of the Board, Petitioner\u2019s counsel revealed that Petitioner was scheduled to be in court on the date proposed for the CRC in that unrelated matter. That disclosure led to further investigation by the Board, which learned that Petitioner, despite the responses provided in his license renewal application, had been involved in a malpractice action at the time he submitted his application in August 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">On March 5, 2007, the Board charged Petitioner with violating the three subsections of \u00a7 14-404 that we mentioned at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>the outset: subsection (a)(3), which prohibits unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine; (a)(ll), which prohibits the willful making of a false report or record in the practice of medicine; and (a)(36), which prohibits the willful making of a false representation when making an application for licensure or any other application related to the practice of medicine. The Board requested that Petitioner be reprimanded, take a course on ethics, and be required to pay a $10,000 f\u00edne.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">\n<em>Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Petitioner asked for and received a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) of the Office of Administrative Hearings. Petitioner moved to dismiss the charges, asserting that the Board impermissibly pursued the charges based on confidential information received from Petitioner\u2019s counsel while scheduling the unrelated CRC. Petitioner relied in support of his argument on COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d), which provides: \u201cExcept for consideration of a proposed resolution of a case achieved through the CRC, the Board may not make later use of any commentary, admissions, facts revealed, or positions taken, <em>unless the subject matter is available from other sources or is otherwise discovered.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The ALJ denied the motion, in a written order, on three grounds: knowledge of the existence of the Wagner case was available from two other sources, the Maryland Health Claims Arbitration Office and the public judiciary website; the information Petitioner\u2019s counsel had disclosed was unrelated to the merits of the CRC proceedings; and, in any event, the Board had relied, not on counsel\u2019s disclosure but rather, on information discovered through its own investigation and obtained from other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The merits hearing took place on July 12, 2007. The compliance analyst who reviewed Petitioner\u2019s renewal application testified that it was routine for the Board to obtain all filings from the Health Claims Arbitration Office and review renewal applications filed during the pendency of a Board investigation. The analyst further testified that information provided on renewal applications is verified through informa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>tion obtained from the Health Claims Arbitration Office. She became aware of the medical malpractice claim against Petitioner before he renewed his application, and the Health Claims Arbitration filing (in the Wagner case) was part of the Board\u2019s record prior to the investigation of the unrelated matter in 2006. The analyst also testified that she was prompted to review Petitioner\u2019s application after learning from the Assistant Attorney General for the Board that Petitioner would be in circuit court in December 2006. She then searched for Petitioner\u2019s name on the judiciary case information website.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\">Petitioner testified that he attended medical school in Korea and then came to the United States in 1973. He completed a three-year residency, in English, and received his Maryland license to practice medicine in 1977. He passed separate written and oral exams, both administered in English, in 1983. He speaks English on a regular basis with his patients and colleagues. He added, though, that he has some difficulty understanding certain aspects of the English language, \u201cespecially legal or written.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Petitioner admitted that he had knowledge of the Wagner case since 2005, had met with his attorney, and was deposed in connection with that matter on November 9, 2005. Petitioner explained his responses to the questions on the license renewal application. Beginning with question 6(m), Petitioner testified that he did not intend to deceive the Board; rather, he had read \u201cfiling or settlement\u201d as \u201cfiling <em>and </em>settlement\u201d (emphasis added); moreover, because the Wagner case had not settled, he believed the correct response to question 6(m) was \u201cno.\u201d As for question 13(f), Petitioner testified that he understood the question to pertain only to family or household members, not himself. Petitioner further testified that he failed to respond to questions 21 through 31 when he filed the application, and, when it was returned to him, his wife assisted him in completing the remainder of the application. Petitioner acknowledged that he signed the affirmation at the end of the renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s license renewal application was admitted into evidence. Also admitted was Petitioner\u2019s application for renewal of privileges at Frederick Memorial Hospital, which predated his license renewal application and acknowledged the pending Wagner case.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The ALJ issued a Proposed Decision on November 29, 2007. The ALJ determined that Petitioner\u2019s conduct was unprofessional and occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine,\u201d because the information withheld in the license renewal application involved the \u201cdelivery of patient care in those matters that led to the filing of a malpractice claim.\u201d The ALJ also found that Petitioner knew of the pending malpractice case and had a duty to disclose that information in the license renewal application. The ALJ reasoned that, because the Board relies on the information provided to assess physicians\u2019 fitness, the failure to disclose information regarding pending malpractice claims constitutes \u201cserious misconduct that may involve substantial risk of harm to patients, and may diminish the standing of the medical profession as caregivers.\u201d The ALJ further concluded that the conduct was unprofessional because physicians are required to provide truthful information on renewal applications.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The ALJ also concluded that Petitioner acted willfully because he \u201cintended to provide the false statements that he submitted to the Board, and that his acts were not accidental or inadvertent.\u201d The ALJ rejected Petitioner\u2019s argument that \u201cwillful\u201d contains the element of bad motive or knowledge that the acts were unlawful. The ALJ further rejected Petitioner\u2019s testimony that he merely had misunderstood the question. In that regard, the ALJ concluded that Petitioner had practiced medicine in Maryland for thirty years, lived in the United States for approximately thirty-three years, completed a three-year residency, completed oral and written exams in English, conversed with both patients and colleagues in English, and completed approximately fifteen license renewal applications during his practice. The ALJ recommended that Petitioner be reprimanded, fined $5,000, and be required to take an ethics course.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>The Board heard Petitioner\u2019s exceptions to the ALJ\u2019s proposed order on February 27, 2008. The Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order adopted the majority of the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> as well as the ALJ\u2019s conclusions of law that Petitioner had acted \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d and \u201cwillfully.\u201d As sanctions, the Board placed Petitioner on six months\u2019 probation, fined him $5,000, and required him to complete an ethics course.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">\n<em>Judicial Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">Petitioner filed a Petition for Judicial Review in the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland. Petitioner raised the following claims of error: (1) the ALJ erred in denying the motion to dismiss the charges on the ground that they stemmed from a violation of COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d); (2) the ALJ erred in concluding that \u201cthe act of filing an application for renewal of a license constitutes the practice of medicine\u201d; (3) \u201cthe ALJ erred in concluding that a \u2018false report in the practice of medicine\u2019 includes an application for renewal of a license, when no such interpretation has been made by statute or case law\u201d; (4) the ALJ erred in finding that Petitioner willfully made a false representation in the renewal application; and (5) the ALJ erred in declining to dismiss the charges, for lack of substantial evidence. Following a hearing on the petition, the Circuit Court affirmed the Board\u2019s decision in a written opinion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Petitioner noted an appeal to the Court of Special of Appeals, which also affirmed the Board\u2019s decision. <em>Kim v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>196 Md.App. 362, 367, 9 A.3d 534, 537 (2010). That court held, with regard to the Board\u2019s use of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s counsel\u2019s statement made during the scheduling of the CRC, that COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7) did not apply because the statement was not substantive in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 372, 9 A.3d at 540. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned that, even if the regulation applied, the regulation\u2019s specific exemption for information available from other sources would permit its use nevertheless. <em>Id. </em>at 372-73, 9 A.3d at 540.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">The Court of Special Appeals held that the Board did not err in deciding that Petitioner violated \u00a7 14-404(a)(3). The court reasoned that Petitioner\u2019s conduct \u201cwas sufficiently intertwined with the \u2018effective delivery of patient care\u2019 \u201d to be deemed \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because non-disclosure of pending malpractice cases on an application for license renewal interferes with the Board\u2019s ability to investigate. <em>Id. </em>at 377, 9 A.3d at 543. In so holding, the intermediate appellate court looked to <em>Cornfeld v. State Board of Physicians, </em>174 Md.App. 456, 921 A.2d 893, <em>cert. denied, </em>400 Md. 647, 929 A.2d 890 (2007). There, the court, relying in part on the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute it administered, held that the physician was engaged \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d when he lied to a peer review committee and the Board during their respective investigations of his conduct during a patient\u2019s surgery. <em>Kim, </em>196 Md.App. at 377-78, 9 A.3d at 542-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">The Court of Special Appeals further held that there was substantial evidence to support the Board\u2019s decision that Petitioner\u2019s conduct was willful, for purposes of \u00a7 14-404(a)(11) and (36). 196 Md.App. at 382, 9 A.3d at 546. The intermediate appellate court rejected Petitioner\u2019s assertion that \u201cwillful\u201d required the intent to deceive. <em>Id. </em>at 379, 9 A.3d at 544. That court affirmed the Board\u2019s findings that Petitioner had knowledge of the Wagner case and intended to provide his responses on the application. <em>Id. </em>at 380, 9 A.3d at 545.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">We granted Petitioner\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari to answer three questions, which Petitioner frames as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALE5\">1. An Assistant Attorney General for the [Board] used statements made by counsel for Dr. Kim concerning a Case Resolution Conference (CRC) to bring this action against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Dr. Kim. Should the [Board] be permitted to use information obtained through the CRC process to bring a new action against a physician?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">2. The [Board] charged Dr. Kim with \u201cunprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine\u201d and with willfully making or filing \u201ca false report or record in the practice of medicine.\u201d Is completing a renewal application for a physician\u2019s license acting \u201cin the practice of medicine?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">3. The [Board] also charged Dr. Kim with \u201cwillfully\u201d making false representations when making application for licensure to practice medicine. Dr. Kim\u2019s testimony clearly indicated that he has difficulty with English. Should the [Board] be permitted to charge and punish a physician for \u201cwillfully\u201d making false representations, when the physician did not understand the questions posed?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\u201cIt is well settled that the State Judiciary\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency\u2019s adjudicatory decision is limited; it \u2018is limited to determining ... if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. 577, 590, 846 A.2d 377, 384-85 (2004) (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994)) (citation omitted). \u201c[A]n administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145, 1154 (2005) (quoting <em>Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, </em>354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1991)). \u201cDespite the deference, \u2018it is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s conclusions of law are correct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 121, 896 A.2d 320, 331 (2006) (quoting <em>Kushell v. Dep\u2019t of Natural Res., </em>385 Md. 563, 576, 870 A.2d 186, 193 (2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>The court\u2019s review of the administrative agency\u2019s factual findings \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions.\u201d <em>Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 590, 846 A.2d at 384^85 (quoting <em>United Parcel Serv., </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230) (internal quotation mark omitted). We uphold the agency\u2019s factual conclusion if \u201ca reasoning mind could have reached\u201d that conclusion. <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380 (quoting <em>Bulluck v. Pelham Wood Apts., </em>283 Md. 505, 512, 390 A.2d 1119, 1123 (1978)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">defer to the agency\u2019s fact-finding and drawing of inferences if they are supported by the record. A reviewing court \u2018must review the agency\u2019s decision in the light most favorable to it; ... the agency\u2019s decision is prima facie correct and presumed valid, and ... it is the agency\u2019s province to resolve conflicting evidence and to draw inferences from that evidence.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-5\"><em>Id., </em>729 A.2d at 380-81 (quoting <em>CBS v. Comptroller, </em>319 Md. 687, 698, 575 A.2d 324, 329 (1990)) (alterations in original) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">It is through this limited judicial-review prism that we address Petitioner\u2019s questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">A. <em>Use of publicly available information to institute proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">Petitioner claims that the Board ran afoul of COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d) by using information obtained through the CRC process to investigate and ultimately press the charges against him in the present case. To repeat, that regulation provides: \u201cExcept for consideration of a proposed resolution of a case achieved through the CRC, the Board may not make later use of any commentary, admissions, facts revealed, or positions taken, <em>unless the subject matter is available from other sources or is otherwise discovered.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). Petitioner asserts that the regulation prohibits the Board from using information acquired from a statement Petitioner\u2019s counsel made to the Board\u2019s counsel, while the two were attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>ing to schedule an unrelated CRC, that Petitioner would be \u201cin court\u201d on the date proposed. Petitioner further asserts that the Board\u2019s position violates public policy because it discourages candor during the CRC process.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">The Board counters that the statement does not come within the protection of confidentiality afforded by the regulation because the statement was not made during a CRC and was not substantive. The Board further argues that Petitioner\u2019s interpretation of the scope of the confidentiality protection ignores the plain meaning of the regulation, and \u201cthe Board did not actually attempt to use the statement ... in any subsequent proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Reviewing courts are to accord some deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, <em>Noland, </em>386 Md. at 573 n. 3, 873 A.2d at 1155 n. 3, and we shall do so here. We, like our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals, <em>see Kim, </em>196 Md.App. at 372, 9 A.3d at 540, find no error in the Board\u2019s decision that COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d) does not include within its protection of confidentiality statements concerning the mere logistics attendant to a CRC. Indeed, Petitioner\u2019s contrary view of the regulation does not comport with a common sense interpretation of its plain language. That is to say, a statement relating solely to the scheduling of a CRC is not \u201ccommentary,\u201d an \u201cadmission! ],\u201d a \u201cfact! ] revealed,\u201d or a \u201cposition!! taken\u201d at a CRC. COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">We likewise find no error in the Board\u2019s additional rationale that the statement that Petitioner was \u201cin court\u201d falls within the regulation\u2019s exception to the confidentiality protection for information that \u201cis available from other sources or is otherwise discovered.\u201d Neither do we find fault, as Petitioner would have us do, with the Board\u2019s finding additional support for that conclusion in <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. Lee, </em>387 Md. 89, 874 A.2d 897 (2005). In <em>Lee, </em>an attorney under disciplinary review had attempted to use, for impeachment purposes, a witness\u2019s statement allegedly made during a confidential peer review proceeding, <em>id. </em>at 103, 874 A.2d at 905, despite Maryland Rule 16-723(a), which prohibits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>such use in proceedings subsequent to the peer review, <em>id. </em>at 110, 874 A.2d at 911. We pointed out that, although \u201cwhat happens in Peer Review stays in Peer Review,\u201d a party nevertheless has an opportunity to discover information through other avenues and to use that information discovered independently. <em>Id. </em>at 113-14, 874 A.2d at 911-12. <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 17-109(e) (providing for confidentiality of communications during mediation proceedings, but not protecting information from disclosure \u201csolely by reason of its use in mediation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">Like Maryland Rules 16-723(a) and 17-109(e), COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d), by its plain language, allows for the use of information that, even though obtained <em>during </em>a CRC, is \u201cavailable from other sources.\u201d There was substantial evidence in the present case not only that the information that Petitioner would be \u201cin court\u201d on a certain date was available from the Health Claims Arbitrations Office and the Maryland Judiciary Case Search, but also that the Board actually acquired the malpractice case information from those other sources.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">It follows that the Board committed no error in its construction of COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d). Moreover, substantial evidence in the record supports the Board\u2019s application of that regulation to Petitioner\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">B. <em>\u201cIn the practice of medicine </em>\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Petitioner challenges the Board\u2019s conclusion that the filing of his application for renewal of his license occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d He asserts that the conduct is not within the purview of the statutory definition.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>that there is a legally insufficient relationship between the statutory definition of \u201cpractice\u201d and Petitioner\u2019s conduct, the relationship being that submitting false statements impedes the Board\u2019s ability to \u201cmake informed decisions regarding physician qualifications and adequately safeguard the public health.\u201d The deficiency, Petitioner asserts, rests in the fact that the Health Claims Arbitration Office alerts the Board to all claims filed, pursuant to Maryland Code (1974, 2006 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-2A-04(b)(6) of the Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, according to Petitioner, the non-disclosure of malpractice matters in fact does not impede the Board\u2019s functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The Board counters that we, as well as the Court of Special Appeals, have rejected a narrow interpretation of the term <em>\u201cin </em>the practice of medicine.\u201d The Board adds that its interpretation of what constitutes \u201cpractice of medicine\u201d is entitled to deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We first examined the breadth of conduct falling within the meaning of \u201cin the practice of medicine,\u201d in <em>McDonnell v. Commission on Medical Discipline, </em>301 Md. 426, 483 A.2d 76 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>(1984). In <em>McDonnell, </em>we considered whether a physician\u2019s attempt to intimidate adverse expert witnesses in a medical malpractice case was conduct that comes within the meaning of \u201cin his practice as a physician.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 428, 488 A.2d at 76. Physician McDonnell, concerned that the experts were inexperienced, communicated with them directly and threatened to have transcripts of their depositions disseminated to the local and national medical communities. <em>Id., </em>483 A.2d at 76-77. The experts testified against McDonnell, despite his intimidation. <em>Id. </em>at 429, 483 A.2d at 77. After the trial concluded, McDonnell was reprimanded for \u201cimmoral conduct of a physician in his practice as a physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429-30, 483 A.2d at 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Before this Court, McDonnell admitted the impropriety of his actions, but asserted that those actions did not occur \u201cin his practice as a physician.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 483 A.2d at 79. We concluded that, although McDonnell\u2019s conduct was improper, it was not sanctionable, <em>id. </em>at 434, 483 A.2d at 80, because it was \u201cclear that the legislature did not intend that a physician\u2019s general moral character would be subject to sanction,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 436, 483 A.2d at 81. We rejected the argument that the statute extended to \u201cimmoral conduct simply because, in some manner, it had a general or associative relationship to the physician in his capacity as a member of the medical profession.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 436, 483 A.2d at 81. Instead, we held that sanctionable conduct must be \u201cdirectly tied to the physician\u2019s conduct in the actual performance of the practice of medicine, i.e., in the diagnosis, care, or treatment of patients.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437, 483 A.2d at 81.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Not surprisingly, Petitioner relies on <em>McDonnell </em>as support for a narrow interpretation of the statute. <em>McDonnell, </em>however, does not stand for the general proposition Petitioner advances. Moreover, <em>McDonnell </em>is not the last word on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">We have consistently recognized that \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d applies not only to diagnosing and treating patients, but also to \u201cmisconduct relat[ing] to the effective delivery of patient care.\u201d <em>Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 597, 846 A.2d at 389. In <em>Finucan, </em>we held that a physician\u2019s engaging in sexual relationships with patients occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because his behavior went \u201cto the heart of his duties as their family doctor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 599-600, 846 A.2d at 390-91. Similarly, in <em>Banks </em>we held that a physician\u2019s engaging in a pattern of sexually harassing hospital employees, 354 Md. at 76-77, 729 A.2d at 385, was \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because his on-duty conduct negatively affected the working environment, which needed \u201cat all times\u201d to \u201cbe conducive to the practice of medicine,\u201d and \u201chis conduct was a threat to the teamwork approach of health care,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 75, 729 A.2d at 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">Likewise, in <em>Cornfeld, </em>the Court of Special Appeals, applying the reasoning of <em>Banks </em>and <em>Finucan, </em>held that conduct similar to Petitioner\u2019s occurs \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d 174 Md.App. at 473-79, 921 A.2d at 903-07. The physician, Cornfeld, while being investigated about his conduct during a surgery he had performed, made false statements at both the hospital peer review stage of the investigation and during the Board\u2019s subsequent investigation and disciplinary proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 467, 921 A.2d at 899. The court affirmed the Board\u2019s determination that Cornfeld\u2019s misconduct occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine\u201d because peer review proceedings \u201cserve[ ] an important patient care purpose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 479-80, 921 A.2d at 906-07. Moreover, Cornfeld\u2019s false statements related to instructions he had given to others in rendering surgical care; consequently, his conduct was directly related to medical \u201ctreatment\u201d and \u201csurgery,\u201d within the statutory definition of \u201cpractice medicine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 481, 921 A.2d at 907. In so holding, the Court of Special Appeals recognized that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>sufficient relationship between conduct and patient care can be established by showing \u201cthat the physician abused his status as a physician in a manner that either harmed patients, created a substantial risk of harm to them, or diminished the standing of the medical profession as caregivers.\u201d 174 Md. App. at 477-78, 921 A.2d at 905-06.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">In the present case, the Board made no legal error in concluding that Petitioner\u2019s submission of his license renewal application occurred \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d We made plain in <em>Banks </em>that, in \u201cconsidering whether a physician\u2019s conduct was within the statutory requirement of \u2018in the practice of medicine,\u2019 a critical factor has been whether the conduct occurred while the physician was performing a task integral to his or her medical practice.\u201d 354 Md. at 74, 729 A.2d at 384. Petitioner\u2019s completion and filing of his application to renew his physician\u2019s license is unquestionably \u201ca task integral to his ... practice.\u201d Without a license, Petitioner would have no authority to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">Moreover, the Board did not err in adopting the ALJ\u2019s finding that filing a license renewal application is sufficiently intertwined with patient care. We appreciate that the Board must be able to rely on the accuracy of information conveyed in license applications in order to investigate and determine physicians\u2019 fitness to practice medicine. A physician\u2019s submission of false information regarding malpractice claims in license renewal applications impedes the Board\u2019s ability to make accurate determinations about a physician\u2019s continued fitness. Although, at best, false information might merely delay investigation, at worst, false information could form the basis upon which the Board renews or grants a license, potentially to an unfit applicant. The Board is entitled to expect truthful submissions, particularly with respect to information concerning suits for malpractice, given that such suits directly raise questions regarding a physician\u2019s fitness to practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">Petitioner argues that his falsehood in connection with the pending Wagner case is ultimately immaterial to the Board\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>licensing decision, because the Board has independent means of investigating whether a physician has been involved in any malpractice litigation through the Maryland Judiciary Case Search, and the Board receives malpractice filing information pursuant to statute from the Health Claims Arbitration Office. The argument is meritless. \u201cThe purpose of disciplinary proceedings against licensed professionals is not to punish the offender but rather as a catharsis for the profession and a prophylactic for the public.\u201d <em>McDonnell, </em>301 Md. at 436, 483 A.2d at 81. It is of no consequence that the Board would otherwise discover the lie, or, for that matter, that no patient was harmed by the physician who undertakes to lie about a malpractice claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Giving to the Board the deference to which it is entitled in the interpretation and application of \u00a7 14-404, we cannot say that the Board erred in concluding that Petitioner\u2019s falsehood concerning the pendency of the Wagner malpractice case was conduct \u201cin the practice of medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">C. <em>Willful conduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">Two of the three \u00a7 14-404 provisions that the Board concluded Petitioner had violated (i.e., \u00a7 14-404(a)(ll) and (36)) require a finding that Petitioner acted \u201cwillfully.\u201d Petitioner asserts that inclusion of the term \u201cwillfully\u201d in those provisions required the Board to prove that he knew his statements were false and \u201cintended to deceive the Board by inducing it to act to its detriment by renewing his license.\u201d Petitioner, pursuant to that understanding of the term, adds that there was legally insufficient evidence to prove that he acted willfully in failing to disclose the pending Wagner case. To the contrary, he asserts, any suggestion of willfulness is belied by the evidence (1) of his demonstrated English language limitations and (2) that he disclosed the pending malpractice action on his previously filed hospital privileges renewal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">The Board counters that \u201cwillful\u201d does not require the intent to deceive, but rather only that the act be \u201cpurposeful conduct, which requires neither a bad motive nor knowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>unlawfulness.\u201d (citing <em>Deibler v. State, </em>365 Md. 185, 199, 776 A.2d 657, 665 (2001)). The Board further asserts that the ALJ\u2019s factual findings were supported by substantial evidence because Petitioner admitted that he was aware of the pending case when he filed his application, yet he nevertheless indicated on his license renewal application that there were no malpractice claims pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">The ALJ\u2019s decision, adopted by the Board\u2019s Final Decision and Order, relied on the definition of \u201cwillful\u201d endorsed by this Court in <em>Deibler, </em>365 Md. 185, 776 A.2d 657. In that case, we considered the meaning of \u201cwillful\u201d under the Maryland criminal wiretap statute and discussed four distinct definitions of the term. <em>Id. </em>at 192-93, 776 A.2d at 661. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzG\">\u201c[WJillful\u201d has received four different constructions from the courts. The first, and most restrictive, is that an act is willful only if it is done with a bad purpose or evil motive\u2014 deliberately to violate the law. A second interpretation considers an act to be willful \u201cif it is done -with an intent to commit the act and with a knowledge that the act is in violation of the law.\u201d That construction does not require that the defendant possess a sinister motivation, but, like the first interpretation, it does require knowledge that the act is unlawful. The third interpretation \u201crequires only that the act be committed voluntarily and intentionally as opposed to one that is committed through inadvertence, accident, or ordinary negligence.\u201d Under that approach, \u201c[a]s long as there is an intent to commit the act, there can be a finding of willfulness even though the actor was consciously attempting to comply with the law and was acting with the good faith belief that the action was lawful.\u201d What is required is \u201can objective intent to commit the act but not necessarily a knowledge that the act will bring about the illegal result.\u201d Finally ... some courts have gone so far as to find an act willful even though it was not committed intentionally, but through oversight, inadvertence, or negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b592-5\"><em>Id., </em>776 A.2d at 661 (quoting S. Brogan, <em>An Analysis of the Term \u2018Willful\u201d in Federal Criminal Statutes, </em>51 Notre Dame <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>Lawyer 786 (1976)) (second alteration in original) (internal citations omitted). We concluded that most applications of \u201cwillful,\u201d if not all, fell within the third definition: a willful act is committed voluntarily and intentionally, not necessarily with the intent to deceive. <em>Id. </em>at 195, 776 A.2d at 663.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">The ALJ correctly recognized (and, by its adoption of the ALJ\u2019s findings and conclusions, so too did the Board), that we have rejected the conclusion that \u201cwillful\u201d means that a person acts with a deceitful or fraudulent motive, in the context of attorney grievance proceedings. <em>See, e.g., Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Jarosinski, </em>411 Md. 432, 451, 983 A.2d 477, 488-89 (2009) (stating that, \u201c[i]n the context of attorney grievance matters, willfulness is defined as \u2018the voluntary, intentional violation of a known legal duty not requiring a deceitful or fraudulent motive.\u2019 A hearing judge need not have evidence of a deceitful or fraudulent motive to conclude that an attorney\u2019s conduct was willful\u201d and concluding that the attorney willfully misappropriated client trust funds (quoting <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Nussbaum, </em>401 Md. 612, 636, 934 A.2d 1, 15 (2007) (internal citation omitted))).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">Similarly, the Court of Special Appeals has defined \u201cwillful\u201d as \u201cintentional, or knowing, or voluntary, as distinguished from accidental,\u201d in the context of civil litigation. <em>See Bond v. PolyCycle, Inc., </em>127 Md.App. 365, 381, 382, 732 A.2d 970, 978 (1999) (concluding that appellant acted willfully in deleting files from computers even though he \u201cbelieved that he was entitled to take the technology\u201d) (quoting <em>Pac. Mortg. and Inv. Grp., Ltd. v. Horn, </em>100 Md.App. 311, 332-33, 641 A.2d 913, 923 (1994)). The intermediate appellate court has concluded also that this definition is not erroneous in other administrative contexts. <em>See Bereano v. State Ethics Comm\u2019n, </em>174 Md.App. 146, 162, 176-77, 920 A.2d 1137, 1146, 1155 (2007), <em>reversed on other grounds and remanded, </em>403 Md. 716, 756-57, 944 A.2d 538, 561-62 (2008) (adopting the Commission\u2019s definition of \u201cknowin[g] and willfu[l]\u201d as \u201cintentional, or knowing, or voluntary as distinguished from accidental\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>Despite the broad support in Maryland easelaw for the definition of \u201cwillfulness\u201d that the Board employed in applying \u00a7 14-404, Petitioner insists that, \u201c[t]o establish a prima facie case for \u2018willfully making a false representation\u2019 to obtain a license or renewal of a license[,] the State must prove ... that [Petitioner] intended to deceive the [Board] by inducing it to act to its detriment.\u201d For support of that notion, Petitioner cites <em>Maryland Board of Physicians v. Elliott, </em>170 Md.App. 369, 907 A.2d 321, <em>cert. denied, </em>396 Md. 12, 912 A.2d 648 (2006). Petitioner\u2019s reliance on <em>Elliott </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Elliot was charged with obtaining his license \u201cfraudulently or deceptively\u201d; \u201cunprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine\u201d; and \u201cwillfully mak[ing] a false representation when seeking or making application for licensure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 403, 907 A.2d at 341. The Board concluded that Elliot had obtained his license by fraud or deceit; the Board therefore found it unnecessary to render a decision on the two latter charges. <em>Id., </em>907 A.2d at 341. Nothing in <em>Elliott </em>remotely suggests that \u201cwillfully\u201d requires an independent showing of intent to deceive or fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">In short, granting to the Board the deference it is due in interpreting the statute, we hold that the Board did not erroneously interpret \u201cwillful\u201d in the context of \u00a7 14-404. \u201cWillful,\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 14-404, requires proof that the conduct at issue was done intentionally, not that it was committed with the intent to deceive or with malice.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Applying that definition of willfulness to Petitioner\u2019s case, we conclude that there was substantial evidence that he acted willfully in making a false statement on his application for renewal of his medical license. In fact, Petitioner\u2019s testimony supported the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination that Petitioner\u2019s explanation of misunderstanding and inadvertence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>\u201cillogical and unconvincing.\u201d Petitioner testified that he understood the difference between \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d He also testified to his extensive professional experience in the United States that he has conducted in English.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">Petitioner nevertheless argues to us that his English language limitations were evident in the transcript of the proceedings. But it is not our role to reevaluate the evidence presented to the administrative agency or to make credibility determinations anew. <em>Banks, </em>354 Md. at 68, 729 A.2d at 380-81. The ALJ found that Petitioner came to the United States over thirty years ago, \u201ccompleted a three year residency in English,\u201d \u201ctook oral and written tests for Board certification in English,\u201d and \u201cspeaks English in his medical practice, both in treating patients and speaking with colleagues.\u201d From those first-level findings the ALJ made the ultimate factual findings that \u201c[Petitioner] intended to provide the false statements that he submitted in his license renewal application and that his responses were not accidental or inadvertent.\u201d The Board accepted the ALJ\u2019s findings in determining for itself that Petitioner \u201cwillfully ma[de] or file[d] a false report or record in the practice of medicine,\u201d under \u00a7 14 \u2014 404(a)(l 1); and \u201cwillfully ma[de] a false representation [while] seeking or making application for licensure,\u201d under \u00a7 14-404(a)(36). The Board\u2019s decision is not premised on an erroneous conclusion of law and is supported by substantial evidence. We therefore uphold it.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">In summary, we hold that: (1) the Board did not err in either its interpretation of COMAR 10.32.02.03.C(7)(d) or its application of that regulation to the statement of Petitioner\u2019s counsel that Petitioner would be \u201cin court\u201d on a date proposed to conduct an unrelated CRC; (2) the Board\u2019s decision that Petitioner violated \u00a7 14-404(a)(3), by failing to include on his application for a medical license the pendency of the Wagner malpractice action, was not based on an erroneous conclusion of law because Petitioner\u2019s false statement on the application comes within the meaning of \u201cunprofessional conduct in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>practice of medicine\u201d; and (3) the Board did not err in determining that the term \u201cwillful\u201d means intentional, for purposes of \u00a7 14-404(a)(ll) and (36), and the record contains substantial evidence that, in his application for license renewal, Petitioner willfully made false statements in connection with his involvement in a medical malpractice action.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.
