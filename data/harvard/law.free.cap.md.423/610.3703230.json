The State\u2019s evidence was sufficient to establish that he committed those offenses on July 14, 2006, when he and an accomplice participated in a \u201chome invasion\u201d during which they robbed the victim of several items, including a necklace that was (in the words of Petitioner\u2019s brief) \u201csnatched from [the victim\u2019s] neck.\u201d After the Court of Special Appeals affirmed Petitioner\u2019s convictions in an unreported opinion, he requested that this Court issue a writ of certiorari to decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-9\">1) Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it decided that [Petitioner\u2019s] constitutional right of confrontation was not violated where the trial court curtailed [Petitioner\u2019s] cross-examination of the State\u2019s detective regarding the contents of a search warrant return that directly contradicted the detective\u2019s direct testimony about recovering a key piece of evidence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-10\">2) [Whether] the Court of Special Appeals err[ed] in failing to reverse [Petitioner\u2019s] conviction due to prosecutorial misconduct under a plain error analysis where the Court of Appeals had previously held that the precise type of prose<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>cutorial misconduct at issue was highly prejudicial and jeopardized the fundamental fairness of the trial, or in the alternative, should this Court recognize plain error and correct the denial of [Petitioner\u2019s] right to a fair trial due to the prosecutorial misconduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">We granted the petition. 417 Md. 125, 9 A.3d 1 (2010). For the reasons that follow, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in \u201ccurtailing the cross-examination of the State\u2019s detective regarding the contents of a search warrant return\u201d that was prepared by another law enforcement officer who did not testify at trial, and we decline to review any of Petitioner\u2019s \u201cplain error\u201d arguments. We shall therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconfrontation\u201d argument is based upon the theory that, to bolster its case against him, the State presented perjured testimony about what tangible evidence was \u2014 and what was not \u2014 recovered from (1) the victim\u2019s apartment, and (2) the apartment of Petitioner\u2019s girlfriend. According to Petitioner, although the victim made an in-court identification of Petitioner as one of the robbers, the fact that the victim had initially stated that he did not know who had robbed him is what motivated the State to present the perjured testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">The robbery occurred on the afternoon of Friday, July 14, 2006, when two men forced their way into the victim\u2019s apartment. One of the intruders was unmasked, and the other was wearing a ski-mask. Both intruders used handguns to strike the victim\u2019s face and head. After the victim had been forced into the bedroom, he lost consciousness. After the victim regained consciousness, one of the intruders grabbed the silver chain that the victim was wearing around his neck, and ripped the chain off the victim\u2019s neck. After stealing several items of the victim\u2019s personal property, the intruders threw him into a closet, where he remained until five to ten minutes after the intruders left the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>The victim did not initiate the investigation of the robbery, which was first reported by an employee of the Southern Maryland Hospital Center, after the victim had been transported there by a friend. At the hospital, while being interviewed by Detective Chris Shankster of the Charles County Sheriffs Department, the victim initially stated that he did not know who robbed him. Detective Shankster testified that \u201cit was within \u2014 probably within the hour of speaking with him. You know, he changed his story.\u201d At this point, the victim stated that Petitioner was the masked intruder.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">On July 26, 2006, Detective Shankster and other members of the Charles County Sheriffs Department accompanied Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Officers who executed a search warrant at 114 Galveston Street, S.E., Apartment 301, Washington, D.C., where Petitioner had been residing with his girlfriend and her children. Petitioner was present at the apartment when the warrant was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Shelley Progovitz, a Charles County evidence technician, who had responded to the victim\u2019s residence on July 14, 2006, also accompanied the D.C. officers. In the words of Petitioner\u2019s brief:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-7\">Ms. Progovitz collected and bagged a black tee-shirt, a pair of black Nike boots, and two pairs of brown Timberland boots. She also processed a small box collected from the sill in the bedroom that contained items of jewelry. Ms. Progovitz photographed the box at the scene, but its contents were \u201call like jumb[led] up ... or on top of each other in the box.\u201d Nonetheless, Ms. Progovitz claimed that there was no clasp in the box seized during the search warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b661-8\">Detective Shankster explained on cross-examination that he was present for the collection of the necklace and pendant during the execution of the search warrant, and that \u201c[w]e left a search warrant return which documents the items we seize from the residence. We leave a copy of the search warrant and search warrant return with the occupants ...\u201d The Return described the box and its contents that were seized as follows: \u201cBox w/chain w/broken clasp <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>w/Jesus <em>&amp; </em>Cross\u201d. The trial court would not, however, allow the Defense to cross-examine Detective Shankster (or any State\u2019s witness) about the contents of the Return. Detective Shankster testified that after execution of the warrant, he returned with [the victim] on July 27, 2006, to [the victim\u2019s] apartment to collect the clasp because he \u201cassumed that the [crime scene technician] would have collected it, but she didn\u2019t.\u201d [The victim] testified that when he returned to the apartment, \u201cthe detective [Shankster] was actually right there standing by my side the whole time,\u201d however, [the victim] did not see the detective collect any evidence when they returned together to his apartment. [The victim] also testified that he could not remember the detective pointing out anything that the detective located in the apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-4\">Detective Shankster claimed that he took a picture of the bloodstained area in the bedroom that showed a \u201cclasp\u201d but testified he did not collect it or request that it be collected. He then left to go to the hospital to speak with [the victim]. After Detective Shankster left [the victim\u2019s] apartment, the crime scene technician, Ms. Progovitz, arrived. Her specific duties were to photograph the scene, search for evidence, collect evidence, and process any evidence ... Ms. Progovitz photographed [the victim\u2019s] apartment and collected items of evidence from it, including a dust particle mask from the bedroom floor near the dresser in the area where Detective Shankster testified the clasp was present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\">Neither Ms. Progovitz, nor Corporals McCue or Strafella\u2014 who had each been through every room in the apartment\u2014 observed any broken items of jewelry or a clasp on the bedroom floor. At trial, Detective Shankster was unable to identify the clasp in the pictures of the bedroom taken on the night of the incident by the crime scene technician, Ms. Progovitz.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">It was the theory of Petitioner\u2019s case that he was in possession of the victim\u2019s necklace because the victim had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>given it to him as a gift, and that the clasp had not been removed from the necklace when it was found in Petitioner\u2019s apartment. The State, of course, emphasized the evidence that (1) the clasp, which broke off of the victim\u2019s necklace when the necklace was ripped off his neck, was recovered from the victim\u2019s apartment, and (2) the rest of the victim\u2019s necklace was recovered from Petitioner\u2019s residence. The State\u2019s closing argument included the following assertions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">The victim identified the chain \u2014 yeah that is the chain that was ripped off me \u2014 that is the pendant that was on the chain when it was ripped off me, and again it is his blood that is found on that chain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">That chain that is found in the Defendant\u2019s bedroom during the search warrant \u2014 what explanation is there ladies and gentlemen as far as how that chain got there? There is only one. It was ripped off the victim by the Defendant on the night of the attack and we have got further evidence to show that because you can see the clasp right there\u2014 picture taken by Detective Shankster \u2014 July 14, 2006 the night of the attack.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">You see the two sections in the bedroom where the victim was attacked. You see the clasp right there. Now at the time this picture was taken no one had talked to [the victim] yet \u2014 no officers that were on that scene had talked to [the victim] yet. They didn\u2019t know if that clasp was significant or not. Ms. Progovitz didn\u2019t know if that clasp was significant was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">When Detective Shankster was with the execution of the search warrant in the District of Columbia \u2014 what did he see \u2014 he saw that picture \u2014 he saw that <em>chain </em>\u2014 what is missing on that chain \u2014 the clasp. The testimony was from the Detective as well as Ms. Progovitz that they opened that box there was no clasp connected to that chain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-9\">Why is that? Well we know why that\u2019s the case \u2014 because it was laying in a pile of \u2014 puddle of blood on the victim\u2019s floor after the chain was ripped off his neck and he got the clasp. What did [Detective Shankster] do \u2014 said, when I see that chain and I notice there is no clasp on that chain, I think to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>myself, wait a minute I know where the clasp is. I have seen that clasp before. He goes back to the victim\u2019s apartment and he collects State\u2019s Exhibit 45 \u2014 that clasp. This was shown to the victim and he said, yeah, that is my clasp. How does he know that? Because he has been wearing this chain for years. He wears it almost everyday. It is his prized possession. He knows this clasp. So we know when that chain is ripped off the victim\u2019s neck. The clasp tells the story, again, showing that the testimony you heard from [the victim] is completely accurate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">During the State\u2019s case-in-chief, Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel made two attempts to place before the jury what had been marked as Defense Exhibit number 5 for identification, the search warrant \u201creturn\u201d prepared by Detective Brett Smith of the D.C. Police Department. The first attempt occurred during Ms. Progovitz\u2019s testimony. The record shows that the following transpired during her cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">Q: I\u2019d like to show you again number 5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-7\">A: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-8\">Q: Okay. Which indicates a search warrant return. This indicates box with chain ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-9\">[Prosecutor] Your Honor, I am going to object at this point. This is not in evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-10\">[Bench conference was held]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-11\">[The Court] It\u2019s not her document. It\u2019s not her document. She didn\u2019t sign it did she?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-12\">[Prosecutor] No. No one that\u2019s going to be in this trial ... [Defense Attorney] But ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-13\">[The Court] So, you can\u2019t ... you can\u2019t impeach her with it. [Defense Attorney] But, she was ... the reason I think it ... ask it is that she identified it as the return for this property and I can ask her to say she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-14\">[The Court] It looked like it, but she ... its\u2019s not her statement it\u2019s not her written statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>[Defense Counsel] Alright. Alright. But, I think that I can ask her whether that changes the recollection of what she saw or what\u2019s there ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-4\">[The Court] Well, you can use it to refresh her recollection. [Defense Counsel] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-5\">[The Court] But you can\u2019t ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-6\">[Prosecutor] I would even object to that. To refresh her</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">[The Court] No, no no, you can use a bowling ball to refresh recollection. It doesn\u2019t have to be statement by the same witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-8\">[Prosecutor] Okay. Well, then I guess I would object ... [The Court] You can show it to her ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">[Prosecutor] Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-10\">[The Court] ... but you can\u2019t read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-11\">[Prosecutor] I would object to her having to read it or any counsel read it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-12\">[The Court] But, she can read it to herself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-13\">[Prosecutor] Certainly. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-14\">[Defense Attorney] Um, hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-15\">[The Court] But, not orally.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-16\">[Defense Attorney] Okay. Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-17\">[Re-Cross Resumed]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-18\">[Defense Attorney] Showing you exhibit 5 here. My question is you could read that, my question is whether that refreshes your recollection about the condition of the necklace in this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-19\">[The Court] Well, wait a second. Do you have any difficulty remembering what it looked like?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-20\">[Witness] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-21\">[The Court] There\u2019s nothing to refresh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-22\">[Defense Attorney] Okay. Alright. Thank you. Alright. I have no further questions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>Anticipating that Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel would attempt to place the contents of the return before the jury during Detective Shankster\u2019s testimony, the State moved <em>in limine </em>to \u201cprevent [Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel] from question[ing] or attempting] to offer [into evidence the search warrant return] through any witness that [was] not the author of the document.\u201d The record shows that the following transpired during the <em>in limine </em>hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-5\">[Prosecutor] Your Honor, I would ask that with regards to the search warrant return sheet, I would ... I\u2019d essentially ask, I mean, it\u2019s in a way, I guess, it\u2019s a motion <em>in limine, </em>that [defense] counsel not be allowed to question or attempt to offer that I believe is Defendant\u2019s 5 through any witness that is not the author of the document. I would argue that if we\u2019re attempting to show that to the jury I think that\u2019s attempting to send a signal to the jury with evidence which is not at least at this point admissible evidence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-6\">[Defense Counsel] That was ... the return of search warrant is obtained through the discovery process. It is part of ... in other words, this was something that was ... the search warrant request to be done by Detective Shankster. [The Court] Um, hum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-7\">[Defense Counsel] He was the one present at the scene. And, would receive that document at the time that it was executed. So, I think that that\u2019s something that he ... he could be questioned about.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">[The Court] Well he didn\u2019t fill it out did he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-9\">[Defense Counsel] No. No. He didn\u2019t fill it out. It would be ... it could be ... he could be questioned about it. And, this, anyway, it says ... it refers to a broken clasp. [Prosecutor] Well, it refers to a bracelet with a broken clasp. But, it does not separately refer to a broken clasp. If you read it, it does ... it is very careful to distinguish separate items. The clasp is not separated. It is described as a box with a bracelet with a broken clasp and a pendant. So, it ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>[The Court] Well, actually, it says box with chain with broken clasp with Jesus Cross.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-4\">[Prosecutor] My first argument is, of course, there could be no possible foundation laid without the author of that document. And, obviously, if we\u2019re going to ... if a piece of evidence like that would be admitted, that line would have to be explained as to exactly what that person meant by what he wrote. That person is not here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-5\">[The Court] Well, how are you going to get it into evidence if you\u2019re trying to[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-6\">[Defense Counsel] Through ... it would be through Detective Shankster. He was ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-7\">[The Court] Well, he\u2019s not the author right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-8\">[Defense Counsel] He\u2019s not the author, but he\u2019s ... he\u2019s ... of them team, he\u2019s the leader of the team that does ... does that. I mean, you know, I mean certainly the State can ... [The Court] No, he\u2019s not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-9\">[Defense Counsel] And, he certainly he can be ... come back. He can be shown the chain and say well, to the best of my knowledge that\u2019s what it looks like. I just think it should be ... it should be something he can be cross-examined on.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-10\">[The Court] No. It\u2019s not his document. How can he answer a question well why does it say this? You\u2019re asking for an opinion, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-11\">[Defense Counsel] Well, we\u2019re asking for him ... he can explain. He can explain his interaction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-12\">[The Court] How can he ... no, he didn\u2019t write it down. [Prosecutor] He can\u2019t.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b667-13\">[The Court] So how can he explain it? I mean, you can use it to refresh recollection ... but at this stage I think you need ... Detective Brett Smith to say why he wrote that down. And for the record, we\u2019ve been talking about Defendant\u2019s Exhibit [5].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>As noted above, Petitioner was convicted of robbery and related offenses. In his appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, Petitioner argued (in the words of his brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-5\">[The] testimony of Detective Shankster at trial unequivocally demonstrated that he ratified and adopted the contents of the Return. As such, Detective Shankster was subject to cross-examination regarding the inconsistency between his testimony and the Return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-6\">Moreover, the Return was independently admissible as an admission since Detective Shankster adopted the statements in the Return in his role as a State agent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-7\">Detective Shankster who was acting in his official capacity as a State agent admitted under oath that the Return documented the item[s] \u201cwe found\u201d which would include a broken clasp. As such, Mr. Sweetney should have been allowed at a minimum, to question Detective Shankster regarding the return. Detective Shankster then would have had the opportunity to explain, if he could the inconsistency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH_\">The Court of Special Appeals rejected these arguments, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-8\">The \u201cparty in question in this case is of course, the State. In effect, [Petitioner] contends that the return was admissible because the return was either signed by an agent of the State with authority to do so or was otherwise adopted by such an agent. Even assuming that Detective Shankster was authorized to fill out and sign the return on a search warrant issued by a court of another jurisdiction, he did not do so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-9\">[Petitioner] also contends that Detective Shankster effectively ratified and adopted the return and its contents by physically delivering a copy of the document to Ms. Wells. He relies on <em>Nance v. State, </em>331 Md. 549, 567-568[, 629 A.2d 633, 642-43] (1993), as support for this proposition. <em>Nance </em>is inapposite. The issue in that case involved whether a witness\u2019 pre-trial identification was admissible as a prior inconsistent statement when the witness repudiated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>identification at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 564[, 629 A.2d at 640-41]. In the case before us, Detective Shankster did not fill out or sign the return and there is no indication that Smith reviewed the return\u2019s contents with Detective Shankster before signing it ... The trial court did not err in declining to admit the return.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><em>Sweetney v. State, </em>No. 91, September Term, 2008, slip opinion pp. 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Petitioner argues (in the words of his brief):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-7\">These [above stated] circumstances suggested that, at the least, the possibility that Detective Shankster, at an earlier point in the investigation, improperly sought to compensate for [the victim\u2019s] failure to initially identify [Petitioner] as one of the persons involved in the incident by fabricating a link between the necklace recovered from [Petitioner\u2019s residence] and the crime. The purported recovery of the clasp from [the victim\u2019s] apartment created that essential link, but Detective Shankster\u2019s testimony on this key point was directly contradicted by the description in the Return served by him ... Cross examination about the search warrant return that he personally served was, therefore, of unquestionable significance to the jury\u2019s assessment of the weight and credibility of Detective Shankster\u2019s testimony.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-8\">[S]alient agency principles apply to this case regardless of whether the underlying issue is directed at the constitutional grounds for suppressing evidence from the search, improper custodial interrogation or whether a search warrant return would constitute an admission of a Maryland agent. <em>[State v.] Mollica, </em>[114 N.J. 329, 554 A.2d 1315 (1989)], <em>[State v.] Knight, </em>[145 N.J. 233, 678 A.2d 642 (1996) ], and <em>[State v.] Cauley, </em>[863 S.W.2d 411 (Tenn.1993) ], simply stand for the position that where one government entity is acting at the behest and direction of another the acting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>government entity is an agent of the requesting government entity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-5\">As such for the purpose of Maryland Rule 5-803(a), Detective Smith of the Metropolitan Police Department was acting as an agent of the State of Maryland where he prepared the Return. The search of [Petitioner\u2019s] District of Columbia residence was instituted at the request of the State of Maryland, seeking evidence from a crime which occurred in Maryland, and such evidence was specifically obtained for the purpose of turning that evidence over to Maryland authorities for use in a Maryland prosecution. Thus, there was sufficient \u201cmutual planning joint operations, and mutual assistance\u201d to establish agency. <em>See State v. Mollica, </em>554 A.2d at 1329; <em>State v. Cauley, </em>863 S.W.2d at 415-416.

State, </em>90 Md.App. 549, 602 A.2d 212 (1992), while affirming convictions for murder and related offenses, the Court of Special Appeals rejected the argument \u201cthat the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>trial court erred in sustaining the State\u2019s objection to appellant\u2019s questioning of [Corporal Paul] Noblitt [of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department] regarding whether the police investigation had disclosed appellant\u2019s fingerprints on the victim\u2019s vehicle.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 602 A.2d at 224. The record shows that the following transpired during Corporal Noblitt\u2019s cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-4\">[Defense Counsel]: Did there ever come, in your capacity as lead investigator, a time that you ever received any information that the fingerprints of Bernard Wiggins were found on the Brinkley Road address?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">[Prosecutor]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-6\">[The Court]: That\u2019s sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-7\">[Defense Counsel]: Could I ask for the basis?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-8\">[Prosecutor]: Fine.

Only what he has personal knowledge of.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-9\">While holding that the Circuit Court ruled correctly when it sustained the State\u2019s objection about what Corporal Noblitt\u2019s fellow officers had reported to him, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-10\">[I]t is clear to us that the objection was properly sustained, especially when viewed in context with the trial judge\u2019s previous rulings when the State objected. The question called for hearsay. Noblitt had earlier testified that he did not personally examine the vehicle. Therefore, he could not have testified from personal knowledge whether examination of the car had disclosed or failed to disclose appellant\u2019s fingerprints.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-11\"><em>Id. </em>at 576, 602 A.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">In <em>Bell v.

While rejecting the State\u2019s argument that it was entitled to use the out-of-court statement for purposes of impeachment, the <em>Bell </em>Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-5\">Statements that are otherwise inadmissible are not salvaged by invoking the mantra of \u201cimpeachment.\u201d If the State could not properly use the statement under the applicable rules of evidence, we fail to see how it could, instead, read the statement to the jury, apparently line by line, through the questions it posed to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">Unquestionably, a party may attempt to impeach a witness by challenging his or her credibility....

Owens\u2019 testimony was offered to prove that appellant was not at the scenes of the crimes on the night in question. Although Tyler\u2019s statement was never formally received into evidence, the clear implication to the jury was that Tyler had told the police that Owens had played a role in the robbery of Dominic\u2019s Pizza.
