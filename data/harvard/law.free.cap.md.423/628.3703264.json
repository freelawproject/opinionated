Taylor, an African American female, in a suit in which she alleged both sexual discrimination and retaliatory termination against Giant of Maryland LLC, Respondent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The focal point of our review of the discrimination <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>verdict is the application of \u201ccomparator evidence\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the context of Ms. Taylor\u2019s claim of disparate treatment related to Giant\u2019s requirement that she undergo an independent medical examination because of a gynecological condition. We also must determine whether Ms. Taylor adduced legally sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s retaliatory discharge verdict, which was premised upon Ms. Taylor\u2019s termination some twenty-five days after having filed a discrimination claim with the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission. We seminally must also address whether it was appropriate for Ms. Taylor\u2019s suit to proceed in state court or whether her claims had to be federally litigated.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Ms. Taylor, a former tractor-trailer driver for Giant of Maryland, LLC, Respondent, filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County alleging not only breach of contract, but that Giant discriminated against her based on her race and gender under Section 42 of Article 49B, Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl. Vol.),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Section 2-222 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> as a result of having required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>her to undergo an independent medicai examination for \u201cmenorrhagia,\u201d or heavy, prolonged menstrual hemorrhaging,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and uterine fibroids, when male truck drivers with health conditions of their own were not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Ms. Taylor also alleged that, within three weeks after she had filed her discrimination claim with the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Office, Giant retaliatorily terminated her employment. She requested an award of $750,000 in compensatory damages and $750,000 in punitive damages as to each count, as well as a declaratory judgment that \u201cthe acts and practices\u201d of Giant \u201cviolate the policies and laws of Prince George\u2019s County and the state of Maryland,\u201d to reinstate her employment with Giant with back pay, and to award her reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees. After a seven-day jury trial, Ms. Taylor was the victor on the issues of sex discrimination and retaliatory termination, while Giant successfully defended on the issue of racial discrimination, culminating in an award of $644,751.00 in damages to Ms. Taylor.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Subsequently, Ms. Taylor was awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount $511,255.00 and costs in the amount of $33,670.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">After Giant took appeals from the verdicts and the award of attorneys\u2019 fees, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgments of the trial court, <em>Giant v. Taylor, </em>188 Md.App. 1, 981 A.2d 1 (2009), concluding that Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims were preempted by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>tions Act,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and even if they were not, Ms. Taylor failed to adduce legally sufficient evidence of discrimination and retaliatory termination. Moreover, although Ms. Taylor opposed review of her award of attorneys\u2019 fees on grounds that Giant failed to note its appeal within the obligatory thirty days, the intermediate appellate court exercised its jurisdiction to review the award and vacated it, because Ms. Taylor was no longer the prevailing party.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">We granted certiorari, <em>Taylor v. Giant, </em>412 Md. 495, 988 A.2d 1008 (2010), to consider the following questions, which we have reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-6\">I. Does the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion announce an application of preemption law which is contrary to existing law?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-7\">II; Has the Court of Special Appeals created a new, impossible standard for comparator evidence and \u201cadverse employment action?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b682-8\">III. Did Taylor present legally sufficient evidence that she was subjected to retaliatory treatment by Giant?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">We also granted certiorari to consider a related question, <em>Taylor v. Giant, </em>412 Md. 495, 988 A.2d 1008 (2010), as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alg\">Where the Respondent filed a notice of appeal 34 days after entry of a collateral order for attorney\u2019s fees following judgment on the merits, did the Court of Special Appeals have jurisdiction to consider the second appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b682-10\">We shall hold that Ms. Taylor\u2019s sex discrimination and retaliation claims were not preempted by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a). We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>shall further hold that the trial court applied the correct standard for comparator evidence as it relates to adverse employment actions. We shall also hold that Ms. Taylor adduced legally sufficient evidence to support the retaliation verdict, because a rational fact finder could have found that the decision-makers at Giant knew of her February 3, 2003 discrimination claim prior to the date of her termination, February 28, 2003. We address Ms. Taylor\u2019s fourth question regarding the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s jurisdiction to review the award of attorney\u2019s fees and determine that the failure of Giant to appeal within 30 days was fatal to its claim about attorney\u2019s fees but remand for the intermediate appellate court to consider other issues that were left unaddressed in Giant\u2019s initial appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">Ms. Taylor, an African American female, worked full-time as a tractor-trailer driver for Giant, making local deliveries of merchandise and groceries, from 1988 to 2003; she was a member of the Drivers, Chauffeurs and Helpers Local Union No. 639 Teamster\u2019s Union at all times. At some point in 1995, Ms. Taylor was diagnosed with menorrhagia, or heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding and fibroid tumors, by her gynecologist. Ms. Taylor testified that she told her direct supervisor at the time, Pamela Sanford, of the diagnosis, and Ms. Taylor occasionally requested time off from work to facilitate her treatment. Ms. Taylor testified that, because of her condition, she would \u201cstart[] experiencing heavy bleeding sometimes prior to going to work, and it would interrupt the flow of preparing to get to work, getting dressed, getting showered,\u201d which in turn delayed her arrival at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">At trial, it was established that Giant required its drivers to call in at least 1.5 hours ahead of a scheduled shift, if they were going to be tardy or absent. If a driver failed to abide by the call-in requirement twice within a one-month period, he/she could be subject to discipline. Ms. Taylor testified that \u201con some days, if the bleeding was too heavy,\u201d she would not have the ability to provide the required 1.5 hours advance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>notice of her absence or lateness. Ms. Taylor began requesting Family and Medical Leave Act (\u201cFMLA\u201d) leave time in order to compensate for her gynecological-related lateness and absence, which Giant approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Because of the call-in policy and Ms. Taylor\u2019s inability to call in within the 1.5 hour time frame, however, Giant issued Ms. Taylor various disciplinary notices: A March 5, 2002 notice reflected that Ms. Taylor was late to her scheduled shift \u201ctwice within a 30 day period\u201d and that her \u201c[n]ext offense may result in more severe disciplinary action, up -to and including [germination\u201d; a March 11, 2002 notice provided that \u201cdriver called 41 minutes prior to shift start at 07:15 am\u201d and \u201c[flailed to give required 1 1/2 hour notification.\u201d A May 11, 2002 notice directed to Ms. Taylor similarly provided that Ms. Taylor \u201cphoned in 1 hr. 2 min. prior to shift start time at 04:30 am\u201d and \u201c[n]ext offense may result in more severe disciplinary action up to and including termination.\u201d Yet another notice, dated October 18, 2002, reflected that Ms. Taylor \u201ccalled off sick\u201d and \u201cfailed to provide medical documentation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">In response to the disciplinary notices, Ms. Taylor provided excuse slips penned by Dr. Jill Ladd, explaining that her violations of the call-in rule were due to a \u201cgynecological problem.\u201d Ms. Taylor also filed various grievances with Local 639, requesting that she have an opportunity to \u201cpresent an explanation for [her] actions.\u201d At the disciplinary hearing related to the notices, Ms. Taylor explained that she was unable to comply with Giant\u2019s call-in rule because of her gynecological condition. At the November meeting, which was attended by several Giant officials, including Theodore Garrett, the Manager of Fair Employment at Giant, Ms. Sanford, Ms. Taylor\u2019s supervisor, and Eric Weiss, Vice President of Labor Relations at Giant, Ms. Taylor was asked several questions about the effect her condition would have on her ability to abide by Giant\u2019s call-in rule; various of those questions were included in a letter dated November 14, 2002, addressed to her and John Steger, a Local 639 official, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>(1) Was Ms. Taylor physically incapable on March 4, 2002 and May 8, 2002 of providing Giant with 1.5 hours notice of her absences?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-4\">(2) If so, why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-5\">(3) Will there be occasions in the future where Ms. Taylor\u2019s medical condition renders her physically incapable of providing Giant with 1.5 hours notice of her absence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-6\">(4) If so:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">(a) Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-8\">(b) How frequently will Ms. Taylor be rendered physically incapable of providing the requisite amount of advance notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-9\">(c) What is the expected duration of Ms. Taylor\u2019s physical inability to provide the requisite amount of advance notice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-10\">(d) Given the answer to 4(a), how much advance notice will Ms. Taylor be capable of providing during the period referenced in response to question number 4(c)?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b685-11\">Ms. Taylor\u2019s response was generated by Dr. Ladd in a letter dated December 11, 2002:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-12\">As previously indicated on her FMLA forms, she has a problem with menorrhagia and uterine fibroids. On occasion she will suddenly start bleeding excessively. This can occur suddenly, with no warning and when she hemorrhages she is required to get off her feet and rest to decrease the bleeding. This has required her to miss work, including 3/4/02 and 5/8/02. Unfortunately, these symptoms can occur quite suddenly, making it impossible for her to predict when she will need to stay home from work, and the sudden onset can prevent her from giving the required 1.5 hrs. notice to her job, as was the case on 3/4/02 and 5/8/02. There may be occasions in the future requiring Ms. Taylor to miss work without knowing 1.5 hrs. beforehand. Some months the bleeding is manageable with routine activities, and some months it is not. She is currently trying different medical options to control this problem and if these fail, she will need to undergo surgery. To undergo major surgery is not a decision to be made lightly and is not unusual for my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>patients to try other therapies for 6-12 months before finally scheduling a date.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">Mr. Weiss did not review the doctor\u2019s response until some time in early January, because of vacation but, in the meantime, had advised Ms. Taylor by letter dated December 24, 2002 that he still had not received the- documentation 'he requested, and thus, \u201cGiant ha[d] no choice but to seek a second medical opinion concerning Ms. Taylor\u2019s ability to comply with the 1.5 hour call-in requirement.\u201d Mr. Weiss directed Mr. Steger, the Local 639 official, to have Ms. Taylor set up an independent medical examination with the Kingstree Group, the relevant medical examiner, by December 31, 2002. Mr. Weiss also stated that Ms. Taylor was required to take the examination by January 7, 2003, and that if she failed to do so, Giant would have \u201cno choice but to deny her grievances\u201d and perhaps to deny future requests for FMLA leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-6\">After Mr. Weiss finally had an opportunity to review Dr. Ladd\u2019s letter in January of 2003, however, he asked Josie Smith, Giant\u2019s Human Resources Manager for Distribution, to explore whether Ms. Taylor\u2019s gynecological condition presented a safety issue. Ms. Taylor did not attend the scheduled January 7, 2003 independent medical examination; another examination at the Kingstree Group was scheduled for January 23, 2003, but Ms. Taylor did not appear for that examination and requested to have the examination rescheduled for April 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">Ms. Taylor filed a discrimination claim on February 3, 2003 with the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-8\">On November 8, 2002, Management decided that the medical documentation used to initially approve my FMLA was now not adequate. I was forced to provide additional medical documentation and they are now saying I have to undergo further testing with their doctors. Other employees (Male, White) are not similarly treated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">The Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission mailed a notice of Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination claim to Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>Garrett, the Manager of Fair Employment at Giant, with whom Ms. Taylor had met before, who testified that he received the claim on February 7, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-4\">Ms. Taylor continued working for approximately three and a half weeks, until February 28, 2003. That day, after Ms. Taylor\u2019s shift, Ms. Smith called a meeting, which also was attended by Michael David, a shop steward, and Nick Galyean, the Fleet Safety Director at Giant. Ms. Taylor testified that she was told that the topic of the meeting was her safety and her \u201cability to drive the tractor-trailer\u201d because of her gynecological conditions. During that meeting, all male personnel left the room while Ms. Smith and Ms. Taylor spoke alone about Ms. Taylor\u2019s ailments. At trial, the parties\u2019 versions of what was said in this private meeting differ. Ms. Taylor testified that Ms. Smith told her she would have to submit to an independent medical examination and follow any and all recommendations made by Giant\u2019s selected specialist, up to and including hysterectomy, which Ms. Smith denied. Further, Ms. Taylor testified that she was told she would be taken off the road and not \u201crehir[ed]\u201d until she underwent an the independent medical examination and any recommended procedure, which she interpreted to mean she had been fired. Ms. Smith, on the other hand, testified that Ms. Taylor agreed to take the independent medical examination before the meeting adjourned.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">No independent medical examination occurred. Rather, shortly after her meeting with Ms. Smith, Ms. Taylor applied for unemployment benefits and began looking for a new job. On March 6, 2003, she filed a claim of retaliation against Giant, in which she alleged she had been terminated as a result of her filing a discrimination claim on February 3, 2003:<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-6\">I believe that the Respondent has retaliated against me for filing a Title VII based complained by terminating my employment because:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-7\">On February 3, 2003,1 filed a discrimination complaint. On February 28, 2003, I was terminated from my employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>I was told by the Human Resources Representative that I was terminated until I took a Physical. I explained to the Respondent that I just had a Physical in December 2002 (DOT). The Representative stated that I was a safety risk and that is why I was being taken off the road.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\">I believe that the Respondent has taken this action to further discriminate against me in retaliation for filing the previous Title VII complaint.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">Ms. Taylor also filed a grievance with Local 639 the same day, in which she set forth substantially the same allegations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">After a substantial procedural history and two removals to federal court and remands back to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County, the case proceeded before a jury for seven days on the issues of gender and race discrimination related to the required independent medical examination and the retaliatory discharge. At the close of a seven-day jury trial, both parties made the appropriate motions, which were denied. After deliberating, the jury recorded its verdicts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">1. Do you find by a preponderance of evidence that Giant of Maryland, LLC, discriminated against Plaintiff Julia M. Taylor on the basis of race prior to filing her February 3, 2003 charge of discrimination against Giant of Maryland, LLC, by requiring Plaintiff to submit to an independent medical exam (IME)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-9\">YES_ NO <em>S</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-10\">2. Do you find by a preponderance of evidence that Giant of Maryland, LLC discriminated against Plaintiff Julia M. Taylor on the basis of gender prior to filing her February 3, 2003 charge of discrimination against Giant of Maryland, LLC by requiring Plaintiff to submit to an independent medical exam (IME)?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>YES <em>S </em>NO_</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-5\">3. Do you find by a preponderance of evidence that Giant of Maryland, LLC retaliated against Plaintiff Julia M. Taylor for filing a charge of discrimination on February 3, 2003, against Giant of Maryland, LLC by the actions taken by Giant of Maryland, LLC on February 28, 2003?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">YES / NO_</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Thereafter, Giant filed a Motion for Judgment Notwithstanding the Verdict, or in the Alternative, to Reduce the Award, in which it argued that Ms. Taylor\u2019s gender discrimination and retaliation claims were preempted by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act and that, in the alternative, Ms. Taylor failed to adduce legally sufficient evidence of discrimination and retaliation to support the jury verdict. The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Ms. Taylor filed a post-trial motion requesting attorneys\u2019 fees and costs, which Giant opposed. In a memorandum opinion and order, the trial court awarded attorneys\u2019 fees in the amount $511,255.00 and costs in the amount of $33,670.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed, in a reported opinion,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Giant v. Taylor, </em>188 Md.App. 1, 981 A.2d 1 (2009), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>determining that Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) preempted Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination and retaliation claims. Drawing upon the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410 (1988), the Court of Special Appeals reasoned that Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination claim called for an \u201cinterpretation of the critical language of\u2019 Article 22.7 of her collective bargaining agreement, which permitted Giant to request a re-examination of a D.O.T. approved driver if it had \u201creasonable cause to believe the employee has a physical or mental condition which necessitates that he be reexamined.\u201d <em>Giant, </em>188 Md. App. at 28, 981 A.2d at 16. Regarding Ms. Taylor\u2019s sex discrimination claim, the Court of Special Appeals decided that the independent medical examination was not an adverse employment action and that Ms. Taylor\u2019s male comparators were \u201cnot similarly situated to her, as a matter of law,\u201d because they had different supervisors and their health conditions \u201ccould be followed and monitored\u201d through the Department of Transportation\u2019s mandatory physicals. <em>Id. </em>at 37-38, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>981 A.2d at 22-23. In disposing of the related retaliatory discharge claim, the intermediate appellate court determined that Ms. Taylor failed to show \u201cthat the decision-makers in her termination ... knew before the termination that she had filed\u201d a discrimination charge. <em>Id. </em>at 39-40, 981 A.2d at 23-24. Finally, in a separate, unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to Ms. Taylor\u2019s counsel, reasoning, in part, that Ms. Taylor was no longer \u201ca prevailing party below,\u201d and thus, that she was \u201cnot eligible for a statutory award of fees and costs under Article 49B, Section 42(c).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Initially, we must determine whether Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination and retaliatory discharge claims must be decided in a federal forum rather than in a state court because of Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a), involving violations of collective bargaining agreements, as Giant asserts. Section 301 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-6\">(a) Venue, amount, and citizenship. Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this chapter, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185(a) (2006). Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, in providing federal courts jurisdiction to consider claims involving collective bargaining agreements, does not obviate state courts\u2019 jurisdiction to entertain such cases. <em>United Steelworkers of America v. Rawson, </em>495 U.S. 362, 368, 110 S.Ct. 1904, 1909, 109 L.Ed.2d 362, 372-73 (1990), citing <em>Charles Dowd Box Co. v. Courtney, </em>368 U.S. 502, 82 S.Ct. 519, 7 L.Ed.2d 483 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">Rather, Section 301 does not permit the application of state law in the context of collective bargaining agreements. In effect, state-law causes of actions relating to violations of collective bargaining agreements are \u201cdisplaced\u201d by federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>law. <em>United Steelworkers of America, </em>495 U.S. at 368, 110 S.Ct. at 1909, 109 L.Ed.2d at 372-73. We observed in <em>Batson v. Shiflett, </em>325 Md. 684, 717-18, 602 A.2d 1191, 1208 (1992), that \u201c[s]uits alleging a breach of a collective bargaining agreement are governed, not by state law, but by a special body of federal common law developed under \u00a7 301.\u201d We also noted, nevertheless, that a state law claim which could be resolved without interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement could be brought in state court, even if the case required \u201caddressing precisely the same set of facts.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>325 Md. at 720, 602 A.2d at 1209, quoting <em>Lingle v. Norge Div. of Magic Chef, Inc., </em>486 U.S. 399, 410, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 1883, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, 421 (1988). Thus, \u201cmere parallelism between the facts and issues to be addressed under a state law claim and those to be addressed under \u00a7 301 does not render the state law analysis dependent on the labor contract.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>325 Md. at 720, 602 A.2d at 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">When Giant initially was sued, it removed the case to federal court, asserting that Section 301 mandated federal preemption. Judge Deborah Chasanow of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland remanded the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and concluded that Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims of discrimination and retaliatory discharge were not preempted by Section 301. <em>See Taylor v. Giant, </em>No. DKC 2004-0710, slip-op. at 21, 2004 WL 2191715 (D.Md. Sep. 13, 2004). She put the question of the appropriateness of the federal forum in the context of whether the collective bargaining agreement between Local 639 and Giant was \u201ccentral\u201d to Ms. Taylor\u2019s claims, which would require preemption, or whether interpretation of the agreement was only \u201ctangential\u201d to her claims, which would permit consideration in state court. Regarding the discrimination claim, Judge Chasanow determined that, whether white, male employees were treated differently than Ms. Taylor was a \u201cpurely factual question\u201d that did not require an interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement. She also concluded that Ms. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim required no interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and therefore Section 301 did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>not apply. Rejecting Giant\u2019s claim that Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement, which permitted Giant to discharge an employee for \u201cgood cause,\u201d was central to Ms. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim, Judge Chasanow reasoned that the issue was not \u201cwhether Defendant may discharge an employee for good cause, but whether Defendant\u2019s alleged good cause was \u2018manufactured! ] and orchestrated\u2019 ... for the purpose in retaliation.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>No. DKC 2004-0710, slip op. at 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">The Court of Special Appeals, however, reached the opposite conclusion regarding federal preemption, reasoning that Ms. Taylor\u2019s theory of the case was \u201cfluid and often elusive,\u201d appearing at times to call into question Giant\u2019s authority to require an independent medical examination in addition to a D.O.T. physical, under the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Giant, </em>188 Md.App. at 28, 981 A.2d at 16. Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals concluded that Giant\u2019s authority to require an independent medical examination was \u201cnot a matter of application of the words of that section of the CBA,\u201d but a \u201cmatter of interpretation of the meaning of those words.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 29, 981 A.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">Before us, of course, Ms. Taylor disputes that her discrimination claim presents an interpretation of Article 22.7 of the collective bargaining agreement, but merely an inquiry into the application of that provision. In so doing, Ms. Taylor relies upon <em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. 399, 108 S.Ct. 1877, 100 L.Ed.2d 410, a case in which the Supreme Court held that a state law retaliatory discharge claim was <em>not preempted </em>by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act. Giant responds that <em>Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, </em>471 U.S. 202, 213, 105 S.Ct. 1904, 1912, 85 L.Ed.2d 206, 216 (1985), a case in which the Supreme Court held that a state tort action for bad-faith handling of insurance claims <em>was preempted </em>by Section 301, is controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">In <em>Lingle, </em>the issue involved whether a manufacturer terminated the employment of an individual for seeking worker\u2019s compensation. The Supreme Court determined that Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act did not preempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>state law remedies, unless the resolution of the claim \u201cdepend[ed] upon the meaning of a collective-bargaining agreement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 405-06, 108 S.Ct. at 1881, 100 L.Ed.2d at 418-19. The Court added that \u201cnot every dispute ... tangentially involving a provision of a collective bargaining agreement, is preempted by \u00a7 301,\u201d such as provisions governing rate of pay and economic benefits relevant to the calculation of damages. <em>Id. </em>at 413 n. 12, 108 S.Ct. at 1884 n. 12, 100 L.Ed.2d at 423 n. 12, quoting <em>Lueck, </em>471 U.S. at 211, 105 S.Ct. at 1911, 85 L.Ed.2d at 215. The Court concluded that Ms. Lingle\u2019s state law remedy was \u201c \u2018independent\u2019 of the collective bargaining agreement,\u201d because the merits of her claim did not turn on an interpretation of the contract. <em>Id. </em>at 407, 108 S.Ct. at 1882, 100 L.Ed.2d at 419; <em>see also Livadas v. Bradshaw, </em>512 U.S. 107, 124, 114 S.Ct. 2068, 2078, 129 L.Ed.2d 93, 110 (1994) (\u201cwhen the meaning of contract terms is not the subject of dispute, the bare fact that a collective-bargaining agreement will be consulted in the course of state-law litigation plainly does not require the claim to be extinguished.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-5\">In <em>Lueck, </em>Roderick Lueck suffered a non-occupational back injury, submitted a disability claim with his health insurer, Aetna, and began receiving benefits that were subject to interception by his employer, Allis-Chalmers, which precipitated Mr. Lueck\u2019s suit in state court in which he alleged that Allis-Chalmers had \u201c\u2018intentionally, contemptuously, and repeatedly failed\u2019 to make disability payments under the negotiated disability plan, without a reasonable basis for withholding the payments,\u201d and thus, had \u201cbreached their duty \u2018to act in good faith and deal fairly with [Lueck\u2019s] disability claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lueck, </em>471 U.S. at 206, 105 S.Ct. at 1908, 85 L.Ed.2d at 212. Addressing Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, the Court instructed that if \u201cthe state tort law purports to define the meaning of the contract relationship, that law is pre-empted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213, 105 S.Ct. at 1912, 85 L.Ed.2d at 216-17. The Court observed that, in Wisconsin, the tort of bad faith handling of an insurance claim \u201cintrinsically relate[d] to the nature and existence of the contract,\u201d rendering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>\u201cduties imposed and rights established through the state tort\u201d wholly derivative from \u201cthe rights and obligations established by the contract.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 216-17, 105 S.Ct. at 1914, 85 L.Ed.2d at 218-19. In so interpreting, the Court held that Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act preempted Mr. Lueck\u2019s state tort claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In a case markedly similar to the case at bar, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dealt with the same dichotomy. In <em>Martin Marietta Corp. v. Maryland Commission on Human Relations, </em>38 F.3d 1392 (4th Cir. 1994), Martin Marietta, a party to several collective bargaining agreements, sought to enjoin administrative proceedings undertaken by the Maryland Commission on Human Relations relative to a claim of discrimination filed by Franklin Price, pursuant to Article 49B of the Maryland Code. Martin Marietta petitioned the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, unavailingly, to enjoin the proceedings on grounds that Section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act preempted Mr. Price\u2019s claims. The Fourth Circuit affirmed the denial of the injunction, observing that, while the collective bargaining agreements at issue contained provisions relating to \u201cabsence from work due to a work-related injury, as well as procedures for dispute resolution,\u201d Article 49B provided both the \u201cright to be free from handicap discrimination and a right to reasonable accommodation,\u201d each of which were rights independent of the collective bargaining agreements. <em>Id. </em>at 1399. The Fourth Circuit concluded that it \u201cseemed likely that Price\u2019s handicap discrimination claim involve[d] no real issue of interpretation of the CBAs.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Owen v. Carpenters\u2019 District Council, </em>161 F.3d 767, 776 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201cIn <em>Dingle\u2019s </em>wake, we have held that state law claims of handicap discrimination, retaliation, and intentional infliction of emotional distress are not preempted by \u00a7 301 of the LMRA ... because the claims involved purely factual questions concerning the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer, and because no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement was required.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">We also have had occasion to address the <em>Lingle-Lueck </em>distinction in <em>Batson, </em>325 Md. at 684, 602 A.2d at 1191. In <em>Batson, </em>A. Spencer Shiflett, a former president of Local of the Industrial Union of Marine and Shipbuilding Workers of America, brought suit against the national union as well as two of its representatives for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and conspiracy, arising from the union\u2019s campaign to remove Mr. Shiflett from Office by alleging embezzlement and misappropriation of union funds. After the jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Shiflett on all counts, the union representatives appealed, asserting, among other claims, that Mr. Shiflett\u2019s state law claims were preempted by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act. Specifically, the national union representatives asserted that Mr. Shiflett\u2019s claims implicated a provision in the Union\u2019s Constitution and Bylaws that \u201cprohibit[ed] the Local from entering any collective bargaining agreement without the consent of the National Union.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 718, 602 A.2d at 1208. This Court, however, rejected the preemption claim, reasoning that Mr. Shiflett\u2019s \u201cclaims of libel, slander, and intentional infliction of emotional distress [were] rights that exist[ed], under Maryland law, independent of any provision of the National Union\u2019s Constitution or By-laws.\u201d <em>Batson, </em>325 Md. at 721, 602 A.2d at 1210.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">In the instant case, Giant alleges that it had the authority to request an independent medical examination under the terms of Article 22.7 of the collective bargaining agreement, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-7\">The Company shall not prohibit an employee with a current valid D.O.T. card from working unless the Company has reasonable cause to believe the employee has a physical or mental condition which necessitates that he be reexamined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AmK\">Whether Giant had the authority to order an independent examination of Ms. Taylor, or the requisite \u201creasonable cause\u201d to require an independent medical examination, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ever, are not in issue.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Rather, the issue, which was tested at trial, was whether Giant\u2019s <em>motivation </em>in demanding the independent medical examination was in some way animated by Ms. Taylor\u2019s race or gender. Nowhere in Ms. Taylor\u2019s Second Amended Complaint does she allege that Giant somehow breached the terms of the collective bargaining agreement in requiring her, as opposed to her male counterparts, to undergo an independent medical examination. Rather, as the Second Amended Complaint lucidly states, Ms. Taylor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>was alleging that Giant\u2019s \u201crequest that Taylor take an IME was discriminatory, as it did not require its Caucasian or male drivers who were in the same or similar situation to take an IME.\u201d It was clearly the application of the independent medical examination provision that was in issue, because Ms. Taylor\u2019s allegations of race and sex discrimination turned, not upon the meaning of Article 22.7, but Giant\u2019s design in invoking it.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">With respect to Ms. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim, we also disagree with Giant\u2019s assertion that Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement, which permits an employee to be discharged for \u201cgood cause,\u201d required preemption. Here, as with Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination claim, the merits turned on Giant\u2019s motivations for firing Ms. Taylor, not whether Giant breached Article 10 of the collective bargaining agreement by firing her, as illustrated by Ms. Taylor\u2019s Second Amended Complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AxU\">113. Approximately, twenty-two (22) days after Plaintiff filed her first Charge of Discrimination with the PGHRC against Defendant, Giant on February 28, 2003 relieved Plaintiff of her duties as tractor-trailer driver unless she submitted to an IME under the guise that it was \u201cconcerned\u201d about Plaintiffs safety.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">115. Defendant\u2019s actions associated with terminating Plaintiffs employment and the grievance proceedings were used to retaliate against plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Under these circumstances, Ms. Taylor\u2019s retaliation claim was \u201cindependent of the collective-bargaining agreement,\u201d and thus, not preempted. <em>Lingle, </em>486 U.S. at 407, 108 S.Ct. at 1882, 100 L.Ed.2d at 419 (instructing that a retaliatory discharge claim presents \u201cpurely factual questions pertaining] to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer,\u201d neither of which \u201crequires a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals, however, determined that the issue Ms. Taylor presented was whether Giant had the authority to order an independent medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>examination, based on evidence adduced at trial. The issue of preemption, however, is not dependent upon evidence adduced at trial, but upon what is alleged as the focus in the discrimination claim. <em>See Vera v. Saks &amp; Co., </em>335 F.3d 109, 113-14 (2d Cir.2003). As we have discussed, neither Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination nor her retaliation claims alleged breaches of the collective bargaining agreement, so that federal preemption did not arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">In addressing Ms. Taylor\u2019s sex discrimination claim, we must clarify the appropriate legal standard for comparator evidence as it relates to adverse employment actions, an issue of first impression in this Court. <em>See Rosemann v. Salsbury, Clements, Bekman, Marder &amp; Adkins, LLC, </em>412 Md. 308, 314, 987 A.2d 48, 52 (2010) (\u201c[O]ur review [of a purely legal question] is non-deferential to the judgments of the intermediate appellate court and the trial court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">Ms. Taylor\u2019s claim of disparate treatment emanated from Section 2-222 of the Prince George\u2019s County Code, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-6\">No employer in the County shall discharge or refuse to hire any person, or act against any person with respect to compensation or other terms and conditions of employment, or limit, segregate, classify, or assign employees because of discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-7\">Prince George\u2019s County Code (2003), Section 2-222. The umbrella provision, of course, for her claim was Section 42 of Article 49B of the Maryland Code, which provided, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b699-8\">(a) <em>Authorized.\u2022 </em>\u2014 In Montgomery County, Prince George\u2019s County, and Howard County, in accordance with this subtitle, a person who is subjected to an act of discrimination prohibited by the county code may bring and maintain a civil action against the person who committed the alleged discriminatory act for damages, injunctive relief, or other civil relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b699-9\">Maryland Code (1957, 2003 Repl.Vol.), Section 42 of Article 49B.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>In proving her claim of disparate treatment, Ms. Taylor utilized evidence regarding four male truck drivers at Giant with significant health problems, none of whom was required to undergo an independent medical examination. Our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals, however, determined that Ms. Taylor\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot such as to allow any reasonable fact-finder to conclude that Taylor was treated differently \u2014 that is, required to undergo an IME by a Giant-specified doctor for a condition not covered by a DOT physical \u2014 than similarly situated male employees at all, let alone on the basis of gender.\u201d <em>Giant, </em>188 Md.App. at 38, 981 A.2d at 23. In attempting to overcome the decision of the Court of Special Appeals regarding comparator evidence, Ms. Taylor asserts that the intermediate appellate court \u201ccreated new evidentiary standards which are at odds with existing law and will be impossible to achieve.\u201d Giant contends, however, that the male comparator evidence was inapposite, because an independent medical examination was unnecessary to monitor their condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">In addressing the issue of appropriate comparator evidence, we recognize the dearth of our own jurisprudence on this issue, as well as our history of consulting federal precedent in the equal employment area. <em>Haas v. Lockheed Martin Corp., </em>396 Md. 469, 481, 481 n. 8, 914 A.2d 735 (2007) (\u201cTitle VII is the federal analog to Article 49B of the Maryland Code\u201d and \u201cour courts traditionally seek guidance from federal cases in interpreting Maryland\u2019s Article 49B\u201d). Federal courts have permitted plaintiffs to prove discrimination with circumstantial evidence by demonstrating that \u201csimilarly situated individuals outside the[ir] protected class were treated more favorably.\u201d <em>Benuzzi v. Bd. of Educ., </em>647 F.3d 652, 662 (7th Cir.2011). Under some circumstances, circumstantial evidence has been deemed \u201cmore certain, satisfying and persuasive than direct evidence.\u201d <em>Merritt v. Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., </em>601 F.3d 289, 299-300 (4th Cir.2010), quoting <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 100, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>In <em>Merritt, </em>601 F.3d at 289, the Fourth Circuit recognized that an employer\u2019s differing treatment of the ailments of members of the opposite sex may support a gender discrimination claim, even where the circumstances surrounding the ailments were not identical. In <em>Merritt, </em>a female truck driver for Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., had been required to take a \u201cphysical ability test,\u201d or PAT, before returning to work after an ankle injury; similarly situated male drivers were not required to do so. After she was terminated for having not passed the PAT, Ms. Merritt filed a gender discrimination suit on a disparate treatment theory, which the trial court disposed of on summary judgment. The Fourth Circuit reversed, however, observing, among other things, that Ms. Merritt had put forth evidence that two \u201cmale drivers missed work as a result of an injury,\u201d but, \u201c[u'Jnlike Merritt, both men were allowed to return to their full duties without passing a PAT.\u201d <em>Merritt, </em>601 F.3d at 298. The male drivers, significantly, did not have ankle injuries, but did have injuries that could affect their performance: one male driver underwent a hernia operation and missed six months of work, while the other male driver missed work due to an injured shoulder. The Fourth Circuit emphasized that \u201c[b]y utilizing the PAT to assess the physical qualifications of Merritt but not males similarly situated to her, [Old Dominion] could be seen by a jury to embrace beliefs that women are unsuited for some of the more remunerative forms of manual labor and, once injured, are less resilient in their ability to recover.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300; <em>see also Freeman v. Madison Metropolitan School District, </em>231 F.3d 374, 383 (7th Cir.2000) (African American janitor with permanent knee injuries was not required to produce Caucasian employee \"with exact same ailment; a Caucasian worker with a temporary back injury was sufficient to survive employer\u2019s motion for directed verdict); <em>Eaton, </em>657 F.3d at 556 (instructing that courts should refrain from applying comparator evidence \u201cso rigidly or inflexibly that it [becomes] a useless analytical tool,\u201d quoting <em>Silverman v. Board of Education, </em>637 F.3d 729, 742 (7th Cir.2011)); <em>Chaney v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number><em>Plainfield Healthcare Ctr., </em>612 F.3d 908, 916 (7th Cir.2010) (comparator need not be a clone, only \u201csubstantially similar\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Further, relevant to the singularity of gender-specific ailments, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals has considered how a company treated employees of the opposite sex with dissimilar health conditions to determine that a woman was treated adversely when she had an abortion. In <em>Doe v. C.A.R.S. Protection Plus, Inc., </em>527 F.3d 358 (3d Cir.2008), the treatment of Jane Doe, a female employee who suffered complications during a pregnancy and ultimately, had to terminate her pregnancy, was compared with the treatment of male employees with health conditions unrelated to their gender. During Ms. Doe\u2019s absence, because of the abortion, Ms. Doe failed to call in, and she was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">In her Title VII case, Ms. Doe claimed that male employees with health-related absences were not fired for failing to abide by the call-in policy. The district court granted the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, reasoning that Ms. Doe had failed to establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of gender discrimination. The Third Circuit reversed, observing that two male employees had not been subjected to adverse employment action for failing to call in when they were ill from a heart attack and a psychiatric problem. <em>Doe, </em>527 F.3d at 366-67; <em>see also Strickland v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>555 F.3d 1224, 1231 (10th Cir.2009) (concluding that Ms. Strickland\u2019s gender discrimination claim was not defeated \u201cas a matter of law,\u201d because the record reflected \u201cthat she was treated worse than her male co-workers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Giant asserts, however, that Ms. Taylor\u2019s comparator evidence is insufficient nonetheless, because she did not have the same supervisor as her male counterparts, that none of the male comparators sought exemption from Giant\u2019s call-in policy due to their ailment, and that the male comparators had submitted a certification from their private doctors that it was safe for them to return to work. Ms. Taylor asserts that none of these distinguishing facts, in themselves, renders her discrimination claim insufficient as a matter of law, because all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>the comparators had serious health conditions that did not trigger an independent medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It is clear that one who alleges discrimination need not identify and reconcile every distinguishing characteristic of the comparators. In <em>Sprint/United Management Co. v. Mendelsohn, </em>552 U.S. 379, 128 S.Ct. 1140, 170 L.Ed.2d 1 (2008), for instance, in the context of an age discrimination suit, the Supreme Court of the United States addressed whether testimony of co-workers that were subjected to discrimination by supervisors other than that of the plaintiff could be relevant to the discrimination inquiry. The Court instructed that the relevance of evidence that other supervisors engaged in discriminatory conduct \u201cdepends on many factors, including how closely related the evidence is to the plaintiffs circumstances and theory of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 387, 128 S.Ct. at 1147, 170 L.Ed.2d at 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">In <em>Chaney v. Plainfield Healthcare Center, </em>612 F.3d at 908, Brenda Chaney, an African American nurse aide, was fired after only three months of working at Plainfield Healthcare Center, allegedly because she had used profanity and delayed in responding to a patient\u2019s call for assistance. Ms. Chaney filed a Title VII racial discrimination claim, alleging that she had been fired, not because she used profanity, but because some patients at Plainfield may have preferred not to have a black nurse aide. The district court granted Plainfield\u2019s motion for summary judgment and the Seventh Circuit reversed, in part, because Ms. Chaney had produced evidence that a Caucasian aide that had not been fired, despite having failed to timely respond to a bed alarm and assist a patient in need of emergency assistance. The Third Circuit acknowledged that, \u201cunlike Chaney, Hart was not accused of using profanity in front of a resident,\u201d but went on to instruct that \u201cthe similarly situated coworker inquiry is a search for a <em>substantially similar employee, not for a clone.\u201d Id. </em>at 916 (emphasis added). In determining that a reasonable jury could conclude that Plainfield had discriminated against Ms. Chaney, the court reasoned if \u201cfailing to respond to a bed alarm is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>separate, terminable offense, it is suspicious that Hart ... got off without so much as a warning.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">In <em>Elkhatib v. Dunkin Donuts, Inc., </em>493 F.3d 827 (7th Cir.2007), moreover, a Palestinian Arab was denied renewal of his franchise agreement with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts after he declined to sell breakfast items containing pork. Mr. Elkhatib filed a racial discrimination claim, which the district court disposed of on summary judgment. The Seventh Circuit reversed, in part, because Mr. Elkhatib had identified three other Dunkin\u2019 Donuts franchises that had \u201crefused to carry the full line of breakfast sandwiches.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 831. The court rejected Dun-kin\u2019 Donuts\u2019s contention that Mr. Elkhatib\u2019s comparators were insufficient because of various distinguishing factors, to include: that none of the comparators were Arab, the first comparator\u2019s reason for not carrying breakfast item was related to a condition of his commercial lease, the second comparator\u2019s reason for not carrying breakfast items was lack of space, and the third comparator\u2019s reason for not carrying pork products was to \u201cmeet the demand in the area for a kosher establishment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded that, while Mr. Elkhatib\u2019s comparators all had distinguishing characteristics, they had an important one in common, that being: they did not comply with Dunkin\u2019 Donuts requirement that a full line of breakfast products be served, yet none were denied a renewal of their franchise agreement like Mr. Elkhatib was.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">In the instant case, the record reveals that all four of Ms. Taylor\u2019s male comparators were afflicted with serious health problems, including Diabetes, Parkinson\u2019s Disease, and severe dizziness, but none was required to undergo an independent medical examination, while Ms. Taylor <em>was, </em>for a gynecological problem. Were we to adopt the approach Giant advocates and require Ms. Taylor to produce a comparator with a gender-specific ailment that escaped the attention of DOT physicals, yet was not subjected to an independent medical examination, we would essentially be eradicating disparate treatment based on gender-specific ailments as an actionable form of discrimination altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>Giant, though, suggests that an unpublished opinion of the Third Circuit, <em>Opsatnik v. Norfolk Southern Corp., </em>335 Fed.Appx. 220 (3d Cir.2009), in which an individual\u2019s Title VII disciplinary discrimination claims failed at the summary judgment stage, should control. The <em>Opsatnik </em>decision, Giant claims, supports the Court of Special Appeals conclusion that Ms. Taylor\u2019s comparators were not similarly situated because of having different supervisors. <em>Opsatnik, </em>however, relying on the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Mendelsohn, </em>552 U.S. at 379, 128 S.Ct. at 1140, 170 L.Ed.2d at 1, identified having the same supervisor as one consideration regarding similarly situated, among many. In <em>Opsatnik, </em>a Caucasian male, Jeffrey Opsatnik, was fired from his position as a locomotive engineer at Norfolk Southern for a record of misconduct up to and including his failure to reduce the speed of a train in operation to below 40 miles per hour in \u201cobservance of weather-related speed restrictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 221. Mr. Opsatnik filed a Title VII suit alleging that similarly situated African American, female, as well as younger employees had not been terminated for similar misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">The trial court granted Norfolk Southern\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the Third Circuit affirmed. The Third Circuit instructed that the sufficiency of comparator evidence is <em>\u201cdetermined by the context of each case, </em>but often includes a showing that the two employees dealt with the same supervisor, were subject to the same standards, and had engaged in similar conduct without such differentiating or mitigating circumstances as would distinguish their conduct or the employer\u2019s treatment of them.\u201d <em>Opsatnik, </em>335 Fed.Appx. at 223 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted). Further, the Third Circuit clarified that \u201cthere can be no <em>per se </em>rule that comparator evidence from employees with different supervisors is irrelevant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying a contextual approach, the Third Circuit concluded that Mr. Opsatnik had not adduced sufficient comparator evidence because the comparators did not work in the same division, have speed violations or have as many infractions.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>Giant also insists that Ms. Taylor\u2019s comparator evidence fails because the male drivers did not ask to be exempted from Giant\u2019s call-in policy and because some male drivers were permitted to return to work after obtaining a certification from their private doctors. To embrace Giant\u2019s reasoning, however, would encourage courts to parse out every individual aspect and employment factor, rather than consider the single most relevant fact, that each of the male drivers used as comparators had significant health conditions but were not required to submit to an independent medical examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">In this case, we also must determine whether legally sufficient evidence was adduced to support the jury verdict that Giant terminated Ms. Taylor\u2019s employment in retaliation for having filed a discrimination claim with the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission. In order to make this determination, \u201cwe must view the evidence, and the inferences reasonably deducible from the evidence, in a light most favorable to [the plaintiff], looking only to whether, viewed in that manner, it was legally sufficient to create a triable issue.\u201d <em>Georgia-Pacific Corp. v. Pransky, </em>369 Md. 360, 364, 800 A.2d 722, 724 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">In <em>Manikhi v. Mass Transit Administration, </em>360 Md. 333, 758 A.2d 95 (2000), in the context of a retaliation claim arising from the internal reporting of sexual harassment, we stated that the pleading requirements for a retaliation claim were that the employee: (1) \u201cengaged in a statutorily protected expression or activity;\u201d (2) \u201csuffered an adverse employment action by her employer;\u201d and (3) \u201cthere is a causal link between the protected expression and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 349, 758 A.2d at 103-104, quoting <em>Knox v. Indiana, </em>93 F.3d 1327, 1333-34 (7th Cir.1996). In <em>Ruffin Hotel Corp. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 17 A.3d 676 (2011), another retaliation case predicated on a report of sexual harassment, we clarified that an employee must merely adduce evidence that their protected activity was a \u201cmotivating factor\u201d in an employer\u2019s decision to subject them to an adverse employment action, not necessarily the controlling factor. <em>Id. </em>at 614, 17 A.3d at 687.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>The specific element that is in question is whether Ms. Taylor adduced sufficient evidence of a causal link between her discrimination claim and Giant\u2019s termination of her employment. Ms. Taylor argues that the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision effectively renders it impossible for her or anyone in her position to prove retaliation through circumstantial evidence, because Giant employees\u2019 denials of knowledge of the filing of her claim was accepted as dispositive by the Court of Special Appeals. Giant responds that Ms. Taylor failed to show that the individual decision-makers involved in her discharge on February 28, 2003, Mr. Weiss and Ms. Smith, knew that Ms. Taylor had filed a discrimination claim at the time the decision was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\">In the present case, Ms. Taylor adduced solely circumstantial evidence to prove Giant knew of the discrimination claim. The distinction between direct evidence of knowledge and circumstantial evidence is oftentimes at the heart of a retaliation case, as exemplified by the Seventh Circuit\u2019s discussion in <em>Sylvester v. SOS Children\u2019s Villages, </em>453 F.3d 900 (7th Cir.2006). In <em>Sylvester, </em>Rosemary Sylvester, an employee of a foster home association, SOS Children\u2019s Villages, filed a Title VII discrimination and retaliation claim against Job West, the CEO of SOS, after Ms. Sylvester was fired, she claimed, for having reported Mr. West\u2019s sexually discriminatory remarks in a letter to SOS\u2019s board, which three of her fellow employees had signed. After receiving the letter, two signatories of the letter, excluding Ms. Sylvester, were fired for poor job performances. At a later SOS board meeting, Ms. Sylvester\u2019s job performance was discussed, even though she had recently received a positive performance evaluation. Immediately after her colleagues\u2019 firing were announced, Ms. Sylvester also met with Mr. West, after which Ms. Sylvester was fired for insubordination. The district court granted summary judgment to SOS on Ms. Sylvester\u2019s retaliation claim. The Seventh Circuit reversed. The court\u2019s exploration of the evidentiary aspects of a retaliation claim elucidates various evidentiary considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>The plaintiffs claim that she was retaliated against ... for opposing sex discrimination in the form of sexual harassment depends entirely on circumstantial evidence; and we must first consider whether and in what sense such evidence can be used to prove retaliation (or other forms of discrimination, but we confine our discussion to retaliation). The usual way in which a plaintiff tries to establish a prima facie case (that is, a case strong enough to withstand summary judgment for the defendant) of retaliation is by an adaptation of the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>test.... [Tjhis \u201crequires the plaintiff to show that after filing the charge [or otherwise opposing the employer\u2019s allegedly discriminatory practice] only he, and not any similarly situated employee who did not file a charge, was subjected to an adverse employment action even though he was performing his job in a satisfactory manner.\u201d This method of establishing a prima facie case requires proof both of similarly situated employees and of the plaintiffs performing his job satisfactorily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-5\">This method is called \u201cindirect\u201d; the alternative \u2014 the \u201cdirect\u201d \u2014 method of establishing a prima facie case of retaliation requires the plaintiff \u201cto present direct <em>evidence </em>(evidence that establishes without resort to inferences from circumstantial evidence) that he engaged in protected activity (filing a charge of discrimination) and as a <em>result </em>suffered the adverse employment action of which he complains.\u201d This method is ordinarily more onerous because of the phrase that we have italicized, but it is the plaintiffs only recourse if he (in this case she) cannot prove that a similarly situated employee who did oppose the employer\u2019s practice was not fired or otherwise treated as badly as the plaintiff was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-6\">Read literally, the passage just quoted ... would defeat Sylvester\u2019s use of the \u201cdirect\u201d method because the passage says that the method requires \u201cdirect evidence,\u201d defined in the passage as \u201cevidence that establishes [a proposition] without resort to inferences from circumstantial evidence.\u201d This is a misleading dictum. What is true is that the direct method does not utilize the specific circumstantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>that the plaintiff presents when he uses the indirect method of establishing discrimination. But if he can prove by means of circumstantial evidence \u201cthat he engaged in protected activity (filing a charge of discrimination) and as a result suffered the adverse employment action of which he complains,\u201d that is fine, as most of our cases ... properly assume.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-4\">The distinction between direct and circumstantial evidence is vague ... but more important it is irrelevant to assessing the strength of a party\u2019s case. From the relevant standpoint \u2014 that of probative value \u2014 \u201c \u2018direct\u2019 and \u2018circumstantial\u2019 evidence are the same in principle.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-5\">The conventional distinction is that direct evidence is testimony by a witness about a matter within his personal knowledge and so does not require drawing an inference from the evidence (his testimony) to the proposition that it is offered to establish, whereas circumstantial evidence does require drawing inferences. By that standard, even a documentary admission is circumstantial evidence, because the genuineness of the document must be inferred before the admission can be credited. But actually all evidence, even eyewitness testimony, requires drawing inferences; the eyewitness is drawing an inference from his raw perceptions. \u201cAll evidence is probabilistic, and therefore uncertain; eyewitness testimony and other forms of \u2018direct\u2019 evidence have no categorical epistemological claim to precedence over circumstantial or even explicitly statistical evidence.\u201d Perhaps on average circumstantial evidence requires a longer chain of inferences, but if each link is solid, the evidence may be compelling \u2014 may be more compelling than eyewitness testimony, which depends for its accuracy on the accuracy of the eyewitness\u2019s recollection as well as on his honesty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b709-6\">A residual suspicion of circumstantial evidence in discrimination (including retaliation) cases is perhaps reflected in the frequent references in decisions of this court to \u201ca convincing mosaic of circumstantial evidence\u201d as an alternative \u201cdirect\u201d method to direct evidence of establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>prima facie case. The phrase <em>first </em>appeared ... to describe the \u201ckind of circumstantial evidence ... that consists of ambiguous statements, suspicious timing, discrimination against other employees, and other pieces of evidence none conclusive in itself but together composing a convincing mosaic of discrimination against the plaintiff.\u201d A mosaic is a work of visual art composed of a large number of tiny tiles that fit smoothly with each other, a little like a crossword puzzle. A case of discrimination can likewise be made by assembling a number of pieces of evidence none meaningful in itself, consistent with the proposition of statistical theory that a number of observations each of which supports a proposition only weakly can, when taken as a whole, provide strong support if all point in the same direction: \u201ca number of weak proofs can add up to a strong proof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b710-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 902-03 (citations omitted). Thereafter, the court enumerated several pieces of circumstantial evidence that buttressed Ms. Sylvester\u2019s claim of retaliation: the fact that two signatories were promptly fired after drafting the letter despite their having poor work records for a substantial period of time, Ms. Sylvester\u2019s job performance being discussed, although she had \u201cno current performance issues,\u201d by the SOS board after she signed the letter, and the fact that Mr. West was authorized to fire Ms. Sylvester for reacting to the firing of the two co-signatories, not poor job performance. <em>Id. </em>at 905.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-6\">In <em>Imwalle v. Reliance Medical Products, Inc., </em>515 F.3d 531 (6th Cir.2008), Dennis Imwalle, the former President of Reliance Medical Products, was terminated from his position three months after he filed complaints for age and national-origin discrimination with the EEOC. Thereafter, he filed suit, alleging various discrimination and retaliation claims. At trial, Mr. Imwalle adduced evidence that he experienced an \u201catmosphere of retaliation\u201d at Reliance Medical Products, that he was \u201cmore or less divorced from the activities\u201d of his company, and that \u201c \u2018key decisions\u2019 were made \u2018without his input or knowledge.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Mr. Imwalle, and Reliance Medical Products appealed, arguing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>among other things, that Mr. Imwalle failed to adduce legally sufficient evidence to support the jury verdict. The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the jury verdict, reasoning that Mr. Imwalle\u2019s circumstantial evidence, which included his own testimony \u201cabout the retaliatory atmosphere he experienced following his complaints,\u201d and the relatively close three-month interim between his complaints and his termination, taken together in the light most favorable to Mr. Imwalle, would not lead \u201creasonable minds\u201d to the one conclusion that Mr. Imwalle\u2019s complaints were not a motivating factor in his termination. <em>Id. </em>at 550-51; <em>see also Moore v. KUKA Welding Systems, </em>171 F.3d 1073, 1080 (6th Cir.1999) (evidence that, after the plaintiff filed an EEOC complaint, he became increasingly isolated at work, experienced more disciplinary writeups for trivial matters, and received \u201cunwarranted criticism\u201d of his work product, \u201cviewed as a whole\u201d supported the jury\u2019s finding of retaliation).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">In <em>Pickett v. Sheridan Health Care Center, </em>610 F.3d 434 (7th Cir.2010), Danielle Pickett, worked for Sheridan Health Care Center as a dietary aide and housekeeper. Over the course of her employment, Ms. Pickett informed her superiors on several occasions that residents at the Sheridan had made lewd remarks and touched her inappropriately. One day, after a heated conversation about the inappropriate behavior of certain residents with a supervisor, Ms. Pickett left work in tears. Later, after her supervisors conferred with Ms. Pickett and suggested that she \u201cpart ways\u201d with the company, Sheridan formally discharged Ms. Pickett for leaving the work premises while on the clock. <em>Id. </em>at 442. Ms. Pickett sued for retaliatory discharge, and the jury returned a verdict in her favor. Sheridan appealed the verdict on grounds it was not supported by sufficient evidence. The Seventh Circuit af<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>firmed, reasoning that \u201ca finding that appellant was fed up with Pickett for impermissible reasons (frustration with the steady stream of Pickett\u2019s protected requests to curtail what she believed to be sexual harassment) and was waiting for an excuse to get rid of her would explain\u201d why, the day before she was fired, she went from showing up to her job ready to work \u201cto tearfully pleading to hold on to her job ... all <em>before </em>walking out of the Center.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 442. The court concluded that, because Ms. Pickett was already under the impression that she had been fired prior to Sheridan\u2019s formal notice of discharge and her supervisors suggested that she \u201cpart ways\u201d with the company, a reasonable juror could have been suspicious \u201cabout whether the sudden departure of an otherwise well-performing employee would lead to automatic termination.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Polk v. Yellow Freight System, Inc., </em>876 F.2d 527, 531 (6th Cir.1989) (there was sufficient evidence of retaliation where plaintiff, Ms. Polk, proved that a superior stated, \u201cI know where you\u2019ve been\u201d to Ms. Polk after she visited the Michigan Department of Civil Rights, and she was fired one day later).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">The record reflects that, after Ms. Taylor filed her discrimination complaint with the Prince George\u2019s County Human Relations Commission on February 3, 2003, the Commission mailed a notice to Mr. Garrett, an officer in Giant\u2019s Office of Fair Employment, which he testified as having received on February 7, 2003. Mr. Garrett testified that, as of February 20, 2003, he had communicated with the Commission regarding Ms. Taylor\u2019s discrimination complaint and had even attempted to mediate on behalf of Giant. Mr. Garrett had also been involved in Ms. Taylor\u2019s gynecological-related union grievances prior to the filing of the discrimination claim in question, attended at least one grievance hearing related to Ms. Taylor\u2019s condition at which Mr. Weiss was present, and had even been asked by Giant officials to perform his own research on Ms. Taylor\u2019s gender-related ailments. The jury was entitled to disbelieve the testimony of denial of notice by Mr. Weiss and Ms. Smith and embrace Ms. Taylor\u2019s circumstantial evidence of knowledge of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Finally, we address Ms. Taylor\u2019s challenge to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s award of attorney\u2019s fees to her, which was brought to us by a second petition for certiorari. She argues that the intermediate appellate court lacked jurisdiction to consider Giant\u2019s untimely filed appeal, which was filed more than 30 days after the trial court issued and entered its order granting her motion for attorney\u2019s fees, and thus was untimely filed under Rule 8-602.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We agree, for it is axiomatic that <em>\u201ca </em>party in the trial court must file a timely notice of appeal, from an appealable judgment, in order to confer upon an appellate court subject matter jurisdiction over that party\u2019s appeal.\u201d <em>In re Nicole B., </em>410 Md. 33, 62, 976 A.2d 1039, 1055 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">In reversing the Court of Special Appeals opinion, however, we are mindful that the intermediate appellate court did not reach a number of issues also raised by Giant in its appeal, which requires that we remand the case to the intermediate appellate court for consideration of the additional issues. <em>See New York Bronze Powder Co. v.

Giant has identified various cases, both reported and unreported, in which federal courts have held that state law claims were preempted by Section 301 of the Labor-Management Relations Act. The cases are inapposite, however, because, unlike the instant case, they all involved some iteration of a <em>breach </em>of a collective bargaining agreement. <em>See Batista v. Stewart Enterprises, Inc., </em>126 Fed.Appx. 767, 769 (9th Cir. 2005) (plaintiff argued that his former employer breached its progressive discipline policy, which incorporated terms from a collective bargaining agreement, in order to prove that he was fired because of his age); <em>Audette v. International Longshoremen\u2019s and Warehousemen\u2019s Union, </em>195 F.3d 1107, 1112 (9th Cir.1999) (observing that, in order for the plaintiff to prove a breach of the settlement agreement, the court had to determine if the collective bargaining agreement was breached, \"as the complaint itself indicate[d].\u201d); <em>Flibotte v. Pennsylvania Truck Lines, Inc., </em>131 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.1997) (inquiry into whether an employer breached its duty to \"provide a suitable hygienic environment\u201d for a drug examination necessarily required a determination as to whether the terms of a collective bargaining agreement were breached); <em>Reece v. Houston Lighting &amp; Power Co., </em>79 F.3d 485, 487 (5th Cir.1996) (allegations of discrimination in promotion, seniority and assignment to training programs involved interpretation of collective bargaining agreement); <em>Davis v. Johnson Controls, Inc., </em>21 F.3d 866, 868 (8th Cir. 1994) (former disabled employee's disability discrimination claim, which alleged employer failed to reasonably accommodate disability by transferring plaintiff to another position, required interpretation of the seniority provisions of a collective bargaining agreement); <em>Jackson v. Liquid Carbonic Corp., </em>863 F.2d 111, 113-15 (1st Cir.1988) (whether a drug test violated a plaintiff's reasonable expectation of privacy necessarily entailed a determination as to whether a collective bargaining agreement's \u201c 'reasonable' rules and regulations\u201d provision was breached); <em>see also Braxton v. Dillon Companies, Inc., 9 </em>Fed.Appx. 919, 922 (10th Cir.2001) (claims that termination was based on factors covered by a collective bargaining agreement were preempted Section 301); <em>Pant v. New England Power Service Co., </em>239 F.3d 8, 16 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Fant virtually invited this preemption conclusion in his complaint, where he alleged that the treatment constituting the substance of his grievance \u2018was in violation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement entered into by and between the defendants\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b711-6\">. Giant relies on <em>Baqir v. Principi, </em>434 F.3d 733 (4th Cir.2006), for its argument that Ms. Taylor failed to show the knowledge component is misplaced. In <em>Baqir, </em>the plaintiff failed to adduce <em>any </em>evidence, direct or circumstantial, that his employer knew he filed a discrimination claim or from which a rational fact finder could infer knowledge. Such is not the case here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b713-6\">. Rule 8-602 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">(a) Grounds.
