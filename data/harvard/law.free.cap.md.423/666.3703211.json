We are asked to determine whether the evidence adduced at trial was sufficient to convict the Respondent, Leon Thomas Coleman, Jr., of theft by deception under Md.Code (2009), \u00a7 7-104(a) of the Criminal Law Article. We are also asked to determine whether the Deposits on New Homes Subtitle (\u201cAct\u201d), Md.Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-301(a) of the Real Property Article, applies to money received in exchange for land without a residential unit on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">After Coleman failed to perform eight construction contracts for detached homes, he was convicted of eight counts of theft by deception and eight counts of failure to escrow under the Act. The Court of Special Appeals reversed all sixteen convictions, holding that the Act did not apply and that there was insufficient evidence of intent to support the theft convictions. We granted <em>certiorari, State v. Coleman, </em>419 Md. 646, 20 A.3d 115 (2011), and answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-8\">1. Did Respondent\u2019s breach of contract give rise to a criminal action for theft?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-9\">2. Is a transfer of property from the victim to a party other than the defendant a \u201ctransfer of interest or possession\u201d within the meaning of the theft statute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-10\">3. May intent to commit theft by deception be inferred based upon facts occurring after the date the defendant allegedly obtained or exerted control over the property of the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-11\">4. Does the Deposits on New Homes Act apply when the land and new residential unit are not conveyed simultaneously? <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>We shall affirm the Court of Special Appeals. The evidence was insufficient to conclude that Coleman intentionally deprived the buyers of their property, as required under the theft statute.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, like the Court of Special Appeals, we assume, without deciding, that a breach of contract may give rise to a criminal action for theft in some circumstances. We also confirm our precedents establishing that (1) a transfer of property from the victim to a party other than the defendant is a \u201ctransfer of interest or possession\u201d within the meaning of the theft statute and (2) intent may be inferred based on acts subsequent to the alleged crime. Finally, we hold that the plain meaning of the Act indicates that it did not apply to Coleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Facts and Legal Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In February and March of 2004, Coleman entered into contracts to convey eight lots in a subdivision and build homes on those lots.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The subdivision was called Kings Grant Court, a collection of eleven lots in Prince George\u2019s County. Earlier that year, Coleman had acquired the right to purchase Kings Grant Court for $550,000.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>The contracts provided that the buyers would purchase the unimproved lots before their homes were constructed. Seven of the eight contracts identified the price of the unimproved lots, which ranged from $89,959 to $100,000. For at least seven of the eight lots, this price was at or below the appraised value of the land at the times the contracts were executed. The total price under the contracts ranged from $256,000 to $360,891, inclusive of constructing the homes.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">The buyers paid for the unimproved lots by obtaining loans with an initial advance for the purchase of the land. At closing, Coleman used the initial advances to purchase one lot for each buyer and convey title by deeds to them. He received $667,993.19 from the advances and used $500,000 of it to buy the lots.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The remaining balance on the buyers\u2019 loans was held in escrow by the lenders pursuant to a draw schedule under which Coleman would make draws to cover his ongoing construction costs. To make draws, Coleman would have needed to certify that materials were received or work was done, that payment was due, and that the Bank had inspected and approved the work or materials. Coleman never applied for any construction draws, however, because construction never went forward. The only payments that Coleman received from the buyers were the initial land advances, used to purchase the lots, and amounts ranging from $900 to $3500 for paper work costs such as blueprints and site plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">Construction never went forward because Coleman ran out of money before he was able to obtain the required permits. He had hired MDB Design Group LLC on June 30, 2004, to prepare drawings and designs and obtain the permits. His contract with MDB provided that its work would be completed by August 31, 2004. He also consulted a builder about the project and retained two individuals to process permits and provide real estate consulting. When MDB failed to obtain the permits by the deadline, Coleman contacted James Reid, CEO of Civtech Designs, Inc., to discuss replacing MDB.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>Coleman extended MDB\u2019s deadline to November 10, 2004, but MDB again failed to meet it, so he retained Civteeh on November 12, 2004, to do the work that MDB was supposed to have done. He notified the buyers of this change on December 3, 2004, stating that he would still be able to complete the project. By the end of December, however, Coleman\u2019s operating account had a negative balance and he began to ignore inquiries from the buyers. Ultimately, the buyers either filed for bankruptcy, had their lots foreclosed, or refinanced or modified their loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">Sufficiency of the Evidence for Theft by Deception</p>\n<p id=\"b720-6\">When reviewing a criminal conviction for sufficiency of the evidence, \u201c[w]e will consider the evidence adduced at trial sufficient if, \u2018after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Facon v. State, </em>375 Md. 435, 454, 825 A.2d 1096, 1107 (2003) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 2789, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)); <em>see also Winder v. State, </em>362 Md. 275, 325, 765 A.2d 97, 124 (2001) (holding that a conviction must be upheld when \u201cthe record evidence could reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">The prosecution needed to prove that Coleman \u201cobtain[ed] control over property by willfully or knowingly using deception\u201d with one of these states of mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-8\">(1) intends to deprive the owner of the property;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-9\">(2) willfully or knowingly uses, conceals, or abandons the property in a manner that deprives the owner of the property; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-10\">(3) uses, conceals, or abandons the property knowing the use, concealment, or abandonment probably will deprive the owner of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">Md.Code \u00a7 7-104(b) of the Criminal Law Article. The statute defines \u201cdeprive\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AVmh\">to withhold property of another:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>(1) permanently;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">(2) for a period that results in the appropriation of a part of the property\u2019s value;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-6\">(3) with the purpose to restore it only on payment of a reward or other compensation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">(4) to dispose of the property or use or deal with the property in a manner that makes it unlikely that the owner will recover it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">Md.Code \u00a7 7-101(c) of the Criminal Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-9\">Property can be \u201cobtained,\u201d for purposes of theft by deception, even when it is transferred to a third party. Maryland Code \u00a7 7-101(g) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201c \u2018Obtain\u2019 means ... in relation to property, to bring about a transfer of interest in or possession of the property[.]\u201d); <em>Cicoria v. State, </em>332 Md. 21, 32, 629 A.2d 742, 747 (1993) (observing that \u201cobtain,\u201d for purposes of theft, means \u201cto bring about a transfer of interest or possession, whether to the offender or to another\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The requirement of intentional deprivation makes theft a specific intent crime. <em>Jones v. State, </em>303 Md. 323, 340, 493 A.2d 1062, 1070 (1985) (\u201cTo steal property is to take it with an intent to deprive the owner of the rights and benefits of ownership.\u201d) (citing <em>U.S. v. Turley, </em>352 U.S. 407, 411, 77 S.Ct. 397, 399, 1 L.Ed.2d 430 (1957)); <em>Murray v. State, </em>214 Md. 383, 386, 135 A.2d 314, 315 (1957) (\u201cTheft is defined as [a] crime consisting in the intentional taking, without legal warrant, of the personal property of another with the unlawful intention to deprive the owner of such property.\u201d (citation and quotations omitted)); <em>see also </em>Charles E. Moylan Jr., <em>Maryland\u2019s Consolidated Theft Law and Unauthorized Use </em>61 (2002) (Theft requires \u201ca more remote intent to achieve some purpose or bring about some end result above and beyond the mere intentional commission of the <em>actus </em>reus.... It is required that the alleged thief ... has the purpose of depriving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>owner of property!.]\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Intent may be inferred from acts occurring subsequent to the commission of the alleged crime. As we observed in <em>Sorrell v. State,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-6\">Flight by itself is not sufficient to establish the guilt of the defendant, but is merely a circumstance to be considered with other factors as tending to show a consciousness of guilt and therefore guilt itself.... The flight doctrine has been applied to a broad spectrum of behavior occurring after the commission of a crime: flight from the scene or from one\u2019s usual haunts after the crime, assuming a false name, shaving off a beard, resisting arrest, attempting to bribe arresting officers, forfeiture of bond by failure to appear, escapes or attempted escapes from confinement, and attempts of the accused to take his own life. (Emphasis added and citations omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">315 Md. 224, 228, 554 A.2d 352, 353-54 (1989); <em>see also U.S. v. Latney, </em>108 F.3d 1446, 1449-50 (D.C.Cir.1997) (\u201c[L]ater acts are most likely to show the accused\u2019s intent when they are fairly recent and in some significant way connected with prior material events!.]\u201d (citations omitted)); <em>Cash v. U.S., </em>700 A.2d 1208, 1212 (D.C.1997) (\u201cEvidence of a subsequent act, if connected in some material way with the event in question, can be probative of a prior state of mind.\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Oliver, </em>443 Mass. 1005, 820 N.E.2d 194 (2005) (holding that the appeals court properly considered \u201cthe defendant\u2019s subsequent conduct as probative of his intent at the time\u201d of the act of theft); <em>State v. Hastings, </em>137 N.H. 601, 631 A.2d 526, 529 (1993) (\u201c[T]o be relevant to a defendant\u2019s earlier state of mind, subsequent acts must be fairly recent and in some significant way connected with prior material events.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The State argues that Coleman\u2019s intent to deprive was proved by the fact that he entered into the contracts, and took the initial advances, with no intent to perform them fully. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>Specifically, the State argues that the jury could have rationally concluded that Coleman never intended to perform based upon</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-4\">his failure to put monies he received from advances toward development of the property; the lack of diligence with which he pursued the development process; and his misrepresentations and his lack of responsiveness to inquiries about the development\u2019s progress, both of which forestalled any legal action against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">We disagree. When a defendant has a right to receive money or property, he cannot be guilty of stealing it. <em>See </em>Md.Code \u00a7 7-101(j) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201c \u2018Property of another\u2019 means property in which a person other than the offender has an interest that the offender does not have the authority to defeat or impair[.]\u201d); <em>State v. King, </em>95 Md. 125, 128, 51 A. 1102, 1103 (1902) (\u201c[T]he Court must be able to determine judicially that the property alleged to have been stolen was the property of another and not the property of the aecused[.]\u201d); <em>see also State v. Galbreath, </em>525 N.W.2d 424, 427 (Iowa 1994) (\u201c[T]he term \u2018property of another\u2019 as it is used in [the theft statute] means property in which the owner retains an interest.... Thus, in the context of an ordinary construction contract, cash advanced as a down payment will not qualify as \u2018property of another\u2019 because title and possession are transferred from the owner to the contractor ... outright.\u201d); <em>Shelley v. State, </em>447 So.2d 124, 125-26 (Miss.1984) (reversing a conviction for embezzlement even though the defendant received $13,250 under \u201ca clearly written and executed contract\u201d for home construction and failed to perform. The buyers \u201cparted with their money and gave it completely to [the defendant]. When he received the money, it belonged to him [even though] he did not produce what is now claimed to have been the \u2018proceeds\u2019 under the quoted embezzlement statute.\u201d); <em>State v. Marshall, </em>541 N.W.2d 330, 333 (Minn.Ct.App.1995) (\u201cBecause money paid by customers became the property of respondent ... the district court properly dismissed theft ... charges.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>Indeed, as we observed in <em>Sibert v. State, </em>even an honest belief in the right to receive money or property negates the mens rea element of theft:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">In elaborating upon the claim of right defense, the Joint Subcommittee observed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">The claim of right defense springs from the notion that in cases of common law larceny the defendant must have had an intent to permanently deprive the owner of the property. If the defendant acted under a mistake as to his right to deal with the property, he could not be guilty of larceny. Similarly, if the defendant can produce evidence that he was acting under an honest belief he had a \u201cclaim of right\u201d, this will be weighed by the trier of the facts in resolving the issue of whether the defendant possessed the requisite <em>mens rea </em>to commit the offense of theft.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-7\">According to this legislative commentary, the claim of right defense in Maryland originated in <em>Saunders v. Mullinix, </em>195 Md. 235, 72 A.2d 720 (1950). The Saunders Court, in referring to this defense in <em>dicta, </em>stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-8\">It is a generally accepted rule in criminal prosecutions that one who either takes or retains the property of another without the latter\u2019s consent for a debt which he in good faith claims to be due him by the owner of the property is not guilty of larceny, because the existence of the debt or the <em>bona fide </em>belief in its existence shows a lack of felonious intent in the taking or detention of the property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-9\">(Emphasis added and citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b724-10\">301 Md. 141, 147-148, 482 A.2d 483, 486-87 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-11\">There is no evidence that Coleman lacked either a right to the money he received or \u201can honest belief\u2019 in that right. <em>See id. </em>The evidence at trial shows that he gave value, i.e. conveyed the lots, for the money he received in the way of advances to pay for the lots, as provided under the contracts. In exchange for the initial draws and miscellaneous payments, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>the buyers received land and also construction blueprints. Coleman received no further payments or draws.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">The State argues that Coleman took money not only for the land and blueprints, but also for his promise to build the homes. Thus, it argues, he stole the money that he took in exchange for the promise to build, because he never intended to complete construction. The State produced no evidence to support this, however, except to note that Coleman received more for the lot sales than he paid for the land. Importantly, there is no evidence that he received more than market value for the land he conveyed. Indeed, for at least seven of the eight lots, the price he charged was at or below the appraised value of the land.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In short, making a profit on a land transaction is not theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">At trial, the State also attempted to introduce evidence that Coleman had used money from the initial draws for expenses unrelated to the contracts, but the trial judge did not allow the evidence. The State now argues that Coleman\u2019s failure to spend some of the money <em>implies </em>that he kept it for himself or used it for personal expenses. Specifically, the State asserts that Coleman \u201cappear[ed] to develop the lots so that he could evade detection until he had spent the money\u201d and \u201cprofited handsomely from selling [the] land.\u201d There is no evidence, however, that Coleman used the money for anything but the Kings Grant Court project. With these facts, no rational jury could conclude that Coleman intentionally deprived the buyers of their money by overcharging for their lots and keeping the excess money with no intent to perform the rest of the contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">What is more, Coleman\u2019s actions between the time of contract and the arrest manifested his intent to perform. In addition to deeding the lots for the money he received, Coleman worked with several companies to draft architectural drawings and floor plans; retained MDB to obtain permits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>and perform architectural and engineering services; hired two individuals to process permits; consulted a builder about the project; consulted with the CEO of Civtech about replacing MDB; and eventually replaced MDB with Civtech after MDB had missed its self-imposed deadline. These actions, continuing eight months after the contracts were signed, manifested Coleman\u2019s intent to perform. <em>Cf. People v. Riner, </em>234 Ill.App.3d 733, 175 Ill.Dec. 850, 600 N.E.2d 1308, 1310 (1992) (holding that a conviction for theft should not stand when \u201cthe defendant\u2019s actions between the time of the contract and the arrest manifest an intention to perform the contract\u201d); Md. Code \u00a7 7-104(f) of the Criminal Law Article (\u201cUnder this section, an offender\u2019s intention or knowledge that a promise would not be performed may not be established by or inferred solely from the fact that the promise was not performed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The cases on which the State relies do not support its sufficiency argument. The State relies primarily on <em>Fraidin v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 231, 583 A.2d 1065 (1991), and <em>Lane v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 412, 483 A.2d 369 (1984).. <em>Fraidin, </em>however, did not even address the intentional deprivation element of the theft statute. <em>See </em>85 Md.App. at 245, 583 A.2d at 1072 (\u201cOur concerns, therefore, in assessing legal sufficiency, are with only two sub-issues: 1) proof of deception and 2) proof of obtaining control.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Lane, although it did address the deprivation element, did not involve the defendant\u2019s nonperformance of a contract. In <em>Lane, </em>the defendant was a real estate broker who had helped two home buyers procure mortgage loans. To ensure that the buyers would qualify for the loans, the defendant encouraged people unrelated to the transactions to \u201ccertify falsely ... that they were co-purchasers and future residents of the [two] properties[.]\u201d 60 Md.App. at 420-21, 483 A.2d at 374. Without these false certifications, the lender \u201cwould not have parted with its money.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 421, 483 A.2d at 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">In contrast to Coleman, the defendant in <em>Lane </em>never entered into the contracts at all. He simply facilitated the consummation of fraudulent mortgage contracts between oth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>er parties. Moreover, <em>Lane </em>held that the buyers\u2019 intent to perform was <em>irrelevant </em>because the theft was complete when the mortgages were fraudulently obtained. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 483 A.2d at 375. Because <em>Lane </em>did not connect the nonperformance of a contract with the intentional deprivation element of theft, it cannot support the State\u2019s position that Coleman intentionally deprived the buyers of their property by entering into contracts with no intent to perform.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The Deposits on New Homes Subtitle</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Deposits and New Homes Subtitle (\u201cAct\u201d) in effect at the time of Coleman\u2019s execution of the contracts and receipt of the land acquisition advances required a builder or vendor to escrow money received from buyers when,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AV7\">in connection with the sale and purchase of a new single-family residential unit which is not completed at the time of contracting the sale, the vendor or builder obligates the purchaser to pay and the vendor or builder receives any sum of money before completion of the unit and grant of the realty to the purchaser^]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Maryland Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-301(a) of the Real Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-8\">The Act required the escrow account to be maintained until one of these events occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-9\">(1) The granting of a deed to the property on which the residential unit is located to the purchaser;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-10\">(2) The return of the sum of money to the purchaser; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-11\">(3) The forfeiture of the sum by the purchaser, under the terms of the contract of sale relating to the purchase of the residential unit.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b728-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>Md.Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-301(b) of the Real Property Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\u201cStatutory construction begins with the plain language of the statute, and ordinary, popular understanding of the English language dictates interpretation of its terminology.\u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 124 n. 13, 896 A.2d 320, 333 n. 13 (2006). Section 10-301(a) obligated a braider or vendor to escrow only when he or she received money \u201cin connection with the sale and purchase of a new single-family residential unit which is not completed ... before completion of the unit.\u201d Md.Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-301(a) of the Real Property Article. If the legislature had intended the escrow requirement to apply to money received in exchange for land without a residential unit, it would not have referred to \u201cthe unit,\u201d \u201ca new single-family residential unit,\u201d or a unit that is \u201cnot completed.\u201d Moreover, one of the events that terminates the escrow requirement \u2014 the \u201cgranting of a deed to the property on which <em>the residential unit is located\u201d </em>\u2014 demonstrates that the legislature had in mind transactions in which the land had a residential unit on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">The Legislature knew how to craft an escrow requirement that would cover transactions in which land is conveyed without a residential unit. For example, the Custom Home Protection Act provides that a builder must escrow money received \u201cin advance of the completion of the labor or the receipt of the materials for which the consideration is paid.\u201d Md. Code (2009, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-504(a)(l) of the Real Property Article. This escrow requirement, by its plain language, applies whether a residential unit is on the land or not. Such a requirement is sensible, in the case of construction advances, as a means to protect against builders who would abscond with advances before the home is completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-7\">No such danger existed under Coleman\u2019s contracts because he did not apply for or receive any draws or advances for construction. Instead, the contracts provided that construction costs would be financed through loan proceeds <em>already </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number><em>held in escrow </em>by the lenders. To receive draws, Coleman would have needed to certify that materials were received or work was done, that payment was due, and that the Bank had inspected and approved the work or materials. It would not make sense for the legislature to have intended the Act to apply the escrow requirement to Coleman\u2019s situation, because he could not receive any advances with which he could abscond. Coleman\u2019s transactions stand in stark contrast to the kinds of transactions then covered by the escrow requirement, including advances for construction of unfinished homes under \u00a7 10-301(a) and advances for labor and materials under \u00a7 10-504(a)(1). Unscrupulous builders may steal advances, but they cannot steal what they never receive.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-4\">Our interpretation is confirmed by the original version of \u00a7 10-301, which required that the \u201cescrow account ... be maintained until such time as the deed to <em>the new home is delivered </em>[.] \u201d Chapter 667 of the Acts of 1969 (emphasis added). The first amendments to \u00a7 10-301, passed one year after the original version, confirm our interpretation as well. <em>See </em>Chapter 615 of the Acts of 1970 (\u201cThe escrow account ... shall be maintained ... until ... the conveyancing of a deed to the realty upon with <em>the residential unit is situated.\u201d </em>(emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">Indeed, the amendments passed in response to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in this case confirm that the prior version of \u00a7 10-301 did not apply. <em>See Md. Pennysaver Group, Inc. v. Comptroller of Treasury, </em>323 Md. 697, 707-08, 594 A.2d 1142, 1147-48 (1991) (interpreting a 1957 statute based in part on subsequent amendments); <em>Comptroller of Treasury, Retail Sales Tax Div. v.

County v. Myers, </em>232 Md. 213, 218, 192 A.2d 278, 280 (1963) (holding that an \u201camendment ... is not controlling as to the meaning of the prior law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The contrast between the amended Act and the superseded version demonstrates that the prior language did not mean what the new language does. <em>See Md. Pennysaver, </em>323 Md. at 707-08, 594 A.2d 1142, 1147-48; <em>Hardisty, </em>268 Md. at 210-11, 299 A.2d at 775. The former language, a \u201cresidential unit which is not completed,\u201d clearly denotes an unfinished unit, which did not exist on the land that Coleman conveyed. <em>See </em>Md.Code (1998, 2010 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-301(a) of the Real Property Article. On the other hand, the modified language\u2014 \u201ca residential unit, the construction of which has not begun\u201d\u2014 refers to the mere promise of a home. <em>See </em>Chapter 450 of the Acts of 2011. Indeed, the amended Act retains the former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>language alongside the new, which demonstrates that the former language must have a <em>different </em>meaning from the new. <em>See </em>Md.Code (2011), \u00a7 10-301(a) of the Real Property Article (referring to a \u201cresidential unit, the construction of which has not begun or, if begun, is not completed\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Evans v. State, </em>420 Md. 391, 400, 23 A.3d 223 (2011) (\u201cWe ... read[ ] the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d). It is clear, then, that Senate Bill 334 did not \u201cclarify\u201d the meaning of superseded \u00a7 10-301, but actually changed it. The superseded version, by its clear and unambiguous terms, does not apply to Coleman because it does not apply when a builder or vendor deeds land without a home on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Special Appeals. There was insufficient evidence of intentional deprivation to support Coleman\u2019s theft convictions, and the clear and unambiguous language of the superseded Act indicates that it does not apply to transactions in which land is conveyed without a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY PETITIONER.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-12\">. The State presented three questions, including three sub-parts, which we have condensed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\">. In reversing Coleman\u2019s theft convictions, the Court of Special Appeals relied on a different aspect of the <em>mens rea </em>requirement, i.e., the intent to <em>deceive. Coleman v. State, </em>196 Md.App. 634, 653, 11 A.3d 326, 327 (2010) (\"[T]he State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant had the intent to deceive the purchasers necessary to sustain a conviction for theft by deception.\u201d). Because we hold that the evidence was insufficient to find intent to <em>deprive, </em>an argument raised specifically by Coleman on appeal, we need not decide whether the evidence was sufficient to find intent to <em>deceive </em>or whether the Court of Special Appeals applied the correct standard of review to that question. <em>See Wash. Suburban Sanitary Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>413 Md. 606, 637, 994 A.2d 411, 430 (2010) (\u201d[W]e affirm, albeit on somewhat different grounds, the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals[.]\u201d); <em>Buxton v. Buxton, </em>363 Md. 634, 658, 770 A.2d 152, 166 (2001) (\"[W]e have affirmed [the Court of Special Appeals'] determination on a different ground.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b718-8\">. Two additional buyers entered into contracts later that year, but those buyers did not testify at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b718-9\">. Coleman performed these transactions through a corporation called Opportunity Investment Group.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b722-9\">. Thus, irrespective of whether Coleman intended to deceive the buyers, a conviction for theft cannot stand without the intent to deprive.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b725-7\">. Coleman actually received $37,000 <em>less </em>for lot number seven than the price at which Glenn Newell, one of the non-testifying buyers, resold it on April 25, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b727-12\">. Furthermore, in <em>Lane </em>there was evidence that the defendant used the money he received for his own purposes. <em>See Lane v. State, </em>60 Md.App. 412, 423, 483 A.2d 369, 375 (1984) (\u201cAppellant appropriated a portion of the value when the money was used, at least partially, to fund his commissions and bonus.\u201d). Again, there is no evidence that Coleman kept the money or used it improperly.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b730-10\">. Senate Bill 334 was co-filed with House Bill 379 2011.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b730-11\">. Senate Bill 334 also adds two new sub-sections, \u00a7\u00a7 10-301(b)(2) and 10-301(c), which provide,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-12\">(2) The vendor or builder may make withdrawals from an escrow account established under subsection (a)(1) of this section that consists of sums received to finance the construction of a residential unit to pay, in accordance with a draw schedule agreed to by the purchaser in writing, documented claims of persons who have furnished labor or material for the construction of the residential unit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-13\">(c)(l)(i) In this subsection the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-14\">(ii) \"Banking institution\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 1-101 of the Financial Institutions Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-15\">(iii) \"National banking association\u201d has the meaning stated in \u00a7 1-101 of the Financial Institutions Article.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-16\">(2) A banking institution or national banking association at which an escrow account established under subsection (a)(1) of this section is maintained is not responsible for a withdrawal from the escrow account made by the vendor or builder.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b731-6\">. Nor are we asked to apply the revised Act retroactively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b731-7\">. Otherwise, \"any retroactive legislation could be shielded from a successful constitutional attack merely by the insertion of such language.\u201d <em>Wash. Nat\u2019l Arena Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Treasurer, Prince George\u2019s County, </em>287 Md. 38, 54, 410 A.2d 1060, 1069 (1980).
