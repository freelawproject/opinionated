Harrod, seeks reversal of his conviction in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County for possession with intent to distribute cocaine, arguing that the trial court erroneously admitted a chemist\u2019s report without the presence of the chemist, in violation of the procedures mandated by Section 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, Maryland Code (1973, 2006 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Special Appeals affirmed Harrod\u2019s conviction, <em>Harrod v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 85, 993 A.2d 1113 (2010), and we granted certiorari, <em>Harrod v. State, </em>415 Md. 337, 1 A.3d 467 (2010), to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-5\">1. Whether, under Maryland Courts &amp; Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 to 10-1003, the State may, without providing notice to the defendant, admit a chemist report in a drug prosecution without the presence of the chemist unless the defendant specifically requests the presence of the chemist prior to each trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b76-6\">2. Whether, when an issue is decided by the trial court, the entire issue is subject to appellate review under Maryland Rule 8-131(a) or just those bases expressly articulated in or by the trial court?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">We shall hold that it was error to admit the chemist\u2019s report and testimony during Harrod\u2019s retrial, because the State failed to provide the requisite notice pursuant to Section 10-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article prior to the retrial and that error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Harrod was initially charged in a two-count indictment with possession with the intent to distribute cocaine and assault in the second degree. During Harrod\u2019s first jury trial, a chemist called by the State appeared, was qualified as an expert witness and testified from her report regarding the identity of the controlled substance as cocaine and its weight of 8.93 grams; she was subjected to cross-examination by Harrod\u2019s counsel. After the jury sent two notes indicating impasse, the trial judge, upon Harrod\u2019s motion, declared a mistrial as to the possession with intent to distribute charge and took a not guilty verdict as to the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Harrod retained new counsel. Five days prior to the date scheduled for Harrod\u2019s retrial, Harrod\u2019s new attorney filed an \u201cUnopposed Motion for Continuance,\u201d which stated that, due to a family emergency, defense counsel \u201canticipate[d] that she w[ould] not be available, or if she [was] available, w[ould] not be prepared to try this case on the scheduled date.\u201d In reliance upon defense counsel\u2019s representations, the State \u201cinformed [its] witnesses\u201d that the trial \u201cwas most likely going to be continued due to the dire nature of the continuance,\u201d and it did not assure the chemist\u2019s appearance. Soon thereafter, however, the administrative judge denied the motion, reasoning that the \u201c[c]ase ha[d] been pending seven (7) months since the mistrial;\u201d the retrial began on the original date.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">At the retrial, counsel for the State moved to have the testimony of the chemist from the first trial admitted into evidence. Defense counsel objected, stating that she had not had an opportunity to cross-examine the State\u2019s chemist and would have done so differently, but she did not specifically challenge the availability of the chemist. The trial judge replied that he did not perceive a \u201cviolation of 5-802.1\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or any \u201cviolation of <em>Crawford v. </em>Washington.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The State also moved to have the substance and the chemist\u2019s report identifying it as cocaine admitted into evidence, to which defense counsel objected. The State responded that, pursuant to the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, it was \u201callowed to just submit the report and the drugs and not have ... the testimony.\u201d The trial judge, referencing Section 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, ruled that the chemist report was admissible without the chemist unless Harrod filed a written demand prior to the retrial. Thereafter, the judge permitted the State to both admit and read the testimony of the chemist into evidence, as well as to admit her report. Ultimately, Harrod was convicted and sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>Harrod noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, asserting, among other arguments,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that the trial court\u2019s admission of the chemist\u2019s report and testimony violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), because, absent a showing that the State\u2019s chemist was unavailable to testify at trial and that Harrod had the prior opportunity to cross-examine her, Harrod was entitled to be confronted by the chemist at his retrial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>The intermediate appellate court declined to reach the constitutional arguments based on its view that Harrod had failed to object regarding the availability of the chemist in the trial court. <em>Harrod v. State, </em>192 Md.App. 85, 993 A.2d 1113 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Harrod also had argued, however, that the trial court\u2019s admission of the chemist\u2019s report violated Section 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, in part, because \u201cthe State provided no notice that it intended to admit the report without calling the chemist\u201d prior to Harrod\u2019s retrial. The intermediate appellate court rejected this argument, reasoning that \u201cthe statute requires only that the report be \u2018made available to counsel\u2019 \u201d and Harrod had \u201cgiven no indication that the report was not available to him prior to his retrial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133 n. 24, 993 A.2d at 1141 n. 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">In his first certiorari question, Harrod asks us to determine whether Sections 10-1001 and 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article required the State to provide timely pretrial notice of its intent to admit the chemist\u2019s report at Harrod\u2019s retrial without the presence of the chemist.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b81-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We recently discussed the standard of review regarding matters of statutory interpretation in <em>Evans v. State, </em>420 Md. 391, 23 A.3d 223 (2011):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-4\">In statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. Occasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">If, however, the language is subject to more than one interpretation, it is ambiguous, and we endeavor to resolve that ambiguity by looking to the statute\u2019s legislative history, case law, statutory purpose, as well as the structure of the statute. When the statute is part of a larger statutory scheme, it is axiomatic that the language of a provision is not interpreted in isolation; rather, we analyze the statutory scheme as a whole considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body, and attempt to harmonize provisions dealing with the same subject so that each may be given effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 400, 23 A.3d at 228, quoting <em>Ray v. State, </em>410 Md. 384, 404-405, 978 A.2d 736, 747-748 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">The provisions regarding testimony at trial of the chemist and the admissibility of her report are reflected in Sections <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>10-1001 and 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Section 10-1001 provides that, \u201cwithout the necessity of the chemist or analyst personally appearing in court,\u201d a \u201creport signed by the chemist or analyst who performed the test\u201d may serve as \u201cprima facie evidence\u201d that the \u201cmaterial was or contained the substance therein stated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">Section 10-1003 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">(a) <em>In general. </em>\u2014 (1) In a criminal proceeding, the prosecution shall, upon written demand of a defendant filed in the proceedings at least 5 days prior to a trial in the proceeding, require the presence of the chemist, analyst, or any person in the chain of custody as a prosecution witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-7\">(2) The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 and 10-1002 of this part concerning prima facie evidence do not apply to the testimony of that witness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-8\">(3) The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-1001 and 10-1002 of this part are applicable in a criminal proceeding only when a copy of the report or statement to be introduced is mailed, delivered, or made available to counsel for the defendant or to the defendant personally when the defendant is not represented by counsel, at least 10 days prior to the introduction of the report or statement at trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-9\">(b) <em>Witness for defense. </em>\u2014 Nothing contained in this part shall prevent the defendant from summoning a witness mentioned in this part as a witness for the defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-10\">Harrod argues, initially, that he was entitled to timely notice of the chemist\u2019s report before the retrial in order for the State to introduce it and that this notice would have triggered his demand for the chemist\u2019s testimony. The State suggests that the chemist report was made available prior to the first trial, so that notice was not necessary again, and that the chemist\u2019s testimony was admitted during the first trial and Harrod did not demand her presence again. Seminally, we obviously must discuss the effect of the granting of a mistrial on subsequent pretrial procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>It is well-established in our jurisprudence that the grant of a mistrial upon a defendant\u2019s request or consent does not preclude a retrial. <em>Bell v. State, </em>286 Md. 193, 202, 406 A.2d 909, 913 (1979). We have noted, in <em>dicta, </em>that the grant of a mistrial is \u201ctantamount to a holding that there had been no trial at all,\u201d which does not \u201cdeny either the accused or the State the opportunity to litigate directly their rights on retrial.\u201d <em>Cook v. State, </em>281 Md. 665, 670-671, 381 A.2d 671, 674 (1978); <em>see also Powers v. State, </em>285 Md. 269, 285, 401 A.2d 1031, 1040 (1979) (\u201ca mistrial is equivalent to no trial at all\u201d). Similarly, of the grant of a new trial, we have suggested, at least in the usual context, that the effect \u201cis to leave the cause in the same condition as if no previous trial had been held.\u201d <em>Cottman v. State, </em>395 Md. 729, 743, 912 A.2d 620, 628 (2006), quoting <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360, 367, 46 A.2d 607, 610 (1946); <em>see also State Use of Scruggs v. Baltimore Transit Co., </em>177 Md. 451, 454, 9 A.2d 753, 754 (1939) (\u201c[T]he beneficial procedural incidence of the order is to reestablish the equality in law of the parties, which was lost, by restoring them to the position of the litigants at the beginning of the trial before a jury.\u201d); <em>Hammersla v. State, </em>184 Md.App. 295, 313, 965 A.2d 912, 923 (2009) (concluding that the grant of a new trial \u201cwiped the slate clean,\u201d and revived the State\u2019s obligation to provide notice of its intent to seek an enhanced penalty prior to sentencing), <em>cert. denied, </em>409 Md. 49, 972 A.2d 862 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Whether a mistrial in a criminal context restores the parties to their original pretrial positions does not appear to be answered in our jurisprudence. Nevertheless, it is not a leap of faith to acknowledge that the grant of a mistrial in a criminal case does create a \u201ctabula rasa\u201d and requires the litigants to observe pretrial procedures once again. The Supreme Court of Idaho, in <em>State v. Bitz, </em>89 Idaho 181, 404 P.2d 628 (1965), so recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">In <em>Bitz, </em>two co-defendants were retried on burglary charges after a mistrial. Prior to the retrial, Bitz filed motions for a change of venue and a continuance as well as an affidavit to disqualify the trial judge. The trial judge denied the motions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>reasoning that such pretrial relief was available to Bitz only on retrial after appellate reversal of a conviction. The Idaho Supreme Court reversed, concluding that Bitz\u2019s pretrial motions were authorized, because \u201cupon the entry of [mistrial] the case reverted to the status it had prior to the commencement of such proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 631; <em>see also Commonwealth v. James, </em>506 Pa. 526, 486 A.2d 376, 379 (1985) (opining that, when a mistrial is declared, \u201cthe status of the case is as though a trial had never occurred and places the matter in a pretrial context\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">If, then, the grant of a new trial after a mistrial creates a \u201ctabula rasa,\u201d we go back to square one to determine what the parties\u2019 responsibilities were. According to Section 10-1003(a)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the State is required to give timely notice by \u201cmail[ing], delivering], or ma[king] available to counsel for the defendant\u201d a \u201ccopy of the report or statement to be introduced\u201d in order to admit it as substantive evidence without the presence of the chemist under Section 10-1001. The mistrial revived the State\u2019s obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">The State asserts that the record \u201cprovides no reason to believe that a copy of the chemist\u2019s report was not \u2018made available\u2019 to second-trial counsel.\u201d In support, the State postulates that its obligation under Section 10-1003(a)(3) may have been met informally in this case, whether by \u201chanding a copy of the report to defense counsel in person, by calling defense counsel and telling her that it was available,\u201d or by \u201c \u2018open-file\u2019 discovery.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The State, in so doing, misconstrues that the burden of proof that it shoulders can be met by inference and that conversely, Harrod must prove that he did not receive the chemist\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Under Section 10-1003(a)(3), the State is the beneficiary of providing notice, because the chemist\u2019s report can be admitted under Section 10-1001 without the presence of the chemist at trial. When we have addressed the obligations of one who was benefitted from notice, we have recognized the burden of proof is his. In <em>Sloan v. Grollman, </em>113 Md. 192, 77 A. 577 (1910), the Sloans, creditors, disputed that they had received notice from the debtor, Mr. Grollman, that he had filed for bankruptcy, thereby claiming his discharge was ineffective. In response, Mr. Grollman asserted that his attorney had written a letter to the Sloans\u2019 office in Baltimore city \u201c \u2018within a very few days\u2019 after the petition was filed,\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 77 A. at 577, but did not produce anything. In resolving the dispute, we instructed that the filing of a notice of discharge in bankruptcy \u201cis for the benefit of the bankrupt,\u201d and as such, \u201cthe burden is upon him to prove that the omitted creditor had requisite notice on or knowledge of the proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 194, 77 A. at 577. In the case before us, as the party to benefit, the State clearly bears the burden of producing proof of compliance prior to retrial, which it has failed to shoulder.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">While we have not directly discussed the effect of the State\u2019s failure to observe the notice requirements in Section 10-1003, our colleagues on the Court of Special Appeals have, and, unwaveringly, they have characterized the State\u2019s failure to provide notice as fatal to the admission of a chemist report without the presence of the chemist. <em>See Best v. State, </em>79 Md.App. 241, 251, 556 A.2d 701, 706 (1989) (stating that Section 10-1003 acts as a \u201csafety catch,\u201d because it precludes the State from admitting a chemist report \u201cwhere the State has failed to give notice to the defendant or his counsel at least ten days prior to the introduction of ... the written report (in lieu of the chemist)\u201d); <em>Gillis v. State, </em>53 Md.App. 691, 698, 456 A.2d 89, 93 (1983) (concluding that where \u201c[t]he State elected not to comply with the clear mandate of the statute .... the trial judge should have required the witnesses to be produced\u201d); <em>Knight v. State, </em>41 Md.App. 691, 694, 398 A.2d 811, 813 (1979) (reversing conviction where \u201c[t]here [was] absolutely nothing written, typed, or printed upon th[e] report <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>that would lead anyone to believe that the State intended to submit the report in lieu of the testimony of the chemist\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">This stance is in keeping with the rigors of strict compliance enforced by various of our sister states with statutes similar to our own. In <em>State v. Neal, </em>144 Wash.2d 600, 30 P.3d 1255 (2001), for example, the State served Neal with a copy of a toxicologist\u2019s report, but the report failed to provide the name of the person receiving the substance as required by court rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, over Neal\u2019s objection, the trial court admitted the State\u2019s lab report, reasoning that the \u201ccertificate substantially complied \"with the rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1257. The Supreme Court of Washington reversed Neal\u2019s conviction, reasoning that \u201cstrict compliance is required\u201d and the \u201cfailure of the State to comply with the notice requirements of CrR 6.13(b)(3) mandates exclusion of the report.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1260, 1261.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In <em>State v. Miller, </em>170 N.J. 417, 790 A.2d 144 (2002), the Supreme Court of New Jersey also characterized that State\u2019s notice requirement as inflexible.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the context of a prosecution for possession of cocaine, the State had notified Miller of its intention to admit a chemist\u2019s report without the presence of its chemist, but without forwarding a copy of the data revealed in the chemist\u2019s lab analysis. At trial, the court received the chemist\u2019s report over Miller\u2019s objection. The Supreme Court ordered a remand, reasoning that \u201c[a] party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>intending to proffer the certificate must convey \u2018notice of an intent\u2019 to do so to the opposing party at least twenty days before the trial\u201d and that \u201cnotice must include a copy of the lab certificate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 151. The court, explaining strict compliance, pointed out that the \u201cState is fully aware of the lab procedures and the outcome of the testing and has complete access to the lab employees\u201d while defendants are \u201cessentially in the dark and unable to test the lab results\u201d by themselves. <em>Id. </em>at 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">The State wants us to excuse its failure to give notice also by the fortuity of the chemist having testified at Harrod\u2019s first trial. In essence, the State argues that even if the chemist\u2019s report cannot be received in evidence, then the chemist\u2019s testimony alone, or even based on her report, was properly admitted because Harrod did not request the presence of the chemist, so that two fouls equal a home run for the State. Section 10 \u2014 1003(a)(3) disqualifies the State from admitting a chemist report without the chemist, unless it timely mails, delivers, or makes available a copy of the chemist report to the defendant. The State did not comply with the dictates of the statute, substantially or strictly. As a result, the chemist\u2019s testimony does not correct the error.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">The State, nevertheless, insists that the failure to provide timely notice was harmless, because Harrod had \u201cactual notice\u201d of the contents of the chemist report as well as the chemist\u2019s former testimony. Harrod counters that the erroneous admission of the chemist\u2019s report and testimony cannot be harmless, because it \u201cprovided the only evidence that the seized substance was a controlled substance, an element of the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>In <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976), we instructed that, when performing harmless error review, we conduct an independent assessment of the \u201cimpact of the erroneous ruling upon the defendant\u2019s trial and the effect it ha[d] upon the decisional process,\u201d irrespective of whether the error could be labeled \u201cas constitutional or nonconstitutional.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658, 350 A.2d at 677; <em>see also Brafman v. State, </em>276 Md. 676, 679, 349 A.2d 632, 633 (1976) (explaining that, in the context of making a determination as to whether erroneous admission of hearsay testimony was harmless, whether the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation was violated \u201cis of no real moment.\u201d). The result of harmless error review depends upon \u201cour own independent review of the record,\u201d in order to determine whether we are \u201cable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In conducting such an analysis, in the arena of inadmissible evidence, we, as we recently did in two such cases, conduct a thorough review of the record to determine whether we are \u201cable to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. In <em>Anderson v. State, </em>420 Md. 554, 24 A.3d 692 (2011), in the context of a prosecution for sexual abuse of a minor, we considered whether the admission of a doctor\u2019s report into evidence, despite it being inadmissible hearsay, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. In framing our analysis, we instructed that harmless error was \u201cdetermined by examining the use that the State made\u201d of the inadmissible doctor\u2019s report. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 24 A.3d at 700. We observed that the State continually reemphasized the statements made by the victim in the doctor\u2019s report during closing argument, many of which inculpated the defendant, which precluded us from declaring beyond a reasonable doubt that the erroneous reception of the doctor\u2019s report was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">In <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 970 A.2d 320 (2009), we also determined that the trial court erroneously admitted a confidential informant\u2019s hearsay statement, which placed the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>dant at the scene of a drug-trafficking crime. In applying the <em>Dorsey </em>standard, we hinged the fulcrum between harmless and harmful error upon whether we could declare a belief beyond a reasonable doubt that the informant\u2019s statements \u201cin no way influenced the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447, 970 A.2d at 331-332. We were unable to declare such a belief, we explained, because the informant\u2019s statement that \u201can individual fitting Parker\u2019s description was \u2018selling heroin from his person\u2019 \u201d at the scene of the crime \u201cprovided potentially scale-tipping corroboration\u201d for the investigating officer\u2019s testimony that \u201che observed Parker engage in what he believed to be \u2018illegal narcotic activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 447-48, 970 A.2d at 332. The informant\u2019s testimony, we concluded, \u201cadded substantial, perhaps even critical, weight to the State\u2019s case against Parker,\u201d and we ordered a new trial. <em>Id. </em>at 448, 970 A.2d at 332 (citation omitted) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Harmless error analysis in the instant case, applied correctly, yields the only justified conclusion that admission of the chemist\u2019s report and testimony was prejudicial, and <em>ergo, </em>harmful. In order to support a conviction for possession with intent to distribute a controlled dangerous substance, the State introduced the chemist\u2019s report to prove that the \u201c40 rocks of white chalky [substance]\u201d seized from Harrod\u2019s person was \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d and totaled \u201c8.93 grams\u201d in weight. Certainly, both the identity of the rocks as controlled dangerous substances, as well as their weight, were adduced to satisfy the elements of the charge, \u201cpossessing] cocaine, a controlled dangerous substance, in sufficient quantity to reasonably indicate under all circumstancefs] an intent to distribute the controlled dangerous substance, in violation of Section 5-602(2) of the Criminal Law Article.... \u201d How, then, could the admission of the report and the testimony adduced relative to it be anything other than harmful? The State, clearly, recognized the importance of the chemist\u2019s report in its closing when the State\u2019s Attorney argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b89-6\">This is my favorite because it\u2019s the <em>easiest. We know it\u2019s crack; we know it\u2019s cocaine. </em>There are a couple of different ways, but the <em>primary </em>one being the lab report....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b90-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>[H]ere\u2019s the report, you can look at it, it\u2019s been admitted\u2014 [the chemist] determined that, yes, they were in fact 8.93 grams of cocaine. So, that has been proven and that\u2019s by [the chemist] and the lab report.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">The chemist report and its attendant testimony were adduced to satisfy proof of the elements of the crime, and thus, their admission was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
