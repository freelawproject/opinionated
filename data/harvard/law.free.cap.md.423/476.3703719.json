We hold that such testimony is permissible where fact evidence establishes that the crime charged was gang-related and the probative value of the testimony is not sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>stantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">Defendant Mario Rodriguez Gutierrez was charged with first-degree murder, first-degree assault, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence following the shooting death of Francisco Quintanilla. At trial, witnesses testified that the incident was linked to Gutierrez\u2019s affiliation with the MS-13 street gang. The court also permitted testimony, over Gutierrez\u2019s objections, of a \u201cgang expert\u201d who generally described the violent customs of MS-13, including its initiation practices and culture of retaliation for perceived insults. A Prince George\u2019s County jury convicted Gutierrez of the murder, and he appealed the conviction to the Court of Special Appeals. On our own initiative, we granted certiorari before argument in the Court of Special Appeals and affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Around midnight on July 14, 2007, Francisco Quintanilla was standing with a group of friends outside a house in Riverdale, in Prince George\u2019s County. A black Honda Civic containing four males approached the house and the front passenger addressed the group, shouting \u201cMara Salvatrucha[.]\u201d The witnesses interpreted this statement to mean that the passenger was a member of the MS-13 street gang. The passenger then demanded to know the gang affiliation of the assembled group, including Quintanilla. One of Quintanilla\u2019s companions answered, saying that he did not belong to any gang, while another member insulted MS-13. The passenger responded by firing multiple shots into the group, fatally wounding Quintanilla.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The black Honda then immediately fled the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>Ellen Villatoro was a part of the group in front of the house and claimed to have had a clear and sustained view of the shooter. On July 24, 2007, she met with detectives in an attempt to identify the shooter, whom she described as a \u201c[hjispanic male, young looking, Asian look, acne, curly hairstyle.\u201d The detectives showed Villatoro approximately 400 photos, but without success. Gutierrez\u2019s photo was not among those shown to Villatoro at that time. On September 5, 2007, after further investigation, detectives met with Villatoro once again to present her with a photographic array. This time, Gutierrez\u2019s picture was among the six in the array, and Villatoro confidently identified him as the shooter. A week or two later, the police took Gutierrez into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">At trial, Luis Alvarado-Pineda, Gutierrez\u2019s co-defendant driver who turned State\u2019s witness, testified that, on the night of the shooting, he received a call from Gutierrez saying that they \u201cshould head over to Riverdale.\u201d Alvarado-Pineda confirmed that Gutierrez was riding in the front passenger seat, and that two other males were sitting in rear passenger seats. Once in Riverdale, the group spotted the party and drove by two or three times, until Gutierrez told Alvarado-Pineda to stop in front of the house. Then, according to AlvaradoPineda, a member of the party insulted Gutierrez for representing that he belonged to MS-13 and Gutierrez responded by pulling out a gun and firing four shots into the crowd.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The prosecution also introduced pictures from Gutierrez\u2019s MySpace webpage. One of Gutierrez\u2019s fellow passengers, Hector Tirado, testified for the State and identified Gutierrez\u2019s gestures as those used by members of MS-13. He identified Gutierrez as the shooter that night. A transcript of Tirado\u2019s grand jury testimony, in which he claimed that Gutierrez shot Quintanilla to gain entry into MS-13, was also admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>The prosecution then called Sergeant George Norris, Supervisor of the Prince George\u2019s County Gang Unit, as an expert witness \u201cin the area of MS-13 and gangs in general.\u201d Norris provided jurors with an overview of the MS-13 culture. He began by explaining that \u201cMS-13\u201d stands for \u201cMara Salvatrucha,\u201d with \u201cmara\u201d meaning gang or group, \u201csalva\u201d referring to El Salvador, and \u201ctrucha\u201d translating as \u201cwatch out\u201d or \u201clook out.\u201d The 13 in the gang\u2019s name, he testified, is \u201cindicative of their alliance with the Mexican Mafia[.]\u201d Norris also described how prospective members are inducted, or \u201cjumped,\u201d into MS-13, which involves a 13 second beating by four or five gang members. He identified Langley Park, the location of the apartment where Gutierrez, Alvarado-Pineda, and Tirado were congregated before driving to Riverdale, as an MS-13 stronghold. Riverdale (the scene of the crime), on the other hand, was a predominantly Mexican neighborhood and \u201c[t]he gangs within that community are more of the Mexican-based gangs as opposed to MS-13, which is predominantly Central American based.\u201d Thus, Riverdale is \u201can area where rival gang members are expected to be.\u201d Norris explained that MS-13 members respond to criticism of their gang or untruthful displays of MS-13 membership (an act known as \u201cfalse flagging\u201d) with violence \u201cup to death.\u201d In fact, MS-13 is \u201cthe gang that [law enforcement] had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region....\u201d Finally, Norris, who often conducted internet investigations by visiting gang members\u2019 MySpace webpages, articulated a belief that Gutierrez was affiliated with MS-13 based on pictures of the defendant taken from MySpace.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">During the lower court proceedings, defense counsel attempted to prevent the admission of evidence of MS-13 affiliation four separate times. Prior to trial, defense counsel moved in limine to bar \u201cany testimony as to [MS-13] and [Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement in a gang.\u201d The Circuit Court, relying on <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952 (2007), denied the motion on grounds that the State was using the gang evidence to prove motive. Again, before voir dire, the defense renewed its \u201cmotion to exclude testimony by any expert on gangs\u201d because news reports of a supposed gang-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>related fatality in Riverdale the week before trial rendered such evidence unduly prejudicial to Gutierrez. The court once again denied the motion, but asked that neither side mention the MS-13 connection during jury selection so as not to dissuade jurors from serving. As the State was about to make its opening remarks, defense counsel asked the court for a standing objection to \u201cany reference to gang membership, gang procedures, or MS-13 except as that may have been uttered by any person at the time [of the shooting].\u201d The court granted a \u201cstanding objection to any reference that the State makes to MS-13.\u201d The final objection occurred immediately before Norris was admitted as an expert, when defense counsel asked for a continuing objection to any testimony presented by Norris that did not pertain to the events of July 14, 2007. The court also granted this continuing objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Following a three-day trial, a jury convicted Gutierrez of first-degree murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony. The Circuit Court imposed a life sentence on Gutierrez for murder and a consecutive 20 year sentence for his handgun conviction. Gutierrez appealed his conviction to the Court of Special Appeals, and, on our own initiative, we granted certiorari to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">Did the trial court err by admitting \u201cexpert\u201d testimony regarding the violent street gang MS-13 such that said testimony potentially misle[d] the jury to believe that defendant\u2019s possible membership in said gang cause him to form the intent for premeditated murder rather than inferring said intent from the facts of the crime?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Gutierrez requests that this Court vacate his convictions and remand the case to the Circuit Court with the direction that no expert testimony \u201cregarding propensity be admitted as to ... Gutierrez\u2019[s] alleged involvement or non-involvement in MS-13.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AC5\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Maryland Rules 5-702 through 5-706 govern expert testimony. Specifically, Rule 5-702 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Expert testimony may be admitted, in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if the court determines that the testimony will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue. In making that determination, the court shall determine (1) whether the witness is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, (2) the appropriateness of the expert testimony on the particular subject, and (3) whether a sufficient factual basis exists to support the expert testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">In <em>Raithel v. State, </em>280 Md. 291, 372 A.2d 1069 (1977), this Court articulated the standard of review for the admissibility of expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-6\">[T]he admissibility of expert testimony is a matter largely within the discretion of the trial court, and its action in admitting or excluding such testimony will seldom constitute a ground for reversal. It is well settled, however, that the trial court\u2019s determination is reviewable on appeal, and may be reversed if founded on an error of law or some serious mistake, or if the trial court has clearly abused its discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 301, 372 A.2d at 1074-75 (quotation marks and citations omitted). A reviewing court may find an abuse of discretion where the prejudice of the admitted testimony outweighs its probative value. <em>See State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 641, 552 A.2d 896, 901 (1989). Prejudice that would \u201coutweigh probative value involves more than mere damage to the opponent\u2019s cause.\u201d <em>State v. Allewalt, </em>308 Md. 89, 102, 517 A.2d 741, 747 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">On appeal, Gutierrez asserts that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Norris\u2019s irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial testimony on gang activity. Specifically, he points to five of Norris\u2019s statements as sources of the error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-10\">(1) MS-13 is \u201cthe gang that we had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>(2) The \u201c18\u201d in \u201cMS-18\u201d is \u201cindicative of their alliance with the Mexican Mafia.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">(3) When a non-gang member uses hand-signs that identify him as a member of MS-13, also known as \u201cfalse flagging,\u201d he would \u201cbe subject to punishment up to death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">(4) When responding to criticism of their gang, MS-13 members react with \u201c[violence ... [u]p to death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">(5) In order to join MS-13, a prospective member must be \u201cjumped in,\u201d meaning that he is \u201cbeaten by usually four or five gang members. It\u2019s called a 13. Because, technically, it\u2019s suppose to be for <em>13 </em>seconds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Gutierrez contends that evidence of his affiliation with MS-13 coupled with Norris\u2019s testimony about the violent culture of the gang constituted inadmissible prior bad acts evidence. The State, on the other hand, maintains that Gutierrez\u2019s claims are not preserved for appeal and, alternatively, that the evidence was admissible because it was \u201chighly probative of premeditation, motive and intent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">A <em>Preservation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The State, ever vigilant in its search for waiver of error, contends that Gutierrez never challenged the particular aspects of Norris\u2019s testimony that he now complains of on appeal, and thus his claims are not preserved for review by this Court. According to the State, defense counsel simply objected to any general expert testimony regarding MS-13. With only this general continuing objection, the State avers that Gutierrez cannot now single out certain portions of the testimony as more inadmissible than others.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">In support of its rationale, the State cites <em>B. Sifrit v. State, </em>383 Md. 116, 136, 857 A.2d 88, 99-100 (2004), in which this Court refused to review a trial court\u2019s denial of evidence because the defendant\u2019s theory of relevance on appeal was different from the theory he presented to the trial court. In that case, both the defendant and his wife had been convicted of murder in separate trials. <em>See id. </em>at 121-22, 857 A.2d at 91. At his trial, the defendant sought to admit his mother\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>testimony regarding another incident where his wife had threatened his mother with a gun, offering the testimony to show \u201csimply that there\u2019s another incident of [the wife] pulling a gun on another human being.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 136, 857 A.2d at 99. The trial court ruled that the testimony was not relevant. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, the defendant claimed that the testimony was relevant \u201cto show that [the wife] Vas capable of pulling a weapon on another individual outside of [the defendant\u2019s] presence\u2019 and had the tendency to show that she was capable of committing the present crimes alone.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We denied that argument on preservation grounds, relying on the established rule that \u2018Vhen an objector sets forth the specific grounds for his objection ... the objector will be bound by those grounds and will ordinarily be deemed to have waived other grounds not specified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Brecker v. State, </em>304 Md. 36, 39-40, 497 A.2d 479, 480 (1985)). We refused to interpret the theory advanced on appeal as a more detailed version of the theory articulated at trial because doing so would \u201crequire trial courts to imagine all reasonable offshoots of the argument actually presented to them before making a ruling on admissibility.\u201d <em>B. Sifrit, </em>383 Md. at 136, 857 A.2d at 99-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">This case is different because Gutierrez\u2019s objections were \u201cgeneral\u201d and not limited to any stated grounds. Rule 4-323(a) provides that \u201c[t]he grounds for the objection need not be stated unless the court, at the request of a party or on its own initiative, so directs.\u201d This rule \u201creflects] the long established Maryland practice that a contemporaneous general objection to the admission of evidence ordinarily preserves for appellate review all grounds which may exist for the inadmissibility of the evidence.\u201d <em>Boyd v. State, </em>399 Md. 457, 475-76, 924 A.2d 1112, 1123 (2007). Gutierrez\u2019s counsel objected to \u201cany testimony as to [MS-13] and [Gutierrez\u2019s] involvement in a gang\u201d no less than four times. Furthermore, the trial court granted a \u201cstanding objection to any reference that the State makes to MS-13\u201d as well as Gutierrez\u2019s continuing objection to any testimony presented by Norris that did not \u201cpertain[ ] to the events of the evening of July 14th, '07.\u201d The court did not ask, nor did Gutierrez disclose, the ground(s) for his continu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>ing objection. Thus, this case is distinguishable from <em>B. Sifrit </em>where defense counsel articulated the reason that the proposed testimony was relevant and should be admissible, thereby waiving all grounds not specified. Gutierrez objected to <em>all </em>statements made by Norris that did not concern the night of the shooting (effectively all of Norris\u2019s testimony) and now appeals the trial court\u2019s admission of those statements. In short, defense counsel\u2019s objections properly preserved this issue for appeal. We now address the merits of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">\n<em>B. Evidence of \u201cPrior Bad Acts\u201d And The Admissibility of Norris\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">As provided in Maryland Rule 5-404(b), a court may not admit evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts that is offered \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Such evidence is known as evidence of \u201cprior bad acts.\u201d <em>See Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 547-49 &amp; n. 3, 735 A.2d 1061, 1071-72 &amp; n. 3 (1999) (surveying multiple jurisdictions in an attempt to define \u201cbad acts\u201d evidence and recognizing in dicta that some out-of-state cases have included gang membership as bad acts evidence). We have defined prior bad acts evidence as \u201can activity or conduct, not necessarily criminal, that tends to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 549, 735 A.2d at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Notwithstanding this exclusionary rule, a trial judge may admit prior bad acts evidence if it satisfies three requirements. <em>See Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634-35, 552 A.2d at 897-98; <em>see also </em>Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 510 (4th ed. 2010). First, the evidence must be \u201csubstantially relevant to some contested issue in the case....\u201d <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d at 897. Such evidence may be relevant to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b). Second, the evidence must be \u201cclear and convincing in establishing the accused\u2019s involvement\u201d in the prior bad acts. <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 634, 552 A.2d at 898; <em>see also </em>Murphy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Jr., <em>supra, </em>at \u00a7 510. Finally, the evidence \u201cmay be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. . . .\u201d Md. Rule 5-408; <em>see also Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 635, 552 A.2d at 898.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">The admissibility of evidence regarding gang affiliation and gang culture, and its tension with the rule against prior bad acts, is an issue with which courts across the country have struggled. <em>See generally </em>John E. Theuman, Annotation, <em>Admissibility of Evidence of Accused\u2019s Membership in Gang, </em>39 A.L.R.4th 775 (2010). Numerous jurisdictions have permitted the inclusion of such evidence as relevant and not unduly prejudicial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Mansoori, </em>304 F.3d 635, 652-55 (7th Cir.2002) (no error in permitting a gang specialist to testify as to the history, leadership, and operations of the Traveling Vice Lords because the average juror is not familiar with the operations of street gangs); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>978 F.2d 1554, 1561-65 (10th Cir.1992) (expert testimony of gang affiliation and gang\u2019s involvement in cocaine trafficking was permissible); <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>38 Cal.4th 932, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d 649, 656-59 (2006) (allowing expert testimony about whether members of a street gang would intimidate persons who testify against a member of that or a rival gang); <em>People v. McDaniels, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 898, 166 Cal.Rptr. 12, 14-16 (1980) (testimony about gang fights in neutral territory admissible to show that when the defendant drove his friends into a rival gang\u2019s territory he knew or should have known they were planning a retaliatory slaying and not just a fist fight); <em>Cyrus v. State, </em>231 Ga.App. 71, 498 S.E.2d 554, 555 (1998) (testimony explaining gang culture was relevant and not unduly prejudicial in case involving the shooting of a 10-year-old child); <em>State v. Tran, </em>252 Kan. 494, 847 P.2d 680, 687-88 (1993) (evidence of gang membership was relevant to show the motive to retaliate or get even with a rival gang, resulting in a fight that lead to the victim\u2019s death); <em>State v. Nieto, </em>129 N.M. 688, 12 P.3d 442, 450 (2000) (\u201c[The expert\u2019s] testimony, both as to Defendant\u2019s affiliation with the 18th Street Gang and the specific rituals and procedures of that gang, was admissible to show Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>dant\u2019s alleged motive (to rise up in the ranks of the gang by performing a hit on its behalf) and intent to murder the victims.\u201d); <em>Utz v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 411, 505 S.E.2d 380, 387 (1998) (expert\u2019s testimony about the culture of two different area gangs was admissible where the defendant and murder victim each belonged to rival gangs). As one commentator observed, the rationale behind this trend is that the \u201crelevance and significance of evidence of gang membership may be lost on a jury without the use of expert witness testimony about the sociological and psychological aspects of gang conduct.\u201d James Blake Sibley, <em>Gang Violence: Response of the Criminal Justice System to the Growing Threat, </em>11 Crim. Just. J. 403, 412-13 (1989) (discussing California courts\u2019 growing acceptance of expert testimony regarding gang methods).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">Analysis of this trend reveals a common, albeit frequently unacknowledged, thread among those cases where gang expert testimony was deemed admissible. Generally, a gang expert\u2019s testimony is relevant and not unduly prejudicial when other evidence demonstrates that the crime was gang-related. In <em>Mansoori, </em>a gang expert\u2019s testimony was relevant to the charge of conspiracy with intent to distribute cocaine where court-authorized wiretaps recorded the defendants\u2019s involvement in a drug deal and three of the five defendants were members of a gang that controlled narcotics distribution in the area. <em>See </em>304 F.3d at 642-43. In another possession with intent to distribute case, gang affiliation evidence was relevant where the defendants were discovered with drugs, scales, razors, and gang-related items and the expert testified that the primary purpose of the gang was to traffic in crack cocaine. <em>See Robinson, </em>978 F.2d at 1557. In California, testimony on a gang\u2019s general practice of witness intimidation was necessary to explain why witnesses who had identified the gang-tattooed defendant as the gunman later recanted at trial. <em>See Gonzalez, </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 656-57. Expert testimony was also admissible to explain why an alleged gang gunman was expecting \u201cmore than just a fist fight\u201d when, according to witnesses, he had traveled to a rival gang\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>territory. <em>See McDaniels, </em>166 Cal.Rptr. at 14-15. In yet another shooting death, a gang bandana wrapped around the gun used in the crime, along with witness testimony that the defendant was a member of that gang, opened the door to expert testimony on gang culture. <em>See Cyrus, </em>498 S.E.2d at 555. In New Mexico, an expert\u2019s testimony on the specific rituals of the 18th Street Gang was admissible to rebut defendant\u2019s assertion that, when he accompanied fellow gang members to the victim\u2019s cabin, he did not know that they intended to carry out a gang-ordered hit on the victim. <em>See Nieto, </em>12 P.3d at 449-50. Finally, in Virginia, expert testimony was relevant to rebut defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense, where the defendant and the victim were members of rival gangs. <em>See Utz, </em>505 S.E.2d at 387.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">Some states have been more vocal about the need for evidence showing that the crime was gang-related, expressing a concern that \u201cevidence of gang affiliation could be used improperly as a backdoor means of introducing character evidence by associating the defendant with the gang and describing the gang\u2019s bad acts.\u201d <em>State v. Torrez, </em>146 N.M. 331, 210 P.3d 228, 235 (2009) <em>(quoting Nieto, </em>12 P.3d at 450). In <em>Torrez, </em>the New Mexico Supreme Court held that the trial judge erred in admitting gang expert testimony, despite determining that the detective was properly qualified as an expert in gang culture and that his testimony was not impermissible propensity evidence because it was offered to establish the defendant\u2019s motive. <em>See </em>210 P.3d at 236-38. The court concluded that the testimony was unfairly prejudicial \u201cbecause there was no evidence presented at trial that [the defendant] was a gang member at the time of the shooting, the party was a \u2018gang party,\u2019 or the shooting was in any way gang-related.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236. Without corroborative evidence that the incident was influenced by a gang\u2019s code of conduct or other criminal aspects of gang culture, the risk that defendant was convicted because he was, or at one time had been, a member of a gang was too great to allow the evidence to be put before the jury. <em>See id. </em>at 237.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Illinois also adopts this cautious approach. In <em>People v. Bryant, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 1007, 182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d 910 (1993), the Illinois appellate court permitted expert testimony on the customs of the Folks Gang, where lay witness testimony supplied a link between that gang and the murder for which defendant Bryant was on trial. There, fact witnesses testified that Bryant exchanged words with the deceased, Houston, and the deceased\u2019s friend, Frazier, over the return of a friend\u2019s pager. <em>See id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 913-14. When Frazier demanded the pager, Bryant turned to an alleged fellow gang member and said, \u201c[Folks], give him that pager.\u201d <em>Id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 913. The alleged gang member complied, tried to shake Frazier\u2019s hand and then \u201c[threw] up a pitchfork.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Frazier returned the handshake, but did not \u201cthrow up a pitchfork[,]\u201d to which Bryant responded, \u201c[You\u2019re] not right, you\u2019re not right. I thought you were folks . . . what the hell you doing coming around here if you\u2019re not folks ... you\u2019ll get whooped like your boy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A physical fight ensued, and Houston joined in to aid his friend. <em>See id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 913-14. Soon thereafter, as Frazier was fleeing the scene, he heard gunshots and looked back to see Bryant standing near Houston and holding a gun. <em>See id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In addition to this eyewitness testimony, the State introduced, and the trial court permitted, the testimony of a Chicago detective who had dealt extensively with that city\u2019s street gangs and was familiar with the gang that refers to themselves as \u201cfolks.\u201d <em>See Bryant, </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 914. The detective explained that the pitchfork is a sign unique to the \u201cfolks\u201d street gang, and that, in his opinion, \u201cwhen an individual uses the hand signal of a pitchfork in an up position, that individual is affiliated with the \u2018folks\u2019 gang.\u201d <em>Id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 914, 920. The State\u2019s theory of the case was that the shooting was motivated by Bryant\u2019s anger that Houston and Frazier were not \u201cfolks.\u201d <em>See id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 918. Bryant, on the other hand, argued \u201cthat the State\u2019s sole purpose in seeking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>admit [the detective\u2019s testimony] was to inflame the prejudices of the jury in an effort to convict [Bryant].\u201d <em>Id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 920. The appellate court sided with the State, holding that \u201c[e]vidence indicating a defendant was ... involved in gang-related activity is admissible ... to offer a motive for an otherwise inexplicable act, <em>provided there is sufficient proof that such ... activity is related to the crime charged.\u201d Id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 920 (emphasis added). It determined that \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to support the State\u2019s theory that the seemingly inexplicable attack on the deceased was gang related\u201d and that the trial court \u201callowed in only as much gang testimony as was necessary to establish this motive.\u201d <em>Id., </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 920-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">In Maryland, the Court of Special Appeals has permitted gang expert testimony where fact evidence showed that the crime was motivated by gang affiliation. <em>See Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 664-66, 923 A.2d at 962-63. In <em>Ayala, </em>this fact evidence came in the form of two pretrial statements, the contents of which were admitted at trial, in which Ayala said that he was a member of MS-13, that the victim had claimed to be a member of the 18th Street Gang, and that Ayala had previously been beaten by a member of the 18th Street Gang and still had a cut on his forehead from the fight. <em>See id. </em>at 653-54, 923 A.2d at 955-56. The State\u2019s theory was that Ayala killed the victim because he believed, albeit mistakenly, that the victim was a member of a rival gang. <em>See id. </em>at 651-52, 923 A.2d at 954. The trial court permitted a Fairfax County detective to testify as to the meaning of the name MS-13, including its link to the Mexican Mafia, the \u201cjumping in\u201d process, and the expectation that gang members must \u201cget[ ] at [the gang\u2019s enemies].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 654-55, 923 A.2d at 956. The detective also identified the 18th Street Gang as the chief rival of MS-13. <em>See id. </em>at 655, 923 A.2d at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In affirming the trial court\u2019s admission of the State\u2019s expert witness, the Court of Special Appeals stated that the testimony served to \u201cexplain the otherwise inexplicable, by providing a motive for a brutal and seemingly senseless killing.\u201d <em>Ayala, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>174 Md.App. at 664, 923 A.2d at 961 (quotation marks omitted). The Court conceded that \u201cevidence that a defendant is a member of an organization known for violent acts may be evidence of bad character or prior bad acts.\u201d <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 658, 923 A.2d at 958. Yet it reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFk\">[g]ang evidence is relevant when ... it provides motive for an otherwise inexplicable act.... In particular, any evidence that tends to show the defendant had a motive for killing the victim is relevant because it enhances the probability that the defendant did kill the victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-4\">There may be strong prejudice against street gangs ... but that alone does not render gang evidence inadmissible. Gang evidence is admissible despite the prejudice that attaches if it is relevant and particularly if it is crucial in establishing motive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 663, 923 A.2d at 961 <em>(quoting People v. Davis, </em>335 Ill.App.3d 1, 268 Ill.Dec. 829, 779 N.E.2d 443, 456 (2002)). According to the Court of Special Appeals, the expert\u2019s testimony corroborated Ayala\u2019s pretrial statements about gang membership and \u201cwas highly probative in that it explained the gang\u2019s code of conduct and revealed the gang\u2019s long and bitter rivalry with the 18th Street [G]ang.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 923 A.2d at 961. Thus, it was \u201chighly probative in establishing motive and was not unduly prejudicial under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664, 923 A.2d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Turning to the case at hand, we must determine whether the trial court erred in admitting testimony of a gang expert at all, and if not, whether Norris\u2019s testimony was unfairly prejudicial. In doing so, we remain ever-cognizant of the highly incendiary nature of gang evidence and the possibility that a jury may determine guilt by association rather than by its belief that the defendant committed the criminal acts. We agree with the Supreme Court of New Mexico that courts must be vigilant in guarding against the improper use of gang affiliation evidence \u201cas a backdoor means of introducing character evidence by associating the defendant with the gang and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>describing the gang\u2019s bad acts.\u201d <em>Torrez, </em>210 P.3d at 235 (quoting <em>Nieto, </em>12 P.3d at 450). Thus, we hold that the threshold requirement for the admissibility of gang expert testimony is <em>fact </em>evidence showing that the crime was gang-related. <em>Accord Torrez, </em>210 P.3d at 235-36. Proof of such a link transforms a defendant\u2019s gang membership, current or prospective, from an impermissible prior bad act to a concrete component of the crime for which the defendant is on trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To be clear, this requirement may be satisfied by fact evidence that, at first glance, may not indicate gang motivations, but when coupled with expert testimony, provides the gang-crime connection. For example, an expert\u2019s testimony that the crime was committed in rival gang territory may be necessary to show why the defendant\u2019s presence in that area, a fact established by other evidence, was motivated by his gang affiliation. <em>See McDaniels, </em>166 Cal.Rptr. at 14-15. As another example, expert testimony that a gang, of which the defendant is a member, specializes in drug trafficking may be used to show why drug paraphernalia found in the defendant\u2019s apartment demonstrates that he was a part of a larger drug conspiracy with other gang members. <em>See Robinson, </em>978 F.2d at 1563-64. In adopting this threshold requirement, we are simply saying that a defendant\u2019s membership in a gang, in and of itself, is not enough.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>Here, evidence supplied by no less than three fact witnesses suggested that Quintanilla\u2019s murder was motivated by Gutierrez\u2019s ties to MS-13. In Tirado\u2019s grand jury testimony, supplied to the jury in this case as a State exhibit, he claimed that Gutierrez shot Quintanilla as part of a gang initiation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">Q. What about [one of the other passengers] and MS-13,1 mean was he trying to get in or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-6\">A. No. Mario was trying to get in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">Q. Do you know \u2014 why did he shoot this person then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-8\">A. Because it\u2019s a mission. You have to kill someone to get into MS.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">Furthermore, during trial, Tirado, Alvarado-Pineda, and Villatoro all testified that, upon reaching the home, Gutierrez shouted \u201cMara Salvatrucha\u201d and then asked the group outside the house to identify their own gang affiliations. Like the gang name \u201cFolks\u201d in <em>Bryant, </em>these statements immediately preceded the shooting, and suggest Gutierrez\u2019s motive for pulling the trigger. Clearly, in this case, our threshold requirement is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Finally, although the fact evidence in this case was enough to open the door for expert testimony, we must still determine whether the trial court abused its discretion in permitting Norris to testify.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Even if Norris\u2019s evidence was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>otherwise admissible, it could still be excluded if its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice____\u201d Md. Rule 5-403; <em>see also Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 641, 552 A.2d at 901. The trial court adopted the State\u2019s reasons for admitting the testimony, specifically that the shooting\u2019s strong MS-13 undercurrent heightened the probative value of Norris\u2019s testimony such that it was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice. With regard to four of the five statements challenged by Gutierrez on appeal, we find no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>error in this decision. First, Norris\u2019s discussion of the Spanish name of \u201cMS-13,\u201d including his comment that the \u201c13\u201d denoted a tie to the Mexican Mafia, explained why Gutierrez\u2019s \u201cMara Salvatrucha\u201d declaration indicated MS-13 loyalties. Second, Norris\u2019s description of the process of \u201cjumping in\u201d as a 13-second beating corroborates Tirado\u2019s grand jury testimony that this seemingly senseless shooting was really Gutierrez\u2019s attempt to join MS-13. Third, his testimony that MS-13 members respond to insults with punishment \u201cup to death\u201d was relevant following testimony that Gutierrez fired four shots after being insulted. The average person would not react to a simple affront in such a brutal manner, and Norris\u2019s opinion shed light on this otherwise \u201cinexplicable act.\u201d <em>See Bryant, </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 920. We reach the same conclusion with respect to Norris\u2019s fourth statement, that gang members also respond to \u201cfalse flagging\u201d with violence up to death, because \u201cfalse flagging\u201d is an insult to the exclusivity and hierarchy of the gang. Ultimately, we do not see how Gutierrez was unfairly prejudiced by this evidence, and thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when permitting the jury to hear and consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">We are in agreement with Gutierrez, however, that the trial court erred in allowing Norris to comment that MS-13 is the gang that law enforcement \u201chad seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region.\u201d The fact that one gang is generally more violent than others does little to add to the jury\u2019s understanding of why the defendant was the person who committed the particular crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Yet, we view this as harmless error rather than grounds for reversal of Gutierrez\u2019s convictions. A defendant in a criminal case is entitled to a fair trial, but not necessarily a perfect one. <em>Cf. Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 36, 553 A.2d 233, 239 (1989)(\u201cThe right of an accused to a fair trial, although not a perfect trial, is paramount.\u201d). We are mindful of the rule that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>when an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApE\"><em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 659, 350 A.2d 665, 678 (1976) (footnote omitted). Looking to the other evidence on the record, we are confident that the statement would not have persuaded the jury to render a guilty verdict when it would not have otherwise done so. Other properly admissible evidence established that Gutierrez was affiliated with MS-13 and had traveled into rival gang territory looking for someone to kill as part of his initiation. Upon spotting a crowd, he shouted \u201cMara Salvatrucha,\u201d was insulted, and then opened fire on the group. Three different eye witnesses named him as the shooter, one of whom viewed approximately 400 photos over two separate days before positively and immediately identifying the defendant when she was shown an array with his picture. Moreover, the statement that MS-13 had displayed the most violence over recent years is not so shocking in light of the mountain of other testimony detailing the violent practices of the gang. Had this been the only comment regarding violence, it could not so easily \u201cblend in,\u201d and we might reach a different result. As it stands in this case, however, the statement constituted harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In sum, the Circuit Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Norris to testify because ample fact evidence established a connection between Quintanilla\u2019s shooting death and the gang MS-13. Although the unfair prejudice of one of Norris\u2019s statements outweighed its probative value, the error was harmless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>BELL, C.J., dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">GREENE, J., concurs and dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-8\">. Quintanilla suffered four gunshot wounds, including a fatal wound to his head. The force of the fated shot blew off a portion of Quintanilla\u2019s skull, causing it to smack into the knee of Ellen Villatoro, who was standing nearby. The doctor who had performed the autopsy testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>that the impact of the gunpowder around the victim's wounds indicated that the shots were fired within a few feet of the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b544-5\">. Although, in <em>Ayala, </em>there was independent evidence (i.e., Ayala\u2019s pretrial statements) that the crime was motivated by Ayala's belief that he and the victim were members of rival gangs, the Court of Special Appeals seemed to advance the view that no such evidence was required to open the door to expert testimony on gangs: \"We do not agree with Ayala that the State should be prevented from presenting crucial evidence regarding motive merely because it has not had the good fortune to find a witness who is willing to step forward and suggest a connection between the gang and the crime.\u201d <em>Ayala, </em>174 Md.App. at 659-60, 923 A.2d at 959. We disagree and hold that some evidence connecting the crime and the gang is required.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b544-6\">. We are not suggesting that gang membership will never establish the necessary link between the crime and the gang. As in <em>Ayala </em>and <em>Utz, </em>fact evidence showing that the defendant <em>and the victim </em>belonged to rival gangs, or that the defendant mistakenly believed that the victim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>was a member of a rival gang, may be enough to open the door to gang expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. To support his claim that Norris\u2019s statements went outside the bounds of proper expert testimony, Gutierrez cites <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>545 F.3d 179 (2d Cir.2008), where the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that expert testimony should not be admitted, even where fact evidence provides the necessary link to the gang, if it only duplicates material that can be established by trial exhibits or lay witnesses. There, expert testimony was introduced after one defendant testified that he and his co-defendants were members of MS-13 and that, after spotting a member of another gang, they executed a drive-by shooting because of MS-13's general policy of killing rivals. <em>Id. </em>at 185. The defendants were subsequently convicted, but the appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>vacated the convictions because much of the expert testimony presented at trial concerned material within the ken of the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-8\">A few examples are particularly striking: [the expert's] testimony that the FBI gang task force had seized \"[p]robably between 15 and 25\u201d firearms, as well as ammunition, from MS-13 members; his statement that MS-13 members on Long Island had been arrested for dealing narcotics; and his statement that MS-13 had committed \"between 18 and 22, 23\u201d murders on Long Island between June 2000 and the trial. No expertise is required to understand any of these facts. Had the Government introduced lay witness testimony, arrest records, death certificates, and other competent evidence of these highly specific facts, the jury could have \u201cintelligently\u201d interpreted and understood it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 194-95. The court stated that, despite the need and utility of expert testimony on gangs, such evidence must be limited to issues where \"sociological knowledge is appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190. It reasoned that a distinction should be made between the legitimate role of an expert in translating slang or explaining the hierarchical structure within a particular gang and the impermissible substitution of an expert for factual evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 190-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-10\">Here, Gutierrez attempts to draw similarities between Norris's testimony and evidence supplied by the expert in <em>Mejia: </em>\"When [Norris] described the gang\u2019s violent tendencies, acts of retribution, and the like, the jury was potentially influenced that the Defendant formed his intent for premeditated murder simply by being a member and not from the facts and circumstances of the crime.\" We disagree with Gutierrez's characterization of Norris\u2019s statements, and believe that <em>Mejia </em>is distinguishable from the case at hand. Here, Norris described the gang-specific rituals of MS-13, such as \"jumping in,\u201d and the expected level of retribution for insults and \u201cfalse flagging.\u201d This is exactly the type of sociological knowledge that, if relevant to an issue in the case, <em>Mejia </em>considered appropriate. Norris did not detail specific criminal acts that could have been better established through fact evidence, including arrest records or death certificates. He limited his opinion to the particular customs and generalized background of MS-13, such as its rivalries with other gangs and the significance of the letters and number composing the gang\u2019s name. This is well within the province of proper expert testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b549-5\">BELL, C.J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AIq\">dissenting, in which GREENE, J., joins in Part B.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">This case considers the propriety, and effect, of the introduction, at the trial of Mario Rodriguez Gutierrez, the appellant, of evidence, expert testimony, regarding the history, practices and violent tendencies of a gang of which the appellant was alleged to be a member.

Norris testified to the history, practices and violent tendencies of the MS-13 gang. Specifically, he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-6\">\u201c(1) MS-13 is \u2018the gang that we had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region____\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-7\">\u201c(2) The \u201813\u2019 in \u2018MS-13\u2019 is \u2018indicative of their alliance with the Mexican Mafia .... \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201c(3) When a non-gang member uses hand-signs that identify him as a member of MS-13, also known as \u2018false flagging,\u2019 he would \u2018be subject to punishment up to death.\u2019 \u201c(4) When responding to criticism of their gang, MS-13 members react with \u2018[violence ... [u]p to death.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201c(5) In order to join MS-13, a prospective member must be \u2018jumped in,\u2019 meaning that he is \u2018beaten by usually four or five gang members. It\u2019s called a 13. Because, technically, it\u2019s suppose to be for 13 seconds.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-10\">On appeal, the appellant argues that the trial court erred by allowing Sgt. Norris to testify at all as to the gang-related history, activity and culture of MS-13. Asserting that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>testimony was irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial, he submits that it served no purpose other than to prejudice the appellant, by misleading the jury into believing that the appellant\u2019s membership in the gang, MS-13, caused him to form the intent for premeditated murder. He posits specific points that Sgt. Norris emphasized in his testimony, the origins of the name, the initiation practices and the penalty for impersonating a gang member, to prove his point. The appellant maintains that testimony regarding the origins of the MS-13 gang\u2019s name as deriving from a connection with the Mexican Mafia, the initiation practice of \u201cjumping in,\u201d and the punishments related to \u201cfalse flagging\u201d have absolutely no relevance, thus, value, in this case, as they do not relate to, elucidate or explain any issue in this case. There were no facts presented in this case, nor any allegations made, that the appellant acted under the direction, or for the purposes, of the Mexican Mafia, or that the murder was committed as part of an initiation or in response to \u201cfalse flagging\u201d by the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The majority holds that expert testimony regarding gang activities and culture, such as that given by Sgt. Norris, is admissible as long as \u201cfact evidence establishes that the crime charged was gang-related and the probative value of the testimony is not substantially outweighed by any unfair prejudice to the defendant.\u201d Op. at 481-82, 32 A.3d at 5. Thus, as a threshold matter, there must be \u201csome evidence connecting the crime and the gang.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 496 n. 2, 32 A.3d at 14, n. 2. The probative value of the testimony, moreover, must not be outweighed substantially by any unfair prejudice to the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 481-82, 32 A.3d at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">The majority concedes that the evidence of gang affiliation is evidence of \u201cprior bad acts,\u201d which is admitted only upon the satisfaction of a three-part test gleaned from Md. Rules 5-404(b) and 5-403. Op. at 489-90, 32 A.3d at 9-10. Citing <em>State v. Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 634-35, 552 A.2d 896, 897 (1989), the majority states, op. at 489, 32 A.3d at 10, that the evidence must be \u201csubstantially relevant to some contested issue in the case[,]\u201d and tend to prove \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, iden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>tity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b). <em>See also State v. Westpoint, </em>404 Md. 455, 488, 947 A.2d 519, 539 (2008) (citing <em>Wynn v. State, </em>351 Md. 307, 316, 718 A.2d 588, 592 (1998); <em>State v.Taylor, </em>347 Md. 363, 368, 701 A.2d 389, 392 (1997)). Pointing to the testimony of Ellen Villatoro and the appellant\u2019s co-defendants, turned State witnesses, who testified that, upon driving up to where Quintanilla was standing, the appellant shouted, \u201cMara Salvatrucha\u201d and asked the victim to identify his gang affiliation, the majority states that the \u201csome evidence\u201d standard was met and, thus, those facts provided sufficient basis for the admission of \u201cgang\u201d expert testimony. Op. at 497-98, 32 A.3d at 14-15. The majority concedes that it was error to allow the expert to testify that \u201cMS-13 is \u2018the gang that we had seen the most violence -with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region ...,\u2019\u201d but finds that error to be harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 499-500, 32 A.3d at 15-16. The rest of Sgt. Norris\u2019 testimony the majority found to be relevant to explain the various motives that Gutierrez might have had for shooting the victim, and that, with regard to the testimony admitted in error, \u201cstrong MS-13 undercurrent heightened the probative value of Norris\u2019 testimony, such that it was not outweighed by any unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 32 A.3d at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The appellant does not, nor could he reasonably, dispute that one of the propositions about which Sgt. Norris testified, <em>ie. </em>[w]hen responding to criticism of their gang, MS-13 members react with \u201c[vjiolence ... [u]p to death,\u201d may be relevant, tending to prove, <em>see </em>Maryland Rule 5-401,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the appellant\u2019s motive for committing the murder. He acknowledges, as he must, the testimony that, at the time of the murder, the victim had criticized, or was engaged in criticizing MS-13. The appellant denies that that testimony is admissible, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>however. While it may be relevant to prove motive, he argues that motive was not a material issue in the case, \u201cof consequence to the determination of the action,\u201d Rule 5-401,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, indeed, was not even contested. The appellant also rejects, and I believe rightly so, the majority\u2019s conclusion that any of Sgt. Norris\u2019 other propositions has that special relevance that Rule 5-404(b) requires for admission, arguing that they have \u201cno logical tendency\u201d to show motive and only serve to show his propensity toward violent acts by associating the defendant with the violent practices of the MS-13 gang. <em>See United States v. Ring, </em>513 F.2d 1001, 1006 (6th Cir.1975) (citing <em>United States v. Birns, </em>395 F.2d 943 (6th Cir.1968)) (During the defendant\u2019s trial for mailing threatening letters, where previous letters received by the victim did not indicate that the defendant had any relationship with the victim\u2019s wife, as asserted by the government, the court held that the prior threats had \u201cno logical tendency\u201d to show a motive.). I agree with the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Md. Rule 5-404(b), provides that \u201c[e]vidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, common scheme or plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d This Rule\u2019s purpose is to limit the admissibility of evidence offered to prove criminal propensity. Membership in MS-13 and adherence to its practices and culture fit the definition of \u201cother wrongs\u201d or \u201cbad acts,\u201d since \u201cthey are activities] or conduct, not necessarily criminal, that tend[ ] to impugn or reflect adversely upon one\u2019s character, taking into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>consideration the facts of the underlying lawsuit.\u201d <em>Klauenberg v. State, </em>355 Md. 528, 549, 735 A.2d 1061, 1072 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">It has been well established by this Court that \u201cother crimes, wrongs or acts evidence may be admissible when it has \u2018special relevance,\u2019 <em>ie., </em>when the evidence \u2018is substantially relevant to some contested issue and is not offered simply to prove criminal character.\u2019\u201d <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 488, 947 A.2d at 539 (citing <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 316, 718 A.2d at 592; <em>Snyder v. State, </em>361 Md. 580, 603, 762 A.2d 125, 138 (2000); <em>Taylor, </em>347 Md. at 368, 701 A.2d at 392). This is consistent with the rule in other states. <em>People v. Golochowicz, </em>413 Mich. 298, 319 N.W.2d 518, 524 (1982). In that case, the Michigan Supreme Court outlined this well-established concept, holding that in order for \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence to be admitted, the issue it is offered to prove must be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeP\">\u201cgenuinely in issue \u2014 not \u2018in issue\u2019 in the sense that criminal intent, identity, motive, lack of accident or some criminal plan are nearly always in issue to some greater or lesser degree in every case, but in issue or \u2018material\u2019 in the sense that they are genuinely controverted matters. A genuine controversy exists concerning such matters when the defendant, either by counsel\u2019s opening statement, a motion in limine, the nature of cross-examination by the defense, or evidence offered by the defense, has made one or more of them an issue actually disputed in the case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\"><em>Id. </em>The foregoing is \u201csubject, of course, to the balancing requirement of Maryland Rule 5-403.\u201d <em>Snyder, </em>361 Md. at 603, 762 A.2d at 138 (and cases cited therein). Maryland Rule 5-403 makes clear that, \u201c[although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d It seems too obvious to state, but it is worth remembering that, when evidence of other bad acts or crimes is offered without the predicate of a contested issue to be resolved, its only purpose is to show those prior bad acts or crimes, from which the logical inference of propensity natural<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>ly and inexorably will flow. In the absence of a contested issue, therefore, the only purpose of such evidence is \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Md. Rule 5-404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We must first look to whether the evidence offered to prove the appellant\u2019s alleged motive was material. \u201cThe fact that evidence may fit one of the certified exceptions to the \u2018other crimes\u2019 rule does not mean that it is automatically admissible.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>38 Md.App. 432, 437, 381 A.2d 317, 321 (1978). Motive is not an element of the crime of murder. It follows, then, that evidence of motive \u201cserves no legitimate purpose,\u201d and is therefore not material, when motive is not an essential element of any offense charged and when the prosecution is aware that it will not be contested. <em>Martin v. State, </em>40 Md.App. 248, 254-55, 389 A.2d 1374, 1377-78 (1978). <em>See also Ruffin Hotel Corp. of Md. v. Gasper, </em>418 Md. 594, 624, 17 A.3d 676, 693 (2011) (quoting <em>Harris v. State, </em>324 Md. 490, 500, 597 A.2d 956, 961 (1991)); <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 488, 947 A.2d at 539 (citing <em>Wynn, </em>351 Md. at 316, 718 A.2d at 592; <em>Taylor, </em>347 Md. at 368, 701 A.2d at 392); <em>Ayers v. State, </em>335 Md. 602, 631, 645 A.2d 22, 36 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">The cases on which the majority relies, <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. 630, 552 A.2d 896, <em>Ayala v. State, </em>174 Md.App. 647, 923 A.2d 952 (2007), <em>United States v. Mansoori, </em>304 F.3d 635 (7th Cir.2002), <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>978 F.2d 1554 (10th Cir.1992), <em>People v. Gonzalez, </em>38 Cal.4th 932, 44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d 649 (2006), <em>People v. McDaniels, </em>107 Cal.App.3d 898, 166 Cal.Rptr. 12 (1980), <em>People v. Bryant, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 1007, 182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d 910 (1993), <em>Utz v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 411, 505 S.E.2d 380, 383 (1998), and <em>State v. Nieto, </em>129 N.M. 688, 12 P.3d 442 (2000), among others, are consistent with, and indeed, follow, this rule. Thus, those cases do not refute the appellant\u2019s argument that the gang-related evidence is inadmissible nor support its holding that it is. In <em>Ayers, </em>the defendant was charged with, \u201cinter alia, assault, assault with intent to maim, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit a racially motivated crime, and committing a racially motivated crime in violation of \u00a7 470A(b)(3)(i).\u201d 335 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>608, 645 A.2d at 25. Then Maryland Code (1957, 1992 Repl. Vol., 1993 Cum.Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 470A<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> required the prosecution to prove, as a part of its case, that the defendant committed the criminal acts because of the victim\u2019s race.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 633, 645 A.2d at 37. The proof of defendant\u2019s motive thus was essential for the prosecution to obtain a conviction and, for that reason, this Court found the evidence of motive to be material. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">To be sure, the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Ayala v. State, </em>like this case, a first-degree murder case, found evidence of the defendant\u2019s gang-related motive to commit murder to be material. 174 Md.App. at 662, 923 A.2d at 960. The facts of <em>Ayala, </em>however, differ greatly from those in the current case. There, Mario Ayala defended by contending that he committed the murder in self-defense and/or in the defense of others and that he \u201cwas intimidated\u201d by other members of the gang and feared retaliation if he did not assist. <em>Id. </em>at 652, 923 A.2d at 955. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s argument that expert gang related testimony was inadmissible, the intermediate appellate court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>\u201cAs in Davis, the gang testimony presented by the State corroborated the defendant\u2019s \u2014 in this case Ayala\u2019s \u2014 pretrial statement that the perpetrators and the victim were members of rival gangs. Further, the evidence served to explain the \u2018otherwise inexplicable,\u2019 by providing a motive for a brutal and seemingly senseless killing---- Detective Porter\u2019s detailed testimony regarding the history and structure of the MS-13 gang was highly probative in that it explained the gang\u2019s code of conduct and revealed the gang\u2019s long and bitter rivalry with the 18&lt;th&gt; Street gang. The detective\u2019s testimony made clear that the relationship between the two gangs was regularly punctuated by acts of extreme violence, and that such acts might be based on amorphous, perceived slights that occurred between other gang members in the distant past rather than on any concrete, identifiable disputes between the immediate parties to the acts. In addition to showing that Ayala personally might have desired revenge for an earlier beating, the evidence indicated that Ayala, like the defendant in Nieto, may have participated in the murder in order to secure his place in the gang.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 664, 923 A.2d at 962. Although the court does not expressly address this step in its analysis, it is clear that not only is the court\u2019s analysis consistent with the requirements of the applicable evidence rules and the case law implementing them, it follows inexorably from them. By offering self defense or intimidation as the explanation and excuse for his actions, which he did not dispute, the defendant placed motive at issue. The State was entitled to, as it did, rebut these defenses, to challenge the proffered motives by introducing evidence to prove that the defendant possessed some other motive, such as his MS-13 affiliation and gang loyalty. Id. at 653, 923 A.2d at 955.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">The other cases on which the majority relies also are cases in which the State was <em>required </em>to show motive or another contested issue in order to rebut the defense presented and meet its burden of proof and, thus, are clearly distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Faulkner, </em>314 Md. at 632, 552 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>at 897, the defendant, Alvin Faulkner, was convicted of robbery after the State offered testimonial evidence of past robberies he had committed using a similar <em>modus operandi </em>The trial judge admitted the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence because the contested issue at trial was Faulkner\u2019s identity as the perpetrator. <em>Id. </em>at 635, 552 A.2d at 898. The Court noted that, although the characteristics of the robbery at issue were unremarkable when considered separately, <em>ie. </em>the robber wearing a mask and gloves, carrying a handgun, and carrying a bag for the fruits of his crime, the evidence considered as a whole, including the State\u2019s prior bad acts/\u201cother crimes\u201d evidence, established a method so unusual and distinctive that it established a <em>modus operandi. Id. </em>at 638-39, 552 A.2d at 900. Once it was shown that the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence fell neatly within an exception, this Court held that, because most of the State\u2019s evidence regarding the robbery was circumstantial, aside from a witness whose testimony would have to be corroborated because he acted as Faulkner\u2019s accomplice in the robbery, the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence was not merely cumulative in establishing Faulkner\u2019s guilt, but necessary and corroborative. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 552 A.2d at 902. <em>See Robinson, </em>978 F.2d at 1561-62 (10th Cir.1992) (holding that expert testimony of gang affiliation was directly probative of the defendants\u2019 knowledge and intent to distribute narcotics, elements of the offenses charged); <em>Gonzalez, </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 653, 659 (Cal.2006) (allowing expert testimony on gang culture and activities, where the only objections to the testimony were different from those made here, relating to the breadth and effect of certain of the assertions, <em>id., </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 657, whether the testimony invaded the province of the jury, <em>id., </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 658, as well as the sufficiency of the foundation laid for the opinion. <em>Id., </em>44 Cal.Rptr.3d 237, 135 P.3d at 659.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>; <em>McDaniels, </em>166 Cal.Rptr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>at 14-15 (Ct.App.1980) (Expert testimony about gang fights admissible when the witnesses were in disagreement about whether only one gang member intended to fight, or whether wholesale retaliation was contemplated. In addition, the defendant offered testimony that he was no longer a member of the gang, although he was present at the scene with gang members.); <em>Bryant, </em>182 Ill.Dec. 376, 609 N.E.2d at 918 (Ill.App.Ct.1993) (Where the State and the defendant told contrary stories of the motivation for the shooting); <em>Utz, </em>505 S.E.2d at 383 (Va.Ct.App.1998) (Where the defendant asserted self-defense, the Commonwealth could seek to prove the murder was gang-related and, therefore, rebut the defendant\u2019s motive); <em>Nieto, </em>12 P.3d at 446 (N.M.2000) (holding that, where the defense is duress, cooperation in commission of a murder out of fear for his own life, the State may offer contrary evidence, that the defendant was accommodating the 18th Street Gang, which had ordered a hit on the victim).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">Nor is <em>Mansoori, </em>304 F.3d 635 (7th Cir.2002) authority for the admission of the evidence regarding gang culture in this case. In <em>Mansoori, </em>the appellants were convicted in federal district court of engaging in a conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute narcotics. 304 F.3d at 640. The State\u2019s theory of the case was that \u201cthe defendants were involved in a unitary conspiracy that used the Traveling] V[ice] L[ords], organization!, the gang with which the defendant and his co-defendants were associated] to distribute cocaine and heroin!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 653. To prove that theory, over the objections of the defense, the court permitted a police gang specialist to give opinion testimony regarding the history, leadership, and operations of the TVL. The defense had a different theory, it posited that the narcotics transactions were part of a series of unrelated conspiracies. <em>Id. </em>at 652-54. These opposing theories were evident from the opening statements. <em>Id. </em>at 653. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>ting the expert testimony, reasoning that the average juror was unlikely to be familiar with the operations of narcotics traffickers or of street gangs; thus, the testimony supplied the jury with useful background concerning the history and structure of TVLs, as well as their involvement in narcotics activities. <em>Id. </em>at 654. The court also found no reason to believe that the testimony invited the jury to reach incorrect conclusions, or to otherwise mislead, confuse, or prejudice the defendants\u2019 case. See <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">In all of the cases, on which the majority relies, in which the admission of gang-related expert evidence was allowed, the expert testimony on gang affiliation was material to the case, addressed a contested issue, and was not offered simply to prove criminal propensity. That is not the situation in the case <em>sub judice. </em>Here, neither the requirements prescribed by Md. Rules 5-404(b) and 5-403 nor by Maryland case law supports the admission of such evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">Indeed, in this case, there simply was no legitimate basis or justification for the State\u2019s proffer of evidence to prove motive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The appellant was charged with first degree murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unlike the crimes charged in <em>Ayers </em>(hate crime), Mansoori (conspiracy), or <em>Robinson </em>(distribution of narcotics), neither of these crimes requires the accused to possess a particular motive, or any motive, knowledge, or intent \u2014 beyond deliberateness \u2014 in order to be convicted.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Furthermore, the appellant did not defend on the basis that he was not a member of MS-13, that he had no motive to kill the victim or, as was the case in <em>Ayala, McDaniels, Bryant, Utz, </em>or <em>Nieto, </em>offer any evidence of self-defense and/or defense of others or of any other matter that would have made motive a contested and material issue in the case. His defense was simple: although there was eyewitness testimony to the contrary, he asserted that he did not fire the gun. To sustain that position, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>appellant attacked the credibility of the eyewitnesses;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> he did not offer a moderating or exculpatory motive for having committed the act alleged. Expert testimony regarding gang activities, culture, and the like does not respond to this impeaching evidence offered by the appellant. Therefore, the gang-related testimony offered to prove Gutierrez\u2019s motive had absolutely no relevance to, and served no legitimate purpose in proving, the prosecution\u2019s case, for either of the crimes charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">In <em>Faulkner, </em>the defendant\u2019s identity was clearly a contested issue, and the \u201cother crimes\u201d evidence was especially important, even necessary. There was no eyewitness to identify the robber; therefore, identity had to be proven circumstantially and, hence, was a material contested issue. Thus, this circumstantial evidence, the testimony concerning the prior robberies, had a particular and significant non-prejudicial relevance: it would show that the robber from previous stick-ups displayed almost identical physical and behavioral characteristics as Faulkner. 314 Md. at 636, 552 A.2d at 899. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>The cases of <em>Ayala, McDaniels, Bryant, Utz, </em>and <em>Nieto, </em>which admitted evidence of prior \u201cbad acts\u201d in the form of gang involvement, also involved materially contested issues; in those cases, the State and defense asserted conflicting theories of motive, or the defendant argued that he lacked any intent whatsoever. Lastly, in <em>Gonzalez, </em>although explainable on the basis of witness testimony repudiation, the objection made here simply was not made to, and therefore not addressed by, the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">The State offered Sgt. Norris\u2019 testimony in its case-in-chief, this is before the defendant had the opportunity to raise the issue of motive. At that point in the trial, he had simply pled not guilty, and had given no indication that he would be contesting the issue of motive. \u201cA plea of not guilty cannot, by itself, be construed as raising such a keen dispute on [the issue of motive] as to justify the admission of this type of evidence.\u201d <em>Jones, </em>38 Md.App. at 440, 381 A.2d at 322 (1978) (citing <em>United States v. Fierson, </em>419 F.2d 1020, 1022-23 (7th Cir.1969)). Consequently, where its case is supported by sufficient evidence and motive is not at issue, the only effect, and thus result, of permitting the State to offer evidence of motive is to buttress the State\u2019s case with evidence whose only effect and purpose is to prejudice the defendant, rather than assist the trier of fact to resolve that disputed issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Courts generally approve of the government anticipating, in its case-in-chief, a defendant\u2019s theory of defense, so long as the anticipated theory is in rebuttal to, or negates actual elements of the charged crime. <em>See United States v. Aranda, </em>963 F.2d 211, 215 (8th Cir.1992) (quoting <em>United States v. Mothershed, </em>859 F.2d 585, 589 (8th Cir.1988); citing <em>United States v. Lewis, </em>759 F.2d 1316, 1349 n. 14 (8th Cir.1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 994, 106 S.Ct. 406, 88 L.Ed.2d 357 (1985)) (Holding that a \u201cplea of not guilty places in issue every element of the crimes charged[,]\u201d and, moreover, \u201cit [is] not necessary for the government to await defendant\u2019s denial of [the elements] before introducing this evidence; the government may anticipate the defense and introduce it in its case-in-chief.\u201d). The State may also anticipate a defense that is not generated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>the elements and present evidence to meet it in its case-in-chief, but only when the \u201cdefense is clearly raised in the defense\u2019s opening statement and [the defense] obviously materializes through a defendant\u2019s presentation of its own witnesses or through cross-examination of the government\u2019s witnesses,\u201d <em>United States v. Goodapple, </em>958 F.2d 1402, 1407 (7th Cir.1992) (entrapment); <em>see United States v. McGuire, </em>808 F.2d 694, 696 (8th Cir.1987) (finding that it was error for the district court to allow the government to introduce rebuttal evidence in its case-in-chief in anticipation of an entrapment defense that was proposed in defense counsel\u2019s opening statement but that never actually materialized), or it is peremptorily to introduce evidence that the defense could use to impeach one of its witnesses, <em>United States v. Curtin, </em>489 F.3d 935, 940-41 (9th Cir.2007) (and cases therein cited). When the government introduces evidence that does not respond to a defense that is not dictated by, or based on, the denial of the necessary elements of the crime, however, the evidence has been ruled inadmissible. <em>See Banks v. State, </em>92 Md.App. 422, 434, n. 2, 608 A.2d 1249, 1255, n. 2 (1992) (citing <em>Commonwealth v. DelValle, </em>351 Mass. 489, 221 N.E.2d 922, 924 (1966)) (testimony of threats made by defendant against victim inadmissible to rebut suicidal state of mind where introduced in State\u2019s case-in-chief and there was no evidence from the defense of victim\u2019s suicidal tendencies). <em>See also United States v. Hicks, </em>635 F.3d 1063, 1071-72 (7th Cir.2011) (holding inadmissible the defendant\u2019s prior conviction offered to rebut an anticipated but then unraised entrapment defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">In <em>Jackson v. State, </em>87 Md.App. 475, 590 A.2d 177 (1991), the front of the victim\u2019s Fort Meade home was firebombed and the victim, after noticing the fire, went to the kitchen and called the police. While on the phone, the victim was fatally shot in the chest from a bullet fired through a kitchen window. <em>Id. </em>at 478, 590 A.2d at 179.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">\u201cAs part of its case in chief, the prosecution offered evidence intended to show that appellant, who was a military police sergeant stationed at Fort Meade, had a motive for committing the arson and the murder. Specifically, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>prosecution introduced the fact that appellant knew he was a suspect in the rape of [the victim\u2019s mother]. Additionally, the prosecution showed that appellant knew that there was a military Article 32 hearing scheduled for November 27, 1989 to determine whether there was sufficient evidence against him to proceed with a general court martial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-4\"><em>Id. </em>Although the opinion is unclear as to whether the defendant objected to the peremptory introduction of motive evidence \u2014 the issue raised by the defendant was his right to offer evidence of a lack of motive in response, <em>id. </em>at 478, 590 A.2d at 179, \u2014 the case can be read as affirming the proposition that the proof of prior bad acts to show motive was properly admitted as circumstantial evidence of guilt, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, as it was material to show that the appellant had a motive to murder the rape victim\u2019s daughter, a possible witness in his upcoming rape trial. <em>Id. </em>at 483-87, 590 A.2d at 181-84. Nevertheless, the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>are not at all similar to those in <em>Jackson. </em>In <em>Jackson, </em>no one witnessed either the fire bombing or the murder. Consequently, there was no direct evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal agency, as there is in this case. Because of this lack of direct evidence, the State could only prove its case circumstantially, including introducing evidence tending to show the defendant\u2019s motive to commit the crimes. By contrast, here, the State had multiple witnesses to testify that the appellant shot and killed the victim. Not only was motive not an element of the offense, but the evidence of gang-related motive was not, with Quintanilla\u2019s murder, \u201cso linked together in point of time or circumstances that one [could not] be fully shown without proving the other,\u201d so as to make motive not simply a material, but a necessary, part of the State\u2019s case. <em>Westpoint, </em>404 Md. at 489, 947 A.2d at 539 (internal citations omitted). Moreover, motive was never placed into controversy by the defense; \u201clack of motive\u201d or a defense that would generate the issue was never introduced in the defense\u2019s opening statement and the defense never raised any such issues during the State\u2019s case or at any time during the trial. Thus, no issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>permitting the State to offer evidence of motive ever materialized during trial, never mind during the State\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">I agree with the court in <em>United States v. Goodwin, </em>492 F.2d 1141, 1155 (5th Cir.1974), when it explained that we must continue to recognize that the categories of exceptions \u2014 motive, intent, identity, etc. \u2014 to the prohibition against other crimes evidence \u201care not magic passwords whose mere incantation will open wide the courtroom doors to whatever evidence may be offered in their names.\u201d By this holding, we fail to heed that advice and, in fact, do the opposite, we expand these exceptions to the point where, if it has not already occurred, they will swallow the rule. More significantly, and sadder still, the State is permitted to force onto a defendant a defense he or she would not otherwise have asserted or, even worse, may have strategically decided not to raise and, in that event, the obligation either to defend or explain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Furthermore, this Court has held that prior bad acts/other crimes evidence is only admissible if its probative value outweighs its prejudicial impact. <em>Johnson v. State, </em>332 Md. 456, 473, 632 A.2d 152, 160 (1993). In arriving at the proper balance, the special relevance of that evidence must be considered, to be sure, but also must its necessity. As I have explained, I believe the evidence at issue fails the special relevance prong of the test, since, where there is no contested issue, there can be but one purpose for introducing the evidence, \u201cto prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Maryland Rule 5-404(b). I believe it also fails the necessity prong. <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cross v. State, </em>282 Md. 468, 474, 386 A.2d 757, 761 (1978), this Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArJ\">\u201c[TJhough the evidence may fall within one or more of the exceptions, the trial judge still possesses discretion as to whether it should be received. In the judicious determination of this issue he should carefully weigh <em>the necessity for </em>and probativeness of the evidence concerning the collateral criminal act against the untoward prejudice which is likely to be the consequence of its admission. In some cases, this may require that evidence of the criminal actions of the defendant be totally excluded; in others, admission of por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>tions or all of the evidence of the defendant\u2019s specific criminal actions may be permissible.\u201d (Citations omitted, emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">It is widely recognized that \u201cwe must balance the actual need for that evidence in view of the contested issues and other evidence available to the prosecution.\u201d <em>Goodwin, </em>492 F.2d 1141, 1150 (5th Cir.1974). Here, even if the evidence of motive were material and contested, which it was not, the gang-related testimony of Sgt. Norris to prove the defendant\u2019s motive simply was not necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The State produced eyewitness testimony, as we have seen, that the appellant was the murderer, that he engaged the crowd with an announcement and a question and then shot the victim. In addition, it called three witnesses who testified, over the appellant\u2019s objection, to the defendant\u2019s membership in the gang and that the murder was related in some way to the MS-13 gang. These witnesses testified to similar, though not the exact, information given by Sgt. Norris. Thus, while perhaps nice to have, the expert testimony was not necessary. Moreover, it must be remembered, when addressing this prong of the test, that the only contested issue was who killed the victim, the appellant or someone else. On this issue, the value of Sgt. Norris\u2019 testimony, relating to the gang\u2019s culture, procedures and affiliations, was not only unnecessary, but of limited probative value, it added very little information helpful to the jury in its deliberation. On the other side of the balance, the evidence was highly prejudicial to the defendant, aligning him with a violent organization with ties to the \u201cMexican Mafia,\u201d whose penalties result in punishments \u201cup to death.\u201d When conveyed to the jurors by a seasoned police officer, determined by the court to be an expert on the subject, this information could be expected to, and likely did, result in the assumption by the jurors that the appellant, because of this association, would be more likely to kill, or use a handgun in the commission of a felony. It is clear that the probative value of Sgt. Norris\u2019 testimony simply does not outweigh the prejudicial impact it would have on the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">While I disagree with the conclusion of the majority in regards to the relevancy of any of the expert witness\u2019 gang-related testimony, I agree that the majority is correct when it states, that \u201cthe trial court erred when allowing [the expert witness] to testify that MS-13 is the gang that law enforcement \u2018had seen the most violence with recently for the past four, four and a half years in this region.\u2019 \u201d Op. at 499, 32 A.3d at 16. Certainly, the fact that MS-13 or any gang is more violent than others has no bearing on whether this particular defendant committed this particular crime. I do not agree that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">The test that controls the resolution of this issue was pronounced in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-7\">\u201c[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u2018harmless\u2019 and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded \u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.\u201d (footnote omitted)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d at 678. The test focuses on the effect of evidence, admitted or excluded in error, on the verdict delivered by the trier of fact. When a reviewing court determines that an error was committed, reversal of the conviction is required unless the error is harmless. The error is harmless only if it \u201cin no way influenced the verdict.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reviewing court must exclude this possibility \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, this Court has stated, that the harmful error test should be implemented strictly, that it \u201cshould be carefully circumscribed\u201d for the reasons given in <em>Younie v. State, </em>272 Md. 233, 322 A.2d 211 (1974), where it said that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>\u201cContinued expansion of the harmless error rule will merely encourage prosecutors to attempt to get such testimony in, since they know that, if they have a strong case, such testimony will not be considered to be reversible error, yet if they have a weak case, they will use such testimony to buttress the case to gain a conviction and then hope that the issue is not raised on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b569-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 248, 322 A.2d at 219 <em>(quoting People v. Jablonski, </em>38 Mich.App. 33, 38-39, 195 N.W.2d 777, 780 (1972) (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">The majority in its review of this issue quotes the harmless error test enunciated in <em>Dorsey; </em>however its application of the test is flawed, or, rather, it applies a different test than it states. The majority states, \u201c[booking to the other evidence on the record, we are confident that the statement would not have persuaded the jury to render a guilty verdict when it would not have otherwise done so.\u201d Op. at 500, 32 A.3d at 16. This is not the harmless error test set forth in <em>Dorsey. </em>The <em>Dorsey </em>test requires \u201cin order to find the error harmless, \u2018the good evidence standing alone must be sufficient to convict, and we must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury was in no way influenced by the bad [evidence].\u2019 \u201d <em>Dorsey, </em>276 Md. at 656, 350 A.2d at 676 <em>(quoting Younie, </em>272 Md. at 247-48, 322 A.2d at 219.); <em>see also State v. Blackwell, </em>408 Md. 677, 698, 971 A.2d 296, 308 (2009). The majority only addresses the sufficiency prong of the test, stating that at trial \u201c[t]hree different eyewitnesses named him as the shooter,\u201d and \u201cother properly admissible evidence established that Gutierrez was affiliated with MS-13.\u201d Op. at 500, 32 A.3d at 16. This may be absolutely correct; however, it alone does not satisfy the test. That all of the evidence the jury used in determining its verdict, excluding the detective\u2019s statement, would be sufficient for the jury to find the appellant guilty is but one consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In conformity with the <em>Dorsey </em>test, the appellate court must also consider whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the wrongly admitted evidence had any influence on the jury\u2019s verdict. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>the case <em>sub judice, </em>it is not unreasonable to believe that the testimony of an expert witness, who has been a police officer for 19 years, a supervisor in the police gang unit, and who states that a gang is one law enforcement had seen \u201cthe most violence with\u201d in recent years, would influence the jury and its verdict. This is particularly so, when the prosecutor has taken great pains to attempt to connect the defendant to this particular gang. It is entirely logical to believe, and thus conclude, that a juror might have concluded that the appellant was a member of MS-13 and, from that, use the officer\u2019s statement to find that the appellant committed the violent acts charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">The majority does not address why it believes the officer\u2019s testimony did not influence the jury\u2019s decision, other than to assert that the statement \u201cis not so shocking in light of the mountain of other testimony detailing the violent practices of the gang.\u201d Op. at 500, 32 A.3d at 16. Again, that is not the question or the test. Testimony need not be \u201cshocking\u201d in order for it to influence the jury. Furthermore, I find that nowhere in the \u201cmountain of other testimony\u201d the majority points to, is it mentioned that the MS-13 gang and its acts are more violent than any other acts or gangs, in the region or in recent years. This statement is unlike any articulated by the officer, or any other witness, and does not \u201cso easily blend in\u201d as the majority suggests. <em>Id. </em>I am not persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that this statement made by the expert witness had no influence on the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">Judge GREENE authorizes me to state that he joins in Part B of this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-6\">.

It further identified and emphasized inconsistencies in the testimony of the State witnesses: one witness (and possibly another, who told the detective on the scene) identified the shooter as a person with long black hair, when, at die time of the shooting, the appellant had short black hair and Hector Tirado, a witness and co-occupant of the car, who identified the appellant as the murderer, had long black hair. Tirado, testified that he was sitting in the back seat passenger side, behind a window with illegal black tints that did not roll down, which contradicted the testimony of a witness who identified the shooter as having \"shoulder length, long black hair,\u201d sitting in the front passenger seat.

Rather than offering lack of motive or intent as a defense, the appellant sought to exclude evidence bearing on the subject. Indeed, the defense objected to the State's introduction of expert evidence of gang affiliation on several occasions. Any discussion of gang membership in which the defense engaged was to rebut the State's accusations that the appellant was affiliated with the MS-13 gang.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b570-8\">GREENE, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A_s\">concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-9\">I agree with the majority that most of the expert witness\u2019s gang-related testimony is relevant to the issue of Gutierrez\u2019s motive to commit murder.

State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976) and recently reaffirmed by this Court in <em>Perez v. State, </em>420 Md. 57, 21 A.3d 1048 (2011); <em>Dove v. State, </em>415 Md. 727, 4 A.3d 976 (2010); <em>Donaldson v. State, </em>416 Md. 467, 7 A.3d 84 (2010), and <em>Parker v. State, </em>408 Md. 428, 970 A.2d 320 (2009).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
