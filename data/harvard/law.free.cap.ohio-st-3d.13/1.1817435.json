This argument is without merit. It is well-settled that any claim alleging the unconstitutionality of a proposal prior to its approval is premature. <em>State, ex rel. Cramer, </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1983), 7 Ohio St. 3d 5, 6, citing <em>Pfeifer </em>v. <em>Graves </em>(1913), 88 Ohio St. 473, paragraph five of the syllabus; <em>Weinland </em>v. <em>Fulton </em>(1918), 99 Ohio St. 10; <em>Cincinnati </em>v. <em>Hillenbrand </em>(1921), 103 Ohio St. 286, paragraph two of the syllabus; <em>State, ex rel.

Kittel, </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1941), 138 Ohio St. 497 [21 O.O. 380], paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-10\">We also reject respondent\u2019s contention that the proposal concerning the delinquent utility account is not a question which \u201c* * * municipalities may now or hereafter be authorized by law to control by legislative action\u201d and thus, is not subject to the power of initiative as set forth in Section <em>If </em>Article II of the Ohio Constitution. R.C. 715.06 clearly grants to a municipality the general power to regulate all aspects of its utility companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-11\">No claim with regard to the signatures or any other aspect of the petitions having been made which would obviate respondent\u2019s duty under R.C. 731.28, the writ prayed for is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-12\">\n<em>Writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b38-13\">Celebrezze, C.J., W.
