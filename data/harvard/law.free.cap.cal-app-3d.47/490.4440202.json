Code, \u00a7 11359, subd. (a)), and with possession of marijuana (counts II and III, in violation of Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11357, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">After taking the required waivers, defendant was tried by the court and was acquitted as to counts II and III. As to count I, defendant was found not guilty of possession for sale of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11359, subd. (a)), but guilty of the lesser included offense of possession of marijuana (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11357, subd. (a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">At the conclusion of trial defendant requested to be diverted on the lesser included offense. The court took the request under submission and after the filing of a probation report, granted the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">QUESTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">The People on appeal question (1) whether an appeal lies from a superior court diversion order, and (2) whether the superior court acted beyond its jurisdiction in diverting the defendant after his trial and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-10\">We must first decide whether there is in existence an appealable order. We hold that the order granting diversion is analogous to a final judgment in a \u201cspecial proceeding\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murphy, </em>70 Cal.2d 109, 115 [74 Cal.Rptr. 65, 448 P.2d 945]), and hence is final for the purposes of appellate review. \u201c. . . It is not the form of the decree but the substance and effect of the adjudication which is determinative.  As a general test, which must be adapted to the particular circumstances of the individual case, it may be said that where no issue is left for future consideration except the fact of compliance or noncompliance with the terms of the first decree, that decree is final, but where anything further in the nature, of judicial action on the part of the court is essential to a final determination of the rights of the parties, the decree is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>interlocutory.\u201d <em>(Lyon </em>v. <em>Goss, </em>19 Cal.2d 659, 670 [123 P.2d 11].) Hence the order granting diversion is an appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">The second question presented is whether the superior court acted beyond its jurisdiction in diverting the defendant after his trial and conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Defendant was diverted pursuant to Penal Code section 1000<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> after his trial and conviction. As stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Reed, </em>46 Cal.App.3d 625, 629 [120 Cal.Rptr. 250]: \u201cSince acceptance of this case by the Supreme Court, that court has rendered its opinion in <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>13 Cal.3d 149 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46]. The issue raised relative to the court\u2019s authority to divert defendant <em>after </em>the completion of a criminal trial has been determined adversely to defendant\u2019s position. In <em>Morse, </em>the court determined that \u2018[defendants eligible for diversion may tender usual pretrial motions prior to their expression of consent for diversion,\u2019 (p. 160) but that \u2018the clear wording of the diversion provision . . . precludes a defendant from initiating diversion proceedings by tendering a consent after commencement of trial\u2019 (p. 157). In the instant case, although initially defendant was eligible and consented to diversion before trial, the court denied diversion at that time, and thereafter defendant pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial. Therefore, defendant\u2019s subsequent consent and the court\u2019s efforts to reinstitute diversion <em>after </em>trial were invalid.\u201d (Original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Defendant contends that since he did not become eligible for diversion until after trial, in that he was charged with a crime not included in Penal Code section 1000, the ruling in <em>Morse, supra, </em>is inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> \", . . Penal Code sections must generally be construed \u2018 \u201caccording to the fair import of their terms, with a view to effect its objects and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>promote justice.\u201d \u2019 <em>(In re Smith </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 437, 440 [50 Cal.Rptr. 460, 412 P.2d 804].) Consistent with that general principle, appellate courts first examine the language of the code section to determine whether the words used unequivocally express the Legislature\u2019s intent. If no ambiguity, uncertainty, or doubt about the meaning of the statute appear, the provision is to be applied according to its terms without further judicial construction. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Baker </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 44, 50 [69 Cal.Rptr. 595, 442 P.2d 675], emphasizing that the plain meaning of words used is not to be disregarded.)\u201d <em>(Morse </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, </em>13 Cal.3d 149, 156 [118 Cal.Rptr. 14, 529 P.2d 46].)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Penal Code section 1000 states in pertinent part that \u201cwhenever a case is before any court upon an <em>accusatory </em>pleading\u201d (italics added) and certain prerequisites are made, the defendant can be diverted. In the case at bench defendant was not eligible for diversion prior to trial, and the Penal Code does not make provision for diversions after trial. Furthermore, in light of <em>Reed, supra, </em>and <em>Morse, supra, </em>defendant cannot be diverted after trial in any event.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The order granting diversion is reversed; the alternative writ of mandate is discharged; and the petition is hereby dismissed as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Wood, P. J., and Lillie, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">The petition of defendant and respondent for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied July 3, 1975.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-8\"> Penal Code section 1000:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201c(a) This chapter shall apply whenever a case is before any court upon an accusatory pleading for violation of Section 11500, 11530, 11555, 11556, 11910, or 11990 of the Health and Safety Code and it appears to the district attorney that all of the following apply to the defendant:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\u201c(1) The defendant has no prior conviction for any offense involving narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201c(2) The offense charged did not involve a crime of violence or threatened violence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\u201c(3) There is no evidence of a violation relating to narcotics or restricted dangerous drugs other than a violation of the sections listed in this subdivision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-13\">\u201c(4) The defendant has no record of probation or parole violations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">\u201c(b) The district attorney shall review his file to determine whether or not paragraphs (1) to (4) inclusive, of subdivision (a) are applicable to the defendant.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
