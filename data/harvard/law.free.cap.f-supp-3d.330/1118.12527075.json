BACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 5, 2018, Villatoro-Ventura was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ICE held Villatoro-Ventura in custody until a grand jury returned an indictment on June 19, 2018, charging him with one count of being found after illegal reentry in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). While Villatoro-Ventura was in ICE custody, he was not brought before an immigration judge (IJ) or hearing officer or offered a bond hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, there is no evidence that any immigration proceedings happened during the time Villatoro-Ventura was held in ICE custody prior to his transfer to the custody of the United States Marshal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 26, 2018, Villatoro-Ventura was transferred to Marshal custody for his initial appearance and arraignment in this case. The process by which Villatoro-Ventura found himself transferred from ICE to Marshal custody for federal prosecution\n   is regulated by a mixture of ICE and United States Attorney's Office (USAO) policies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Up to the point of transfer, other than perhaps the 21 days of inaction by ICE, there is little controversial about the proceedings against Villatoro-Ventura.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Villatoro-Ventura's case became complicated at his initial appearance and arraignment on June 26, 2018. At that time, he exercised his right under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (the Bail Reform Act or BRA), to request a detention hearing. Doc. No. 6. Judge Mahoney held a detention hearing on June 29, 2018, during which she considered the Pretrial Services Report (PSR) prepared by United States Probation, the testimony of ICE Deportation Officer Christopher Green and Villatoro-Ventura's proffer of information. Doc. No. 13. Judge Mahoney ordered Villatoro-Ventura released. The Government, through Officer Green and Assistant United States Attorney Kevin Fletcher, represented that release under the BRA would result in ICE taking Villatoro-Ventura into custody\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and deporting him before his trial date. However, Judge Mahoney held that such alleged eventuality should not affect the court's determination under the BRA:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   In this case, ICE very clearly decided that criminal prosecution should take precedence over removal proceedings; Villatoro-Ventura was in ICE custody for 21 days (from June 5 to June 26) without being removed before ICE turned him over to appear in the criminal case. The Government acknowledged at the detention hearing that if Villatoro-Ventura is removed from the United States by ICE prior to trial in this case, the criminal indictment would have to be dismissed. Therefore, it appears the Government is fully aware of the risk to the criminal case should ICE detain and deport Villatoro-Ventura pending trial. The conflict between either Villatoro-Ventura being released on conditions and standing trial or being taken into immigration custody and removed prior to trial rests with the [USAO] and ICE, both agencies within the Executive Branch. It is not the court's place to resolve internal decisions between the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security about\n   whether a criminal prosecution or administrative deportation should take precedence in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Doc. No. 17 at 15. Put another way, Judge Mahoney held that the various agencies of the Executive Branch could not use their alleged failure to cooperate on Villatoro-Ventura's case to deprive him of his rights. Judge Mahoney also stated that the risk of Villatoro-Ventura's deportation was on the Government: \"It is now up to the Government (both the [USAO] and ICE) to determine whether it is more important to prosecute Villatoro-Ventura for illegal reentry (after which they can resume removal proceedings), or expeditiously remove him from the country and risk dismissal of the indictment.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    at 15-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Judge Mahoney stayed her release order for seven days to allow the Government to appeal. However, the Government requested an extension of time to appeal (Doc. No. 20) and Villatoro-Ventura was ultimately released from Marshal custody. Villatoro-Ventura was then taken back into ICE custody and the court was advised that his deportation was scheduled for a date certain some two weeks after he was returned to ICE custody. In addition, Villatoro-Ventura filed his first motion to dismiss the indictment, arguing that ICE and the USAO could not pursue the dual track of deportation and prosecution without violating his statutory and constitutional rights. In order to ensure that Villatoro-Ventura was not deported pending resolution of the Government's appeal, and of Villatoro-Ventura's motion to dismiss, I granted a writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to bring Villatoro-Ventura back into Marshal custody.

The only provision of the BRA that differentiates between the treatment of aliens and citizens - \u00a7 3142(d) - permits only a \"temporary detention to permit ... deportation, or exclusion\" if the judicial officer determines that the defendant \"is not a citizen of the United States or lawfully admitted for permanent residence\" and \"may flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3142(d) (1)(B), (d)(2).

In this case, ICE brought Villatoro-Ventura to the attention of the USAO, not the other way around. Thus, the temporary detention provisions of \u00a7 3142(d) do not apply. Instead, Villatoro-Ventura's pretrial release must be resolved pursuant to \u00a7 3142(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"In our society liberty is the norm, and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception.\"\n   <em>\n    Salerno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p742\">\n    481 U.S. at 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222105\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/481/739/#p742\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2095\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Three cases in the Southern District of Iowa are presently addressing the situation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   another case in this district addressed it earlier this year,\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two circuit courts of appeal\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   have had occasion to address the situation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2017, the offense of illegal re-entry comprised 23.6% of all federal criminal sentences and 81.6% of all immigration offenders.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nearly every defendant charged with illegal reentry will have a prior order of removal that ICE will attempt to reinstate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The prospect of denying pretrial release to 24% of defendants, as a matter of course and without\n   an individualized determination under the BRA, raises constitutional concerns.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   For many reasons, I find that my opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   has no precedential value. First, the record before me in that case indicated, without refutation, that the defendants' removals, if they were released from Marshal custody, would be certain and immediate. Neither party argued or suggested that ICE may have discretion to delay removal. As discussed above, it is now clear that the situation is not so simple.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, my opinion in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   did not expressly address the two-step inquiry for resolving pre-trial detention issues, as outlined in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4060790\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/985/895/#p897\">\n    985 F.Supp.2d 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897. At the first step, if the charged offense does not fall within the scope of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1), detention is not an option unless the case involves either (1) \"a serious risk that [the defendant] will flee\" or (2) \"a serious risk that [the defendant] will\" engage in specified acts to obstruct justice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2). In\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   , I addressed the \"risk of nonappearance\" issue that arises at the second step of the BRA analysis without discussing the threshold issue of whether the defendants were likely to \"flee\" or to obstruct justice. Third, one of the cases I found persuasive,\n   <em>\n    United States v. Castro-Inzunza\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:11-cr-00418-MA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201952652\">\n    2012 WL 1952652\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Ore. May 30, 2012), was overturned in an unpublished Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals opinion before I issued the order in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, two of the three defendants in\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   pleaded guilty before their appeals of my detention order could be resolved.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nos. 17 (appeal of magistrate judge order of detention), 30 (notice of withdrawal of appeal), and 39 (order accepting guilty plea);\n   <em>\n    United States v. Roque-Castro\n   </em>\n   , CR12-3053-MWB at Doc. Nos. 16 (appeal of magistrate judge order of detention), 21 (order granting motion to withdraw appeal) and 29 (order accepting guilty plea). However, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Millan-Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , CR12-4102-DEO, my order was appealed to the Honorable Donald E. O'Brien.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201952652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Doc. No. 12. While Judge O'Brien adopted my order as it applied to the facts of Millan-Vasquez's particular case, he declined to adopt a \"rule, de facto or otherwise\" that would detain all similarly situated defendants.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201952652\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at Doc. No. 24. On interlocutory appeal, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals similarly cautioned against a per se rule of detention for those in Millan-Vasquez's position.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Millan-Vasquez\n   </em>\n   , 13-1324 at *4-5 (8th Cir. Apr. 18, 2013). Specifically, the court acknowledged that \"the magistrate judge's rationale raises serious constitutional questions that should be avoided by a narrowing construction of the Bail Reform Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *5. The Eighth Circuit issued a limited remand for the \"purpose of requesting the district court to clarify whether it determines that Millan-Vasquez presents a\n   <em>\n    serious risk of flight of his own volition\n   </em>\n   , such that no conditions will reasonably assure his appearance as required if he is released into the community.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Judge O'Brien ultimately ordered Milan-Vasquez detained without regard to the ICE detainer, based on the factors in \u00a7 1342(g).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Doc. No. 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In short, and unlike the present case,\n   <em>\n    Ramirez-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   suffered from a limited factual record and poorly-developed legal arguments. Now that I have the opportunity to revisit the issue, I decline to follow my holding in that case. I instead adopt the reasoning and holdings of the Ninth and Tenth Circuits in\n   <em>\n    Santos-Flores\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Ailon-Ailon.\n   </em>\n   A risk of involuntary removal does not, by itself, establish \"a serious risk that such person will flee,\" such that the Government may seek pre-trial detention pursuant to \u00a7 3142(f)(2)(A). As in\n   <em>\n    Dimmick\n   </em>\n   , I hold that the BRA does not create an exception for a defendant who is subject to detention outside of my jurisdiction. The question of whether this court should order Villatoro-Ventura to be detained pending trial must be resolved pursuant to the BRA without regard to whether the Executive Branch might remove him from the country if he is released.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     1. Villatoro-Ventura is not properly detained under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (d).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As discussed above, the BRA allows for the temporary detention of aliens if the court determines that the defendant \"is not a citizen of the United States or lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). However, that section does not apply to this case. ICE is already aware of Villatoro-Ventura's status as an illegal alien, as it was the entity that conveyed him to Marshal custody. \"If [DHS] fails or declines to take such person into custody during that period, such person shall be treated in accordance with the other provisions of this section, notwithstanding the applicability of other provisions of law governing release pending trial or deportation or exclusion proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, I must conduct the usual BRA analysis under \u00a7\u00a7 3142(e) and (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. Villatoro-Ventura is not properly detained under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n      18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3142\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (f)(1) or (2).\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   At the first step of the BRA analysis, I must consider whether the Government has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that it is authorized to seek detention under \u00a7\u00a7 3142(f)(1) or (2). Illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is not one of the enumerated crimes for which pretrial detention may be sought under \u00a7 3142(f)(1). The Government has not alleged that there is a serious risk that Villatoro-Ventura will attempt to obstruct justice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(2)(B). Therefore, the issue is whether the Government has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a serious risk that Villatoro-Ventura will flee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Government has not submitted evidence that Villatoro-Ventura is likely to flee on his own volition, rather, the Government focuses on the \"nonappearance\" element under \u00a7 3142(e). This argument misses the mark. I cannot reach the question of whether there are conditions which will reasonably assure Villatoro-Ventura's appearance without addressing first whether Villatoro-Ventura is subject to detention under \u00a7 3142(f)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Considering all of the evidence in the record, including the additional evidence received during the hearing I conducted on August 27, 2018, I do not find a serious risk that Villatoro-Ventura will flee. He was born in El Salvador and earned the equivalency of a high school diploma in that country. However, with only one interruption, he has lived in Sioux City, Iowa, from the time he was 18. Villatoro-Ventura became an LPR and graduated from Sioux City West High School in 1999. After graduating, he maintained steady employment from 1999 to 2011. Although he was convicted in October 2001 of attempted burglary in the third degree and\n   rioting, Villatoro-Ventura (then age 21) was given a suspended prison sentence and ordered to serve a two-year term of probation. Villatoro-Ventura successfully discharged his probation in September 2002, after only 11 months, and has not had any involvement with law enforcement (excepting his immigration troubles) since. While the ICE witness testified that these 2001 convictions rendered Villatoro-Ventura deportable, he was not deported until 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Villatoro-Ventura has strong family and community ties. His wife, two children, mother, father and three siblings all reside in Sioux City. Thirteen of Villatoro-Ventura's family members have LPR status or are United States citizens. Villatoro-Ventura's wife owns a residence in Sioux City. Although Villatoro-Ventura faces a potential term of incarceration and serious immigration consequences arising from his return to the United States, he has never missed a court date in immigration, state or federal court. Nor has he ever attempted to flee any jurisdiction or failed to comply with probation or pretrial release conditions. To my knowledge, Villatoro-Ventura has not indicated that he would prefer deportation to facing criminal charges. Indeed, the evidence strongly suggests that Villatoro-Ventura's primary motivation in returning to the United States, and in litigating this case, is to be with his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   In light of these facts, I find no serious risk that Villatoro-Ventura will flee. Thus, the Government has failed to show that it is authorized to seek pretrial detention under \u00a7 3142(f)(1) or (2). While this ends the BRA analysis and rules out pretrial detention, I will also address, in the alternative, the second step of the analysis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3.

At the outset, to avoid potential constitutional issues, I will analyze the \u00a7 3142(g) factors without regard to the Executive Branch's plans for Villatoro-Ventura. Such an analysis weighs in favor of releasing Villatoro-Ventura subject to the conditions imposed by Judge Mahoney.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     a. Nature and Circumstances of the Offense Charged\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As previously stated, illegal reentry under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   does not carry a presumption of detention. In Villatoro-Ventura's case, an LPR was deported due to 10-year-old conviction for which he\n   served no jail time. There is no allegation that his reentry, apart from being unlawful, harmed any particular person or place. If convicted in this case, Villatoro-Ventura will face a likely guideline range of zero to six months imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the Government certainly has the right to exclude non-citizens, and to punish those who do not use the appropriate means to enter the country in order to deter others from doing so, there is nothing about Villatoro-Ventura's allegedly unlawful actions in this case to suggest that this is a crime for which pretrial detention is appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     b. Weight of the Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Judge Mahoney found that the weight of the evidence against Villatoro-Ventura was strong, and that this factor weighed in favor of detaining him pretrial. However, Villatoro-Ventura has now offered \"newly received information\" (Doc. No. 49) suggesting that he has a colorable collateral challenge to his removal.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Limones-Valles\n   </em>\n   , No. CR16-4060-LTS,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207489446\">\n    2016 WL 7489446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (N.D. Iowa Dec. 30, 2016) (if the defendant was erroneously deported as an aggravated felon, such removal may not form the basis of an illegal reentry conviction). While it is premature to address the effect of this new information, it does suggest that the weight of the evidence against Villatoro-Ventura may not be as strong as it was at the time of Judge Mahoney's hearing. Nevertheless, this factor weighs in favor of detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     c. History and Characteristics of the Person\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Here, I need not repeat my above findings regarding Villatoro-Ventura's history and characteristics. His criminal history is negligible. He has a strong work history and strong family connections in this area. During the August 27 hearing, the Government presented evidence casting doubt on Villatoro-Ventura's recent work history, including evidence that his purported employer denies the existence of an employment relationship. Doc. No. 60 at 1. Of course, because of Villatoro-Ventura's immigration status it is unlikely that any employer would freely acknowledge employing him. Nonetheless, I agree with the Government that this apparent discrepancy as to Villatoro-Ventura's recent employment is a factor that weighs against release. I find, however, that this factor does not overcome the many other factors that support release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   As for family connections, the Government actually argues that Villatoro-Ventura's strong connections to his family weigh\n   <em>\n    against\n   </em>\n   release. The Government's theory is that his family has harbored him and returning to his family would therefore encourage ongoing criminality. According to the Government, \"an illegal alien released on bond would effectively need to be self-sufficient and live independently,\" and that returning Villatoro-Ventura to his family would encourage their \"further criminality.\" Doc. No. 27-1 at 13. I disagree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   First, individuals do not commit\n   the crime of harboring an alien under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201324\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(A)(iii) simply by allowing a relative or acquaintance to live with them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

There must be some evidence of affirmative actions taken to shield the alien from detection. Second, the conditions Judge Mahoney imposed, which include electronic monitoring and no employment that would be contrary to law, preclude the possibility of any future actions that could be construed to be unlawful harboring.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In short, I find that Villatoro-Ventura's history and characteristics weigh heavily in favor of pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     d. The Nature and Seriousness of the Danger to any Person or to the Community\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Government has not alleged that Villatoro-Ventura's release would put any person or the community in danger.

Instead, he was transferred from Marshal custody to ICE custody, was listed as an ICE detainee, and was moved from the Plymouth County Jail to the Marshall County Jail. He contends that this conduct violated both the BRA and his constitutional rights and seeks dismissal with prejudice as a remedy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 29-1.

First, as\n   Villatoro-Ventura acknowledges, Judge Mahoney did not rely upon \u00a7 3142(d) in conducting her analysis under the BRA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 29-1 at 6. Indeed, the \"temporary detention\" authorized by \u00a7 3142(d) applies only if the court makes the findings described in both subparagraph (1) and subparagraph (2).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) (using the word \"and\" between subparagraphs (1) and (2) ). Subparagraph (2) requires a finding that \"such person may flee or pose a danger to any other person or the community.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3142(d)(2). Judge Mahoney made no such finding. Thus, the temporary detention and notice provisions set forth in \u00a7 3142(d) were not triggered. The issue of whether Villatoro-Ventura should be released or detained pending trial in this case was instead resolved pursuant to the other provisions in \u00a7 3142, as described earlier in this order. Because Villatoro-Ventura was not released or detained pursuant to \u00a7 3142(d), I find it difficult to conclude that \u00a7 3142(d) has any applicability to this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Second, given the broad scope of subparagraph (1) of \u00a7 3142(d), the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning assumes a Congressional intent to limit detention and prosecution decisions by state and local governments in addition to Executive Branch agencies. Subparagraph (1) applies when, for example, a defendant is \"on ... probation or parole for any offense under Federal, State, or local law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1). If a defendant charged with a federal offense is under state probation, the court could order temporary detention for ten days (or less) and direct the USAO to notify the \"appropriate\" state probation official. Under \u00a7 3142(d), the state government would have the option of taking the defendant into custody during the temporary detention period.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 3142(d) (\"If the official fails or declines to take such person into custody during that period ...\"). Under the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning, however, this would be the state government's\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   opportunity to take the defendant into custody. Thus, if the state did not act quickly enough and the federal court determined that release under the BRA was appropriate, the state would be barred from taking the defendant into custody and initiating revocation proceedings while the defendant was awaiting his or her federal trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   I find no support, in the statutory language or elsewhere, for a Congressional intent to impose such restrictions on sovereign state governments. Federal courts can, and often do, issue writs of habeas corpus ad prosequendum to have state prisoners transferred to federal custody to face charges. That is a far cry, however, from dictating to a sovereign state government that it is not allowed to arrest a federal defendant for a state parole or probation violation while the defendant is on federal pretrial release. Further, I find nothing in \u00a7 3142(d) to suggest that Congress intended it to provide the\n   <em>\n    exclusive\n   </em>\n   remedy for state government or ICE officials when a defendant is charged with a federal offense. It does not state, for example, that such officials are prohibited from deferring action on a pending matter and, instead, filing a detainer to take effect upon a defendant's prospective release from federal criminal custody. Rather, I\n   conclude that Section 3142(d) provides a mechanism to prioritize the disposition of previously pending cases over any recently filed federal criminal charge, should the specified other \"officials\" so elect. Because \u00a7 3142(d) expressly applies to individuals who may be subject to detention and prosecution by state or local governments, in additional to Executive Branch agencies, I find that the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning reads far too much into the operative sentence of that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Even if \u00a7 3142(d) was written to apply only to the Executive Branch, I would not be able to stretch the operative sentence to reach the broad result that a defendant released under the BRA cannot be detained under the INA. In reading that section in its entirety, I find that its purpose is to ensure that various \"officials,\" including ICE officials, receive notice about certain defendants who pose a flight or safety risk in order to give the relevant officials in a particular case an opportunity to take immediate custody of the defendant with regard to other pending matters. If the relevant officials do not take advantage of that opportunity during the short, temporary detention period, then the federal district court must proceed with the normal BRA analysis to determine if the defendant should be released or detained pursuant to the BRA. To the extent that \u00a7 3142(d) has any relevance to this case, I construe the operative sentence to mean, simply, that in making its decision under the BRA, the court must apply \"the other provisions of this section\" without considering \"other provisions of law governing release pending trial or deportation or exclusion proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d). In other words, whether release is warranted under the BRA, the court cannot take into account the possibility that the defendant will be deported, or will be subjected to state court revocation proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dimmick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270271\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/82/866/\">\n    82 F.Supp.3d 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (completing the BRA determination without regard for the fact that the state of South Dakota would take the defendant into custody if he were to be released from Marshal custody).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In short, and in the absence of controlling authority, I decline to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning, as I find that it is supported neither by the statutory text or any indicia of Congressional intent. This does not mean I am unsympathetic to the policy outcome that results from the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning. As indicated previously in this order, I am perplexed by the Executive Branch's practice of seeking deportation while a defendant is awaiting trial on a federal criminal charge. Congress could, and maybe should, provide a legislative solution to this practice. However, in the absence of clear authority otherwise, I do not find it appropriate for the federal courts to step in and save the Executive Branch from its own, baffling decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Finally, I note that relief may be warranted in a particular case if it becomes clear that the Executive Branch is using ICE solely to hold a defendant for his or her federal criminal trial after the court has ordered release under the BRA. A policy of simply stashing a defendant in ICE custody, with no effort to proceed under the INA, would raise serious concerns as to the defendant's rights under the BRA. Here, however, it is apparent that ICE moved forward with removal proceedings after Villatoro-Ventura was released from Marshal custody and transferred to ICE custody. As noted above, he was moved to a different holding facility and, according to the Government, was scheduled to be removed from the United States within two weeks of July 20, 2018, the date the Government filed its motion to revoke the release order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. No. 27-1 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Thus, there is no evidence that in this case the Government attempted to evade Judge Mahoney's release order under the BRA by using ICE detention as a proxy for pretrial detention. If that does occur in a particular case, I will almost certainly consider it to be a violation of the BRA and will fashion an appropriate remedy. Here, however, I find that ICE detained Villatoro-Ventura for the purpose of removing him from the country - regardless of the impact such removal would have on this case - and would have done so had I not issued writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum. ICE's actions did not violate Villatoro-Ventura's rights under the BRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2. The Constitutional Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Villatoro-Ventura makes abbreviated arguments that the Government has violated, and likely intends to continue to violate, his rights under the Fifth, Sixth and Eighth Amendments. Doc. No. 29-1 at 9-11. With regard to the Fifth Amendment, he notes that due process requires fundamental fairness and then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   When the Executive Branch ignores a Court's release order; keeps a defendant in jail despite that order; moves him to a jail 200 miles away from the Court, his family, and his attorney; and threatens to remove him from the country before he can answer to the criminal charge, the proceedings are simply unfair.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (footnote omitted) (citing\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3803028\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/900/1167/\">\n    900 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1180 ). As with my conclusion concerning the BRA, it is possible to imagine scenarios in which the Executive Branch could interfere with a defendant's due process rights by proceeding under the INA. For example, if a defendant released under the BRA is taken into ICE custody, transferred to a facility in another part of the country and actually (or practically) deprived of access to his federal criminal defense attorney, due process concerns would naturally arise. Similarly, if ICE removes a defendant from the country while a criminal case is pending and the USAO attempts to try the defendant\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   , that would raise serious issues, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   None of these hypothetical issues have occurred in this case. While Villatoro-Ventura was moved to the Marshall County, Iowa, jail for a short period of time after being released from Marshal's custody and taken into ICE custody, there is no evidence that this temporary placement actually impacted his ability to confer with his attorney or to assist in his defense of this case. Nor has Villatoro-Ventura cited authority for the proposition that being held at a facility that is less than a four-hour (one way) drive from the venue of a federal criminal case constitutes a due process violation. Thus, while it is possible that due process issues could arise when the Government proceeds with simultaneous deportation and criminal prosecution proceedings, Villatoro-Ventura has not shown that\n   <em>\n    his\n   </em>\n   Fifth Amendment rights have been violated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   As for the Sixth Amendment, Villatoro-Ventura states that ICE's conduct \"threatens\" his right to counsel, referencing his transfer to the Marshall County Jail and his possible removal from the country. Based on what has actually occurred so far, I find no Sixth Amendment violation. As with the Fifth Amendment, the situation may well be different if the Executive Branch removes Villatoro-Ventura from the country and then attempts to proceed to trial without him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Villatoro-Ventura's Eighth Amendment argument is based on the premise that the Government has violated the BRA and, by extension, has violated that Eighth Amendment's prohibition of excessive bail. Because I have found no BRA violation, this argument necessarily fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     3. The First Motion to Dismiss - Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   I decline to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Trujillo-Alvarez\n   </em>\n   reasoning and, therefore, find that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203142\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d) does not prohibit ICE from proceeding against Villatoro-Ventura under the INA simply because he is entitled to pretrial release under the BRA. I further find that, at least to date, Villatoro-Ventura's rights under the BRA and under the United States Constitution have not been violated. Because no violations have occurred, I need not consider the appropriate remedy. Villatoro-Ventura's first motion (Doc. No. 29) to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    denied\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     VI. CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   I have denied the Government's motion to revoke the release order. Thus, Villatoro-Ventura is entitled to be released from Marshal's custody pending his trial in this matter, subject to the conditions of release imposed by Judge Mahoney. I will not protect the Executive Branch from itself by keeping the July 25, 2018, writ of habeas corpus ad prosequendum (Doc. No. 33) in place. As such, that writ is hereby\n   <strong>\n    annulled\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Once Villatoro-Ventura is released from Marshal's custody, the Executive Branch will be free (through ICE) to detain him and move forward with removal proceedings under the INA, if it so chooses. For the reasons set forth in Section V(B)(1),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , I find that that the BRA does not prohibit such action. Of course, if Villatoro-Ventura is removed from this country before trial, or is otherwise detained in such a manner as to impair his ability to defend this case, his counsel may file a renewed motion to dismiss or for other relief, as may be appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   To conclude, for the reasons set forth herein:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   1.

Although the case before me addresses a defendant who has been charged with illegal re-entry, I suspect that similar arguments about the propriety of allowing immigration detainers or re-instatement of prior removal orders to control the BRA decision could be made about the remaining 19% of immigration offenders.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"18\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    At least one circuit has held that a categorical ban on pretrial release for illegal aliens (in state court) violates the Eighth Amendment, among other constitutional provisions.\n    <em>\n     Lopez-Valenzuela v.

A per se rule mandating pretrial detention in the presence of an ICE detainer would tread similar ground to the state law at issue in\n    <em>\n     Lopez-Valenzuela.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"19\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    The Government argues that Villatoro-Ventura is asking me to apply the BRA to immigration proceedings, thereby claiming an exemption from detention and removal while this case is pending and receiving an \"immigration benefit\" under the INA or a get-out-of-jail free card in his criminal case. With all respect, this argument is lame. I do not have the authority to prevent ICE from deporting Villatoro-Ventura within the framework of the present proceedings. My order releasing Villatoro-Ventura under the BRA will merely shift the risk of his deportation while this criminal case is proceeding onto the branch of our federal government that causes it - the Executive Branch. Indeed, it was the\n    <em>\n     Government\n    </em>\n    , not Villatoro-Ventura, that decided to initiate criminal process. The Government has not offered any explanation as to why the USAO and ICE cannot cooperate to protect all parties' mutual interest in seeing this case through to its end. Referring to ICE's forcible removal of Villatoro-Ventura from the country as a \"get-out-of-jail free card\" as to his criminal charges ignores the fact that it would be the Executive Branch, not the Judicial Branch, that prevents his criminal prosecution if he is removed from the country before he can be tried. The Government's handwringing over \"losing\" a defendant is therefore thoroughly unconvincing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"20\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Although the calculation would change if either of Villatoro-Ventura's prior convictions were determined to be an aggravated felony, as it stands he has a base offense level of 8 (assuming acceptance of responsibility) with a criminal history category of I. See U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Counsel for Villatoro-Ventura has indicated he intends to challenge any allegation that Villatoro-Ventura's prior convictions are aggravated felonies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    I make the same finding as to the rest of the new evidence the Government presented during the August 27 hearing, which includes an expired driver's license found in Villatoro-Ventura's possession that may (or may not) have been intentionally altered. Doc. No. 60-3 at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    I have no doubt that if Villatoro-Ventura had no family ties in the area, the Government would argue that the lack of such ties supports detention. This \"heads I win, tails you lose\" posturing is not persuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"23\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    During the August 27 hearing, defense counsel confirmed that this is how he believes \u00a7 3142(d) should be interpreted, but pointed out that the requested remedy would be different if a state government, rather than an Executive Branch agency, took the federal defendant into custody. Frankly, it is unclear what remedy might be available in such a situation if \u00a7 3142(d) is interpreted in accordance with the\n    <em>\n     Trujillo-Alvarez\n    </em>\n    reasoning. However, it is not the lack of an obvious remedy but the lack of statutory support for the\n    <em>\n     Trujillo-Alvarez\n    </em>\n    reasoning that is fatal to Villatoro-Ventura's motion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
