The Complaint alleges violations of the ESA, NEPA, NFMA, and HFRA.

To that end, many of the paragraphs in the declarations include notations indicating which exception to the extra-record evidence bar Plaintiffs believe applies. Despite this coding, review of the declarations show that they attempt to improperly stage a battle of the experts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   All three of the Johnson declarations go beyond the limitations on extra-record evidence by attacking the science underlying the Forest Service's decisions. In her first declaration, Johnson attacks the methodology by which the Forest Service manages elk security and hiding cover; in her second declaration, she attacks the science underlying the Forest Service's treatment of lynx habitat; and in her third declaration, she attacks the treatment of snag habitat in the Gallatin Forest Plan. While the declarations purport to be limited to extra-record exclusions, in substance they target the Forest Service's science. Their consideration would therefore lead to de novo review of the decisions at issue here by inviting judicial weighing of the science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The same applies for Juel's declaration, which targets the Forest Service's soil productivity analysis of the Smith Shields Project. Contrary to Plaintiffs' assertion, the declaration does not simply explain complex terminology or provide relevant background, but assails the methodology itself. Further, even if attacks on the science were within the Court's purview,\n   it is not clear that Juel, a school psychologist by trade and training, possesses scientific expertise about soil productivity standards. In sum, neither the relevant factors exception nor the technical terms/complex subject matter exceptions apply to the Johnson and Juel declarations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue the declarations may be considered because, with regard to the Designation, Plaintiffs are attempting to compel agency action-namely, to compel the Forest Service to conduct an EIS considering the impacts of the designation. Section 706(1) of the APA applies where a plaintiff seeks to \"compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\" \"In such cases, review is not limited to the record as it existed at any single point in time, because there is no final agency action to demarcate the limits of the record.\"\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Clearwater v. Dombeck\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11242269\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/222/552/#p560\">\n    222 F.3d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 560 (9th Cir. 2000). Therefore, Plaintiffs insist, the declarations may be considered with regard to the Designation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   While Plaintiffs are correct that the declarations would be available for consideration in a \u00a7 706(1) action, that is not the case Plaintiffs pled here. The Complaint requests the Designation be set aside \"pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     706\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2)(A)\n   </em>\n   and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=16%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201540\">\n    16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g) [ESA].\" (Doc. 3 at \u00b6 4) (emphasis added). Plaintiffs' argument is also a red herring because the Johnson and Juel declarations do not target the Designation. Instead, they focus on the Project and the Amendment. And as discussed in Section II(A),\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , the Forest Service's decision to designate the lands in Montana was not a final agency action requiring NEPA review. Plaintiff's argument that \u00a7 706(1) applies to the declarations is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert that the nature of this case calls for a more relaxed approach to extra-record evidence. Specifically, Plaintiffs insist that because neither the HFRA designation, the Amendment, nor the Project involved an EIS, the opportunity for public involvement was limited and the record should be expanded. Plaintiffs cite no authority for this argument, and, as Defendants point out, courts in the Ninth Circuit have applied the extra-record bar when considering an EIS,\n   <em>\n    Nw. Envt.

However, the Johnson declarations are intended to support standing for Native Ecosystems Council. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 1-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 3-6) (Johnson stating she is Executive Director of Native Ecosystems council and has visited, and plans to return to, the Project area), and Defendants do not object to their use for that purpose. Accordingly, the motion to strike is granted except as to those portions of the Johnson declarations supporting standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Motion to Supplement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In addition to the four declarations at issue in Defendants' motion to strike, Plaintiffs have filed a motion to supplement the record with two further declarations-Johnson's fourth declaration, and a declaration from William Haskins. Haskins is an information technology specialist; his declaration involves an overlay of two maps-the cutting unit map for the Smith Shields Project decision memo, and a 2006 \"Successional Stages Smith Creek Vegetation\" map from the Smith Creek Project. (Doc. 38-1.) Johnson's fourth declaration deals with old growth forest in the Smith Shields Project area. Plaintiffs assert the two declarations \"support allegations of bad faith on the part of the Forest Service in approving Smith Shields,\" and \"explain technical terms or complex subjects for the Court in order to understand those allegations,\" (Doc. 38 at 3), but have not submitted a brief in support of their motion to supplement. The motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   First, the motion is untimely. The Case Management Order required Plaintiffs to raise \"any and all issues relating to the sufficiency of the agencies' administrative records\" by July 28, 2017. (Doc. 8 at 2.) It also set August 28, 2017, as the deadline for motions to supplement or challenge the administrative record. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs failed to raise the declarations at issue with Defendants by July 28, 2017, and filed their motion to supplement on October 27, 2017, two months past the deadline. Plaintiffs make no argument to excuse the late-filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Second, and as with the four declarations at issue in Defendants' motion to strike, the two declarations do not fit within the four \"narrowly construed\" circumstances permitting extra-record evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fence Creek\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3920506\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/602/1125/#p1131\">\n    602 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Johnson's fourth declaration disputes the scientific and technical methods employed by the Forest Service in conducting tree stand exams. The point of Haskin's declaration seems to be that the overlay map shows the Forest Service included old growth in Smith Shield Project harvest areas, but the Forest Service did not rely on the 2006 Smith Creek map when analyzing old growth in the Smith Shield Project area, but instead used on-the-ground inspection by a silviculturist. SmithShields 001868-9. In other words, the Haskins declaration attacks the Forest Service's methodology. Even had the declarations been timely filed, they still would not merit consideration.

In brief, Plaintiffs argue that (1) the Forest Service Chief's Designation triggered NEPA; (2) the Forest Service did not sufficiently consider potential impacts from the Amendment or the Project on the Canada lynx; (3) the Amendment involved substantial changes to two forest-wide standards that required preparation of an EIS, as demonstrated by impacts from the Project; and (4) the Project violates HFRA because it does not maximize old growth retention and comply with soil productivity standards.

Certain projects may, in turn, be categorically excluded from NEPA review pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6591b.

They argue that (1) the agencies violated HFRA because they failed to consider the best available science to maintain or restore habitat connectivity; (2) the Project poses potential significant impacts requiring the preparation of an EA; and (3) the Forest Service violated NEPA by informally amending the Lynx Amendment without public involvement. Plaintiffs' arguments are not compelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    1.

HFRA mandates consideration of \"the best available scientific information to maintain or restore the ecological integrity, including maintaining or restoring structure, function, composition, and connectivity.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6591b(b)(1)(B). The Forest Service consulted with the Fish and Wildlife Service regarding the Project's effects on federally listed threatened and endangered species. SmithShieldsFWS 000001. The Fish and Wildlife Service determined that the Project \"may affect-not likely to adversely affect [sic]\" Canada lynx, and that it would have \"no effect\" on designated critical habitat for Canada lynx.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 000004-5.

And, the Biological Assessment considered connectivity, concluding the Project would retain connectivity because (1) it would impact a small amount of lynx habitat, (2) impacts to winter snowshoe hare habitat would be isolated and temporary, (3) the natural mosaic of young to old tree stands would be maintained, and (4) location of the treatments retaining vegetation cover in the Lynx Analysis Unit would allow for lynx mobility. SmithShields 002702, 002705-06, 002709.

Amended Lynx Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue the Lynx Amendment has been altered by the 2013 Lynx Conservation Assessment and Strategy without public involvement or Forest Plan amendment, which has downgraded the conservation value of unoccupied secondary habitat.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Northern Rockies Lynx Management Direction (\"Lynx Amendment\") amended the forest plans of 18 National Forests within the Rocky Mountain, Intermountain, and Northern Regions of the Forest Service, including the Gallatin National Forest, to add specific objectives,\n   standards, and guidelines for management of lynx habitat.

(Doc. 37 at 16);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   40 C.F.R. But NEPA does not contain a best science requirement,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   n.7, and the gravamen of Plaintiffs' argument is that the Forest Service ignored best science when amending Standard 6(a)(5). The Forest Service did not ignore the best available science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Substantive Change to 6(a)(5)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that the Forest Service substantively changed Standard 6(a)(5) by removing the two-thirds hiding cover standard and replacing it with the requirement that vegetation treatment projects \"shall maintain at least two-thirds (2/3) of Douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine conifer forest cover types (on National Forest System lands) with at least 40% canopy cover (on National Forest System lands), to function as hiding cover for elk at any point in time.\" CleanUp 000740-41. More precisely, Plaintiffs argue that the two thirds hiding cover requirement used to apply at the Elk Herd Unit level and that amending the standard reduced its scope in four ways: (1) it applies only to National Forest lands, rather than the total area of the relevant landscape; (2) it applies only to forested areas, rather than all National Forest lands; (3) it applies only to certain types of forests, rather than total forested areas; and (4) it presumes that any forest with 40% canopy cover will function as hiding cover. Defendants disagree, arguing that, prior to amendment, 6(a)(5)'s two thirds hiding cover requirement was not correlated to any particular total area, but required only that two-thirds of hiding cover be retained. They also insist that, in any case, the best available science does not require two-thirds of the area in every Elk Herd Unit to be hiding cover.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   As to Plaintiffs' best available science argument, where interpretation of scientific literature is at issue, courts must provide a high degree of deference.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lands Council v. McNair\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129690\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/981/#p993\">\n    537 F.3d 981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 993 (9th Cir. 2008),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Winter v.

The Collaborative\n   Recommendations, upon which the Forest Service relied, stated as follows regarding whether hiding cover should be assessed at any particular spatial scale:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   We concluded that a specific quantifiable cover recommendation was not supported by the scientific literature. While Lyon et al. 1985 (Coordinating Elk and Timber Mangement; 1985) speaks to \"good cover\" as being two-thirds of the total area, and Thomas et al. (1979) recommended managing for 40% cover and 60% forage for elk, to our collective knowledge, these recommendations have never been empirically tested. Blocks of forested cover were not a strong predictor of elk distribution in a recent study in Montana (Proffitt et al. 2012).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   CleanUp 003991. The Forest Service's interpretation of the hiding cover literature survives that deferential standard. Plaintiffs rely heavily on a statement in Lyon\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   that \"cover is poor\" at \"one-third or less of total area,\" and \"good\" at \"at least two-thirds of total area.\" (Doc. 13 at 19-20); SmithShields 007099. But that citation does not define \"total area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Plaintiffs also rely on two cases for the proposition that the Elk Herd Unit scale has been recognized in the Ninth Circuit as the best available science:\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8939696\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/418/953/#p962\">\n    418 F.3d 953\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 962 (9th Cir. 2005), and\n   <em>\n    Helena Hunter &amp; Anglers v.

Mont. 2009). Both cases addressed whether the Forest Service had complied with the hiding cover requirement in the Helena National Forest Plan, but did not conclude two thirds cover was the best available science. The issue here is whether the Forest Service relied on the best available science.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As to the diminished hiding cover argument, Plaintiffs first argue elk habitat protection has been diminished because the amended standard applies only to National Forest lands, rather than to the total area of the relevant landscape, such as an Elk Herd Analysis Unit. Plaintiffs rely on\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v. Weldon\n   </em>\n   , a case from this Court which held that the Forest Service acted arbitrarily by excluding private lands from two units of analysis involved in a landscape management project in the Custer National Forest.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3793350\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/848/1207/#p1217\">\n    848 F.Supp.2d 1207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1217-18 (D. Mont. 2012),\n   <em>\n    vacated for mootness by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v.

But that case dealt with project-level analysis under a Forest Plan, while Plaintiffs challenge here concerns amendment of a Forest Plan. The pre-amendment standard did not specify that it pertained to any specific \"total area.\" Instead, it linked the two-thirds hiding cover requirement to \"key habitat components,\" including \"moist areas (wallows etc.); foraging areas (meadows and parks); critical hiding cover ... thermal cover; migration routes, and staging areas,\" and stated that such areas \"will be mapped on a site-by-site basis during project area analysis.\" CleanUp 000354. And, as Defendants note, before amendment, hiding cover was determined using the Timber Stand Management Record System, which has data for National Forest System lands, but not for non-federal lands. SmithShields 003523, 003526.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Second, Plaintiffs assert the amended standard reduces hiding cover protection because it applies only to forested areas in National Forest lands, and not to all areas. Again, Plaintiffs' argument overlooks how\n   the pre-amendment standard connected the two thirds hiding cover requirement with \"key habitat components.\" CleanUp 000354. And, risking tautology, hiding cover can only be protected where it exists (or could exist). Hiding cover is \"vegetation capable of concealing 90% of a standing big game animal at a distance equal to or less than 200 feet.\" SmithShields 003514. Accordingly, maintaining that cover can only apply to areas capable of providing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Third, Plaintiffs argue the amended standard reduces hiding cover protections because it pertains only to \"douglas fir, lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir conifer forest cover types ... with at least 40% canopy cover.\" CleanUp 000354. But, as Defendants note, the tree species or mixes of species that provide hiding cover are those \"naturally capable of having relatively dense (&gt;=40%) canopy cover and could include Douglas fir, subalpine fir, spruce, and lodgepole pine.\" CleanUp 003991 (Collaborative Recommendations). The amended standard is therefore more precise, but does not provide less protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Fourth, Plaintiffs insist that using 40% canopy cover as a proxy for the Gallatin Forest Plan definition of hiding cover contravenes the best available science for measuring hiding cover. But the Collaborative Recommendations concluded that 40% cover types \"will generally provide screening for animals and be capable of hiding 90% of an elk &lt; = 200'.\" CleanUp 003391. The Ninth Circuit has upheld the use of canopy cover as proxy for hiding cover, noting that the court is \"required to apply the highest level of deference in [its] review of the Forest Service's scientific judgments in selecting the elk hiding cover methodology.\"\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v. Weldon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623270\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1043/#p1053\">\n    697 F.3d 1043\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1053 (9th Cir. 2012). \"The mere fact that Native Ecosystems Council disagrees with the methodology does not constitute a NEPA violation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623270\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/697/1043/#p1053\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Smith Shields Project Elk Security and Displacement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Plaintiffs argue that application of Amended Standard 6(a)(5) to the Project shows that it reduces elk security and exacerbates elk displacement by significantly reducing the required amount of hiding cover. Plaintiffs focus on a table from the Smith Shields Wildlife Report (\"Wildlife Report\") which shows 30,375 acres of total existing and potential hiding cover on a total of 86,903 acres of National Forest system and private lands within four 6th code Hydrologic Unit Codes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   SmithShields 002614. Because 30,375 is just under 35% of the total area, but the Forest Service nevertheless found the Project met Amended Standard 6(a)(5), Plaintiffs insist that the change to 6(a)(5) was substantial. But, as Defendants note, Plaintiffs' argument is predicated on the conclusion that pre-amendment hiding cover standard required that two-thirds of any analysis unit be elk hiding cover, not that two-thirds of the existing hiding cover be maintained. As discussed above, that conclusion misreads the standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Plaintiffs further assert that the amended standard allows almost unlimited logging of hiding cover without any cumulative effects because it provides no time for logged areas to recover their habitat values for wildlife. But the Wildlife Report considered both \"areas that currently provide hiding cover\" and \"areas that have potential to provide hiding but have been affected by disturbance\" as making up the total acres accounting for hiding cover. SmithShields 002614, 002617. Because the baseline hiding cover includes both disturbed\n   and undisturbed areas, the overall amount of hiding cover cannot be whittled below two thirds. In other words, the denominator in the hiding cover fraction remains the same. In\n   <em>\n    Hapner v. Tidwell\n   </em>\n   , the Ninth Circuit found the Forest Service's interpretation of Standard 6(a)(5) (pre-amendment) was plainly erroneous where the Forest Service argued the standard mandated retaining two-thirds of \"then-existing\" elk cover.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3784699\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/621/1239/#p1251\">\n    621 F.3d 1239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1251 (9th Cir. 2010). That decision is not at odds with the conclusion that the amended standard retains two-thirds cover because, as discussed, the baseline measurement includes both disturbed and undisturbed areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Plaintiffs next assert that amending Standard 6(a)(5) violated NEPA because the Clean Up Amendment did not address the connection between low elk security and elk displacement, specifically as it pertains to displacement during hunting season. But the record shows Defendants took a \"hard look\" at that issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes v. U.S. Dep't of Transp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3829198\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/655/1124/#p1132\">\n    655 F.3d 1124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1132 (9th Cir. 2011) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Envtl.

As shown above, vegetation is only one of several factors that may contribute to an elk security area. Second, the Collaborative Recommendations contains an extensive discussion of elk security, and recommends \"that the local [Montana Department of Fish Wildlife and Parks] and [Forest Service] wildlife biologists work together to define the numerical parameters (i.e. size of area, distance from roads, percentage of analysis unit, etc.) to be used for determining security areas at the local project level.\" CleanUp 003983. Thus the amendment decision involved consideration of elk security and the science underlying elk security. The conclusions an agency draws from the science are within its reasonable discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lands Council\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4129690\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/537/981/#p993\">\n    537 F.3d at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While Plaintiffs are correct to note that elk displacement is a management concern in Montana, that argument addresses broader policy issues. Further, as discussed above, the amended standard does not reduce hiding cover protection. The Forest Service took a hard look at elk security.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs argue the Smith Shields Project fails to analyze the cumulative effects of elk displacement from public lands due to reductions in security \"from excessive roading and eliminating hiding cover,\" and that such cumulative effect precludes a categorical exclusion. (Doc. 13 at 23.) As to the first, the Wildlife Report for the Smith Shields Project concludes the Project will maintain existing elk security areas. SmithShields 002616 (\"Elk security areas were defined in this analysis as those areas that are at least 0.5 mile from an open motorized route or project road and at least 250 acres in size.... The proposed action would not result in reduction in elk security areas.\") Though the Project will involve construction of 6.2 miles of temporary road, that temporary road will occur where existing road densities range from 1.1 to greater than two miles per square mile, SmithShields\n   002616, meaning they will not be constructed in elk security habitat. Thirty-seven percent of the Smith Shields Elk Analysis Unit is elk security habitat (32,246 acres out of 87,107 acres).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 002613. Where elk security areas are not reduced, no cumulative impact on elk security areas can exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   As to hiding cover, the Forest Service analyzed Project effects in part on the basis of elk hiding cover. SmithShields 002616-2617. That analysis \"assumed that all the treatment units will remove hiding cover.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 002616. While Plaintiffs want the Forest Service to analyze elk security as a direct function of hiding cover, they fail to cite scientific support for that assertion. Plaintiffs have not shown significant effects from elk displacement would preempt categorical exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Substantive Changes\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Plaintiffs also direct their attack at Amended Standard 6(c)(2), which they argue significantly reduces wildlife protection by changing the scale over which old growth is measured, requiring an EIS. Defendants rebut that that the amount of old growth maintained remains the same following amendment, and that the Forest Service disclosed effects on associated wildlife species, which do not require an EIS. Defendants again have the better argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Prior to the Clean Up Amendment, Standard 6(c)(2) provided as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   In order to achieve size and age diversity of vegetation, the Forest will strive to develop the following successional stages in timber compartments containing suitable timber:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   ?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   CleanUp 000358.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Following amendment, Standard 6(c)(2) provides: \"Use fire and other management tools to help active vegetation size and age class diversity.

It noted that \"[a]ssessing old growth at other scales may be appropriate in certain situations.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In the Amendment EA, the Forest Service disclosed the effects of the amended standard on old growth and associated wildlife species. CleanUp 000422-26. It concluded that the change \"would not affect wildlife associated old growth forest because the standard still ... maintain[s]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   at least 10% old growth.\" CleanUp 000425. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are wrong when they assert the Forest Service ignored the issue. Plaintiffs also incorrectly assert that the Forest Service dropped pine marten and goshawk as Management Indicator Species. (Doc. 13 at 26.) The amended standard actually retains both species. CleanUp 000422, 000425.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Forest Service's conclusion that an EIS was not necessary was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Smith Shields and Amended Standard 6(c)(2).\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Plaintiffs also attack the Smith Shields Project in terms of Amended Standard 6(c)(2), arguing the Project shows how the amended standard has degraded old growth protection. Plaintiffs' argument seems to be that the change will allow the Forest Service to calculate old growth as a percentage of forested lands instead of as a percentage of total landscape within a timber compartment. But as a matter of logic, the Forest Service can only \"strive to maintain\" old growth where it exists, either in \"timber compartments containing suitable timber\" (old standard) or \"on lands classified as forested at the mountain range scale\" (amended standard). To require the Forest Service strive for 10% old growth across total area would make no sense where there is no indication that the total area is all forested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs claim the Project will degrade old growth habitat. However, the Project proposes no harvest or treatment in old growth or potential old growth stands. SmithShields 001885, 014406. Plaintiffs make much of the Forest Service's decision not to prepare a map of old growth in the Project area, but point to no requirement that a map be used. Further, a Forest Service silviculturist conducted walk-through inspection of each stand, as documented in the Stand Diagnosis reports. SmithShields 001531-674. The Forest Service reasonably concluded the project would not have significant effects.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201508.4\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 1508.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Plaintiffs also claim NEPA and NFMA violations in the Project analysis of pine marten. First, Plaintiffs assert the Forest Service should have considered a 2016 pine marten study, Moriarty\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   But the Forest Service did consider the Moriarty study, SmithShields 0022774, which concerns the Pacific marten, a different species than the American marten that occurs in the Gallatin. SmithShields 002774-2782. It was not unreasonable for the Forest Service to conclude that a study concerning a different species with different habitat was not applicable to the Project. SmithShields 002774.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Next, Plaintiffs somewhat incongruously claim the Forest Service may not use pine marten as a Management Indicator Species because pine marten are absent from the Project area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Native Ecosystems Council v. Tidwell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4222274\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/599/926/#p937\">\n    599 F.3d 926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 937 (9th Cir. 2010) (\"[T]he Forest Service's use of the nonexistent sage grouse as an [Management Indicator Species] to assess the project's impact on all sagebrush species' diversity was flawed.\"). But, while track and camera surveys indicate pine marten are \"relatively rare\" in the Crazy Mountains, pine marten are not absent. SmithShields 002627, 012808.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs assert the Project did not consider the impacts reduction in hiding and thermal cover will have on moose in the Project area. First, because the Project will not treat old growth, and because moose are not an old growth obligate species, SmithShields 001107, the Forest Service reasonably omitted consideration of the effects of old growth treatment upon moose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Next, the Wildlife Report states that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   [m]oose ... populations have experienced fluctuations at local and regional\n   scales, due to a variety of complex ecological factors. The major impact to ... moose under the proposed treatment would be a reduction in hiding and thermal cover. While reduction in cover is not always desirable in the project area, they are occurring anyway due to epidemic levels of insect and disease activity. Proposed treatments are designed to reduce tree mortality from insects and improve overall forest health in the project area. Therefore, we feel that the proposed action, while imparting short-term negative impacts, would benefit ... moose over time by maintaining habitat integrity and providing cover to a higher degree than is expected if no treatments were to occur.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   SmithShields 002642.

Smith Shields Project and HFRA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Plaintiffs claim the Smith Shields Project (1) violates the HFRA old growth retention requirement and (2) violates Gallatin Forest Plan soil standards.

Plaintiffs argue that the Project violates HFRA because it does not requiring maximizing retention of large trees and old growth. However, the Decision Memo states \"[t]he largest and healthiest trees, as appropriate for the forest type, habitat type, and old growth group will be retained to the extent that the trees promote stands that are resilient to insects and disease, fire, and changing climate.\" SmithShields 014434. That requirement is in line with HFRA's old growth mandate. Contrary to Plaintiffs' interpretation, HFRA does not require that all healthy large trees be retained. Instead, the maximization requirement holds to the extent it is \"appropriate for the forest type\" and \"promote[s] stands that are resilient to insects and disease.\" 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6591b(b)(1)(A). Further, the statute calls for the exercise of Forest Service expertise in determining what is appropriate to maximize retention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass'n\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p43\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Plaintiffs again assert the Forest Service \"has done nothing to demonstrate that it is not logging old-growth forest.\" (Doc. 13 at 29.) That is untrue. The Forest Service identified units with possible old growth, and proposes no harvest or treatment in old growth or potential old growth stands. SmithShields 001185. To the extent Plaintiffs argue the Forest Service erred by failing to consider distribution of old growth, they have not shown viability concerns for old growth in the Crazy Mountains or Project area. SmithShields 001185 (Crazy Mountains contain 17% old growth, Forest Plan calls for retaining 10%).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Soil Productivity Standards\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Plaintiffs further claim the Project runs afoul of HFRA by violating the Forest Plan's regional soil standard. The Farm Bill Amendment requires that all projects it authorizes \"be consistent\" with the Forest Plan for the unit of the National Forest System containing the project. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 6591b(e). Plaintiffs note that Unit # 17 in the Project area has a 16% detrimental disturbance, and assert that that percentage violates the Gallatin Forest Plan's 15% disturbance soil standard. But, as Defendants note, the 15% standard comes from the Region 1 Supplement to Forest Service Manual 2250 Soil Management, which is not part of the Forest Plan\n   and therefore cannot provide the basis for a HFRA violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In any event, Unit # 17 actually complies with the 15% disturbance soil standard. The standard requires that, in areas \"where more than 15 percent detrimental soil conditions exist from prior activities,\" further activities not result in further cumulative disturbance. SmithShields 014238. Because analysis of Unit 17 found 16% existing detrimental disturbance,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 001411, the Forest Service eliminated road building from Unit 17 and determined it could only be harvested in winter conditions,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 014404. With those changes, the Forest Service determined the Project would not increase detrimental soil disturbance above the existing 16%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 001411, 001397-98.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Plaintiffs have not shown that (1) the Designation violated NFMA, NEPA, or the ESA (First Claim); (2) the Project threatens Canada lynx in violation of NFMA, NEPA, and the ESA (Second Claim); (3) the Amendment and the Project violate NEPA and NFMA as relates to Amended Standard 6(a)(5) (Third Claim); (4) the Amendment and the Project violate NEPA and NFMA as relates to Amended Standard 6(c)(2) (Fourth Claim); (5) the Project violates HFRA by failing to consider best available science and maximize old growth retention (Fifth Claim); (6) the Project violates NEPA and NFMA by relying on an absent management indicator species (Sixth Claim); or (7) the Project violates NEPA and NFMA by failing to comply with a soil standard (Seventh Claim).
