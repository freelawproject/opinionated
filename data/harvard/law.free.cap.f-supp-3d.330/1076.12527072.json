After their arrivals in Karachi, Khan and his co-conspirators went to the LET office in Lahore and spent time at the LET camp together, where Khan fired an AK-47 rifle, an anti-aircraft gun, and a rocket-propelled grenade at targets, which was a part of the training plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275632\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/789/#p807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   While at the LET camp, Khan learned that Pakistan had closed its border with Afghanistan, that LET would not facilitate his travel to Afghanistan to fight with the Taliban, and that Pakistani authorities were working to remove foreigners from the training camps.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275632\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/789/#p807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As a result, LET required Khan to leave, which he did in December 2001; however, before leaving the camp, he was approached by two men who requested that he \"return to the United States, gather information, and spread propaganda.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9275632\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/309/789/#p807\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Khan's return to the United States, he maintained contact with LET.

With respect to each of the other counts against Khan, the Court either found him not guilty or the count was dismissed on his motion for judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29. As is relevant to the present motion, the Court found that conspiracy to provide material support to LET, conspiracy to supply services to the Taliban, and conspiracy to levy war against the United States were all crimes of violence sufficient to act as predicate offenses to support Counts 11, 24, 25, and 27.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    at 823, 826-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Under this framework, courts were required \"to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in the ordinary case, and to judge whether that abstraction presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). In determining that the ACCA residual clause was unconstitutionally vague, the Court specifically described problems generated by four aspects of this inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   First, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause \"leaves grave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\" because \"assessing 'potential risk' seemingly requires the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently plays out\" but the statute provides no guidance on how to determine what the \"ordinary case\" of a given crime includes.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As examples, the Court explained that it is unclear whether the ordinary case of witness tampering involves offering a witness a bribe or threatening a witness with violence or whether the ordinary case of attempted burglary involves a would-be burglar being confronted by a police officer, security guard, or homeowner or simply a homeowner \"yelling 'Who's there?' from his window, and the burglar's running away.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). The Court further explained that the statute provided no guidance on how to determine which of various potential alternatives represents the ordinary case: \"A statistical analysis of the state reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Second, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause left \"uncertainty about how much risk it takes\" for this ill-defined \"ordinary case\" of a crime \"to qualify as a violent felony.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The indeterminacy of this risk threshold was heightened by the provision's structure, which \"force[d] courts to interpret 'serious potential risk' in light of the four enumerated crimes-burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives,\" which themselves are \"far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Third, the Court observed that the ACCA residual clause did not limit the inquiry to risks posed by even the stylized ordinary defendant's conduct in the commission of the offense but instead forced courts to consider how the aftermath of the ordinary offense might play out. As the Court explained, \"the inclusion of burglary and extortion among the enumerated offenses preceding the residual clause confirms that the court's task also goes beyond evaluating the chances that the physical acts that make up the crime will injure someone\" because the risk of injury in such cases \"arises because the extortionist might engage in violence after making his demand or because the burglar might confront a resident in the home after breaking and entering.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2557\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This lack of a nexus requirement or temporal limitation only heightened the uncertainty involved in evaluating the risks posed by any given offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Lastly, the Court surveyed previous decisions attempting to apply the ACCA residual clause and found that the Supreme Court's \"repeated attempts and repeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause confirm its hopeless indeterminacy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For example, in each of the three cases where the Supreme Court had \"concentrated on the level of risk posed by the crime in question,\" the Court had \"found it necessary to resort to a different ad hoc test to guide [its] inquiry.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These tests included asking whether the risk posed by the crime in question was \"comparable\" to the risk posed by the closest analog among the enumerated offenses, using a statistical report prepared by the Sentencing Commission to analyze the level of risk posed by the crime in question, and relying on a combination of \"common sense\" and statistical evidence to assess the degree of risk posed by the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2558-59\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the fourth Supreme Court case applying the residual clause, the Court had taken \"an entirely different approach,\" asking whether the crime in question resembled the enumerated offenses \"in kind,\" rather than in \"degree[,] of risk posed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, looking beyond its own cases, the Supreme Court acknowledged that the ACCA residual clause had created \"numerous splits among the lower federal courts\" both about \"whether the residual clause covers this or that crime\" and about \"the nature of the inquiry one is supposed to conduct and the kinds of factors one is supposed to consider.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    at 2560\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Taking these factors together, the Supreme Court concluded that the ACCA residual clause was unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In the wake of this decision, the lower federal courts began to split over whether the nearly identical residual clauses in \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 924(c), both of which shared some-but not all-of the features of the ACCA residual clause at issue in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , were also unconstitutionally vague. In\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court resolved this split with respect to \u00a7 16, holding that \u00a7 16(b)\"suffers from the same constitutional defect\" identified in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    138 S.Ct. at 1210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In particular, the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court read\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as relying on two specific features of the ACCA residual clause to find it unconstitutionally vague: \" 'By combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause' violates the guarantees of due process.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n    at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   2558 ). According to the Court, \u00a7 16(b)\"has the same two features ..., combined in the same constitutionally problematic way.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1213. First, as with the ACCA residual clause, \u00a7 16(b) calls for an ordinary-case analysis and, because the \"ordinary case\" of a given crime remains an \"inscrutable thing,\" \u00a7 16(b) does not provide a clear way to measure the risk posed by a given crime. Second, as with the ACCA residual clause, \u00a7 16(b) employs an uncertain risk threshold (\"substantial risk\") that, when applied to \"an idealized ordinary case of the crime[,]... ceases to work in a way consistent with due process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1215-16 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Accordingly, the\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   Court held that \u00a7 16(b) was unconstitutionally vague, and, armed with these two decisions, Khan now contends that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   which is worded almost identically to \u00a7 16(b), is also unconstitutionally vague.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The government argues that consideration of the Motion to Vacate is barred by a variety of procedural obstacles, and also fails on the merits because \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) should be reinterpreted in accordance with principles of constitutional avoidance rather than struck down. Lastly, it argues that under its interpretation of \u00a7 924(c), Khan's predicate offenses remain crimes of violence, and therefore his Motion to Vacate should be dismissed. The Court will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Timeliness Under\n     <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202255\">\n      28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (f)(3)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The government first argues that the Motion to Vacate is untimely. In general, for a motion under \u00a7 2255 to be timely, it must be filed within one year of the date that the movant's conviction became final; however, \"courts will consider a [ \u00a7 2255 ] motion timely if (1) [the movant] relies on a right recognized by the Supreme Court after his judgment became final, (2) he files a motion within one year from 'the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court,' \" and (3) the right has been made retroactively applicable.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Because there is no question that movant's motion was filed more than one year after Khan's conviction became final, the motion is timely only if he is asserting a right that has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review. According to the government, the motion is untimely under this provision because it is based on a \"right regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\" that has not yet been recognized by the Supreme Court. This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit recently explored the question of what it means for\n   a \u00a7 2255 motion to rely on a right recognized by the Supreme Court. There, the movant argued that his sentence, which was imposed pursuant to the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines, was unconstitutional because the relevant guideline range had been enhanced by Brown's designation as a career offender under a provision similar to the ACCA residual clause that was invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   . To support his argument, the movant \"urge[d] th[e] court to cobble together a right by combining\n   <em>\n    Johnson's\n   </em>\n   reasoning with that of two other Supreme Court cases,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Combining the premise from\n   <em>\n    Booker\n   </em>\n   , the reasoning from\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , and the explicit limitation in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   , Brown argued \"that the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines cabined a sentencing judge's discretion in a manner that raises the same concerns animating the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   : denying fair notice to defendants and inviting arbitrary enforcement by judges.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Fourth Circuit rejected Brown's argument and held that he did not appropriately assert a new right that had been recognized by the Supreme Court.

Second,\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   had left open \"the question of whether defendants could challenge sentences imposed under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines as void for vagueness,\" which meant that the Supreme Court had explicitly refused to recognize the right asserted by Brown in\n   <em>\n    Beckles\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, the majority held that Brown's motion was untimely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3) in light of \"the narrow nature of\n   <em>\n    Johnson's\n   </em>\n   binding holding,\" as well as \"\n   <em>\n    Beckles's\n   </em>\n   indication that the position advanced by [Brown] remains an open question in the Supreme Court.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 303.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The government argues that similar logic applies to the Motion to Vacate because \"neither the plurality opinion in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   nor Justice Gorsuch's concurrence said anything about \u00a7 924(c).\" Gov't Opp. 8. Indeed, the only mention of \u00a7 924(c) in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   came in Chief Justice Roberts's dissent, which recognized that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \u00a7 16 serves as the universal definition of \"crime of violence\" for all of Title 18 of the United States Code.

Moreover, the government observes that\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   did not hold that language like that in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) requires a categorical approach rather than a conduct-specific approach and argues that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is distinguishable from \u00a7 16(b) because, as is discussed below, \"the government now contends\" that \"the better reading of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is under a conduct-specific\" approach. Gov't Opp. 9. Accordingly, the government argues that \"\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   does not, by itself, entitle [Khan] to relief\" and that any \"reliance on\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   in this context would have to turn on the purported similarity between \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) and \u00a7 16(b),\" which analogical reasoning is \"foreclose[d]\" by\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To the contrary, under the logic of\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   , Khan's motion is timely.

Unlike Brown's \u00a7 2255 motion, Khan's motion relies on a simple application of the rule announced in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   to the nearly identical provision in \u00a7 924(c), which the Fourth Circuit has traditionally interpreted in tandem with \u00a7 16(b).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Hubbard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325250\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/825/225/\">\n    825 F.3d 225\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 230 n.3 (4th Cir. 2016) (\"We note, however, that the language of \u00a7 16(b) is identical to that in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), and we have previously treated precedent respecting one as controlling analysis of the other.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, when\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   was decided, the Fourth Circuit interpreted\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   as a \"narrow\" decision that applied only to the context of the ACCA and not to other residual clauses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264309\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/297/#p301\">\n    868 F.3d at 302-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Khan asserts that the residual clause of \u00a7 924(c), under which he was convicted, is unconstitutionally vague because it includes both an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk threshold. Accordingly, the Motion to Vacate asserts a right under\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   and is timely under \u00a7 2255(f)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, contrary to what the government appears to argue, the Motion to Vacate is not rendered untimely merely because the government has a reasonable argument that, as a matter of constitutional avoidance, \u00a7 924(c) should be reinterpreted to dispense with the ordinary-case requirement\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the motion should be denied on the merits.

As such, the government argues that Khan cannot challenge \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as void for vagueness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Whatever merit the government's argument may have in other contexts,\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   foreclose its application here for three reasons. First, in both cases, the Supreme Court did not engage in any discussion of whether Johnson's or Dimaya's specific underlying offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   fell within the\n   \"core\" of the statute but instead allowed Johnson and Dimaya to bring their facial constitutional challenges without any regard to the relationship between their specific offenses and the residual clause in question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the Supreme Court has at least implicitly rejected the idea that only individuals whose underlying offenses are not at the \"core\" of the residual clause may bring a facial vagueness challenge to the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, in both cases, the Supreme Court did not interpret the residual clause in question narrowly to allow it to apply constitutionally to a \"core\" group of offenses. Instead, the Court held that the entire residual clause is void for vagueness and, therefore, is wholly unenforceable. This categorical holding suggests that, at least with respect to statutes that share the problematic features of the residual clauses in \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(e), the appropriate mode of analysis focuses on the vagueness of the statute as a whole rather than on whether any specific offense clearly falls within its ambit. Because the Court must analyze the clause as a whole and Khan was convicted under \u00a7 924(c), he has standing to bring his constitutional challenge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Lastly, even if the government were correct that Khan would only have standing to challenge the constitutionality of the residual clause if his conduct fell outside of the \"core\" of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), Khan's motion could still proceed. As is discussed below, Khan's specific conduct did not involve \"a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in committing the offense,\" which means that his actual conduct was not within the \"core\" group of conduct encompassed by the statute and Khan may challenge\n   the constitutionality of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     Analysis Under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The government next argues that Khan's \u00a7 924(c) convictions should not be vacated because his three predicate crimes-conspiracy to provide material support to LET, conspiracy to supply services to the Taliban, and conspiracy to levy war against the United States-all qualify as crimes of violence under the force clause, \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), the constitutionality of which is not called into question by\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   . Under the force clause, any felony offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\" is a \"crime of violence.\" According to the government, Khan's predicate offenses fall under this clause because \"[o]ne definition of 'threaten' is 'to give signs or warning of,' or 'to portend,' \" and when two or more people engage in an agreement to provide material support or services to a foreign terrorist organization or to make war against the United States, \"that agreement, without more, 'portends' the use of force, because the existence of the conspiracy makes the occurrence of the conspiracy's object far more likely.\" Gov't Mem. 14. This argument is unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As is obvious from the plain language of the force clause, analyzing whether a particular offense falls within its ambit requires the Court to focus on \"the statutory definition of the offense.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, although one way to define \"to threaten\" may be \"to portend\" (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , \"the clouds threatened rain\"),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   \"Threaten,\"\n   <em>\n    American Heritage College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   (3d ed. 2000), it is clear from the context of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) that this is not the sense in which Congress used the word in the force clause. Instead, a \"threatened\" use of force involves a situation where a defendant's \"conduct and words were calculated to create the impression\" that the defendant may imminently use force.\n   <em>\n    United States v. Jones\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542455\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/624/#p625\">\n    932 F.2d 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 625 (7th Cir. 1991) (cited in\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The claimed predicate offenses here clearly do not have as an element any such \"threatened use\" of force. Second, the government's interpretation of \"threaten\" raises its own constitutional problems. As the Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   , one of the predominant features of the ACCA residual clause that gave rise to its unconstitutional indeterminacy was that it did not limit the risk-of-force analysis to the conduct surrounding the elements of the crime but instead required courts to \"imagine\" how a stylized version \"of the crime subsequently plays out.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12591035\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2551/\">\n    135 S.Ct. at 2557-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government's proposed definition of \"threaten\" falls into the same trap, asking the Court to determine whether a violation of one of the predicate offenses necessarily leads to a sequence of events that \"portends\" the use of force at some indeterminate point in the future. As\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   made clear, the Court must reject such an invitation. Third, even if the government's definitions of \"threaten\" and \"portend\" were correct, the inchoate nature of the conspiracy offenses at issue here would still not necessarily \"portend\" the use of force by the defendant. Because no more than an agreement to engage in the relevant conduct is required to establish a violation of any of the predicate offense statutes, even if the defendant does not pursue the agreement any further or engage in any overt act in furtherance of the agreement, it is possible for a defendant to commit each predicate offense without in any way \"portending\" the future use of force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Accordingly, it is clear that none of the claimed conspiracy predicate offenses involved in this case \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3)(A), and therefore none of the predicate offenses qualifies as a crime of violence under the force clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n    <em>\n     Analysis Under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B)\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The government's final argument is that the Court should reinterpret the residual clause to avoid the constitutional problems identified by\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and that under this reinterpretation, defendant's predicate offenses qualify as crimes of violence.

In view of the \"serious constitutional questions\" raised about the ordinary-case approach in light of\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   , the government urges the Court to \"construe Section 924(c)(3)(B) to require that the classification of an offense as a 'crime of violence' under that provision be based on the defendant's actual conduct in that case,\" and not on the ordinary-case requirement.

In this case, there are, as discussed above, serious constitutional problems with \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) if the ordinary-case approach is used to determine whether the predicate offense qualifies as a crime of violence. Accordingly, this Court's task is not to determine whether \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is better read to incorporate the ordinary-case approach or the conduct-specific approach. Instead, the Court must determine\n   whether it is \"fairly possible\" to construe \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as implementing the conduct-specific approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Turning to the text of the residual clause, this provision defines a \"crime of violence\" as any \"offense that is a felony\" and \"that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\" Based on this definition, the critical word to interpret is \"offense,\" and where the government and movant disagree is about whether the word \"offense\" can fairly be read to refer to the specific criminal act committed by a defendant rather than to the generic crime for which he was convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court has already provided at least a preliminary answer to this debate. According to the Court, \"in ordinary speech words such as 'crime,' 'felony,' 'offense,' and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime, say, the crime of fraud or theft in general, and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion, say,\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   fraud that the defendant planned and\n   executed last month.\"\n   <em>\n    Nijhawan v.

This conclusion is especially appropriate considering the significant difference between a statute like \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), which criminalizes specific conduct, and statutes such as the ACCA residual clause and \u00a7 16(b) as incorporated into the INA, which determine the impact of previous convictions (many of which may involve state law) on later, separate proceedings such as federal sentencing proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   and removal proceedings in\n   <em>\n    Dimaya\n   </em>\n   .

Moreover, when a defendant in a \u00a7 924(c) case elects to proceed to trial, both the predicate \"crime of violence\" and the \u00a7 924(c) offense are before the fact-finder, which can evaluate the underlying conduct and make a determination about whether that specific conduct involved the use of force or by its nature presented a substantial risk that the defendant would use force against the person or property of another in the course of committing the predicate offense.

This conclusion is reinforced by the absence of the practical and constitutional problems that concerned the previous courts interpreting the residual clauses in \u00a7 924(e) and \u00a7 16(b). Accordingly, the Court interprets \u00a7 924(c) in relevant part to apply to the use or carrying of a firearm during and in relation to, or the possession of a firearm in furtherance of, the defendant's commission of any federal crime where the defendant's actual conduct, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Turning to the question of whether Khan's specific conduct in committing the claimed predicate offenses meets this standard, the government's entire argument on this point is: \"In this particular case, the better interpretation of\n   Section 924(c)(3)(B) would be to permit this Court to consider Khan's own real-world conduct in determining whether his offenses qualified as crimes of violence. Based on the facts that this Court found 14 years ago, his offenses surely did.\" Gov't Opp. 27.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Having reviewed the record, the Court disagrees. The primary conduct underlying Khan's convictions on Counts 2, 4, and 5 involved his participation in various discussions and meetings with individuals connected to the Center; his trip to Pakistan to train in the LET camps, where he engaged in weapons training and military drills, including as part of that training firing an AK-47 rifle, a 12 mm anti-aircraft gun, and a rocket-propelled grenade at targets, but did not, as far as the Court is aware, travel to the front lines or engage in active fire; and his contact with Pal Singh to whom he sent an airplane control module and a compatible wireless video system. Although all these various activities occurred at the periphery of-and, in some cases, with the intent to support-violent actions undertaken by others, including co-conspirators and LET members, there is insufficient evidence in this record that these actions involved either Khan's actual use of force or a substantial risk that Khan would use force.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on the evidence introduced at trial, the government has not shown that Khan, for example, traveled to the front lines or any area of active combat, discharged a firearm in any context other than target practice, or in any respect used force against the person or property of another. Accordingly, the Court finds that Khan's convictions on Counts 2, 4, and 5 do not constitute crimes of violence under either \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) or \u00a7 924(o).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   III.

The plain language of this provision requires the Court to determine both whether the Supreme Court case in question \"initially recognized\" a right and also whether the movant \"assert[s]\" this right. The government's argument improperly mixes these two inquiries because the premise refers to the first inquiry and the conclusion to the second. Although the\n    <em>\n     Teague\n    </em>\n    framework is appropriately applied to determine whether a particular case \"newly\" recognizes a given right or merely applies a right that was recognized in an earlier case, it is not the appropriate test for determining whether a given \u00a7 2255 motion is asserting a particular right.

As discussed above, this Court must determine not what the most natural interpretation of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is but instead whether it is \"fairly possible\" to interpret \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as employing the conduct-specific approach.\n    <em>\n     St. Cyr\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p299\">\n     533 U.S. at 300\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313153\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/289/#p299\">\n     121 S.Ct. 2271\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (internal quotation marks omitted).

Accordingly, although Justices Thomas, Kennedy, and Alito, in dissent, argued that the Court should abandon the ordinary-case approach with respect to \u00a7 16(b),\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     at 1252\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Thomas, J., dissenting), a majority of the Court declined to do so, at least in part because the argument had not been presented to the Court,\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12610616\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1204/\">\n     at 1217\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (plurality opinion) (\"[T]he Government once again has not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.

In addition, as discussed below, applying the conduct-specific approach in the context at issue in\n    <em>\n     Dimaya\n    </em>\n    would have raised practical and constitutional problems, which further reinforced the majority's view that it would be improper to abandon the ordinary-case approach in that case; however, these same concerns are not present in the context of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).
