BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Over a decade ago, Defendant Internal Revenue Service determined that Plaintiffs Thomas and Beth Montgomery were involved in a multi-billion-dollar tax-shelter scheme. Suspecting that an insider had blown the whistle on their sham partnerships, the couple requested several categories of IRS records under the Freedom of Information Act. After coming up short, Plaintiffs filed this action asserting causes of action under FOIA and the Administrative Procedure Act. In this second round of briefing, each party seeks summary judgment on both counts. Finding merit on each side, the Court will grant in part and deny in part both Motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Like some FOIA cases, this dispute stretches back much farther than the records requests at issue. The Court detailed the underlying saga between these two parties in a prior Opinion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v. IRS\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n    292 F.Supp.3d 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 393-94 (D.D.C. 2018), but provides a brief recap here. In the early aughts, Thomas Montgomery formed several partnerships, from which he and his wife as joint-filer recorded losses on their individual tax returns. A few years later, the IRS became suspicious of these entities because they were reporting tax losses without experiencing any real economic loss. After an investigation, they were eventually deemed shams, meaning that the Montgomerys were retroactively disallowed from taking the losses from the partnerships on their individual returns and owed payments for tax, penalties, and interest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In thirteen separate federal suits in Texas, Plaintiffs and the partnerships petitioned the Government for, respectively, tax refunds and readjustment of partnership income. Before all of these actions could be judicially resolved, the Montgomerys and the IRS entered into a global settlement agreement, promising to \"fully and finally resolve all ongoing disputes between [them] related to\" the partnerships.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n    at 394\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although one might believe that would have ended the matter, Plaintiffs were not yet finished. Having settled the tax issues, they then turned their attention to figuring out how they had crossed the IRS's path to begin with. To that end, they each submitted FOIA requests for twelve types of records. Requests 1 through 5 solicited various IRS forms used in connection with a whistleblower, and 6 through 12 requested lists, documents, or correspondence between the IRS and any third party regarding Plaintiffs' potential tax liability or partnership transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint, \u00b6 16. The Service rejoined that it had \"found no documents specifically responsive\n   to [the] request[s] in response to the items 6 through 12\" and claimed that FOIA Exemption 7(D) \"exempts the disclosure of records\" sought in items 1 through 5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12523575\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/292/391/#p393\">\n    ,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Exh.

First, they contend that it is estopped from relying on the doctrine because a prior court held that there was no informant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 6. In addition, they posit that because the Government previously admitted the contrary during the administrative process, it has waived any reliance on\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   . The Court looks at both issues and then moves to the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   a. Estoppel\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Montgomerys first argue that the IRS is estopped from invoking\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   for their requests regarding a confidential informant because in prior litigation the Service asserted - and a court found - that there was no informant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Opp. at 14-15. Yet, as even the Montgomerys admit, the existence of records and the existence of an informant are not the same thing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl. Reply at 7 (\"[I]t is entirely possible that responsive records exist and yet there was no confidential source relied upon previously by Defendant.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The requested forms include: 1) 211, Application for Award for Original Information;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2) 211A, State or Local Law Enforcement Application for Reimbursement for Original Information; 3) 3949-A, Information Referral; 4) 11369, Confidential Evaluation Report on Claim for Award; and 5) 13976, Itemized Statement Component of Advisee List. With the exception of Form 11369, these forms are all generated by people outside of the IRS, meaning they provide no conclusive evidence as to whether Defendant\n   <em>\n    relied\n   </em>\n   upon a confidential informant. For example, someone could submit a Form 211 about a taxpayer that, upon investigation, proves inaccurate or unworthy of follow-up. Similarly, the form could be submitted for a taxpayer already on the IRS's radar, possibly rendering the whistleblower superfluous. Although in both cases no award would be issued and the applicant would not become a confidential informant, the\n   <em>\n    record\n   </em>\n   of the form would nonetheless exist. The forms requested by the Montgomerys, therefore, would only provide information as to whether someone\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   to become a confidential informant, not whether anyone ever actually fulfilled that role. Plaintiffs' estoppel argument thus fails because it is tethered to prior statements that there was no confidential informant, but that does not mean that no records exist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   b. Official Acknowledgment\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs fare no better on their next contention that the Service waived a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response by officially acknowledging that records do exist. While it is true that a plaintiff \"can overcome a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response by showing that the agency has already disclosed the fact of the existence (or nonexistence) of responsive records,\" to do so he must \"point[ ] to specific information in the public domain that appears to duplicate that being withheld.\"\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

Reply at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Although the Court finds the Service's error unfortunate, it does not amount to an official acknowledgement. It would be draconian to penalize the Government in a sensitive matter concerning a potential informant by refusing to permit some leeway for an honest mistake. In addition, the administrative letter merely noted that Exemption 7(D) \"is applicable in this matter.\" Compl., Exh. H at 3. Even if the Court were to find that the letter acknowledged the existence of\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   records, its reference to \"withheld\" or \"exempted\" material does not specify which of the five requests it refers to and thus does not rise to the level of an official acknowledgement. Simply put, Defendant's careless phrasing does not \"match the information\" requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.

In other words, because a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response is meant to\n   <em>\n    obscure\n   </em>\n   the very existence of the source (or attempted source), the Government cannot offer any public statement concerning the confidentiality assurances given to that source (or a statement that no source exists). As the Service persuasively argues, even though the identity of an informant may not be at risk in\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   case, to protect whistleblowers in cases where disclosure of the existence of records could lead to their identification, it\n   must assert\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   whenever an informant is involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   For example, in a situation where there is only one suspected whistleblower, the Service's affirmative or negative response to a request for certain forms would either confirm or refute the suspicion. Either the documents exist, in which case the identity of the informant could be apparent even if the IRS does not release anything, or they do not. Even though the\n   <em>\n    non-existence\n   </em>\n   of records does not implicate a harm cognizable under Exemption 7(D), the IRS can only protect against the damage that confirming such records would engender by asserting\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   in all situations. This is also true in circumstances where there is someone who attempted to be a source but whose information was ultimately not utilized, as discussed above in the Estoppel section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   That does not mean, however, that Defendant can categorically refuse a FOIA request for all forms related to a confidential or prospective informant without any judicial review. Rather, it must \"publicly explain[ ] to the extent it can why\" the exemption is applicable and \"then rely[ ] on\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   judicial review to confirm its conclusions.\"\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n    642 F.3d at 1185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
