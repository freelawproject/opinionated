Def.'s Opp. to Pl.'s Mot. [Dkt. # 9] (\"Def.'s Opp.\") at 1, 7-18. But the union maintains that the determination of whether the parties have engaged in good faith negotiations is itself a question that must be decided by an arbitrator, and not by the Court, under the terms of the Agreement.

Okla. Dec. 27, 2012) (holding that an arbitrator must decide whether the defendant had \"satisfied or waived any procedural preconditions to arbitration,\" including the requirement that the parties seek to resolve their disputes through \"good faith negotiation\" before engaging in arbitration or litigation).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In an effort to avoid the application of these principles, defendant attempts to\n   characterize the good faith negotiation requirement in the MOU as a substantive limit on topics subject to arbitration, instead of a procedural precondition to arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp. at 15. According to Liberty, the good faith negotiation provision establishes the \"scope\" of the parties' agreement to arbitrate: that is, the arbitration clause is limited to those reopener disputes that have been first narrowed through the parties' good faith bargaining efforts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11.

There is no dispute that the parties have agreed to arbitrate wage reopener issues. And defendant has already admitted that the good faith negotiation requirement is merely a \"precondition\" to arbitrating those issues.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Opp. at 15 (\"[T]he good faith bargaining requirement is the\n   <em>\n    essential precondition\n   </em>\n   to the parties' agreement to arbitrate anything related to the reopener negotiations.\") (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7 (\"[T]he Union has not satisfied the condition precedent to having an arbitrator decide the wages and benefits Liberty Maritime will pay its employees.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\"Here, the terms of the MOU arbitration provision require the Union to have first engaged in good faith bargaining as the condition precedent to interest arbitration ....\").

The Court also noted that since the treaty provided that only an arbitral determination - and not any local court decision - would be final and binding on the parties, the requirement to await a local court ruling was a \"purely procedural requirement - a claims processing rule that governs when the arbitration may begin, but not whether it may occur or what its substantive outcome will be on the issues in dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-36,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12578340,12706990\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/134/1198/\">\n    134 S.Ct. 1198\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similarly, here, defendant states in its opposition that in crafting the arbitration provision, \"the Union and Liberty Maritime exercised 'their power to specify' the\n   <em>\n    time\n   </em>\n   at which 'their obligation to arbitrate' would arise, as well as the 'clear condition' that triggers the obligation - namely, following bargaining in good faith.\" Def.'s Opp. at 12 (emphasis added);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 15 (\"The parties crafted the MOU arbitration provision to restrict arbitration to only the circumstances where both parties\n   <em>\n    first\n   </em>\n   have bargained in good faith ....\") (emphasis added). And the arbitration provision provides that \"[t]he arbitrator's decision will be final and binding on the parties,\" MOU \u00a7 3(g), which is a further indication of the procedural nature of the good faith negotiation requirement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Ultimately, defendant does not point to any evidence to indicate that the parties intended to have a court, and not an arbitrator, determine whether the good faith negotiation requirement has been satisfied.

Then, the Court had to determine whether the Court or an arbitrator must decide whether the procedural prerequisites to arbitration had been met.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     at 544, 555-58\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     84 S.Ct. 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The collective bargaining agreement provided for arbitration after a three-step grievance procedure: the first two steps involved conferences between the employee, the union, the employer, and other personnel of those entities, and the third step called for arbitration \"in the event that the grievance shall not have been resolved or settled\" after the second step.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     at 555-56\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     84 S.Ct. 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The plaintiff argued that since the first two steps had not been followed, no duty to arbitrate had arisen.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-69\">\n    The Court held that this question was best left for the arbitrator in order to avoid duplicative efforts by courts and arbitrators.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     at 558\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n     84 S.Ct. 909\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

The Court emphasized that \"[i]t would be a curious rule which required that intertwined issues of 'substance' and 'procedure' growing out of a single dispute and raising the same questions on the same facts had to be carved up between two different forums, one deciding after the other.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"379388\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/376/543/#p546\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    Liberty attempts to distinguish this case from the\n    <em>\n     John Wiley\n    </em>\n    decision on the grounds that the policy considerations underlying the case are not implicated here. It argues that the parties did not agree to arbitrate the issue of whether the parties have complied with the good faith negotiation requirement, and that there is no need for an arbitrator to deal with this question because \"there is no overlap between the predicate good faith bargaining obligation and the ultimate merits of the parties' dispute.\" Def.'s Opp. at 8-9, 11-12, 15-16. However, a decision concerning whether the parties did indeed bargain in good faith may rest in part on evaluating the substance of the parties' various proposals to one another, and this analysis bears on the merits of the dispute over the appropriate wage and economic benefits to be negotiated under the collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the reasoning underlying the\n    <em>\n     John Wiley\n    </em>\n    decision is equally applicable here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    The Agreement does not appear to contain a provision for the award of attorneys' fees, and the Labor Management Relations Act does not expressly authorize the award of attorneys' fees.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Nat'l Ass'n of Letter Carriers, AFL-CIO v.
