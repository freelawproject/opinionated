Plaintiff contends that Kialegee \"has set forth the actions of Defendants, explained why it violates that law and how this has deprived and harmed Kialegee - that is, Defendants expressly refuse to acknowledge that Kialegee has jurisdiction over its lands as a successor to the historic Creek Nation.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 18-19. Plaintiff argues further that it \"need not plead this with specificity, as under Rule 9(b), rather, Kialegee's Amended Complaint need only comport with the notice-pleading requirements of Rule 8\" and it has done this by putting \"Defendants on notice of what Kialegee alleges to be wrong and its recourse sought for the same[,]\" in part by referencing a letter in which the rights of other Creek successors are acknowledged, where such letter includes \"findings from Defendant the Department of Interior.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Plaintiff indicates that it has constructed a restaurant facility known as the Embers Grill, which is located on an Indian allotment within the Creek Reservation and within the city limits of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, and Plaintiff claims jurisdiction over this land, in common with the other recognized Creek tribes in Oklahoma and pursuant to \"various Creek\n   Treaties with the United States read in context with the Indian Canon of Construction.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. Plaintiff asserts also that \"Defendants have repeatedly violated 25 U.S.C. Section [5123](f) by blocking the Kialegee from jurisdiction on lands located within the Creek Reservation,\" but this general assertion fails to state a claim that supports Plaintiff's request for declaratory and injunctive relief. What is missing from the Amended Complaint is any connection between Plaintiff's claim to jurisdiction over the land where the restaurant facility is located, and any actions taken by Defendant in response to such claim of jurisdiction, which violate Section 5123, or alternatively, any other actions taken by the Defendant that violate Section 5123, which are actionable by the Plaintiff. More succinctly, Plaintiff's Amended Complaint fails to provide this Court with any information about how and when the Defendants have \"block[ed] the Kialegee from jurisdiction\" over land with the effect that the Kialegee's privileges and immunities have been diminished relative to other federally recognized tribes. Plaintiff's allegations against Defendants - presumably relating to its cause of action pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Section 5123 - are fleshed out in somewhat more detail in the context of the briefing on Defendants' Motion to Dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In its Opposition, Plaintiff refers to three specific instances where Defendants have failed to recognize Kialegee as a Creek successor having jurisdiction over its lands: (1) a pending appeal before the Indian Board of Indian Appeals (\"IBIA\") of an April 26, 2017 decision by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Eastern Oklahoma Regional Director, declining to approve a resolution of the Kialegee Tribal Town Business Committee on grounds that Kialegee lacks jurisdiction over any area of Indian Country over which it could enact and apply a liquor ordinance; (2) a 1991 IBIA decision captioned\n   <em>\n    Kialegee Tribal Town of Oklahoma v. Muskogee Area Dir., Bureau of Indian Affairs\n   </em>\n   , 19 IBIA 296, 303 (1991), upholding a decision by the Regional Director that Plaintiff did not exercise jurisdiction over the Muscogee (Creek) Nation lands; and (3) a May 24, 2012 Memorandum regarding review by the National Indian Gaming Commission (\"NIGC\") of a proposed gaming facility in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma (the \"proposed Site\"), which concludes that the facility \"does not qualify as Kialegee's Indian lands eligible for gaming because Kialegee has not established that it has legal jurisdiction over the Proposed Site for purposes of [the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act],\" and expressly stating that \"the Department of the Interior (DOI), Office of the Solicitor, concurs with this opinion.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 19-21;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   May 24, 2012 Memorandum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In their Reply, Defendants explain why none of these three instances is currently actionable by the Plaintiff, for the following reasons: (1) the Regional Director's April 26, 2017 decision is on appeal before the IBIA, and Plaintiff must exhaust its administrative remedies before seeking a judicial review of that decision;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) any challenge to the 1991 decision is untimely because, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 2401(a), a civil action against the United\n   States is barred if not filed within six years after the right of action accrues; and (3) the May 24, 2012 Memorandum is not an agency action for which Plaintiff may seek judicial review as it does not constitute a \"final agency action\" pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Section 2714, nor has Plaintiff demonstrated how the 2012 Memorandum \"violates the IRA in any way.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Defs.' Reply at 5-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   This Court agrees with the Federal Defendants' analysis of these three \"instances,\" and as such, finds that while the Plaintiff has alleged that it has a cause of action pursuant to 25 U.S.C. Section 5123, Plaintiff has not indicated any conduct by Federal Defendants that is actionable under this cause of action. A claim is facially plausible when the plaintiff pleads factual content that is more than \" 'merely consistent with' a defendant's liability,\" which \"allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.\"\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p678\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    550 U.S. at 556-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p557\">\n    127 S.Ct. 1955\n   </extracted-citation>\n   );\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rudder v.

In the instant case, Plaintiff alleged initially a more specific claim against the Federal Defendants (and then-defendant NIGC), based on the development of the Bruner allotment and its jurisdiction over that land, but because that claim was not yet ripe, Plaintiff amended its Complaint, with the effect that its claim against the Federal Defendants was made more general. It is not enough for Plaintiff to simply claim that a statute has been violated, which affects Plaintiff in a negative way, and to make conclusory statements regarding Federal Defendants' position. Instead, Plaintiff needs to allege with some specificity the actions allegedly taken by Federal Defendants, which give rise to Plaintiff's cause of action.
