The plaintiff class purchased common stock of ReWalk Robotics, Ltd. between September 12, 2014 (the date of its initial public offering (\"IPO\") ) and February 29, 2016. The consolidated amended complaint alleges that ReWalk, its officers and directors, and the IPO underwriters concealed material information in its IPO registration statement about ReWalk's failure to comply with FDA regulations, in violation of the Securities Act. It also alleges that after the IPO, ReWalk and certain officers continued to make material false statements after the initial offering, in violation of the Exchange Act. It relies in part on statements by three former ReWalk employees acting as confidential witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 78u-4, 78u-5. Defendants contend that the complaint fails to set forth a Securities Act violation because it does not identify a misleading statement or omission in the registration statement. They also argue that the complaint fails to set forth an Exchange Act violation because the lead plaintiff lacks standing and the information allegedly omitted was not material and was in fact disclosed. In addition, they contend that the complaint fails to allege specific facts that give rise to a strong inference of scienter and that it fails to plead loss causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Because the complaint here fails to identify a false or misleading statement in the registration statement, to the extent it alleges violations of the Securities Act, it will be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The claims under the Exchange Act, however, present different issues. As a threshold matter, the lead plaintiff in this case, Wang Yan, purchased shares only in September 2014, at the time of the initial public offering; he can therefore assert claims personally only under the Securities Act. Under normal circumstances, he would not have standing to assert claims under the Exchange Act, and those claims would accordingly be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This case, however, is subject to the requirements of the PSLRA. That statute requires the appointment of a lead plaintiff, who may not be the party who actually filed the complaint (as here), but who normally has the largest financial interest in the litigation. Under some circumstances, courts have permitted lead plaintiffs appointed under the PSLRA to assert claims as to which they have no personal stake (and, therefore, would not have standing under a traditional legal framework).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The complicating factor here is that the lead plaintiff, Yan, has\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   valid claims remaining after dismissal of the Securities Act claims. Because standing has a constitutional dimension, in addition to the requirements\n   of the PSLRA, it is at least somewhat unclear whether Yan can continue to act as lead plaintiff. Under the circumstances, and because the parties have not briefed or otherwise addressed the issue, the Court will not address the Exchange Act claims at this time. Instead, plaintiffs will be given an opportunity to persuade the Court that Yan remains an appropriate plaintiff; to seek the appointment of a substitute or supplemental lead plaintiff; or to take such other steps as they believe may be proper under the circumstances. In the meantime, the Court will grant the motion to dismiss as to the Securities Act claims, and deny it as to the Exchange Act claims without prejudice to its renewal once the standing issue has been resolved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Accordingly, and for the reasons set forth below, defendants' motion to dismiss will be granted in part as to Counts One and Two, and denied in part without prejudice as to Counts Three and Four.\n  </p>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-15\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n     <em>\n      Background\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      Factual Background\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-17\">\n    The facts are set forth as described in the consolidated amended complaint.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    <strong>\n     1.\n     <em>\n      Overview\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Defendant ReWalk Robotics, Ltd., formerly known as Argo Medical Technologies, Inc., is a medical device company. It designs and develops exoskeletons, which are devices that help persons with spinal-cord injuries walk. (CAC \u00b6 2). The company is incorporated in Israel and has its U.S. headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 26). It was founded by Amit Goffer, who served as CEO and Chief Technical Officer from 2001 until 2012. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 30). Goffer resigned from the company on November 18, 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    At the time of its IPO in September 2014, ReWalk's CEO was Larry Jasinski and its CFO was Ami Kraft. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 27, 29). Hadar Ron, Jeff Dykan, Asaf Shinar, Wayne Weisman, Yasushi Ichiki, Glenn Muir, and Aryeh Dan were all members of ReWalk's Board of Directors. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 31-37). In January 2015, Kevin Hershberger replaced Kraft as CFO. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 28).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    ReWalk currently sells two distinct products: ReWalk Personal, which is designed for everyday use, and ReWalk Rehabilitation, which is designed for clinical rehabilitation centers. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 46). Both devices are regulated in various jurisdictions by the FDA, the European Union, or other governmental agencies. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 94). This litigation concerns only the ReWalk Personal device, which the Court will refer to as the \"device.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-22\">\n    In 2014, ReWalk submitted the device to the FDA for \"de novo\" classification. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 47). \"De novo\" classification allows manufacturers to market devices that are low to moderate risk and not substantially similar to devices that are already being marketed. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    On June 26, 2014, the FDA approved the ReWalk device for marketing. It designated the ReWalk device \"Class II,\" requiring special controls. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 48-49).\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    The FDA\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    also ordered the company to conduct a \"post-market surveillance\" study to determine the product's risks, as required by Section 522 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 4, 48-49; 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 360L(a)(1)(A) ). FDA regulations require manufacturers to report results of such studies, including important attributes such as the type of test subjects, methodology, data collection plan, and patient follow-up. 21 C.F.R. 822.10. The FDA required the study due to concerns that a malfunction could result in serious injury or death. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 4, 49).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    The complaint alleges that defendants failed to disclose that ReWalk was either unprepared or unable to comply with the FDA's June 2014 directive that it perform post-market surveillance. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 16, 68).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    Prior to the IPO, ReWalk filed a registration statement with the SEC, stating that it had developed a \"breakthrough product\" that would \"deliver a natural gait and functional walking speed.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 90). The complaint alleges that the registration statement failed to disclose that the reason the FDA ordered the company to conduct a post-market surveillance study was that the ReWalk device posed a threat of serious injury or death. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 85-95).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    The initial public offering of ReWalk occurred on September 12, 2014. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 5). The company issued 3 million shares of common stock. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The IPO was underwritten by defendants Barclays Capital Inc., Jefferies LLC, and Canaccord Genuity Inc. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 38-40). Lead plaintiff Wang Yan purchased 3,600 shares of ReWalk in September 2014, shortly after the IPO. (Docket No. 7, Ex. C).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-28\">\n    Two weeks after the IPO, on September 29, 2014, the FDA contacted ReWalk to inform the company that its proposed post-market surveillance study was deficient. (CAC \u00b6 7). Notably, the FDA's letter stated that although the plan was deficient, because less than six months had elapsed since the issuance of the 522 order, the study status would be marked as \"Plan Pending\" on the FDA's website. (Feldman Decl. Ex. F at 3). The FDA granted ReWalk 30 days to file a response, which it failed to do in a timely fashion. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 7-8). ReWalk eventually filed a response on November 6, 2014. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 8). On February 13, 2015, the FDA found that the November 6 submission was also deficient. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The FDA granted ReWalk another 30 days to file a further response, and ReWalk responded (late) on May 22, 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8-10). ReWalk stated that it wanted to discuss an issue with the FDA before submitting a formal reply to the February 13 letter. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 10).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    According to the complaint, during that time, ReWalk officials held quarterly earnings calls, during which they failed to disclose the company's failure to comply with the FDA's requirement. Specifically, those calls were made on February 12, 2015 (Q4 2014), May 7, 2015 (Q1 2015), August 6, 2015 (Q2 2015), November 11, 2015 (Q3 2015), and February 25, 2016 (Q4 2015). (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 99-110).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    On September 5, 2015, the FDA cautioned ReWalk that it still had not submitted a revised study plan addressing the deficiencies previously identified by the agency. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 13). Having received no response, on September 30, 2015, the FDA issued a warning letter outlining the company's substantial failure to comply with the post-market surveillance requirement. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 14). Specifically, the letter stated that under the 522 order, ReWalk was required to begin its surveillance study \"not later than 15 months after the day on which [a 522 order] is issued.\" (Pl. Ex. C at 2). The 15-month time frame had closed on September 28, 2015. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The letter went\n    on to state that ReWalk had \"committed a prohibited act under section 301(q)(1)(C) of the [Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]\" and that the ReWalk device was \"currently misbranded.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The letter was eventually disclosed to the public by the FDA on March 1, 2016. (CAC \u00b6 18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    ReWalk's closing stock price the day before the FDA released the letter was $10.48. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 19). The closing price the following day, on March 1, 2016, was $9.07, reflecting a 13% decline in value. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The stock price has steadily declined since, and ReWalk shares are currently trading at around $0.75 to $1.25.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    At the end of March 2016, the FDA exercised its enforcement discretion and allowed ReWalk to continue to market its device, provided that it would initiate the post-market surveillance study by June 1, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 114). The FDA approved ReWalk's proposed protocol for the study on May 5, 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 115). However, ReWalk did not file timely monthly reports to the FDA in June and July 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 116). Although the approved protocol required 60 subjects from twelve U.S. clinical areas, according to CW-3, ReWalk had only recruited eight subjects from three areas by June 2017. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 117-18).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    <strong>\n     2.\n     <em>\n      Confidential Witness Allegations\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-34\">\n    As noted, the complaint alleges in substance that defendants failed to disclose ReWalk's failure to comply with various FDA regulations, both during and after the IPO. In support of those allegations, the complaint relies in part on statements from three confidential witnesses (\"CWs\"), who were formerly employed by ReWalk.\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-35\">\n    CW-1 was the Executive Assistant to CEO Jasinski between April 2015 and December 2016. (CAC \u00b6 70). She described Jasinski as \"micromanaging\" ReWalk's day-to-day operations and involving himself in \"every single aspect of the business.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). According to CW-1, ReWalk had a culture of procrastination, which was \"exacerbated by Jasinski's micromanagement style.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 71).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    CW-1 sat in on weekly meetings between Jasinski and other high-ranking ReWalk officials. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 72). She recalled a meeting where the FDA's September 30, 2015 warning letter was discussed. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Jasinski, CFO Hershberger, and other officials were concerned about possible consequences ReWalk could suffer if it failed to meet FDA requirements. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 73). At some point, the warning letter was also brought to the attention of ReWalk's Board of Directors, chaired by defendant Dykan. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 74).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    CW-2 was a Clinical Training Manager at ReWalk from November 2015 to August 2016. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 75). CW-2 reported to ReWalk's Worldwide Training Manager and trained physical therapists at hospitals and\n    rehabilitation centers on how to use the ReWalk device. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    In December 2015, Jasinski convened a company-wide teleconference to discuss ReWalk's plan for a post-market surveillance study. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 76). At the teleconference, defendants \"showed no sense of urgency at all to even start the post-market surveillance study before February 2016.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Two months later, the FDA sent another letter to ReWalk citing deficiencies in the company's proposed post-market surveillance study. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 77). Around that time, ReWalk hosted a company-wide meeting in its Marlborough headquarters. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 78). At that meeting, \"CW-2 noticed for the first time that there appeared to be some urgency at [ReWalk] to start post-market surveillance.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). The Worldwide Training Director instructed CW-2 to recruit subjects for such a study. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 79). However, ReWalk did not recruit a sufficient number of subjects, in part because most insurance companies declined to reimburse users for the ReWalk device. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    CW-3 was the Associate Director of Clinical Operations at ReWalk from February 2016 to June 2017. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 80). CW-3 was hired to develop and execute ReWalk's post-market surveillance study. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 81). CW-3 initially reported to John Hamilton, the Vice President of Regulatory and Clinical at ReWalk. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 80). After Hamilton stepped down from his position in early 2017, CW-3 reported directly to Jasinski. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    CW-3 stated that before the IPO, ReWalk hired Clinivation, a third-party contract research organization, to prepare documents necessary for a post-market surveillance study. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 82). However, upon joining ReWalk, CW-3 reviewed Clinivation's work and concluded that it was \"quite garbage.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ). Eventually, CW-3 convinced Hamilton to terminate ReWalk's contract with Clinivation; however, Hamilton appeared to have \"virtually no experience with clinical trials.\" (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 83). Like CW-2, CW-3 stated that ReWalk's attempt to conduct a post-market surveillance study was hampered by its failure to recruit a sufficient number of subjects after insurance companies refused to reimburse users for the ReWalk device. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 84).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     3.\n     <em>\n      Defendants' Statements as to the Securities Act Claims\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The complaint alleges that the following paragraphs in ReWalk's September 12, 2014 IPO registration statement were false and misleading:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n    <strong>\n     Compelling Clinical Data.\n    </strong>\n    We believe that ReWalk's clinical data differentiates us from our competitors.

In addition, governmental agencies may impose new requirements regarding registration, labeling or prohibited materials that may require us to modify or reregister ReWalk once it is already on the market or otherwise impact our ability to market ReWalk in those countries.

Both cases were putative class actions alleging violations of the federal Securities Act relating to omissions in ReWalk's registration statement and final prospectus.

The court also concluded that there was concurrent state and federal jurisdiction for claims arising from violations of the Securities Act. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 4). Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the state action, and a hearing was held on October 18, 2017.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In the interim, on June 9, 2017, in this proceeding, the Court appointed a lead plaintiff, lead counsel, and liaison counsel. On July 6, 2017, defendants moved to stay this federal action based on the first-to-file rule, the\n    <em>\n     Colorado River\n    </em>\n    abstention doctrine, and the prior-pending-action doctrine. In their motion to stay, defendants also noted that the Supreme Court had granted a writ of certiorari in\n    <em>\n     Cyan, Inc. v. Beaver Cty. Emp. Ret. Fund\n    </em>\n    , which raised the question of whether the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998 (\"SLUSA\") stripped state courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate class actions brought under the Securities Act.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    Lead plaintiff then filed a consolidated amended complaint on August 9, 2017.

On October 23, 2017, the Court denied without prejudice defendants' motion to stay.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Subsequently, on November 10, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The motion sought to dismiss the action for failure to complete service of process on the individual domestic defendants pursuant to Rule 4(m), and for failure to state a claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). Defendants then filed a renewed motion to stay in the Superior Court, which was granted on December 13, 2017.

The paragraphs detailing the Securities Act allegations use the words \"materially false and misleading\" to describe the alleged omissions and misstatements in the registration statement. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 85-95). Words such as \"fraud\" and \"deceit\" are not used, and there are no allegations of willful or intentional conduct.

However, the letter went on to state:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n    The safety and effectiveness of the ReWalk has been demonstrated in an institutional environment (e.g. hospital, rehabilitation institution).

The letter further stated that the post-market surveillance study would be useful to help determine the product's safety in non-institutional environments. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ).

(\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    ; Feldman Decl. Ex. B). The text of the registration statement accurately summarizes why the post-market surveillance requirement was imposed.

It is undisputed that Yan purchased his shares on September 15 and 17, 2014. (Docket No. 7, Ex. B at 3). And the statements alleged to have violated the Exchange Act were made between February 12, 2015, and February 25, 2016. (CAC \u00b6\u00b6 99-110). The only statements, therefore, that Yan could have relied on were those made on or before September 17, 2014-that is, those in the registration statement, which the Court has found did not violate the Securities Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    Normally, that would be sufficient to dispose of the Exchange Act claims for\n    lack of standing.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Gross v.

And, as noted, it states that plaintiff \"disclaims any reliance upon [the Exchange Act allegations] or incorporation of these allegations in his Securities Act claims.\" (CAC \u00b6 96). In addition, counsel for plaintiff explicitly argued that there were \"two separate classes\"-one for the Securities Act claims and one for the Exchange Act claims.
