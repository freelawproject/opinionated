He was, and others similarly situated are, detained in the Cullman County jail following arrest because they cannot afford to post a surety bond or a property bond as a condition of pretrial release. Mr. Hester asks the Court to preliminarily enjoin the Cullman County Sheriff from detaining indigent defendants who cannot afford to post a property bond or a surety bond as a condition of pretrial release. Mr. Hester argues that Cullman County's procedures for setting a secured bond as a condition of pretrial release are constitutionally flawed, and he argues that the way in which Cullman County implements those procedures is inequitable. (Doc. 102).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the following reasons, the\n   Court finds that Mr. Hester is entitled to a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Procedural Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 8, 2018, Mr. Hester intervened in this action. (Doc. 94). The following day, Mr. Hester filed his intervenor complaint against Cullman County Sheriff Matt Gentry, Circuit Clerk Lisa McSwain, Magistrate Amy Black, Magistrate Joan White, District Court Judge Kim Chaney, and District Court Judge Wells R. Turner III. (Doc. 95). In his first claim for relief, citing the Fourteenth Amendment, Mr. Hester alleges that the defendants violate the \"fundamental rights\" of indigent criminal defendants arrested in Cullman County \"by enforcing against them a post-arrest system of wealth-based detention\" pursuant to which indigent defendants \"are kept in jail because they cannot afford a monetary amount of bail.\" (Doc. 95, p. 18, \u00b6 80). In his second claim for relief, Mr. Hester alleges that the defendants do not provide counsel for bail hearings, give arrestees an adequate opportunity to testify or present evidence at bail hearings, apply a uniform evidentiary standard to determine whether a person should be detained prior to trial, or \"require a [judicial] finding that no affordable financial or non-financial condition of release will ensure appearance or public safety before jailing pretrial arrestees on monetary bail amounts that they cannot afford.\" (Doc. 95, p. 19, \u00b6 85).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hester asserts that the defendants create\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention orders that apply to only indigent criminal defendants in Cullman County. Mr. Hester seeks declaratory relief from the judicial defendants -- Circuit Clerk McSwain, Magistrate Black, Magistrate White, Judge Chaney, and Judge Turner -- and injunctive relief from Sheriff Gentry. (Doc. 95, pp. 20-21, \u00b6\u00b6 c-f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Mr. Hester has asked the Court to certify this lawsuit as a class action and \"certify a class consisting of all state-court arrestees who are or who will be jailed in Cullman County who are unable to pay the secured monetary bail amount required for their release.\" (Doc. 101, p. 2). The defendants do not oppose class certification should this case proceed. (Doc. 144, p. 8; Doc. 145, p. 1). Mr. Hester also has asked the Court to preliminarily enjoin Sheriff Gentry \"from prospectively jailing arrestees unable to pay secured monetary bail.\" (Doc. 102, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The judicial defendants filed opposition to Mr. Hester's motion for preliminary injunction. (Doc. 122). In addition to arguing that Mr. Hester has not satisfied the standard for a preliminary injunction, the judicial defendants contend that Cullman County's recent adoption of new bail procedures moots Mr. Hester's claims for injunctive relief. (Doc. 122, p. 32). Sheriff Gentry has asked the Court to dismiss Mr. Hester's claims for injunctive relief. (Doc. 123).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On April 12 and 13, 2018, the Court held a hearing on the motion for preliminary injunction. (Docs. 136, 143). Dr. Stephen Demuth, whom the Court admitted as an\n   expert in statistical analysis and quantitative research methods related to pretrial detention and release processes, testified for Mr. Hester. (Doc. 136, pp. 36-40). Judge Truman Morrison of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia, whom the Court admitted as an expert in bail setting procedures, also testified for Mr. Hester. (Doc. 136, pp. 118-21). Sheriff Gentry and Judge Turner testified for the defendants. (Doc. 136, pp. 187, 268). The parties provided additional evidence via affidavit and stipulated to certain facts relevant to Mr. Hester's motion for preliminary injunction. (Docs. 132-135, 138-140, 146, 148, 153). On this record, the Court considers Mr. Hester's request for a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In Cullman County, individuals charged with crimes are taken into custody either pursuant to a probable cause warrantless arrest or pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by one of the county's magistrates. Most arrests in Cullman County are warrantless probable cause arrests. (Doc. 136, pp. 235-36; Doc. 143, p. 194).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Under Alabama law, absent a capital murder charge, arrestees have a statutory right to bail. (Doc. 136, p. 285;\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2015-13-106\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7\u00a7 15-13-106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , -108).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Cullman County, bail initially is set as a condition of pretrial release for every arrestee. The staff of Cullman County's Sheriff's Office selects the initial bail amount for individuals jailed for warrantless probable cause arrests; magistrates select the initial bail amount in arrest warrants. (Doc. 136, pp. 206, 275).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because most of the arrests in Cullman County are warrantless arrests, the Sheriff's Office sets most of the initial bail amounts in the county. Both the sheriff and the magistrates use a bail schedule to determine the bail amount. On an average day, there are ten arrests in Cullman County, and six of those arrestees are immediately bail eligible. (Doc. 136, p. 193).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Cullman County primarily uses property bonds and surety bonds to meet the bail\n   condition for pretrial release of arrestees. In the case of a property bond, a criminal defendant's relative or neighbor may post property (typically real property, but occasionally a vehicle) to secure the defendant's release. (Doc. 136, pp. 190-92, 224). By state statute, Cullman County must assess a $35 bond fee for property bonds. (Doc. 136, p. 192).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bonding companies provide surety bonds. Cullman County advertises the telephone numbers for bonding companies in its jail cells. An arrestee may call a bonding company, \"work out an agreement ... on a set price for that bonding company\" to post bond, and secure her release from jail. (Doc. 136, p. 191).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Sheriff Gentry testified that he has two primary interests in the pretrial process: getting defendants to appear for court proceedings and ensuring the safety of the community. (Doc. 136, pp. 235-36). Those interests are consistent with Alabama law. Pursuant to Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, conditions of pretrial release are imposed to \"reasonably assure the defendant's appearance\" at court proceedings and to protect \"the public at large\" from \"real and present danger.\" Ala. R. Crim. P. 7.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Pre-March 26, 2018\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Until March 26, 2018, Cullman County used a bail schedule that identified a range of bail for various state criminal offenses. (Doc. 129-34; Doc. 132, p.1, \u00b6 1). For each individual arrested, Sheriff Gentry set bail based on the crime charged and then released criminal defendants who could post a secured bond for the bail amount and detained criminal defendants who could not afford to post bond. (Doc. 132, p. 2, \u00b6\u00b6 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Cullman County magistrates conducted initial appearances for arrestees who could not afford to post bond. (Doc. 132, pp. 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 12). The initial appearance was conducted by video conference, and the state did not offer counsel for the appearance. (Doc. 132, pp. 2-3, \u00b6\u00b6 10, 13). At the initial appearances, the magistrates informed the arrestees of their bail amount but did not evaluate the bail amount to determine whether the bail amount exceeded the amount necessary to satisfy the statutory purposes of bail. (Doc. 132, p. 3, \u00b6 14). Arrestees who could not afford to post a secured bond had to remain in jail and file a motion to reconsider their bail amount. (Doc. 132, p. 2, \u00b6 9). Typically, a district judge would not consider such a motion until several weeks after arrest. (Doc. 132, p. 2, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The parties dispute the number of arrestees who were detained each month solely because they could not afford to post bail under this system. According to Alacourt records, Alabama's electronic trial management system, during the month of February 2018, 85 of 235 arrestees (i.e. 34%) who were eligible to secure their release\n   by posting a secured bond were unable to post bond within 72 hours after arrest. (Doc. 129-9, p. 3, \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Doc. 136, pp. 262-63). Of those 85 arrestees, 36 (i.e. 42%) never received an initial appearance. (Doc. 129-9, pp. 3-4, \u00b6 5). Two arrestees received an initial appearance more than 72 hours after arrest. (Doc. 129-9, p. 4, \u00b6 5). The remaining 47 arrestees received an initial appearance within 72 hours of arrest. (Doc. 129-9, p. 3, \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The defendants contend that Alacourt records are not necessarily reliable because the records do not contain all relevant information, and the Alacourt system experiences lag time between entering and displaying data. (Doc. 136, p. 262; Doc. 143, p. 65). According to a Cullman County detention data sheet that Sheriff Gentry submitted, of the 220 new arrests made in February 2018, 167 arrestees (i.e. 76%) were released without need for an initial appearance within 72 hours of arrest. (Doc. 139-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 143, pp. 190-93; 210-13). Of those 220 new arrests, 159 arrests were made without a warrant, all but 14 of which (i.e. 91%) posted bond within 48 hours after arrest without having to wait for an initial appearance. (Doc. 139-2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 143, pp. 194-95). Sheriff Gentry testified that the 14 arrestees who did not post bond may have been detained because they had a new probable cause arrest or a warrant for failure to appear during the month. (Doc. 143, pp. 194-95).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    March 26, 2018 Revisions to Bail Procedures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 26, 2018, the presiding circuit judge in Cullman County signed a \"Standing Order Regarding Pre-Trial Appearance and the Setting of Bond\" which established new pretrial detention and bail policies for the Cullman County. (Doc. 129-36). The Court first describes the procedures that the new Standing Order dictates. The Court then describes the evidence concerning the way in which Cullman County has implemented the new Standing Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    a. March 26, 2018 Standing Order and Initial Appearance Procedures\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Pursuant to the March 26, 2018 Standing Order, the Cullman County Sheriff still uses a bail schedule, but the new bail schedule provides specific amounts of bail for specific criminal charges. (Doc. 129-36, p. 3; Doc. 129-37;\n   <em>\n    compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-34, p. 2). Some of the bail amounts listed in the new schedule are lower than the bail amounts in the previous schedule. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-34\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-37). As with the former bail procedures, absent a capital murder charge, eligible defendants arrested without a warrant are released when they post a secured bond in the amount that Sheriff Gentry's staff sets per the bail schedule, regardless of the nature of the crime charged, the arrestee's criminal history, or the arrestee's prior record of failures to appear. (Doc. 129-36, p. 3; Doc. 136, p. 206). When the sheriff sets a bond amount for a warrantless arrest, \"there's no leeway in ... what your bond is going to be.\" (Doc. 136, p. 206;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 136, pp. 221-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The Sheriff's Office releases a defendant arrested pursuant to a warrant when the defendant posts bond in the amount set in the warrant. (Doc. 129-36, p. 4; Doc. 143, p. 141). Magistrates set bond in arrest warrants in the amount listed in the bail schedule. (Doc. 129-36, p. 4; Doc. 136, p. 199; Doc. 143, p. 142).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   For those who can afford to post a secured bond, ordinarily between 45 and 90 minutes elapse from the time an arrestee is booked in the Cullman County jail until the time she is released from jail on a secured bond. (Doc. 136, p. 206).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   According to the Standing Order, if a law enforcement officer believes that a defendant poses \"an unreasonable risk of flight or danger to the public,\" then the\n   officer may complete a bail request form and ask that bond be set in an amount different from the amount listed in the bail schedule. (Doc. 129-36, pp. 3-4). Under the terms of the Standing Order, if an officer completes a bail request form for a defendant, then a magistrate may either grant the request and order the sheriff to detain the defendant until a district judge, within 72 hours of arrest, conducts an initial appearance and makes \"an individualized determination of conditions of release, including the setting of bond,\" or deny the bail request \"in which case the defendant shall be immediately released upon posting a bond on the terms contained in the schedule.\" (Doc. 129-36, pp. 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Standing Order provides that defendants who are unable to post a secured bond in the amount listed in the bail schedule are entitled to a judicial determination of the conditions of their release by a district judge held no later than 72 hours after arrest. (Doc. 129-36, p. 5, n. 3; Doc. 143, pp. 48, 63). A circuit judge must determine the conditions for release for a defendant who is arrested pursuant to a warrant issued upon an indictment. (Doc. 129-36, p. 5, n.3). The judicial determination of conditions for release takes place at an initial appearance. If a defendant cannot pay the bond amount set by Sheriff Gentry or a magistrate, and the defendant does not receive an initial appearance within 72 hours of arrest, then Sheriff Gentry must release the defendant on an unsecured appearance bond in the amount set in the bail schedule. (Doc. 129-36, p. 8).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Before an initial appearance, a member of the Sheriff's Office meets with a defendant in jail and offers two forms to the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   A defendant may complete a \"Release Questionnaire,\" and a defendant who indicates that she needs an attorney also may complete an \"Affidavit of Substantial Hardship.\" (Doc. 129-39; Doc. 129-41; Doc. 143, pp. 176-77;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Doc. 136, pp. 216, 272, 277-78). Defendants may refuse the forms. (Doc. 139-1, p. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The release questionnaire states: \"FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING CONDITIONS OF PRE-TRIAL RELEASE IN THIS CASE, THE COURT MAY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE FOLLOWING.\" (Doc. 129-41, p. 2). The release questionnaire asks the defendant to supply information about her residence, employment, family situation, health, and criminal history, including prior failures to appear. (Doc. 129-41, pp. 2-3; Doc. 136, p. 279). The questionnaire also asks the defendant to identify and provide contact information for nearest living relatives not living with the defendant and for as many as four individuals who can vouch for the defendant's \"character, reputation and reliability.\" (Doc. 129-41, pp. 2-3; Doc. 136, p. 279). The affidavit of substantial hardship asks the defendant to identify her employment, assistance benefits, monthly gross income, monthly expenses, and liquid assets. (Doc. 129-39, pp. 2-3). The sheriff's court liaison deputy delivers the completed forms to court, so that the forms are available to the judge at the initial appearance. (Doc. 122-1, p. 3, \u00b6 7; Doc. 136, p. 281).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Cullman County does not have a pretrial services department, so there is no one who independently gathers information for an initial appearance. (Doc. 136, p. 288). The information that arrestees provide on the bail forms is not always accurate, often because arrestees may have difficulty understanding the forms. (Doc. 136, pp. 288-89). As Judge Turner explained, the majority of the people who \"come in contact with [ ] the criminal justice system\" in Cullman County do not have \"even a high school education.\" (Doc. 136, p. 289). \"A lot of them are going to have learning disabilities. A lot of them are going to have inability to read and comprehend.\" (Doc. 136, p. 289). Therefore, the examination of defendants during an initial appearance is an important source of information for the determination of the conditions of bond. (Doc. 136, p. 289).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The initial appearance typically is held remotely by video conference. (Doc. 136, pp. 272-73). At the initial appearance, the judge ensures that the defendant is aware of the charges against her, the right to be represented by counsel, and the right to remain silent. (Doc. 129-40, p. 2; Doc. 136, p. 282). The judge reviews the affidavit of substantial hardship, if the defendant has submitted one, to determine whether the defendant is indigent. (Doc. 136, pp. 277-78). If the judge determines that the defendant is indigent, then the court appoints counsel for the defendant, but under the Standing Order, appointed counsel is not available to a defendant during an initial appearance. (Doc. 122-1, p. 5, \u00b6 11; Doc. 129-36, pp. 2-8; Doc. 129-40, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   During an initial appearance, the judge determines the conditions of the defendant's release. (Doc. 122-1, pp. 3-4, \u00b6 8). Pursuant to Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, the judge must consider releasing the defendant on the defendant's own recognizance or on an unsecured appearance bond unless the judge \"determines that such a release will not reasonably assure the defendant's appearance as required, or the defendant's being at large will pose a real and present danger to the public at large.\" (Doc. 122-1, p. 4, \u00b6 9; Doc. 136, pp. 282-83m 286). Rule 7.2(a) states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (a) BEFORE CONVICTION. Any defendant charged with an offense bailable as a matter of right may be released pending or during trial on his or her personal recognizance or on an appearance bond unless the court or magistrate determines that such a release will not reasonably assure the defendant's appearance as required, or that the defendant's being at large will pose a real and present danger to others or to the public at large. If such a determination is made, the court may impose the least onerous condition or conditions contained in Rule 7.3(b) that will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance or that will eliminate or minimize the risk of harm to others or to the public at large. In making such a determination, the court may take into account the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   1. The age, background and family ties, relationships and circumstances of the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   2. The defendant's reputation, character, and health.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   3. The defendant's prior criminal record, including prior releases on recognizance or on secured appearance bonds, and other pending cases.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   4. The identity of responsible members of the community who will vouch for the defendant's reliability.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   5. Violence or lack of violence in the alleged commission of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   6. The nature of the offense charged, the apparent probability of conviction, and the likely sentence, insofar as\n   these factors are relevant to the risk of nonappearance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   7. The type of weapon used, e.g., knife, pistol, shotgun, sawed-off shotgun.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   8. Threats made against victims and/or witnesses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   9. The value of property taken during the alleged commission of the offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   10. Whether the property allegedly taken was recovered or not; damage or lack of damage to property allegedly taken.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   11. Residence of the defendant, including consideration of real property ownership, and length of residence in his or her place of domicile.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   12. In cases where the defendant is charged with a drug offense, evidence of selling or pusher activity should indicate a substantial increase in the amount of bond.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   13. Consideration of the defendant's employment status and history, the location of defendant's employment, e.g., whether employed in the county where the alleged offense occurred, and the defendant's financial condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   14. Any enhancement statutes related to the charged offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ala. R. Crim. P. 7.2. The Standing Order requires the judge to consider the fourteen factors in Rule 7.2(a). (Doc. 129-36, pp. 5-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In weighing the factors that bear on a defendant's eligibility for release, the judge considers the information that the defendant provided in the release questionnaire and in the affidavit of substantial hardship, if the defendant submitted one. (Doc. 136, pp. 277-81). Judge Turner testified that when he is \"considering factors to consider to release\" a defendant, it is helpful for him to know whether a defendant \"[is] employed or if they're not employed\" and whether the defendant is \"living where they say they are at that address or is that just where they get their mail.\" (Doc. 136, p. 280). With respect to the address information, Judge Turner stated: \"We have a lot of people that move from place to place wherever they can find to lay their head. And [ ] keeping track of them can be difficult at times.\" (Doc. 136, p. 281). Judge Turner also considers \"the circumstances\" of \"the most recent arrest.\" (Doc. 136, p. 285). For example, in setting the conditions for a 26-year-old male defendant charged with unlawful possession of a controlled substance, Judge Turner considered the fact that the defendant previously served time in prison, and he considered the fact that the defendant was found hiding in a closet with a 14-year-old girl, \"a factor to go with contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\" (Doc. 136, p. 287). Had that 26-year-old arrestee been able to afford bond, he would have been released as soon as he posted bond without regard to his criminal history or his association with a 14-year-old girl.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In addition to the questionnaire and the affidavit of substantial hardship, in the case of a warrantless arrest, the judge may consider the form that contains the arresting officer's statement of why the officer believed that she had probable cause to arrest the defendant. (Doc. 136, p. 281). According to the Standing Order, the judge \"may elicit testimony about the defendant's financial condition,\" (Doc. 129-36, p. 7), but according to the Order on Initial Appearance and Bond Hearing form, the form that the judge completes during or following an initial appearance, the judge must \"[give] the Defendant the opportunity to make a statement regarding his/her ability to post the bond currently set in this matter.\" (Doc. 129-40, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Standing Order provides that after considering the fourteen factors, the defendant's\n   ability to post a secured bond, testimony from the defendant, and forms submitted to the Court, the Court \"may release a defendant on his or her own recognizance, require the defendant to post an unsecured appearance bond, or require the posting of a secured appearance bond if that is the least onerous condition that will reasonably assure the defendant's appearance or that will eliminate or minimize the risk of harm to others or the public at large.\" (Doc. 129-36, p. 7). If there is \"no less onerous condition for securing the defendant's appearance or protecting the public, then the Court may require a secured appearance bond in an amount less than, equal to, or greater than that contained in the bond schedule,\" even if the defendant cannot afford to post bond. (Doc. 129-36, p. 7). If the Court requires a secured bond, then the Standing Order states that \"[t]he Court will make a written finding as to why the posting of a bond is reasonably necessary to assure the defendant's presence at trial in such a case\" in \"Section 6 of Form C-80 (Local), Order on Initial Appearance and Bond Hearing, and in Form C-52(g), Release Order.\" (Doc. 129-36, pp. 7-8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Under the Standing Order, if a judge appoints counsel for an arrestee at an initial appearance, appointed counsel must meet with a defendant within seven days. (Doc. 136, pp. 290-91). It is not uncommon for a judge to set a bond in an amount he knows the defendant cannot afford. (Doc. 136, pp. 291-294). Following her initial appearance, if a defendant still cannot afford to post bond, then the defendant may file a motion for bond reduction, and her appointed attorney may assist her. (Doc. 122-1, p. 5, \u00b6 11; Doc. 136, pp. 293, 295). A judge typically hears the motion within a month. (Doc. 136, pp. 297-98; Doc. 143, p. 97).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    b. Implementation of the March 26, 2018 Standing Order\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The presiding judge of the Cullman County Circuit Court entered the new Standing Order two weeks after Mr. Hester filed his motion for preliminary injunction in this case. (Docs. 102, 129-36). Therefore, at the hearing on Mr. Hester's motion, the defendants were able to offer little evidence concerning the implementation of the new policy, but the limited evidence that the defendants did offer indicates that officials in Cullman County do not always comply with the written requirements in the new Standing Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For example, officials in Cullman County do not handle bail requests in a manner consistent with the new standing order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Law enforcement officers rarely use this tool. Sheriff Gentry testified that bail requests from law enforcement officers \"are very few and far between.\" (Doc. 136, p. 207). Judge Turner testified that he has never seen a bail request from a law enforcement officer in conjunction with a warrantless arrest. Judge Turner and Judge Chaney handle all bail requests tied to warrant arrests. (Doc. 136, pp. 275-76). In practice, a magistrate will not deny a bail request submitted with an application for an arrest warrant; magistrates refer all bail requests to a district judge. (Doc. 143, p. 143).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition, although Cullman County has instituted a system purportedly designed to ensure that all arrestees who require an initial appearance see a judge within 48 hours, the system does not always work. For example, on April 8, 2018, PEB was arrested on a charge of domestic\n   violence third degree, harassment. (Doc. 136, pp. 217, 219; Doc. 139-1, p. 1). The sheriff's staff set PEB's bond at $1,500 per Cullman County's bail schedule. (Doc. 122-1, p. 16; Doc. 136, p. 219). PEB completed a release questionnaire and received an initial appearance on April 9, 2018. (Doc. 136, pp. 217, 220; Doc. 139-1, p. 1). The sheriff testified that this initial appearance took place before a magistrate; the Standing Order calls for an appearance before a judge. As of April 11, 2018, PEB was still in jail, and he had not received a bail hearing within 48 hours. (Doc. 136, p. 220). PEB was released on a property bond on April 13, 2018. (Doc. 136, p. 221).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   With respect to written findings concerning a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention order, when a judge, based on the information that he reviewed in an initial appearance, decides to require secured bond as a condition for release, the Standing Order says that the judge must make \"a written finding as to why the posting of a bond is reasonably necessary,\" but neither the Order on Initial Appearance and Bond Hearing nor the Release Order provides space for a written finding with respect to secured bond. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-40, p. 3; Doc. 129-42, p. 2). Instead, the Order on Initial Appearance and Bond Hearing requires a judge to check boxes beside 15 factors to identify the factors the judge took into \"consideration\" in requiring a secured bond. (Doc. 129-40, p. 3). Fourteen of the factors listed come from Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the fifteenth factor is \"Other,\" which the judge may specify in writing. (Doc. 129-40, p. 3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Release Order simply requires the judge to check a box if the court requires a secured bond. (Doc. 129-40, p. 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

At the time of arrest, if a defendant cannot provide any\n   of these types of security, then a defendant must receive a hearing before a municipal judge within 48 hours. That hearing has a single purpose: using a uniform standard of indigency to evaluate evidence of indigency supplied to the court by a court-appointed attorney, a judge determines whether a defendant is, in fact, indigent. A defendant who \"has other resources that might reasonably be used\" to secure release must provide the security that a judge orders to obtain release. All defendants adjudged indigent under the city's uniform standard are released on a recognizance bond, \"meaning no bail amount is set, either secured or unsecured.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1252-53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204000252\">\n    2018 WL 4000252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *1-*2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thus, as the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   majority found, the City of Calhoun releases\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   indigent defendants, just as the city releases all defendants who can afford to pay a cash bond, post a surety or property bond, provide a driver's license as collateral, or provide some other form of collateral. The\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   majority found that delay of up to 48 hours in securing release for indigent defendants was presumptively constitutional.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1266-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204000252\">\n    2018 WL 4000252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *14. The\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   majority held that the indigent in the City of Calhoun \"must merely wait some appropriate amount of time to receive the same benefit as the more affluent\" and that an appropriate period of delay, without more, does not offend the Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Cullman County's bail process differs significantly from the process in the City of Calhoun because indigent defendants cannot secure their release merely by proving that they are indigent according to a uniform standard of indigency. Instead, within 72 hours of arrest, to obtain pretrial release in Cullman County, an indigent criminal defendant, without the assistance of counsel, must prove not only that he is indigent but also that he is not a flight risk or a threat to himself or the community. If a judge, applying no particular legal standard, decides that a defendant is indigent but that the defendant is a danger to himself or his community or a flight risk, then the judge may set bail at a level that the defendant cannot afford, creating a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-36, p. 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In the section that follows, the Court discusses the procedural deficiencies in Cullman County's bail system, but the Court first examines the inequitable treatment of arrestees on basis of wealth. Under Cullman County's pretrial procedures, a dangerous arrestee who can post bond immediately returns to the community to which she is a threat, suffering only the inconvenience of detention of no more than two hours. For example, Judge Turner confirmed that if a deputy sheriff were to arrest an individual on a charge of first degree rape, the Sheriff's Office would release the individual as soon as he could post a $20,000 property or surety bond. (Doc. 143, p. 143). If that same arrestee could not post bond, then he would have to participate in an initial appearance before a district judge, and the judge would consider the conditions for release including the bond amount. (Doc. 143, p. 144). The bail order that a judge would enter likely would include a bond amount that the indigent defendant could not satisfy, completely depriving the defendant of the benefit of pretrial liberty that would have been available to him hours after his arrest, had he been able to afford a bond immediately. The Standing Order permits this result, and the record shows that it is not unusual for a judge to set bond for an indigent defendant in an amount the defendant cannot afford. (Doc. 129-36, p. 7; Doc. 136, pp. 291-294).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Judge Turner acknowledged that if every arrestee in Cullman County had to go through the pretrial process that indigent\n   defendants must follow, \"drastically\" higher numbers of defendants would be detained pretrial. (Doc. 143, p. 67). Judge Turner estimated that the number of pretrial detainees would quadruple. (Doc. 143, pp. 67-68). Judge Turner agreed with counsel for the judicial defendants that detaining non-indigent arrestees would not be a good thing because doing so would mean that many more people would suffer the deleterious consequences of pretrial detention. (Doc. 143, pp. 67-68).\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Those harmful consequences are significant. Mr. Hester's unrebutted evidence shows that deprivation of pretrial liberty takes a high toll on a criminal defendant, and the negative effects of pretrial incarceration compound each day that a defendant is detained. Dr. Demuth explained that research literature increasingly \"shows quite robustly that pretrial detention has deleterious consequences for the detained, the community at large, and the criminal justice system itself.\" (Doc. 129-1, pp. 9-10). As discussed in greater detail below, pretrial detention hampers a defendant's ability to participate in his defense. Prolonged pretrial detention increases the likelihood that the pretrial detainee will enter a guilty plea, receive a harsher sentence, and recidivate. (Doc. 129-1, pp. 11-12; Doc. 129-19, p. 8; Doc. 129-20, pp. 2, 4; Doc. 136, pp. 73-74). And detention for even 24 hours can cause a defendant to lose a job, a consequence an indigent defendant cannot afford. In Cullman County, these harmful consequences appear to be unacceptable for all but the indigent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Mr. Hester is substantially likely to prove that Cullman County's discriminatory bail practices deprive indigent criminal defendants in Cullman County of equal protection of the law because the challenged distinction does not rationally further a legitimate state purpose.\n   <em>\n    McGinnis v. Royster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957172\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/263/#p270\">\n    410 U.S. 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 270,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957172\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/263/#p270\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1055\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957172\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/263/#p270\">\n    35 L.Ed.2d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1973). Instead, Cullman County's stated interests are illusory and conspicuously arbitrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The defendants argue that three compelling interests warrant secured bonds in Cullman County: providing pretrial release as quickly as possible for all who can afford it (Doc. 143, pp. 125, 168), ensuring that criminal defendants appear for trial (Doc. 122-1, p. 6, \u00b6 14; Doc. 143, pp. 171, 173), and protecting the community from dangerous criminal defendants (Doc. 143, pp. 413-14, 521). Mr. Hester is likely to demonstrate that the defendants' secured money bail procedures are not necessary to serve any of these interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   With respect to efficient pretrial release of criminal defendants, the defendants have demonstrated that the bail schedule enables the defendants to quickly release criminal defendants who can afford a bond. Sheriff Gentry testified that at the pretrial stage of a criminal proceeding, it is important to release individuals from as jail early as possible because pretrial release reduces the demands on the county's jail and returns people to their families as soon as possible. (Doc. 143, p. 168). The sheriff generally releases defendants who can afford a secured bond within two hours of booking. The sheriff must detain defendants who cannot afford a secured bond but are otherwise eligible for release at least until those defendants have an initial appearance. (Doc. 129-1, pp. 8-9, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). An unsecured bond system would allow wealthy and indigent defendants to be released at the same rate and on the same basis, thereby\n   <em>\n    increasing\n   </em>\n   the efficiency of pretrial release in the county by freeing additional jail space and returning all defendants,\n   not just the wealthy, to their families as quickly as possible. Cullman County has not examined or tested an unsecured bond system. (Doc. 136, p. 210).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   With respect to the issue of pretrial appearance, the plaintiffs' evidence demonstrates that Cullman County likely would not see an increase in failures to appear with unsecured bonds. Mr. Hester offered expert testimony and empirical studies to demonstrate that secured money bail is not more effective than unsecured bail or non-monetary conditions of release in reducing the risk of flight from prosecution. For example, Dr. Demuth testified that \"several recent empirical studies that compare the effectiveness of different kinds of bonds in assuring appearance in court ... [found] no difference in the effectiveness of secured and unsecured bonds.\" (Doc. 129-1, p. 5, \u00b6 11).\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   One of those studies concluded that regardless of a criminal defendant's pretrial risk category, \"unsecured bonds offer decision-makers the same likelihood of court appearance as do secured bonds.\" (Doc. 129-10, p. 13).\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Michael Jones, the study's author, considers this finding unsurprising \"given that both bond types carry the potential for the defendant to lose money for failing to appear.\" (Doc. 129-10, p. 13). A study conducted by Claire M. B. Brooker, Dr. Jones, and Timothy R. Schnacke found that the average court appearance rate for criminal defendants in Jefferson County, Colorado did not differ significantly between judges who set more secured bonds and judges who set more unsecured bonds. (Doc. 129-11, p. 9).\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Mr. Hester's evidence shows that secured money bail actually may undermine the government's interest in court appearance because secured money bail results in longer periods of pretrial detention for those who cannot easily afford bail, which, in turn, is associated with higher failure to appear rates. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-1, pp. 5, 11-12, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 18-19; Doc. 129-4, p. 5, \u00b6 17). For example, a study conducted by Christopher T. Lowenkamp, Marie VanNostrand, and Alexander Holsinger found that criminal defendants who eventually are released after arrest are more likely to fail to appear for court the longer they are detained pretrial. (Doc. 129-12, pp. 11-12).\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   And evidence suggests that most defendants released without financial incentives to appear in court still appear at a very\n   high rate. For example, Judge Morrison testified that in 2017, in Washington, D.C., where \"financial conditions are almost never used\" for pretrial release, 88% of criminal defendants released pretrial made all scheduled court appearances. (Doc. 129-2, p. 5, \u00b6\u00b6 22, 25). Dr. Jones stated that many research studies show that court date reminders, \"which can be delivered through in-person meetings, letters, postcards, live callers, robocalls, text messages, and/or email,\" are the \"single most effective pretrial risk management intervention for reducing failures to appear;\" they improve court appearance by approximately 30% to 50%. (Doc. 129-4, p. 14, \u00b6 43). Jacob Sills, the co-founder and CEO of a company that uses technology and behavioral research to help criminal defendants appear for court, testified that the failure to appear rate of public defender clients in Richmond, California decreased from 20% to under 4% after implementing text-message court date reminders. (Doc. 129-7, p. 4, \u00b6 11). The failure to appear rate of low-income defendants in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania decreased from 15% to under 6% after implementing text-message court date reminders. (Doc. 129-7, p. 4, \u00b6 12). Insha Rahman, a senior planner at a non-profit criminal justice organization that develops pretrial services, testified that in New York City, 95% of nearly 2,300 criminal defendants whose bail was paid by charitable organizations, i.e. who had no \"skin in the game,\" made all court appearances. (Doc. 135-3, p. 4, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The defendants have not offered empirical evidence or research studies to rebut Mr. Hester's considerable evidence. Judge Turner testified that he has no empirical evidence concerning or experience with unsecured bail to demonstrate that unsecured bail would increase failure to appear rates. (Doc. 143, pp. 116, 128-29). Instead, the defendants argue, without an evidentiary basis, that by requiring a criminal defendant or a third party to put \"skin in the game,\" the criminal defendant is more likely to appear in court. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Doc. 143, pp. 62, 69-70). Sheriff Gentry and Judge Turner testified that because family members or a commercial bondsman often pay a criminal defendant's bond, a secured money bail system encourages those third parties to hold a criminal defendant accountable for appearing in court. (Doc. 136, pp. 225-27; Doc. 143, pp. 367-68).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Other testimony from Sheriff Gentry and Judge Turner undermines the defendants' argument that secured money bail is necessary for court appearance. Sheriff Gentry acknowledged that a court-appointed third-party custodian would hold an individual just as accountable to appear in court as a family member who posted secured bond. (Doc. 136, p. 226). And Judge Turner acknowledged that an individual would have just as much \"skin in the game\" with an unsecured bond. (Doc. 143, pp. 69-70). Thus, the evidence demonstrates that secured bail is no more effective than other conditions to assure a criminal defendant's appearance at court proceedings, and secured bail is not necessary to secure a criminal defendant's appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The defendants' third stated interest, the safety of the community, illustrates that Cullman County's bail procedure is entirely arbitrary. Empirical studies demonstrate that there is no statistically significant difference between the rates at which criminal defendants released on secured and unsecured bail are charged with new crimes. (Doc. 129-1, pp. 7-8, \u00b6\u00b6 12-13). Dr. Jones's study found that regardless of a criminal defendant's pretrial risk, \"unsecured bonds offer the same public safety benefit as do secured bonds.\" (Doc. 129-10, p. 12). Dr. Jones noted that his findings are consistent with at least two other research studies. (Doc. 129-10, p. 12). In addition,\n   the study conducted by Ms. Brooker, Dr. Jones, and Mr. Schnacke found that \"there was no significant difference in the overall public safety rate between\" criminal defendants released by judges who set many secured bonds and criminal defendants released by judges who set many unsecured bonds. (Doc. 129-11, p. 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Significantly, Mr. Hester offered expert testimony and research studies which demonstrate that prolonged pretrial detention is associated with a greater likelihood of re-arrest upon release, meaning that pretrial detention may\n   <em>\n    increase\n   </em>\n   the risk of harm to the community. (Doc. 129-1, pp. 7-8, \u00b6 13). Citing the study conducted by Dr. Lowenkamp, Dr. VanNostrand, and Dr. Holsinger, Dr. Jones testified that criminal defendants who are released in two to three days are 39% more likely, five to seven days 50% more likely, and 8 to 14 days 56% more likely to re-offend than those who are released within one day. (Doc. 129-4, p. 5, \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-12, pp. 11-12, 20). In addition, reviews of pretrial release practices in Washington, D.C., New Jersey, and Kentucky show that defendants released on unsecured bond or non-financial conditions are not more likely to re-offend than defendants released on secured bond. (Doc. 129-2, p. 5, \u00b6 25; Doc. 129-16, p. 5; Doc. 129-18, p. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The defendants did not offer evidence to show that criminal defendants who cannot afford to pay secured money bond are more dangerous to the public than criminal defendants who can. Judge Turner testified that he was not aware of empirical data showing that secured money bail ensures public safety more than other forms of pretrial release. (Doc. 143, p. 131). Sheriff Gentry testified that the threat of losing money creates the incentive to not commit new crimes after release. (Doc. 143, p. 168). But release on unsecured bond provides the same incentive because a judge may require a criminal defendant who commits a new crime while on pretrial release to pay the face value of the bond.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   As currently implemented, Cullman County's bail schedule does nothing to secure public safety. A defendant with financial means who is charged with assault can go home within two hours of his arrest if he can post a $10,000 bond, while an indigent defendant charged with fourth degree possession of a forged instrument who cannot afford to post a $3,000 secured bond remains in custody awaiting a hearing. (Doc. 122-1, p. 16). More importantly, dangerous defendants charged with identical crimes are treated differently based on their financial status. The Sheriff's Office releases a dangerous defendant with financial means within two hours of arrest, but the Sheriff's Office detains an indigent defendant who must await an opportunity to convince a judge, who is not required to apply a particular evidentiary standard, that his or her past criminal history and/or current alleged conduct do not warrant an unattainable bond amount that will serve for that defendant as a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   detention order. The system is discriminatory: not all criminal defendants who pose a real and present danger to the public are indigent, but Cullman County detains only indigent criminal defendants who pose a real and present danger to the public. Dangerous defendants with means enjoy pretrial liberty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   In February 2018, Cullman County had 220 new arrests. Of the 220 individuals arrested, 47 individuals had to await initial appearances, and 167 individuals were able to secure their release immediately. (Doc. 143, pp. 192, 212). None of those 167 individuals had to prove that they were not a danger to the community or a flight risk. With respect to those 167 individuals, Cullman County did nothing to determine whether conditions other than bond were\n   necessary to protect the public or to ensure the defendant's appearance at court proceedings. Cullman County professes concern for the safety of the citizens in the community, but the record demonstrates that that concern is illusory or at least half-hearted in implementation. As Judge Turner stated, if Cullman County were to assess all arrestees for danger to the community, there would be many more individuals held pretrial in the Cullman County jail, just as there would be many additional detentions if Cullman County assessed all arrestees for flight risks.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The defendants mention that they are open to making additional changes to their pretrial bail system, but they contend that \"it's got to come from a state level. Whatever works for Cullman has got to be the same thing that works for Jefferson County, for Mobile County, for Escambia County.\" (Doc. 143, p. 69). The proposition is not persuasive. Cullman County did not have to wait for the rest of the State of Alabama when it revised its pretrial bail procedures two weeks after Mr. Hester filed his motion for preliminary injunction. And this Court does not have a record before it that would allow it to determine whether the bail systems in other counties in Alabama suffer from constitutional flaws, such that state-wide reform is necessary. For purposes of this litigation, the Court is concerned only with the record concerning Cullman County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   None of the interests that the defendants have identified relating to Cullman's County's secured bail procedures finds support in the current record. Therefore, Mr. Hester has shown a substantial likelihood of success on the merits of his claim that Cullman County's bail procedures violate his right under the Fourteenth Amendment to equal treatment under the law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <em>\n    b.

Judge Turner acknowledged that at an initial appearance, a stage at which indigent defendants do not have counsel, he does not inform criminal defendants of the fourteen factors he considers when setting secured bail, so a defendant cannot know what information may be important to share for an assessment of conditions of release. (Doc. 143, p. 91). Judge Turner stated that he asks few questions during an initial appearance, most of the defendants who appear before him lack formal education, and many defendants are illiterate or have learning disabilities. (Doc. 136, p. 289). Having these defendants rely on the information in the release questionnaire for notice is tantamount to no notice at all. These defendants do not receive adequate notice of their constitutional right to pretrial liberty or the evidence they must provide to prove that there are non-monetary conditions of pretrial release that will satisfy the purposes of bail.

(Doc. 129-36, p. 7) (\"The Court ...\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   elicit testimony about the defendant's financial condition.\") (emphasis added). Judge Turner testified that he asks the defendant some questions at the initial appearance, but he \"tr[ies] not to ask too many questions.\" (Doc. 136, pp. 288-89). The record does not indicate whether other judges in Cullman County elicit information from defendants during an initial appearance. Although a check-box on the Order on Initial Appearance and Bond Hearing states, \"Bail: Gave the Defendant the opportunity to make a statement regarding his/her ability to post the bond currently set in this matter,\" there is no evidence that a judge must check this box or that judges give criminal defendants a meaningful opportunity to speak.

Accordingly, the defendants impermissibly leave a criminal defendant's opportunity to be heard, a \"fundamental requirement of due process,\" up to the judge's discretion.\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p349\">\n    424 U.S. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p349\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Caliste\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12527039\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/329/296/#p314\">\n    329 F.Supp.3d 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 311-13,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203727768\">\n    2018 WL 3727768\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *9-10 (finding an opportunity to be heard to be an essential requirement of due process at a hearing where a defendant faces pretrial detention because of indigency) (citing\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

The detention of a criminal defendant in Cullman County without a specific degree of confidence that detention is necessary offends a fundamental principle of justice.

This is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Checking boxes for factors \"considered\" is just as inadequate as jotting abbreviated factors such as \"safety\" or \"criminal history,\" per the hearing officers in\n   <em>\n    ODonnell.\n   </em>\n   Cullman County's check-boxes simply restate the factors in Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure. As a matter of state law, every judge presumably considers these factors when setting a bond amount or imposing other conditions for pretrial release. Aside from the \"Other\" check-box and the corresponding two blank lines, which a judge does not have to use, no check-box provides individualized information or suggests that the judge actually made a finding with respect to a\n   particular factor. For example, when a judge sets secured bail and checks \"[t]he age, background and family ties, relationships and circumstances of the defendant\" or \"the defendant's reputation, character, and health,\" the check communicates no individualized reason for the judge's decision, and a checked box does not indicate whether a factor worked in the defendant's favor or worked against her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   To obtain her freedom after an initial appearance, an indigent defendant must move the state court to reduce her bond. At this stage of Cullman County's bail proceedings, an indigent defendant finally obtains the assistance of appointed counsel, but the record affords appointed counsel no information regarding the rationale for her client's bond, making the task of identifying error and challenging the bail amount unreasonably -- and potentially insurmountably -- difficult. Checking boxes for factors \"considered\" is tantamount to providing counsel with a copy of Rule 7.2(a) of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure ; checkboxes for factors \"considered\" provide no meaningful information to indigent defendants or their appointed counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   To cure these deficiencies, at a minimum, a judge must state on the record why the court determined that setting secured money bond above a defendant's financial means was necessary to secure the defendant's appearance at trial or protect the community.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goldberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p268\">\n    397 U.S. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/#p268\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (due process generally requires the decision maker to \"state the reasons for his determination and indicate the evidence he relied on, though his statement need not amount to a full opinion or even formal findings of fact and conclusions of law\");\n   <em>\n    Holley v.

As discussed above, Cullman County's bail procedures differ significantly from those of the City of Calhoun. Calhoun's Standing Bail Order provided, \" 'those individuals who do not obtain release pursuant to the secured bail schedule ... shall ... be brought before the [Municipal] Court' within 48 hours from their arrest, shall 'be represented by court appointed counsel,' and 'will be given the opportunity to object to the bail amount ..., including any claim of indigency.' \"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518306\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/1245/#p1258\">\n    901 F.3d at 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204000252\">\n    2018 WL 4000252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. Calhoun guaranteed counsel and the opportunity to be heard. The availability of counsel made the opportunity to be heard meaningful. Cullman County offers no such opportunity to indigent defendants at an initial appearance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Notably, the Eleventh Circuit did not address notice, findings, or an evidentiary standard in\n   <em>\n    Walker.\n   </em>\n   Calhoun's Standing Bail Order may have provided those safeguards, but even if the Calhoun Standing Bail Order lacked certain safeguards, Calhoun's requirement of counsel at an initial\n   bail hearing -- perhaps the most significant safeguard -- mitigates other constitutional concerns. For example, if a judge did not give a defendant an opportunity to be heard, counsel could request such an opportunity. If a judge did not inform a defendant of the importance of her ability to post bond, counsel could do so. In contrast, the lack of counsel in Cullman County exacerbates each procedural defect in Cullman's bail system. Lack of adequate notice, an opportunity to be heard, findings on the record, and an evidentiary standard raise significantly more concern when an indigent defendant must confront those obstacles by herself. And at the end of the day, in Calhoun, a detainee simply had to prove that she was indigent to secure release within 48 hours.\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518306\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/901/1245/#p1258\">\n    901 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1266 n.12,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204000252\">\n    2018 WL 4000252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *14 n.12 (\"[T]he Standing Bail Order guarantees release to indigents within 48 hours.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 129-1, pp. 9-11, \u00b6\u00b6 16-17; Doc. 136, pp. 64-65, 112-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Four studies in the record show that pretrial detention is associated with a higher rate of conviction because detention hampers a defendant's ability to prepare a defense and induces people to plead guilty to get out of jail. A study from Harris County, Texas found that \"defendants who are detained on a misdemeanor charge are much more likely than similarly situated [defendants who are released pretrial] to plead guilty and serve jail time. Compared to similarly situated [released defendants], detained defendants are 25% more likely to be convicted ....\" (Doc. 129-19, p. 8). A study from Pittsburgh found that \"pretrial detention leads to a 13% increase in the likelihood of being convicted, an effect largely explained by an increase in guilty pleas among defendants who otherwise would have been acquitted or had their charges dropped.\" (Doc. 129-20, p. 2). A study from Philadelphia and Pittsburg\n   found that \"criminal defendants who are assessed money bail are 12% [ ] more likely to be convicted.\" (Doc. 129-21, p. 4). And data from New York City shows that 92% of people detained pretrial pleaded guilty, while only 24% and 32% of the cases in which the defendant's bail was paid by the Bronx Freedom and Brooklyn Community Bail Fund, respectively, resulted in a criminal conviction. (Doc. 135-3, pp. 3-4, \u00b6\u00b6 11, 14-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Two studies in the record show that pretrial detention is associated with harsher sentences upon conviction. The Harris County, Texas study found that detained individuals were 43% more likely than similarly situated released individuals to be sentenced to a term of incarceration. (Doc. 129-19, p. 8). The Philadelphia study found that defendants detained pretrial generally end up owing $129 more in non-bail court fees and are sentenced to an additional 124 days on average upon conviction. (Doc. 129-20, p. 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   In addition, detention for more than 24 hours before release appears to increase the risk of recidivism. (Doc. 129-1, pp. 11-12, \u00b6\u00b6 18-19; Doc. 136, pp. 73-74). The risk compounds as the length of detention increases. (Doc. 129-1, p. 12, \u00b6 19; Doc. 129-12, pp. 5, 12). For example, the Philadelphia/Pittsburgh study found that secured money bail is \"a significant, independent cause of ... recidivism.... [T]he assessment of money bail increases recidivism in our sample period by 6-9% yearly [ ].\" (Doc. 129-21, p. 4). The study conducted by Dr. Lowenkamp, Dr. VanNostrand, and Dr. Holsinger found that \"[b]eing detained pretrial for two days or more is related to the likelihood of post-disposition recidivism. Generally, as the length of time in pretrial detention increases, so does the likelihood of recidivism at both the 12-month and 24-month points.\" (Doc. 129-12, p. 5). The study also found that \"[t]he longer low-risk defendants are detained, the more likely they are to have new criminal activity pretrial (1.39 times more likely when held 2 to 3 days, increasing to 1.74 when held 31 days or more).\" (Doc. 129-12, p. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   Therefore, individuals who, by law, are presumed innocent suffer irreparable injury when they are detained because they cannot afford to pay secured bond and are deprived of constitutionally adequate procedures for examining potential non-monetary conditions of release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   3.\n   <em>\n    Injury to the Defendants\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   The threatened harms to the putative class outweigh the harms the preliminary injunction may cause to the defendants. The defendants argue that no alternative systems are workable in Cullman County. The defendants contend that detaining every arrestee until an initial appearance would put considerable strain on the county's resources. (Doc. 136, pp. 230-31; Doc. 143, pp. 66-68).\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   Judge Turner stated that the circuit court's resources already are taxed to handle the 72-hour initial appearances, the county has no government-funded pretrial services staff, and the county needs one more judge just to keep up with the circuit court's current case load. (Doc. 143, pp. 51-53). According to Sheriff Gentry, funding for the sheriff's department has not increased since 2009. (Doc. 136, p. 254).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   But alternative pretrial detention policies are cost effective. Three options are readily available to Cullman County at little\n   or no cost. First, Cullman County could release all defendants on unsecured bond. In a case in which a defendant may pose a significant flight risk or a danger to the community, a judge could hold an initial hearing within 48 hours of arrest and, if necessary based on the evidence collected at the hearing, impose additional conditions for release such as a court-appointed third-party custodian or a requirement that the defendant periodically call one of the sheriff's court liaisons. The defendants acknowledge that an unsecured bail schedule would serve their interests. (Doc. 136, p. 211; Doc. 143, pp. 69-70, 133-34).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Alternatively, Cullman County could adopt the Calhoun model and, within 48 hours of arrest, release on recognizance bonds all indigent defendants who prove their indigency on the basis of an objective standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Finally, Cullman County could have all arrestees complete a release questionnaire, updated to conform to the procedural requirements discussed above. The Sheriff's Office could review those questionnaires and release on unsecured bond all low-risk arrestees. The Sheriff's Office would detain all high risk arrestees, wealthy and indigent alike, for an initial appearance at which a judge would assess the necessary conditions for pretrial release.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Holding procedurally sufficient initial appearances consistent with this memorandum opinion would not be overly burdensome. The defendants may be able to provide sufficient notice to arrestees by, for example, editing the affidavit of substantial hardship and release questionnaire and making sure that arrestees who have difficulty understanding the forms receive assistance. Satisfying an evidentiary standard before setting bail should add no extra cost, and making actual findings when requiring a bond may require very little extra time, if any.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Public Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   A preliminary injunction would prevent continuing deprivation of core constitutional rights by prohibiting detention based solely on predetermined secured money bail amounts without sufficient substantive findings and adequate procedural protections. It would not impair the efficacy of the justice system or endanger the public. Therefore, a preliminary injunction would not disserve the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Security\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Because Mr. Hester and members of the putative class are, by definition, indigent, the Court exercises its discretion to waive the security required by Rule 65(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sanders v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Mr. Hester has demonstrated that he is entitled to a preliminary injunction consistent with the analysis in this opinion. The Court will set a telephone conference to discuss the terms of a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   <strong>\n    DONE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   this September 4, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-172\">\n    As will be discussed in greater detail below, when Mr. Hester filed his motion for preliminary injunction, Cullman County followed pretrial procedures different from the procedures in place as of the date of this opinion. Therefore, the language of Mr. Hester's motion pertains to the old version of Cullman County's pretrial procedures. Two weeks after Mr. Hester filed his motion for preliminary injunction, Cullman County revised its pretrial procedures. The parties have conformed their evidence, and the Court conforms its analysis, to Cullman County's new pretrial procedures. The Court considers whether Mr. Hester and the proposed plaintiff class have demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on their constitutional claims as those claims pertain to Cullman County's new pretrial procedures.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-173\">\n    Mr. Hester brings a third claim concerning the promptness of the release hearing. (Doc. 95, p. 20). Mr. Hester does not pursue early relief for that claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-174\">\n    The Court will resolve Sheriff Gentry's motion to dismiss by separate order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-175\">\n    By way of example, in February 2018, Cullman County took 159 individuals into custody pursuant to warrantless arrests, and the county took 61 individuals into custody pursuant to arrest warrants. (Doc. 143, p. 191).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-176\">\n    Alabama Code \u00a7 15-13-106 states: \"Except in capital cases where there is no right to release on bail, no person or defendant shall be committed to any jail in the State of Alabama on a warrant unless there is an amount of bail affixed to the warrant. No person or defendant shall remain in jail anywhere in this state for more than 24 hours for any felony or misdemeanor case without an order of bail, unless bail is not authorized by law.\" Alabama Code \u00a7 15-13-108 states: \"In all cases of misdemeanors and felonies, unless otherwise specified, the defendant is, before conviction, entitled to bail as a matter of right. All sheriffs and police chiefs of this state shall ensure that one of their officers or themselves are available to approve and accept bail 24 hours each day, seven days a week, except during the hours the clerks of the courts provide personnel for bail acceptance and approval.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-177\">\n    In Cullman County, magistrates are court specialists, but they are not lawyers. They are not members of the Alabama State Bar. (Doc. 136, p. 270). Magistrates make probable cause determinations on warrantless arrests within 48 hours of arrest. A criminal defendant typically does not attend a probable cause determination; only the arresting officer attends that proceeding. (Doc. 136, pp. 269-71).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-178\">\n    Even if they can afford to post bond, the sheriff cannot immediately release the following categories of defendants: defendants arrested for failure to appear or on charges that, by statute, require detention for a period of time; defendants who are intoxicated; defendants who are in need of medical attention; or defendants who have holds on their detention from other jurisdictions. (Doc. 129-36, p. 3; Doc. 136, p. 276).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-179\">\n    Sheriff Gentry testified that he encourages family members of arrestees to post property bonds because his office can quickly assess the value of the property using the county's tax records, and a property bond can be obtained with the payment of a $35 fee. (Doc. 136, pp. 224-226). Sheriff Gentry explained that his office can use the contact information provided with a property bond to contact family members if a defendant fails to appear for a hearing. He acknowledged that he would have the same ability if a defendant identified a third-party custodian in conjunction with an unsecured bond. (Doc. 136, pp. 225-28).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-180\">\n    Cullman County also uses cash bonds and ROR (release on recognizance) bonds. By law, the sheriff cannot accept cash bonds; only the clerk of court may accept cash bonds. There is no financial obligation for ROR bonds. The arrestee \"just promise[s]\" that she will return for court dates. If she does not appear as promised, then a judge will issue an arrest warrant for the individual. (Doc. 136, pp. 189-90).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Defendants who post bond at the time of their arrest later have to attend an initial appearance. At that proceeding, a judge informs a defendant of his court date, and the judge may appoint counsel to represent the defendant if the defendant demonstrates financial need. (Doc. 136, pp. 300-01).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    Sheriff Gentry testified that he has two court liaisons on his staff. These staff members offer a release questionnaire and an affidavit of financial hardship to an indigent defendant and, when necessary, the staff members will help a defendant complete the forms.

(Doc. 129-1, p. 6). According to Dr. Demuth, the \"problematic study\" analyzed \"insufficient underlying data,\" used questionable and unreliable shortcuts to approximate data, and employed a statistical technique that did not overcome bias in the dataset.

The record contains no such suggestion. Judge Turner explained that the bail request forms were part of Cullman County's pretrial system before the county's chief judge signed the March 2018 Standing Order, and Judge Turner testified that he has never seen a bail request form for a warrantless arrest.

La. Aug. 6, 2018). In addition, the governor of California recently signed into law the California Money Bail Reform Act, 2018 Cal. Legis. Serv. Ch. 244 (S.B. 10) (effective date October 1, 2019). The Act appears to eliminate money bail and provide all of the procedural safeguards that Mr. Hester argues the Due Process Clause demands Cullman County to provide at an initial appearance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-198\">\n    Generally, pursuant to the California Money Bail Reform Act, pretrial risk assessment services determine whether an individual booked on a charge other than a misdemeanor is \"low risk,\" \"medium risk,\" or \"high risk\" of failure to appear or danger to the public. S.B. 10, \u00a7\u00a7 1320.7(a)-(c), 1320.9. Pretrial risk assessment services release low risk defendants on their own recognizance without a hearing. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.10(b). Pretrial risk assessment services may release medium risk defendants on their own recognizance without a hearing or recommend an arraignment hearing. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.10(c). The court conducts an arraignment hearing for any detained defendant. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.15. \"At arraignment, the court shall order a defendant released on his or her own recognizance or supervised own recognizance with the least restrictive nonmonetary condition ... that will reasonably assure public safety and the defendant's return to court unless the prosecution files a motion for preventive detention.\" S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.17. The court must conduct a hearing on the motion for preventive detention at which the defendant has the right to court-appointed counsel. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.19(d). The defendant must have the opportunity to be heard and present evidence. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.20(c). The court may order detention only if the court determines by clear and convincing evidence that no nonmonetary condition of release will reasonably assure public safety and court appearance and must state its reasons on the record. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.20(d)(1). Otherwise, the court must release the defendant on her own or supervised recognizance. S.B. 10, \u00a7 1320.20(e)(1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-199\">\n    Mr. Hester has not urged the defendants to detain every arrestee until an initial appearance. Cullman County has offered no reason why it could not, at a minimum, use unsecured bond for non-violent arrestees. As noted, individuals released on unsecured bond would have \"skin in the game,\" and unsecured bond would enable Sheriff Gentry to release all non-violent arrestees, not just wealthy arrestees, more quickly.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
