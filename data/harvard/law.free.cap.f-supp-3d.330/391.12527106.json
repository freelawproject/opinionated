That is the question Plaintiff Oakland Physicians Medical Center faced in the fall of 2014, after a Medicare administrative contractor (\"MAC\") issued two Notices of Program Reimbursement (\"NPR\") for the fiscal years ending in 2010 and 2011, which Plaintiff viewed as under-reimbursing it for eligible Medicare costs. How and when Plaintiff could have challenged those determinations is at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Medicare statute gives a dissatisfied provider the right to appeal a MAC's final decision to the Provider Reimbursement Review Board, so long as that provider files a request for review \"within 180 days after notice of the intermediary's final determination.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (a)(3). Medicare regulations, however, confer some discretion on the Board to extend the 180-period. If the provider files the request for review no more than three years from the date of the NPR and can show \"good cause\" for the delay in filing, the Board \"may\" exercise jurisdiction over the appeal.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1836\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c). The regulations define \"good cause\" to mean \"extraordinary circumstances beyond [the provider's] control (such as a natural or other catastrophe, fire, or strike).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 405.1836(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff did not file a request for Board review within 180 days of the 2010 and 2011 NPRs. Instead, Plaintiff moved the MAC to reopen those decisions-a request that the MAC initially granted. But months later, the MAC shut the door on the prospect of a correction by closing the reopenings. In doing so, the MAC found that Plaintiff had contracted away its right to challenge the reimbursement decisions by virtue of a settlement that Plaintiff had reached with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (\"CMS\"). Stunned by the MAC's about face, Plaintiff scrambled and filed appeals with the Board, arguing that Plaintiff had good cause to file beyond the 180-day period. The Board disagreed. It refused to extend the 180-day filing period, finding that Plaintiff's decision not to appeal from the 2010 and 2011 NPRs was within its control and therefore Plaintiff had not met the good-cause standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff now asks this court for two types of relief. First, Plaintiff asks the court to reverse the Board's no \"good cause\" determination. Second, it asks the court to order the MAC to \"complete the reopenings.\" The court declines to do either. The court concludes, contrary to Defendant's argument, that it has jurisdiction to review the Board's refusal to extend the filing deadline, but ultimately finds that the Board's decision that Plaintiff failed to show good cause was neither arbitrary and capricious nor contrary to law. As to Plaintiff's request to compel the MAC to complete the reopenings, the court lacks jurisdiction to do so. Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, the court grants Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment and denies Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

As pertinent here, the Medicare statute authorizes \"judicial review of any final decision of the Board\" by a federal court if the action is filed \"within 60 days of the date on which notice of any final decision by the Board ... is received.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1). The Medicare regulations, however, purport to remove a Board denial of a \"good cause\" extension from the reach of a federal court. Specifically, the regulations provide that \"[a] finding by the Board ... that the provider did or did not demonstrate good cause for extending the time for requesting a Board hearing is not subject to judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1836\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(4). As will be seen, whether that regulation squares with the Medicare statute's allowance of judicial review of \"any final decision of the Board\" is a threshold question in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Medicare regulations provide one additional avenue to correct a MAC reimbursement determination: going back to the source. A provider can ask the MAC to reopen its reimbursement determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1836\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 405.1885(a)(1).

Compl. \u00b6 50; Answer \u00b6 50. The MAC's elimination of the FTE count in the 2009 NPR adversely affected not only the reimbursements for that fiscal year, but also for the two subsequent fiscal years, 2010 and 2011, because of the use of the three-year rolling average in calculating a provider's FTE count. Compl. \u00b6 51; Answer \u00b6 51. In other words, because the MAC zeroed out Plaintiff's FTE count for 2009, Plaintiff's FTE counts for years 2010 and 2011 were lowered, resulting in a reduced reimbursement for those years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   During the 180-day window that followed both determinations, Plaintiff asked the MAC to reopen the 2010 and 2011 NPRs, but did not appeal them to the Board.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 51 (letter regarding 2011 NPR), 138 (letter regarding 2010 NPR).

The D.C. Circuit, however, has rejected that very argument. Recall that in\n   <em>\n    Stovic\n   </em>\n   the Circuit interpreted the Railroad Retirement Act, which contains a judicial review provision that is identical to the Medicare statute: \"any final decision of the Board.\" The Circuit held that\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   control there because of basic differences in statutory text.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stovic\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4326878,12310503\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/826/500/\">\n    826 F.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the decision in\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   as \"based primarily on the [statutory] text\").

Furthermore, the Circuit rebuffed the notion that the interest in finality discussed in\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   ought to drive its\n   interpretation of the Railroad Retirement Act. It explained that \"the [\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   ] Court appealed to the interest in finality only after consulting the text of [Section 405(g) ].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Circuit concluded: \"We highly doubt that the interest in finality would have controlled in [\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   ] if the Social Security Act had provided without qualification for judicial review of '\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   final decision' of the Secretary.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20355\">\n    at 504-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So it is here, too. Under the Medicare statute, Congress has allowed judicial review of \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   final decision of the Board,\" thus encompassing a broader range of \"final decisions\" than in\n   <em>\n    Your Home Visiting Nurse Services\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Califano\n   </em>\n   . A denial of a good-cause extension easily falls within the category of reviewable decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   That leaves Defendant's second argument. Here, Defendant draws a distinction between \"the Board's\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   determination as to its jurisdiction,\" which is reviewable, and the \"denial of a\n   <em>\n    discretionary\n   </em>\n   good cause determination,\" which is not. Def.'s Mem. at 15. Defendant draws this line to distinguish this case from the Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Auburn Regional Medical Center v.

Namely, the Circuit held that it could review a Board decision to dismiss an appeal filed more than a decade after the 180-day period expired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auburn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556120,3386401\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1145/\">\n    642 F.3d at 1147-48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Such a dismissal,\" the Circuit explained, \"is final in any sense of the word.

Defendant argues that the rationale of\n   <em>\n    Auburn\n   </em>\n   does not apply here because in that case, the Board made the\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   determination it had no jurisdiction, whereas here the Board exercised its\n   <em>\n    discretion\n   </em>\n   to deny a good-cause extension. The former is reviewable, Defendant says, whereas the latter is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Defendant's position cannot be squared with the text of the Medicare statute or the agency's own regulations. For starters, the Medicare statute draws no distinction between final Board decisions that are \"legal\" and those that are \"discretionary\"-even assuming a clear line could be drawn between those two categories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, it permits, without qualification, judicial review of \"any\" final decision of the Board.

Importantly, Plaintiff does not take issue with Defendant's narrow definition of \"good cause\" as \"extraordinary circumstances beyond [a provider's] control.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Mem. of P. &amp; A. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J. &amp; in Further Supp. of Pl.'s Mot., ECF No. 20 [hereinafter Pl.'s Combined Mem.], at 15-16. Thus, the only question here under the APA is whether the Board's denial was \"unsupported by substantial evidence\" or \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1) (subjecting final decisions of the Board to the APA's standards of review). Plaintiff makes two arguments for why the court should reverse the Board's decision. First, Plaintiff argues that the Board's decision was not supported by \"substantial evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 26-28. Second, it contends that the Board's decision was contrary to law because the Board did not recognize that it had discretion to consider facts presented in making a good-cause finding and that it was not limited only to those examples of good cause set forth in the regulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    at 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Neither argument is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   First, the Board's ruling easily satisfies the \"substantial evidence\" standard.

It therefore found Plaintiff \"at fault for not timely filing an appeal.\" AR 3. This explanation satisfies the \"substantial evidence\" standard. Based on the evidence presented by Plaintiff,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   AR 98-100, the Board determined that Plaintiff was on notice of the FTE discrepancy contained in the 2009 NPR more than 180 days before it filed an appeal on August 12, 2016. Moreover, Plaintiff also waited \"634 days\" to file its appeal of the 2010 NPR, which issued on November 17, 2014. AR 1. Plaintiff offered no \"extraordinary circumstances beyond its control\" to excuse it for missing the 180-day deadline. The Board's decision therefore is supported by the evidentiary record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Plaintiff makes much of the Board's statement that Plaintiff \"did not provide any documentation explaining why it did not or could not file sooner,\" when it did in fact provide documentation to justify its late filing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 17. But Plaintiff misreads the Board's statement. The absence of documentation to which the Board refers is Plaintiff's failure to appeal the FTE error when it first became apparent in the\n   <em>\n    2009\n   </em>\n   NPR, not Plaintiff's reasons for late-appealing the NPRs for the following two years. The Board correctly observed that Plaintiff did not provide any documentation for why it did not timely appeal from the 2009 NPR.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Plaintiff's second contention that the Board acted arbitrarily and capriciously by failing to recognize that it had discretion to grant a good-cause extension,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 16, is likewise incorrect. The Board made no statement that it viewed \"good cause\" as consisting of only the examples contained in the regulation. To the contrary, the Board plainly considered the facts before it and applied the good-cause standard to those facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   AR 88-89. The Board committed no legal error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff makes one more argument. It claims that it was misled by instructions found on the MAC's website, which stated that the MAC would not consider a request to reopen an NPR if the NPR was the subject of an open appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pl.'s Combined\n   Mem. at 2-5. Plaintiff claims that it took this misleading statement to mean that a claimant could not simultaneously appeal and seek reopening. The flaw in this contention is two-fold. First, Plaintiff did not raise the purportedly misleading statement on the MAC's website before the Board. It therefore cannot press that argument here for the first time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Salt Lake Cmty. Action Program v. Shalala\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11325633,3817244\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/11/1084/\">\n    11 F.3d 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1087 (D.C. Cir. 1993). Second, even if the court could consider such evidence, this argument would still founder. Plaintiff's request is, in essence, a request that this court equitably toll the 180-day period due to the website's misleading statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 4 (insisting that the website error \"should not prejudice the Hospital\"). But the Supreme Court has held that the 180-day limit is not subject to equitable tolling.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Auburn Reg'l Med. Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407338\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/568/145/#p153\">\n    133 S.Ct. at 826-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, even if the website had supplied erroneous information, that fact would not excuse Plaintiff's late filing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   There was a solution to the seeming quandary in which Plaintiff found itself: Plaintiff could have filed a protective appeal. The Medicare regulations make clear that \"[a] request to reopen does not toll the time in which to appeal an otherwise appealable determination or decision.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1885\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2)(ii) (emphasis added). If Plaintiff believed that the proper course was to have the MAC correct the FTE error in the first instance, then to preserve its right of appeal Plaintiff could have simultaneously filed both an appeal to the Board and a request to reopen before the MAC within 180 days. By doing so, Plaintiff would have safeguarded its right to Board review while trying to secure redress through the MAC. Plaintiff did not, however, take this precautionary step.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Accordingly, the court finds that the Board's decision denying Plaintiff a good-cause extension was supported by substantial evidence and was not contrary to law. The court therefore will enter judgment in favor of Defendant as to this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Directing the MAC to Complete the Reopening\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In the alternative, Plaintiff asks the court to order the MAC to reopen the 2009, 2010, and 2011 NPRs and correct the FTE error. Plaintiff contends that the court has the jurisdiction and authority to grant such relief directly under the Medicare statute; through a writ of mandamus; or under the court's federal question jurisdiction. None of these three alternatives provide the court with jurisdiction to review the MAC's decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The first avenue cannot be sustained under the clear text of the Medicare statute upon which Plaintiff relies: 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1). Section 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1) speaks to judicial review of \"any final decision\n   of the Board.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1885\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A decision made by a MAC, quite plainly, is not a \"final decision of the Board.\" For that reason alone, Section 1395\n   <em>\n    oo\n   </em>\n   (f)(1) provides no jurisdictional anchor. The Medicare regulations are to the same effect. They provide: \"A determination or decision to reopen or not to reopen a determination or decision is not a final determination or decision within the meaning of this subpart and is not subject to further administrative review or judicial review.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1885\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1885\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(6). Plaintiff does not argue-nor could it-that this regulation conflicts with the Medicare statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Your Home Visiting Nurse Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076629\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/449/#p454\">\n    525 U.S. at 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076629\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/449/#p454\">\n    119 S.Ct. 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The right of a provider to seek reopening exists only by grace of the Secretary.\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The second and third grounds likewise are unavailable. The Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Your Home Visiting Nurse Services\n   </em>\n   squarely forecloses them.

Therefore, Plaintiff is left with no ground upon which this court can review the MAC's rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Plaintiff acknowledges these hurdles, but nevertheless insists that the MAC's decisions here are reviewable. It argues that\n   <em>\n    Your Home Visiting Nurse Services\n   </em>\n   does not address the situation presented in this case, \"where the MAC granted the Hospital's reopening request ... and substantially completed the reopening.\" Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 18 Plaintiff is right about one thing: The MAC's action here was not merely denying reopening, but rather reopening the NPR and then closing it without revision. But for jurisdictional purposes, this is a distinction without a difference. And Plaintiff points to no statutory or regulatory basis that would warrant different jurisdictional treatment. Indeed, the Medicare regulations are to the contrary, as they proscribe the type of appeals that can be made to the Board from a MAC reopening decision. According to those regulations:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Only those matters that are specifically revised in a revised determination or decision are within the scope of any appeal of the revised determination or decision. Any matter that is not specifically revised (\n   <em>\n    including any matter that was reopened but not revised\n   </em>\n   ) may not be considered in any appeal of the revised determination or decision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20405.1889\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 405.1889\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)-(2) (emphasis added). Plaintiff's NPRs for 2009, 2010, and 2011 were \"reopened but not revised.\" Therefore, Plaintiff could not appeal the MAC's determination to the Board and, correspondingly, to this court. Accordingly, the court lacks jurisdiction to review the MAC's decision in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Apparently, the 2009 NPR issued on April 15,\n    <em>\n     2013\n    </em>\n    , some 18 months after Plaintiff entered into the settlement.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Combined Mem. at 9. Plaintiff does not appear to have alerted the Board to the actual date of the issuance of the 2009 NPR. In any event, the actual date of the NPR is not material.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     PDK Labs. Inc. v.

Cir. 2004) (\"In administrative law, as in federal civil and criminal litigation, there is a harmless error rule.\"). If anything, that clarification proves that Plaintiff was aware of the FTE error as early as April 2013, yet did not appeal the 2009 NPR; nor did it appeal the 2010 or 2011 NPRs within 180 days after learning that the 2009 FTE error had affected the reimbursement amounts for those two years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    For support, Plaintiff provides an affidavit from the lawyer that represented Plaintiff before the Board and the MAC, Paul Evers.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Mot., Ex. 2, Aff. of Paul Evers, ECF No. 16-3. Evers recounts Plaintiff's decision to move to reopen, instead of appeal, and states that he \"reasonably believed that pursuing the Reopenings was appropriate based upon communications with the Hospital, the MAC's website, the relative time and expenses of an appeal given the Hospital's financial condition, my communications with the MAC, the MAC having granted all three Reopening Requests, and the proposed corrective adjustment received in July 2015.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 7(g).
