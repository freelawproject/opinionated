The operative Second Amended Complaint (\"\n   <strong>\n    SAC\n   </strong>\n   \") seeks declaratory and injunctive relief on three counts. Count One alleges that Section 10 of the MDHHS rule, which relates to compliance and enforcement, exceeded the agency's delegated legislative authority in violation of the Maine Administrative Procedures Act, 5 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 8051 - 8074 (2013). Count Two alleges that Section 10 of the rule authorizes the search and seizure of participants' homes and workspaces in violation of the Fourth Amendment and allows questioning of participants in violation of the Fifth Amendment. Count Three alleges that Section 10 of the rule provides for disclosure of medical marijuana patient information to the MDHHS in violation of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\"\n   <strong>\n    HIPAA\n   </strong>\n   \"),\n   Pub.

(ECF No. 32.) For the following reasons, the Defendant's motion to dismiss is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   and the Plaintiffs' motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The MMMA provides for the legal use of marijuana to treat certain debilitating conditions. Under this framework, patients who qualify may obtain marijuana lawfully by: (1) growing limited amounts for themselves, (2) buying it from a registered \"caregiver,\" or (3) buying it from a registered dispensary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   SAC \u00b6 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A \"qualifying patient\" is defined as \"a person who has been diagnosed by a medical provider as having a debilitating medical condition and who possesses a valid written certification regarding medical use of marijuana.\" 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 2422(9). Although qualifying patients can register with the State, they are not required to do so. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2425(9-A). A \"caregiver\" is, in essence, a person who is designated by the qualifying patient to provide care to that patient and who is allowed, for the purposes of assisting the qualifying patient, to grow, store, and sell limited amounts of marijuana for up to five patients. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2422(8-A), 2423-A(2) ; SAC \u00b6 20. Caregivers, unless they fall into an exemption for family members of qualifying patients, are required to register with MDHHS. 22 M.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 2425(9-A), 2423-A(3)(C). Caregivers must complete an application indicating the number (but not the names) of the patients that they serve. SAC Ex. D-1 (ECF 18-4). As of 2016, there were 51,324 qualifying patients and 3,258 caregivers in Maine. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the MMMA became law in 2009, it authorized the MDHHS \"to adopt rules to carry out the purposes of this chapter.\" 22 M.R.S. \u00a7 2424. The MDHHS most recently amended its implementing rules in February 2018 through the Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Program Rule (\"\n   <strong>\n    the 2018 Rule\n   </strong>\n   \"). (ECF No. 18-1.) The 2018 Rule addresses, inter alia, marijuana cultivation, certification and registration of participants, and compliance and enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The authorization to conduct on-site assessments contained in the compliance and enforcement rules found in Section 10 of the 2018 Rule is the focus of this suit. An \"on-site assessment\" is defined as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   the review process to determine compliance. An on-site assessment may include a paper review, interview and inspection of the medical marijuana cultivation, processing and retail sites and administrative locations for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the requirements of the statute and this rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   2018 Rule \u00a7 (1)(Q). Section 10 provides that MDHHS \"may initiate an on-site assessment ... to ensure compliance prior to issuing a registry identification card, as a routine review, in response to an allegation of non-compliance or as part of a plan of correction.\" 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B). During an on-site assessment, the Department's mission is primarily to: (1) verify information submitted in an application; (2) review records; (3) conduct interviews; (4) ensure that the amount of marijuana is within the specified limits and that it is identifiable\n   and maintained as required; (5) take samples; and (6) assess conduct for compliance with the statute. 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On-site assessments may occur in areas \"reportedly used by a registered primary caregiver for conduct authorized by this rule,\" regardless of whether it is a workspace or a residence, and \"areas within a person's residence reportedly used for conduct authorized by this rule.\" 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(3)(a)-(c). Registered caregivers will not receive advance notice before an inspection, but those who are not required to register (e.g., patients) will receive at least 24 hours advance notice. 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(3)(a)-(c). A provision headed \"Prior to entry\" states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The Department will show proof of identity when requesting entry to conduct an on-site assessment and to inspect an area reportedly used for conduct described under this rule and the statute. The Department will also provide the reason for the on-site assessment in standard written form developed by the Department prior to entry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If a registered caregiver or qualifying patient refuses to allow the Department entry during an on-site assessment, the 2018 Rule provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   the Department will consider such an action a failure to comply with the provisions of this rule.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   a. Upon refusal, the Department may refer to law enforcement as a progressive enforcement action when compliance cannot be determined.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   b. Additionally, if denied entry by a cardholder, the Department may also take action to revoke the registry identification card or dispensary registration certificate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(7). Section 10 also states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   Failure to comply with provisions of statute and rule may result in remedial action up to, and including, directed corrective action; suspension, revocation and denial of a registry identification card or registration certificate; civil penalties; and referral to the appropriate agency, department or entity if the conduct is determined to be outside the scope of MMMP, is not appropriate for agency directed corrective action, or has not been rectified through corrective action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   2018 Rule \u00a7 10(A)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Plaintiffs assert that recent passage of the Maine Marijuana Legalization Act (\"\n   <strong>\n    MMLA\n   </strong>\n   \") makes available marijuana that is less regulated and \"will likely entice current medical marijuana patients, and future such patients, to consider foregoing compliance\" with the MMMA. SAC \u00b6 54. The Plaintiffs fear that this will lead patients to seek marijuana from sources that are not subject to background checks and do not provide careful prescriptions. SAC \u00b6 54. The Plaintiffs allege that \"[t]his enticement will be substantially greater if the present search-and-seizure provisions under the 2018 Rule that is the subject of this action are not enjoined with the attendant disclosure to the state of Maine of the identity of medical marijuana patients within this state.\" SAC \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There are four plaintiffs in this suit. Plaintiffs Justin Olsen and Nancy Shaw are authorized caregivers under the MMMA who conduct business as New World Organics, Inc. in Belfast, Maine. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 9-10. As caregivers, they receive patient designations and certifications from medical providers, including records regarding the patients' medical conditions and symptoms. SAC \u00b6 31. They also counsel qualifying patients on the use of medical marijuana and dispense medical marijuana to qualifying patients. SAC \u00b6 28. Plaintiffs Jane Doe and John Doe are qualifying patients under the MMMA. SAC\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Jane Doe has cancer, and John Doe experiences pain from injuries sustained in combat while deployed with the U.S. Army. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 11-12. Olsen and Shaw \"have acted\" as the caregivers for Jane Doe and John Doe. SAC \u00b6 21. The Defendant is Ricker Hamilton, in his official capacity as the Commissioner of the MDHHS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs Olsen and Shaw received a form letter from the MDHHS dated May 10, 2018, with the subject line \"Maine Medical Use of Marijuana Program (MMMP) 2018 Rule.\" Olsen Decl. Ex. A-1 (ECF No. 47-1). The letter was addressed to \"MMMP Participant,\" and stated that \"MMMP is implementing its revised rule (original implementation) as of the date of this letter,\" and included a link the MDHHS's website on the 2018 Rule. Olsen Decl. Ex. A-1. A Frequently Asked Questions section of the website includes the following text:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 10\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    Can the Department inspect a patient?\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Yes, the Department may request permission to inspect the premises used by a qualifying patient for conduct authorized under this chapter. The Department assesses conduct reported as a violation of the rule or statute by making contact by phone or requesting access to locations where this conduct is reportedly taking place. The patient may voluntarily permit entry or request an administrative warrant before allowing the Department to enter the location which may be the patient's home. When the Department is refused entry or otherwise unable to ensure compliance, the Department may proceed with obtaining an administrative warrant and/or refer to law enforcement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Olsen Decl. Ex. A-4 (ECF No. 47-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Plaintiffs filed this suit on January 16, 2018. On the same day, the Plaintiffs also filed a motion to proceed under the aliases Jane Doe and John Doe. (ECF No. 4.) The Plaintiffs subsequently amended their complaint twice; the operative SAC was filed January 30, 2018. On January 31, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. (ECF No. 19.) Later on the same day, the Governor issued a public notice that he would stay the implementation of the 2018 Rule by 90 days until May 1, 2018, and the Plaintiffs filed a motion to stay this action for 90 days, which was granted on February 2, 2018. (ECF Nos. 21, 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On May 7, 2018, the Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (\"\n   <strong>\n    TRO\n   </strong>\n   \") or for an expedited briefing schedule. (ECF No. 29.) I responded to the TRO motion that same day, issuing a text order granting the expedited briefing schedule but reserving on the motion for the TRO. On May 14, 2018, ahead of oral argument on the preliminary injunction, the Defendant filed a motion to dismiss the SAC under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of justiciability and 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim. (ECF No. 32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Oral argument was held May 23, 2018, at which I conditionally granted the motion to proceed under aliases. (ECF No. 42.) This order follows on the pending motions for preliminary injunction, TRO, and dismissal of the SAC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court has an obligation to ensure that it has jurisdiction before proceeding to the merits.\n   <em>\n    Steel Co. v.

Article III provides federal courts with limited jurisdiction, which only extends to actual cases and controversies. The related justiciability doctrines of standing and ripeness are at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The justiciability doctrine of standing requires that a plaintiff allege \"such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to assure that concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Baker v.

Count Two: Constitutional Challenges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Plaintiffs' articulated injury under Count Two is that the on-site inspections provided for in the 2018 Rule would violate their rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 5, 46-48. These injuries could occur, they allege, through the unlawful search of their medical records at the caregivers' facility, through an unlawful search of their private homes, and through interviews that take place during the search. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 46, 48. Because no such on-site assessments have yet taken place, the threshold inquiry for both the standing and ripeness inquiries is whether the Plaintiffs have adequately alleged an imminent, threatened injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   An \"injury is imminent if it is certainly impending or if there is a substantial risk that harm will occur.\"\n   <em>\n    Reddy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12176648\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/845/493/#p501\">\n    845 F.3d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the context of this facial challenge to the 2018 Rule, I consider whether the injury is certainly impending or there is a substantial risk that such a search or interrogation would occur if the Department attempts to conduct an on-site assessment under Section 10. Because there are numerous ambiguities within the 2018 Rule, it is difficult, if not impossible, to tell whether any such attempt would result in conduct that violates the Fourth or Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   First, as the State points out, the Department would have to decide to seek an on-site assessment. Given that there are two inspectors and approximately 55,000 qualifying patients and caregivers, the likelihood of these Plaintiffs being subjected to an on-site assessment is limited.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   While it is possible that the State would beef up its enforcement branch and hire additional inspectors, at present the likelihood of an on-site assessment is quite low.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Second, even if state inspectors decide to conduct an on-site assessment, it is apparent from Section 10 that the caregivers and patients can refuse entry. Section 10's language that the Department will show proof of identity when\n   <em>\n    requesting\n   </em>\n   entry implies that inspectors cannot insist upon entry. 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(4). The letter sent by the Department to Jane and John Doe reinforces this idea, stating that \"the Department may request permission to inspect the premises\" and suggesting that a patient could refuse entry and ask the officials to seek an administrative warrant. Olsen Decl. Ex. A-4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Plaintiffs argue that if they refuse entry they will be expelled from the protection of the medical marijuana program. Patients will lose their right to use marijuana as medication, and caregivers will lose their livelihood. But these predictions rest on assumptions. Section 10's provision dealing with refusal of entry contemplates that the Department will consider a refusal to allow entry a \"failure to comply\" with 2018 Rule. 2018 Rule \u00a7 10(B)(7). But what the Department will ultimately do with such a failure to comply is unclear. There are no criminal penalties attached to such a refusal, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Patel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Department, as discussed above, has considerable discretion in choosing remedial action; in addition to revocation, remedial options include directed corrective action, suspension, and civil penalties. 2018 Rule \u00a7 (10)(A)(4). Section 10's remedial actions themselves are ambiguous. \"Directed corrective action,\" for example, is an undefined term. None of the remedial options available to the Department has been tested in the state courts. 2018 Rule \u00a7 (10)(A)(4). And while the revocation of a registry identification card is possible, there are due process protections which attach to such a revocation, including written notice and a right to appeal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2018 Rule \u00a7\u00a7 10(H), (I);\n   <em>\n    Toilet Goods Ass'n, Inc. v.

The Plaintiffs seek a declaratory judgment under Count Three that they are not bound by Section 10 of the 2018 Rule to disclose the identity of their qualifying patients. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 71, 75.
