The government has proposed one such fledgling theory of criminal forfeiture in the instant case: based on Defendant Keith Young's conviction at trial of one count of unlawful possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, the government seeks a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $180,000, which is the estimated value of the two kilograms of heroin that law enforcement officers seized from Young's residence. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Supp.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Mem. Regarding Forfeiture (\"Gov't's Supp. Mem.\"), ECF No. 59, at 8-9.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the Court understands it, the government's proposed forfeiture order rests on the assumption that Young once used money ($180,000) to \"facilitate\" his illegal drug-distribution conduct when he bought the recovered heroin, and is also rooted in the contention that the spent $180,000 qualifies as forfeitable facilitating property for the purpose of section 853(a)(2), separate and apart from the recovered heroin upon which that figure is based. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ) Thus, despite the fact that the government has already seized the very drugs that Young allegedly tendered $180,000 to purchase, the government maintains that Young should also be ordered to forfeit an additional $180,000 as a criminal penalty under section 853(a)(2). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) This Court declined to adopt this novel drug-seizure-plus-equivalent-money-judgment criminal forfeiture theory on July 18, 2018. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Order of Forfeiture, ECF No. 65, at 5-6 (requiring Young to forfeit property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds obtained from the drug offense, as well as certain other facilitating property, but not including the requested money judgment).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Memorandum Opinion explains the basis for the Court's conclusion that the government's proposed $180,000 money-judgment forfeiture order must be rejected. In short, the Court is confident that there is no legal basis for the government's contention that Congress has authorized\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the relinquishment of forfeitable property that the government has seized from a criminal defendant\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the amount of money that the defendant purportedly previously used to acquire that same property. In this Court's view, such a forfeiture order constitutes improper double counting that the criminal forfeiture statutes neither direct nor envision. Moreover, the Court's double-counting concern exists without regard to the reason that the seized property is subject to forfeiture, which makes the fact that the heroin at issue here is itself illegal contraband (and is thus inherently forfeitable) entirely irrelevant to the applicable forfeiture analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 25, 2017, agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") executed a search warrant at Young's residence in Southeast Washington, D.C., after investigating trash from the residence on three previous occasions in the preceding weeks. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Revised Final Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\"), ECF No. 67, \u00b6 7.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the search of the home, law enforcement agents recovered: 2,020 grams of heroin; a Glock 21, .45 caliber firearm with an extended magazine containing 25 rounds of .45 caliber ammunition; other ammunition of various types; $14,707 in United States currency; and other drug-related goods, such as sifters, a blender, a bottle of Mannitol, ziploc bags, and a digital scale. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 8-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 27, 2017, Young was charged in a three-count indictment with possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin, in violation of sections 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A)(i) of Title 21 of the United States Code (Count One); possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, in violation of\n   section 922(g)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code (Count Two); and using, carrying, and possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking offense, in violation of section 924(c)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code(Count Three). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Indictment, ECF No. 4, at 1-2.) The indictment also put Young on notice that the government sought criminal forfeiture in the case under section 853(a) of Title 21 of the United States Code with respect to Count One, and under section 924(d) of Title 18 of the United States Code with respect to Counts Two and Three, including forfeiture of certain gun- and ammunition-related specific property; $14,707 in U.S. currency recovered on April 25, 2017; and a money judgment in an unspecified amount. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4.) The case proceeded to a jury trial, which commenced on April 23, 2018, and on April 27, 2018, the jury convicted Young of Count One (possession with intent to distribute one kilogram or more of heroin) and Count Two (possession of a firearm by a felon), but acquitted Young of Count Three (possessing a firearm during a drug trafficking offense). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Verdict Form, ECF No. 55, at 1-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the lead-up to the trial and during the post-conviction proceedings, the government vigorously maintained that, as part of any forfeiture order, it was entitled to a money judgment in the amount of $180,000-an amount equal to the estimated value of the two kilograms of heroin that had been seized from Young's residence. In a pretrial memorandum regarding forfeiture, the government specifically announced its intention to seek a money judgment in the value of the recovered heroin in addition to the forfeiture of $14,707 in cash found in Young's home in the event of a conviction under Count One, and the forfeiture of the recovered firearm and ammunition if Young was convicted under Counts Two or Three. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Pretrial Mem. Regarding Applicable Procedures for Forfeiture Phase of Trial (\"Gov't's Pretrial Mem.\"), ECF No. 42, at 9-10.) Similarly, in a supplemental memorandum regarding forfeiture, the government reiterated its position that it was requesting \"a forfeiture money judgment reflecting the amount of money that the defendant used to purchase the approximately two kilograms of heroin the jury found in the defendant's possession[,]\" on the grounds that Young had allegedly used that amount of money to facilitate the commission of his crime by buying the drugs. (Gov't's Supp. Mem. at 8.) With respect to the fact that the two bricks of heroin had been seized, the government asserted that the heroin was \"contraband and [Congress] demanded its immediate forfeiture [ ] independent of any other forfeiture authority\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 9 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) ) ), and thus, \"neither the defendant, nor any third party, can maintain a legal interest in the drugs\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   This Court held a forfeiture hearing in this matter on July 5, 2018. During the hearing, defense counsel conceded that the requested specific property-including the firearm, ammunition, and $14,707 in U.S. currency-was subject to forfeiture, but objected to the $180,000 forfeiture money judgment that the government had proposed. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr. at 4:16-5:8, 40:12-16.) The government maintained its position regarding the $180,000 money judgment, but asked the Court to consider, in the alternative, a money judgment in the amount of $40,000, representing the amount that the record evidence suggested Young was owed from various people to whom he had sold drugs. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    at 42:5-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Given this request, which was followed by defense counsel's objection that the defense had not previously been notified of this theory of forfeiture, the Court instructed the government to file a supplemental brief regarding the alleged justification\n   for a $40,000 money judgment. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    at 44:1-48:13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The government subsequently filed a second supplemental memorandum, pointing to evidence in the record (including Young's own statements) to the effect that Young was owed $40,000 from street-level distributors to \"be paid back after the narcotics that were fronted are sold,\" and with respect to this amount, asserting that the anticipated $40,000 qualified as facilitating property that is forfeitable in the form of a money judgment. (Gov't's Supp. To Mem. Regarding Forfeiture (\"Gov't's 2d Supp. Mem.\"), ECF No. 62, at 5) Defense counsel did not file any written response to this forfeiture argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 16, 2018, this Court issued its preliminary order of forfeiture. The Order required forfeiture of the firearm, ammunition, and $14,707 in U.S. currency-items that the parties did not dispute. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim. Order of Forfeiture at 3-4.) The Court also found that Young was owed $40,000 as proceeds obtained from drug sales, and that that money was presently unavailable, such that a money judgment in the amount of $40,000 based on sections 853(a)(1) and 853(p) of Title 21 of the United States Code was warranted. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    at 4-5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The Court's preliminary order of forfeiture, which became final at Young's sentencing on July 19, 2018, did not order a money judgment in the amount of $180,000, as the government had requested; as explained below, this Court finds such an order inappropriate under the circumstances presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In the instant matter, the forfeiture related to Young's drug offense (Count One of the indictment) is governed by Title 21, section 853 of the United States Code, which Congress enacted pursuant to the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 (\"the CFA\"), Pub. L. No. 98-473, \u00a7\u00a7 302-03,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=98%20Stat.%201837\">\n    98 Stat. 1837\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 2040-57 (1984).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Under section 853(a), forfeiture applies to \"any person\" convicted of certain drug offenses that are criminalized in Title 21.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

This section takes a broad view of proceeds that covers both the original proceeds of criminal behavior and what Congress refers to as \"derivative proceeds[,]\" i.e., property that the original proceeds were used on or exchanged for, \"such as corporate stock, legitimate businesses, and real estate which may be unrelated to the drug operation, but which are purchased, maintained, indirectly or directly, with the proceeds of the illegal transactions.\" H.R. Rep. 98-845, pt. 1, at 5 (1984). This is apparent in the plain language of the section, which refers not only to the proceeds themselves (\"property constituting ... any proceeds\") but also \"property ... derived from[ ] any proceeds[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1). Likewise, the offending proceeds or derivative property can have been \"obtained[ ] directly\n   <em>\n    or indirectly\n   </em>\n   \" from the crime.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).

These courts have typically authorized money judgments when established proceeds of the defendant's criminal activity are no longer in the defendant's possession at the time of sentencing and the government has not otherwise recovered such proceeds. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Part III.A,\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   This Court has declined to order a $180,000 money judgment based on the estimated monetary value of the two kilograms of heroin that the government seized from Young's residence because, as explained fully below, there is no statutory or common-sense justification for the government's suggestion that it is authorized\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   to seize contraband drugs\n   <em>\n    and also\n   </em>\n   to obtain a money judgment for the amount that the defendant allegedly used to purchase those very same drugs. The government's request for a money judgment under these circumstances bears no relationship to the usual purpose of money judgments in the criminal forfeiture context, which is to prevent the dissipation of illegal proceeds by an offender who might otherwise profit from his ill-gotten gains. What is more, the proposed money judgment finds absolutely no support in the text of the applicable criminal forfeiture statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As requested here, if the $180,000 money judgment is meant to be a substitute for the heroin that the government seized from Young's house, the government has not adequately explained how the requested money judgment could possibly qualify as substitute property within the meaning of section 853(p)(1), when the drugs were\n   actually recovered and thus were not dissipated or otherwise unavailable. Alternatively, to read section 853(a)(2) as the government suggests-i.e., to authorize a money judgment for the monetary value of seized drugs on the grounds that the money the defendant used to purchase those drugs is inherently tainted 'facilitating' property even though it was spent on something that the government has already seized-constitutes impermissible double counting and stretches the forfeiture doctrine beyond all reasonable limits. And the fact that the property recovered here (the heroin) is itself illegal contraband, means only that there is an independent basis for the government to have seized the drugs and is otherwise entirely irrelevant to the proper criminal forfeiture analysis under section 853.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Criminal forfeiture was not part of the federal criminal justice system in the United States at all until 1970, when Congress passed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Avital Blanchard,\n   <em>\n    The Next Step in Interpreting Criminal Forfeiture\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20Cardozo%20L.%20Rev.%201415\">\n    28 Cardozo L.

Circuit's approval of money judgments in the amount of the entirety of a defendant's ill-gotten gains rests largely on its conclusion that the court should ensure that the defendant realizes the economic impact of a forfeiture order, even in cases where the defendant has inadequate assets at the time of sentencing as a result of the defendant's own dissipation of the forfeitable assets. Similarly, as noted above, all of the other circuit decisions that are cited in\n   <em>\n    Day\n   </em>\n   approved money judgments to stand in for forfeitable proceeds under section 853(a)(1) when the defendant no longer possessed those proceeds due to his willful spending or dissipation of them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

J. Crim. L. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 74 (2004) (\"Usually, the Government seeks a money judgment in cases where the defendant has obtained a certain quantity of money as the proceeds of the offense, but the money cannot be found.\"). Thus, money judgments are ordinarily deemed appropriate when there is some known, forfeitable asset-e.g., the proceeds of, or other property derived from the proceeds of, an established criminal offense-that the defendant should possess but that the government has not been able to recover because the defendant has made it unavailable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This benchmark does not appear in the facts of the instant case, and this Court has struggled mightily to ascertain how the standard rationale for money judgments provides any justification for the $180,000 money judgment that the government seeks here. The government suggests that it is entitled to a money judgment \"reflecting the amount of the money that the defendant used to purchase the approximately two kilograms of heroin [that] the jury found [to be] in the defendant's possession with intent to distribute\" because Young apparently spent that amount of money to facilitate his crime by buying the heroin that he possessed for distribution. (Gov't's Supp. Mem at 8.) But under this theory of facilitating property, the $180,000 was not willfully dispersed by Young in an attempt to avoid forfeiture, nor is it missing in any meaningful sense; rather, Young allegedly used that money to buy the drugs as part of the underlying offense, which means that it has been recovered by the government in the form of the asset that Young purchased. In other words, while it is the\n   <em>\n    unavailability\n   </em>\n   of forfeitable assets that appropriately gives rise to a money judgment that prevents the defendant from dispersing or disposing of such assets, the government's theory here is that the money Young spent to buy the drugs at issue constitutes \"facilitating\" property, which means that that money is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   properly characterized as missing or unavailable; indeed,\n   <em>\n    its whereabouts are known\n   </em>\n   : the $180,000 has been traded for the goods that comprise or sustain the defendant's criminal acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A non-monetary example helps to illustrate the point. Imagine that a defendant is convicted of the production of child pornography under Title 18, section 2251(a) of the United States Code, and the evidence demonstrates that he used a fancy computer to edit and distribute the illegal pornographic images. There is no question that the defendant's computer equipment is properly considered facilitating property under section 853(a)(2), because that equipment was a tool that aided the creation of the illegal images. And if the prosecutors can show that the defendant once possessed and utilized such a computer to make child pornography, but that the computer went missing prior to its recovery as a forfeitable item, one can reasonably infer that the defendant sold it or\n   gave it away to a third party, and there is at least a reasonable argument that a money judgment should be imposed against the defendant for the value of the computer equipment because it was forfeitable property that the defendant should have had but that now cannot be located due to the defendant's own efforts. By contrast, when the government posits that the forfeitable \"facilitating\" property is the money that a defendant used to purchase illegal drugs that the government has recovered, that money\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   been located-its whereabouts are clear-as the government here notes, the defendant exchanged it for the drugs. (Gov't's Pretrial Mem at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   To be sure, the defendant no longer physically possesses the particular dollars that he allegedly used to buy the illegal narcotics, but that is just the natural and necessary consequence of the very transaction that constitutes the defendant's criminal conduct; it is not due to any willful action by the defendant to thwart forfeiture by dissipating assets that were used to facilitate the commission of some\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   crime. And it is really only in the latter circumstance that a forfeiture money judgment-to substitute for forfeitable assets that the defendant has so dissipated, hidden, or disbursed-makes any sense. Put another way, in the instant context, the government has not alleged that the $180,000 represents missing ill-gotten gains from other criminal conduct by Young, nor has it shown that that money was a forfeitable asset that Young has willfully dissipated, squirreled away, or otherwise removed from the government's reach so as to thwart its forfeiture in a manner that justifies holding him responsible for surrendering that money in the form of a forfeiture money judgment. Instead, the government freely admits that the $180,000 was\n   <em>\n    tendered in exchange for the drugs\n   </em>\n   , and if anything, became tainted\n   <em>\n    by that very act\n   </em>\n   -i.e., the money was effectively converted into the purchased heroin as part of the very activity that, according to the government, makes the money forfeitable 'facilitating' property in the first place. This set of circumstances distinguishes this case from those in which various circuits have authorized money judgments, and this Court sees no reason why the holdings of those circuits should be considered to extend to the facts presented here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Where The Government Has Seized Forfeitable Property, Seeking A Money Judgment For The Value Of That Property Is Impermissible Double Counting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The government's forfeiture money-judgment theory fails for an additional reason: under the present circumstances, the $180,000 forfeiture money judgment that the government requests constitutes impermissible double counting in a manner that contravenes well-established principles of punishment and sentencing. To understand why this is so, recall that the $180,000 money judgment that the government seeks is specifically pegged to the value of the two kilograms of heroin that the government recovered from Young's house. The amount at issue is not a separate, or even separable, sum-the government readily admits that it has seized two kilograms of heroin that it says is worth $180,000, and by requesting a money judgment in that amount, it now seeks the cash value of those drugs as well. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Supp. Mem at 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The government has provided no convincing argument for why such a double recovery is permissible under section 853(a)(2). To be clear, that statutory provision does authorize the recovery of any facilitating property that is in the defendant's possession (or that is known to have been, and should be, in the defendant's\n   possession). But Young did not have $180,000 in his possession when the government executed its search warrant; he had $180,000 worth of heroin. Thus, even setting aside the fact that the $180,000 is not missing in any meaningful sense (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Part III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ), the money judgment that the government seeks here is\n   <em>\n    in addition to\n   </em>\n   the heroin that the government has seized, and is thus tantamount to the recovery of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   a forfeitable asset of the defendant (the drugs)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the money that the defendant spent to procure that asset. Nothing in the statute even remotely suggests that Congress intended this result, and nothing in the government's sentencing memoranda or oral argument adequately accounts for this significant double-counting problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The strangeness of the government's recovered-item-plus-money-judgment theory of criminal forfeiture becomes evident when one considers, again, the example of the child pornography defendant and the computer equipment he used to commit the crime. Assume that instead of being missing, the offending computer is actually found in the defendant's home and is recovered. Under the government's theory, the government could seek forfeiture of\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the computer\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   a money judgment in the value of the computer, on the grounds that that amount of money was used to purchase the computer equipment and thus such money arguably facilitated the child pornography crime. But the Court finds no trace of statutory authority for the proposed seizure of the tainted asset\n   <em>\n    and also\n   </em>\n   its monetary value (in the form of a money judgment). Nor does the government point to any prior case in which this theory of forfeiture has been thoroughly evaluated and ultimately approved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To the contrary, in a virtually identical situation, the Second Circuit expressed genuine skepticism about the propriety of such a double recovery.

But neither of these cases involved the granting of a forfeiture money judgment in the amount of the money that the defendant used to purchase drugs\n   <em>\n    in a situation where the drugs had also been seized\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   , the drugs forming the basis of the drug conspiracy conviction had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   been recovered, and the district court estimated the amount of facilitating money based on testimony offered by witnesses who had sold drugs to the defendants on a regular basis during a period that spanned several years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4316837\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/885/791/\">\n    885 F.Supp.2d at 792-799\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Supp. Mem. at 8-9.) To hear the government tell it, the two kilograms of heroin that were recovered from Young's home are essentially a nullity for forfeiture purposes, because illegal drugs are \"contraband and [Congress] demanded [their] immediate forfeiture [ ] independent of any other forfeiture authority[.]\" (Gov't's Supp. Mem. at 9 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (f)(1) ).) Thus, the government's brief points out that \"neither the defendant, nor any third party, can maintain a legal interest in the drugs\" in the first place. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, during the hearing, government counsel argued that the drugs at issue here were plainly distinguishable from other forfeitable property, because the government is required to destroy the seized heroin by law and cannot resell, repurpose, or otherwise recover value from the heroin, in contrast to other types of forfeitable goods. (Forfeiture Hr'g Tr. at 9:8-10:17;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20881\">\n    at 10:4-6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e don't have $180,000 worth of goods because it's destroyed immediately pursuant to statute.\").) Neither of these heroin-as-contraband arguments cures the above-identified problems with the government's forfeiture money-judgment theory, and thus neither persuades this Court that the government's $180,000 forfeiture request passes muster.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   First of all, it is clear to this Court that the government has taken its \"no legal property interest\" in illegal narcotics argument much too far. To have a legally enforceable property interest in something generally means that one has the right to\n   exclude others from using it, as well as the concomitant right to bring a legal action to prevent its unauthorized use or to compel others to return it to its rightful owner.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Joseph William Singer,\n   <em>\n    The Reliance Interest in Property\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20Stan.%20L.%20Rev.%20611\">\n    40 Stan. L. Rev. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650 (1988) (describing the state's role in enforcing exclusivity as one dimension of property interests). Thus, the property interest that a state regulates and enforces as a matter of law is, as a general matter, merely an interest in\n   <em>\n    exclusivity\n   </em>\n   , and the\n   <em>\n    absence\n   </em>\n   of such a property interest (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Supp. Mem. at 9) says nothing about whether the person who is in possession of the item at issue paid good money for it, nor does it bear on whether the government can require such payor to relinquish not only that item but also the amount of money that was tendered to purchase it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Consequently, while the government is surely correct when it contends that Young had no \"legal property interest\" in the two kilograms of heroin that he allegedly tendered $180,000 to purchase (in the sense that he had no exclusive right to those drugs and could not prevent their seizure by the government), it does not follow that the contraband status of the seized narcotics renders that heroin valueless from Young's standpoint, such that the government should not be deemed to have affected an actual deprivation of a valuable asset of Young's for the purpose of the forfeiture statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) (defining \"[p]roperty subject to forfeiture\" broadly, to include all \"tangible and intangible personal property,\" and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   expressly excluding property that is otherwise forfeitable as contraband). In other words, contraband or no, Young cannot get his money back; by virtue of the government's seizure, he is out the $180,000 that he paid for those illicit goods. And the fact that the government might rightly rely on a separately applicable statutory provision to justify seizing the heroin that Young allegedly tendered $180,000 to purchase does not fix the double counting problem from the standpoint of the one whose conduct forfeiture is meant to punish-regardless, that same asset is being counted twice.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Segal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3562087\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/495/826/#p839\">\n    495 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   839-40 ;\n   <em>\n    Ofchinick\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536051\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/883/1172/#p1182\">\n    883 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1182 ;\n   <em>\n    Demik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%207360425\">\n    2005 WL 7360425\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The government's other contention-that the two kilograms of heroin cannot be resold or otherwise repurposed to recover its value-fares no better. The animating idea behind this argument appears to be that the government is entitled to the issuance of a money judgment whenever it cannot be made whole with respect to forfeited items, but\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   concept has no basis in forfeiture doctrine, and in fact, it ignores the clear purpose of the criminal forfeiture provisions. As explained in Part II,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Congress has made criminal forfeiture an aspect of a defendant's sentence, and there is no question that forfeiture is intended \"to operate as punishment for criminal conduct[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Libretti v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"328015\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/29/#p38\">\n    516 U.S. 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 38-39,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"328015\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/29/#p38\">\n    116 S.Ct. 356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"328015\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/516/29/#p38\">\n    133 L.Ed.2d 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Thus, the forfeiture tally is appropriately made based not on what the government\n   <em>\n    gains\n   </em>\n   , but on what the defendant\n   <em>\n    loses\n   </em>\n   as a penalty for his criminal acts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   For the reasons explained above, neither the language of the criminal forfeiture statute nor its theory and purpose supports the government's request for a $180,000 money judgment as a representation of the estimated value of the heroin that the government recovered from Young's home. Thus, this Court has rejected the government's request for a $180,000 money judgment under Title 21, section 853(a)(2) of the United States Code under the circumstances presented in this case.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    Page numbers herein refer to those that the Court's electronic case-filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    Neither party objected to the facts outlined in the Probation Office's Presentence Investigation Report (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    PSR at 27), and the Court adopted the facts contained in the report during Young's sentencing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-59\">\n    The Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984 constitutes Chapter III of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 (\"CCCA\").\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Terry Reed,\n    <em>\n     Criminal Forfeiture under the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984: Raising the Stakes\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%20747\">\n     22 Am.

Notably, some of the forfeiture literature refers to the CCCA and the CFA interchangeably.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-60\">\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    n. 3,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    For this same reason, the government's argument that the recovered drugs should be deemed to have no value because they \"cannot be converted into any amount of value\" is unconvincing. (Forfeiture Hr'g Tr. at 12:22-23.) There is nothing in the law that requires the court to ensure either that the government is able to recover full value from its resale of forfeited property or that it be made whole for the difference between what the defendant relinquishes and what the government receives if it is unable to resell forfeited goods.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
