KELLY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   From 2008 to 2016, Plaintiff Tiffany Washington was a sergeant in the Metro Transit Police Department (the \"MTPD\"), a component of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (\"WMATA\"), which operates the public transit system commonly known as the Metro. She worked at the MTPD's Revenue Collection Facility in Alexandria, Virginia, which processes fares gathered from Metro stations. During Washington's shift on September 18, 2015, the train transporting the fares-known informally as the \"money train\"-broke down and was repaired. Washington then left early for a medical appointment, without ensuring that another supervisor took her place. The money train then broke down again. Washington failed to notify any on-duty official with supervisory authority about the breakdown, and the two officers accompanying the train were left without any supervisor in charge for several hours. Following an investigation, the MTPD determined that Washington had violated its policies and demoted her in 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Washington has sued WMATA under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , claiming that her demotion amounted to unlawful discrimination based on her race, color and gender, as well as unlawful retaliation for a complaint of harassment she filed in January 2015. WMATA has moved for summary judgment on all claims, arguing that no reasonable jury could find for Washington on the evidence in this case. ECF No. 17. For the reasons explained\n   below, the Court will grant WMATA's motion and enter judgment in its favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Washington is an African-American woman. Am. Compl. \u00b6 1.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   WMATA hired her as an MTPD officer in 2001. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 1. In 2008, she was promoted to sergeant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 2. As a sergeant, she acquired new supervisory responsibilities. That is because MTPD \"officers\" (that is, those with a rank lower than sergeant) do not have supervisory authority, while MTPD \"officials\" (that is, MTPD personnel ranked sergeant and above) supervise the officers under their command.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9, 12-15. As of September 2015, Washington was assigned to work at WMATA's Revenue Collection Facility (the \"Facility\") in Alexandria.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. Her shift ran from 9:30 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2016, Washington was demoted from sergeant back to \"officer.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 25; Pl.'s Ex. 18 (Letter of Demotion). The asserted basis for Washington's demotion lay in events that occurred on September 18, 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 18 (Letter of Demotion). That morning, two MTPD officers (Officers Perkins and Gilani) reported for duty at the Facility to accompany the \"money train\" transporting Metro fares.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 46. That morning and early afternoon, the money train experienced mechanical problems and broke down at least once.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 10-11 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 4 (Gaddis Dep.) at 144:14-146:6, 152:16-154:1). No later than 1:15 p.m., Washington's supervisor, Lieutenant Biggs, left work as per his daily schedule, leaving Washington as the only \"official\" in charge of the Facility. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6\u00b6 39-40, 68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At around 4:15 p.m., Washington left the Facility for a medical appointment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 47. She claims that Biggs had approved her taking medical leave earlier that day, although the parties dispute this fact.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52, 54. Washington does not dispute that the only other persons she notified of her departure were two officers stationed at the Facility (Officers Patterson and Dean).\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, she did not notify any official with supervisory authority (other than, in her telling, Biggs) that she would be leaving early.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53. She instructed the senior officer at the Facility to \"check-off and secure the building\" in her absence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At some point either shortly before or after Washington left, the money train broke down again.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. Washington claims that she found out about the breakdown by way of a text message from the senior officer at the Facility (Officer Patterson). Pl.'s Opp'n at 12 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 128:4-9). At around 4:45 p.m., Washington called one of the officers on the money train (Officer Perkins) to discuss the situation. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 66;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 12 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 2 (Washington Aff.) ). According to Officer Perkins, he did not speak again to an MTPD official for over three hours-until around 8:00 p.m., when a different off-duty sergeant returned his call.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 4;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Attach. 7 (Perkins' statement). At around 6:00 p.m., Washington sent Biggs, who was off duty at that time, text messages informing him about the problem\n   with the train. Pl.'s Opp'n at 13 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 13 (text messages) ). Washington also claims to have spoken with a Captain Ware, who was on duty that evening, although it is unclear when that happened and whether Ware called her or she him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 157:10-16,\n   <em>\n    cited in\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Shortly after 8:00 p.m., the MTPD Watch Commander on duty that evening, Captain Sepulveda, became aware that the money train had broken down. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 60. Subsequently, the money train was repaired, and the two officers aboard ultimately went off duty at 1:00 a.m. the following morning.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 4;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Attachs. 7-8 (officers' statements). Captain Sepulveda then investigated the events of September 18. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Sepulveda interviewed Washington, Biggs, and the two officers who accompanied the money train, and also had Washington and Biggs complete a written questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 63-64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 247:18-20. Washington claims that another WMATA official, Captain Brown, also participated in the investigation by asking her questions during her interview. Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6\u00b6 61-64. Brown's participation was improper, she suggests, because she had previously filed a claim of harassment against Brown with WMATA's Office of Employee Relations in January 2015.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24-27, 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on this investigation, Sepulveda concluded that Washington had violated two MTPD policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 5-6. First, he found that Washington improperly failed to contact any on-duty MTPD \"official\" regarding the breakdown of the money train, leaving the two officers accompanying the train unsupervised for several hours.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She thereby \"abandoned her supervisory duties,\" violating an MTPD policy requiring supervisors to be accountable for their direct reports.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   He also found that Washington, by failing to ensure that the officers were relieved during their ordeal, had exercised poor judgment inconsistent with her position and \"failed to adequately staff and maintain proper coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. He declined to find, however, that Washington had improperly failed to request leave.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7. He noted that Biggs and Washington disputed whether she had timely requested leave, and concluded that this reflected a \"communication breakdown\" between them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Based on Sepulveda's report, the MTPD's Chief ordered Washington demoted in January 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6\u00b6 73, 76. Washington sought and obtained several internal levels of review of the Chief's decision.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 78-79. The final review was conducted by WMATA's Assistant General Manager for Bus Services, who upheld the decision based on the following \"key points\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1) [Washington] admitted she left work early based on an informal agreement with Lt. Biggs; conversely, Lt. Biggs stated he did not grant [Washington] leave; 2) [Washington] failed to notify an on-duty official that she was leaving her shift early and failed to arrange for supervisory coverage; and 3) [Washington] was negligent in her responsibilities to her Officers, who were left unsupervised without an effective means of communicating with [Washington].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 80.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On June 29 or June 30, 2016, Washington filed a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), bringing claims of discrimination and retaliation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 28, 30. On July 6, 2016, EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32. On October 10, 2016, Washington filed this lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 34. Her operative complaint brings four counts against\n   WMATA. The first three allege that her demotion in January 2016 was motivated by unlawful discrimination based on her race, color and gender. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 41-76. The fourth count alleges that the demotion was in retaliation for having previously engaged in protected activity.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 77-92.

Our purpose in smoking out pretextual employer rationales is to discern whether prohibited discrimination may be a real reason for the challenged action. A false \"mistake\" or obvious omission can itself bespeak discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Burley v.

The evidence shows that WMATA reached in good faith the factual conclusions underlying her demotion, which were set forth in Captain Sepulveda's report: that Washington left work early on September 18, 2015, without ensuring that someone with supervisory authority was in charge, and that she subsequently did not notify an on-duty official that there was a problem with the money train, thereby leaving the officers under her command without adequate supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 1-5. As a result, the officers on the money train had to work until 1:00 a.m. the next morning without relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. The Chief of the MTPD relied on these facts in demoting her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 18 (Letter of Demotion). And through several subsequent layers of review, WMATA officials found these facts adequate to justify her demotion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 19 (Grievance Correspondence and Decisions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   While Washington attempts to poke holes in these factual conclusions, her quibbles do not impugn the honesty of the WMATA officials who demoted her, or even directly contradict the key conclusions they relied upon in doing so. She relies heavily on evidence that her supervisor, Biggs, had approved her medical leave.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 26-28. But WMATA took this evidence into account during its investigation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann v.

Sepulveda's report noted that Washington and Biggs disagreed on whether she had requested leave earlier that day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 2-3. Sepulveda effectively chose to credit both of them: he concluded that there was \"communication breakdown\" between Washington and Biggs, and therefore recommended that Washington not be disciplined for failing to properly request leave.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12394748\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/692/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12394748\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/692/6/\">\n    at 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, she was not disciplined on this point. Moreover, this evidence does not suggest that WMATA acted dishonestly in concluding that Washington \"failed to adequately staff and maintain proper coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12394748\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/692/6/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12394748\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/692/6/\">\n    at 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Even if Washington notified Biggs earlier in the day that she planned to leave early, she does not dispute that she never arranged for another official to take over her supervisory duties in her absence. And this also meant that no one was available to find replacements to timely relieve the officers accompanying the money train.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Washington also points out that she contacted Biggs while he was off duty to inform him the money train had broken down. Pl.'s Opp'n at 29. Once again, Sepulveda's report acknowledged this fact. Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 5. It nonetheless concluded that she \"did not notify an\n   <em>\n    on duty\n   </em>\n   official of the situation and abandoned her supervisory duties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (emphasis added). Here too, Sepulveda's conclusion was reasonable: Lieutenant\n   Biggs had gone off-duty no later than 1:15 p.m., before the money train broke down again later in the afternoon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 68. Moreover, Washington's handwritten answers during the investigation identified Biggs as the\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   official with supervisory authority whom she had contacted during the incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12, Attach. 3 (Washington Statement), question 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, even though Washington informed Biggs of the incident when he was off-duty, she did not notify any on-duty official who could take charge of the situation that a problem had arisen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Washington now claims that she also contacted an on-duty official named Captain Ware. Pl.'s Opp'n at 29; Pl.'s SoMF \u00b6 67 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 157:10-16). But this evidence does not create a genuine issue of material fact for two reasons. First, as already noted, Washington's statement during the investigation did not identify Ware as someone she had spoken to, and WMATA's investigation cannot have been \"egregiously wrong\" because it omitted facts that Washington never raised.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Burley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173601,6055295\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/290/\">\n    801 F.3d at 298-99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Second, Washington's testimony merely states that she talked to Ware at some point \"that evening,\" without specifying when.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 157:10-16. She also could not recall whether she contacted Ware or he contacted her.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173601,6055295\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/290/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, her testimony is consistent with WMATA's conclusion (and her own handwritten statement) that she never contacted an on-duty official during the time frame in which the officers accompanying the money train were without supervision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Washington further argues that she acted appropriately by maintaining contact with the senior officer at the Facility and one of the officers accompanying the money train, and by returning to the Facility later in the evening, shortly before 10:00 p.m.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 29-30; Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 115:3-6. Once again, none of these points undermines the factual predicate for her demotion: that there was a period of several hours in which she failed to inform an on-duty official with supervisory authority that there was a problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Washington also picks at other factual nits, such as whether the officers accompanying the money train reported for duty at 5:30 a.m. or 9:30 a.m. on September 18,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 46. But Washington does not explain how these factual issues were material to the investigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 25-30. And in any event, the mere fact that WMATA may have disagreed with Washington on these minor factual points does not appear to have any bearing on the reasonableness of the ultimate decision to demote her. \"Employers obviously have to resolve factual disagreements all the time in order to make employment decisions regarding hiring, promotion, discipline, demotion, firing, and the like. In many situations, employers must decide disputes based on credibility assessments, circumstantial evidence, and incomplete information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3569076,3701580\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/520/490/\">\n    520 F.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These additional factual disputes are of the type that WMATA could properly resolve in investigating Washington's conduct, without calling into question its basis for demoting her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Having failed to impeach WMATA's factual conclusions, Washington also argues that WMATA misapplied its policies. Specifically, she claims that WMATA's policies allowed her to delegate her supervisory responsibilities to the senior officer at the Facility when she left, and that she did so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 28-29. She does not dispute the basic fact that \"officials\" (MTPD employees at the rank of sergeant or higher) have supervisory responsibilities, whereas \"officers\" (MTPD employees ranked below sergeants) do not.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6\u00b6 9, 13. She nonetheless points to several pieces of evidence that show, in her view, that a sergeant can delegate her supervisory authority to a subordinate officer.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15-18, 55, 59. First, she points out that WMATA's written policies require officers to follow their supervisors' commands even when \"relayed\" by their fellow officers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 7 (General Order 106) \u00a7 IV.C.7; Pl.'s Ex. 4 (Gaddis Dep.) at 69:12-21). Next, she references the fact that WMATA's policies allow the first officer on the scene of a major incident to take charge until an official arrives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing Pl.'s Ex. 8 (General Order 364); Pl.'s Ex. 9 (General Order 365) ). WMATA's policies also empower (and encourage) supervisors \"to delegate authority when feasible\" in order to \"meet their increasing responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17 (quoting Pl.'s Ex. 7 (General Order 106) \u00a7 IV.C.12.b). Finally, she testified that officials at the Facility shared a common practice of delegating their duties to \"experienced officers\" when they left.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55 (citing Pl.'s Ex. 3 (Washington Dep.) at 159:2-9, 163:5-168:17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First, the written policies she cites do not support her argument. Not one of them even remotely suggests that it is acceptable for an MTPD sergeant to delegate\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of her supervisory duties to a subordinate officer at any time, much less when an ongoing crisis demands a supervisor's attention. Thus, the policies do not contradict WMATA's conclusion that Washington's conduct violated the overarching principle that officials must remain accountable for the performance of their subordinates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 7 (General Order 106) \u00a7 IV.C.9; Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 5-6. And even if the Facility officials had an informal practice of delegating their duties to officers when they left, it cannot explain why Washington failed, upon learning no later than 4:45 p.m. that the money train had broken down, to take charge of the situation or to notify an on-duty official of what had happened.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Second, even assuming WMATA's policies on delegation and supervision leave room for interpretation, that does not call into doubt that WMATA honestly evaluated her case. \"The question here ... is not whether Plaintiff in fact violated [WMATA] policies, but whether [WMATA] decision-makers honestly and reasonably believed that [she] did so.\"\n   <em>\n    Evans v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271138\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/219/99/#p107\">\n    219 F.Supp.3d 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 107 (D.D.C. 2016). Thus, WMATA's \"failure 'to follow its own regulations and procedures, alone, may not be sufficient to support' the conclusion that its explanation for the challenged employment action is pretextual.\"\n   <em>\n    Fischbach\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694065,452891\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/86/1180/\">\n    86 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Cir. 1982) ). Ultimately, WMATA's decision rested less on a mechanical application of its written policies than on its common sense conclusion, based on the events of September 18, 2015, that Washington had fallen down on the job and exercised\n   poor judgment inconsistent with her continuing to occupy a supervisory role.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 12 (Sepulveda Report) at 5-6; Pl.'s Ex.18 (Letter of Demotion). The existence of some policies or practices that arguably supported Washington's conduct does not call into question the honesty of WMATA's conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As the foregoing analysis shows, no reasonable jury could conclude that WMATA's investigation yielded a factual conclusion so \"egregiously wrong\" that it was a lie.\n   <em>\n    Burley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173601,6055295\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/801/290/\">\n    801 F.3d at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The first kept an all-terrain vehicle owned by the MTPD at his home for a year and a half, used it for his personal benefit, and damaged it; he was suspended for 10 days. Pl.'s Opp'n at 16; Def.'s Ex. 21 at 3. The second was accused of sexual harassment after he asked out a female WMATA employee via text message; the MTPD cleared him of the harassment charge because it found no evidence his text messages were unwelcome or sexually explicit, but nonetheless suspended him for three days for conduct that brought discredit or the appearance of discredit on himself or the MTPD. Pl.'s Opp'n at 17; Def.'s Ex. 21 at 4-5. The third had a traffic accident while driving a rental car but did not immediately notify any MTPD official; he was not punished because WMATA determined this conduct did not violate any of its policies. Pl.'s Opp'n at 17; Def.'s Ex. 21 at 1-2. None of the three was demoted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   These comparators do not help Washington's case because none engaged in conduct as serious as hers. Their conduct differed from hers in a key respect: not one engaged in conduct that called into question his ability to perform a sergeant's supervisory duties. Washington did, and as a result, the MTPD \"lost confidence in [her] ability to perform in a leadership position.\" Pl.'s Ex. 18 (Letter of Demotion). This difference fully explains why she alone was demoted. And while Washington argues that two of these comparators were found to have violated one of the same \"general orders\" that she violated,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 32-33, that is of no moment: the general order in question applies broadly to many different types of conduct,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 17 at 8-11 (General Order 217), and the proposed comparators\n   \"engaged in different conduct to violate different aspects of the same rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Dudley v.

Therefore, Washington's proposed comparators do not permit the inference that WMATA's justifications for her termination are pretextual.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In light of the above, the Court will grant summary judgment for WMATA on Washington's discrimination claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Title VII prohibits employers \"to discriminate against any individual ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by [ 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 ].\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a).

Washington's retaliation claim fails because she has not introduced any evidence to show that she engaged in statutorily protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Washington's theory of retaliation rests on a complaint she had previously made against Captain Brown to WMATA's Office of Employee Relations in January 2015.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp'n at 36-38. The complaint asserted that Brown had \"harassed and unfairly treated\" her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36. Specifically, Washington claimed that Brown unnecessarily \"interrogate[d] her\" about various aspects of her job performance, improperly required her to undergo drug screening, and confiscated her firearm until the screening was complete.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 16.

Washington asserts, in her response to WMATA's statement of undisputed material facts, that her 2015 complaint alleged that Brown had engaged in discriminatory conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 22. But the evidence she cites,\n   <em>\n    see id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 22-27, does not back up this assertion. WMATA's records of the 2015 complaint describe an accusation that Brown \"harassed\" Washington as discussed above, in the sense that he was purportedly rude to her-but without any hint that his conduct was based on race, gender, or any other category protected under Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 16. Nor do the cited portions of Washington's own testimony describe any complaint of unlawful discrimination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Ex. 13 (Washington Dep.) at 242:16-243:8, 243:21-22. Thus, Washington has not shown that she ever engaged in protected activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   One final point. The parties dispute whether WMATA's Office of Employee Relations, to which Washington directed her 2015 complaint, handles complaints of discrimination at all. WMATA argues that it does not; Washington argues that it does.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Resp. SoMF \u00b6 23. But even assuming Washington is correct, the matter is immaterial to the outcome here. Washington does not assert that the Office of Employee Relations\n   <em>\n    exclusively\n   </em>\n   handles discrimination claims. Thus, the mere fact that she directed her 2015 complaint to that office does not imply-one way or the other-that she alleged unlawful discrimination. The D.C. Circuit has made a similar observation about the EEOC:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [The plaintiff's] threat to contact the EEOC does not help his cause. The bare invocation of \"EEOC,\" divorced from any allegation of unlawful discrimination on a statutorily prohibited ground, does not constitute protected activity under Title VII. Indeed, the EEOC hears complaints under a broad variety of non-discrimination statutes in addition to Title VII, including those that prohibit age, disability, and genetic-information discrimination. [The plaintiff's] naked reference to the \"EEOC\" thus does not provide any basis for inferring opposition to racial discrimination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <em>\n    Robbins v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4338267\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/650/37/#p40\">\n    650 F.
