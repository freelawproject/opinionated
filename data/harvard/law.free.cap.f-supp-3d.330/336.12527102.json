BOASBERG, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Cause of Action Institute caught wind of a congressional committee's instruction to various government agencies to withhold certain records in response to Freedom of Information Act requests. Hoping to uncover the agencies' reactions to this directive, the Institute filed a FOIA request with Defendant United States Department of Justice. Frustrated with DOJ's delayed response, the Institute then initiated this suit. DOJ eventually identified and turned over responsive records, but partially redacted some and refused to provide others, citing the protections afforded by FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6. Both parties now move for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In so doing, the Institute concedes the adequacy of the Government's search and presents no challenge to its redactions of personal information. But it does take issue with information withheld pursuant to two privileges under Exemption 5's umbrella:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   the attorney-client privilege and the deliberative-process privilege. After conducting an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review of the documents at issue, the Court finds merit in both parties' Motions. It agrees that the claimed privileges do indeed cover a subset of the withheld documents, but concludes that they do not extend quite as far as DOJ claims. Some of the redacted content reveals no confidential communication within the scope of an attorney-client relationship and no deliberation of agency personnel. The Court, therefore, grants in part and denies in part each side's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Little need be said to tee up the narrow issues at play. In the spring of 2017, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Chairman of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Financial Services, sent a letter to the twelve agencies within his committee's jurisdiction. This letter instructed the agencies that communications with the committee should be treated as \"congressional records\" rather than \"agency records.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 1 (Compl.), Exh. 1 (FOIA Request) at 8-9 (Letter from Chairman Hall to Secretary Mnuchin (Apr. 3, 2017) ). The import of this instruction for FOIA requests is significant: while \"agency records\" must generally be turned over in response to a FOIA request, \"congressional records\" are often protected from disclosure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   For this reason, the letter requested that the agencies \"decline to produce any such congressional records in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Chairman's letter found its way into the hands of the press, prompting the Institute to file a FOIA request with DOJ to obtain additional information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 16 (Pl. MSJ &amp; Opp.) at 3. Plaintiff sought \"[a]ll communications\" between two DOJ divisions - the Office of Information Policy (OIP) and the Office of Legislative Affairs (OLA) - and any of the twelve agencies under the Financial Services Committee's purview concerning the Chairman's \"directive.\" FOIA Request at 2-3 (Letter from Ryan P. Mulvey, CoA Inst., to Laurie Day, DOJ OIP (May 18, 2017) ). The request also sought similar communications between DOJ and either the White House or certain members and committees of the House of Representatives.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   About a month after the Institute filed its FOIA request, DOJ acknowledged receipt. Justice then notified Plaintiff that its search would require more than the \"ten additional days provided by the statute.\" Compl., Exh. 2 (Letter from James M. Smith, DOJ OIP, to Mulvey (June 22, 2017) ) at 2. Because the Institute's request required searching another office, DOJ attested that it fell within the category of \"unusual circumstances\" under 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 552(a)(6)(B)(i)-(iii).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After approximately another month passed, the Institute, having received no further communication, filed this suit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   DOJ subsequently produced two batches of documents. In the first, it turned over five pages to Plaintiff, which comprised emails between the White House Counsel's Office and OIP. Following the parties' convention, the Court will refer to this batch of records as the \"White House-DOJ documents.\" Justice made various redactions to these documents per Exemption 5 and also removed personally identifiable information under Exemption 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 14 (Def. MSJ), Exh. C (White House-DOJ Documents) at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendant later notified the Institute that it had discovered eleven additional pages of responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ, Exh. D (Letter from Vanessa R. Brinkmann, DOJ OIP, to Mulvey (Jan. 8,\n   2018) ) at 1-2. In a declaration filed with the Court, Justice describes these documents as \"email communications, including attachments (one of which is a draft), between [OLC] and OLA and another Executive Branch agency, regarding and responding to a confidential request for DOJ advice from the agency.\" Def. MSJ, Attach. 1 (Decl. of Vanessa R. Brinkmann, Sr. Counsel, DOJ OIP), \u00b6\u00b6 12, 22. Justice did not, however, disclose which executive-branch agency is included in the correspondence. The Court will refer to this batch of records as the \"Agency-DOJ documents.\" Claiming the protection of Exemption 5, DOJ withheld the eleven pages in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Brinkmann to Mulvey at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Both parties have now filed Motions for Summary Judgment regarding the propriety of the exemptions invoked by DOJ. To aid in resolving this issue, the Court, on August 3, 2018, ordered the Government to produce the records at issue for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   inspection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   8/3/2018 Minute Order. Having now completed this evaluation, the Court is primed to resolve the parties' present dispute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The email begins: \"FYI - the administration has received several letters like the attached.\" DOJ then redacted the immediately following sentence, as well as the attached letter, claiming that the material fell within the scope of Exemption 5.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"287953,3715977\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/148/1100/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   These are the two documents at issue here. DOJ also redacted what appears to be personal information, citing Exemption 6, but, as explained earlier, Plaintiff has no beef with those redactions. As to Exemption 5, DOJ contends that the redacted information \"falls squarely under the protection of the attorney-client privilege.\" ECF No. 17 (Def. Opp. &amp; Reply) at 2.

Nowhere does the White House directly ask for legal advice in the email, nor is there any other statement that can even be fairly construed as a solicitation of legal counsel. Rather, the body of the email begins with the acronym \"FYI,\" which the Court, like the parties, takes to mean \"for your information.\" This statement gives the email the appearance of a simple alert to another government employee and not a communication whose \"primary purpose\" is securing legal advice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280771,5900221\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/754/\">\n    756 F.3d at 759-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   DOJ nonetheless asks the Court to infer from \"the context of th[e] email\" that the White House Counsel's Office's true purpose, even if not apparent from the email's text, was to seek legal advice from OIP.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Opp. &amp; Reply at 5. To substantiate this position, Justice relies largely on a declaration submitted by an OIP senior counsel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 17; Def. Opp. &amp; Reply at 2-4. In this declaration, the official asserts that OIP \"routinely provides legal advice\" to further its mission \"to oversee and encourage agency compliance with the FOIA.\" Brinkmann Decl., \u00b6 15. DOJ does not claim, however, that providing legal advice is the office's sole duty or its primary reason to interact with other agencies. Beyond this general description, the declaration specifically characterizes the email exchange at issue here as a \"consultative exchange ... regarding FOIA matters on which\" the OIP director \"has been asked to provide her advice.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280771,5900221\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/754/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although no doubt helpful to DOJ's position, this evidence does not carry it across the finish line. This is so for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, the fact that OIP is in the business of sometimes - or even \"routinely\" - providing legal advice is insufficient when, as here, the provision of legal services is not the office's sole duty. It is Justice's burden to show that this\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   communication involved a request for legal advice. For when a government lawyer's duty encompasses providing both legal and non-legal advice, the Government must show that the communication at issue involves the provision of legal services rather than, for example, \"political, strategic, or policy issues.\"\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890746\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/926/121/#p144\">\n    926 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   144-45 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"670102,3799711\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/737/94/\">\n    737 F.2d at 99\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DOJ's particularized arguments, moreover, are thin. In the Court's view, the \"context of the email\" to which the Government refers only reveals coordination between the White House and OIP on a response to the congressional instruction. It does not establish that the purpose of this communication was legal in nature. In addition, although DOJ asserts in a declaration that the OIP director had \"been asked to provide her advice\" in this exchange,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Brinkmann Decl., \u00b6 15, such a declaration characterizing withheld documents carries little weight when the Court has had an opportunity to reach its own determination after an\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Military Audit Project\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267816,3518669\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/656/724/\">\n    656 F.2d at 738\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that affidavit \"controverted by ... evidence in the record\" does not carry weight);\n   <em>\n    Reporters Comm.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p754\">\n    489 U.S. at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12033433\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/489/749/#p754\">\n    109 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring courts to evaluate the propriety of withholdings without deference to the agency). Parsing this declaration carefully, the Court also notes that the official only asserts that the White House requested \"advice,\" which may or may not be legal in nature. As noted, advice on \"political, strategic, or policy issues\" does not warrant protection.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5890746\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/926/121/#p144\">\n    926 F.Supp.2d at 144-45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Second, even if the Court were to assume that obtaining legal advice was one of the White House's objectives in reaching out to OIP, DOJ might nevertheless\n   still fail to carry its burden. That a conversation has some legal nexus is insufficient: the party seeking the protection of the attorney-client privilege must show that securing legal advice was a \"primary objective.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Kellogg Brown &amp; Root, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280771,5900221\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/754/\">\n    756 F.3d at 759-60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons already explained, the email's language cuts against any inference that the communication primarily concerned a request for legal counsel, rather than mere coordination on strategy or policy amongst government agencies. The Government has thus not cleared its first hurdle -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , demonstrating that the solicitation of legal advice constituted the communication's primary purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This is not DOJ's only deficiency.

But the Court has seen these communications, and it does not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court is confident that the single sentence redacted from the email contains no confidential information beyond what DOJ has affirmatively disclosed in responding to the Institute's FOIA request and in its filings in this matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring that confidentiality be maintained to warrant protection under the attorney-client privilege). No more need be said.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Similarly, the substance of the attached letter does not reveal any \"confidential information\n   <em>\n    concerning the [a]gency\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11967576,3707851\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/607/\">\n    117 F.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Perhaps DOJ could argue that the fact that this particular agency received the letter is \"confidential information.\" This is a tough argument to make, however, since the prior disclosed sentence reveals that \"the administration has received several letters like the attached.\" By revealing to the Institute the earlier sentence in response to its FOIA request regarding certain congressional correspondence, the Government has divulged that the agency has received such letters.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 863\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . DOJ could conceivably argue - although it does not - that the fact that this agency received this\n   <em>\n    particular\n   </em>\n   letter is \"confidential information\" necessitating protection. This argument would be sliced awfully thin. After reviewing the attachment\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   , the Court sees nothing about this letter that sufficiently differentiates it from the others such that the Court could conclude that the fact of the communication is predicated on \"confidential information\n   <em>\n    concerning the [a]gency\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11967576,3707851\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/607/\">\n    117 F.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The attorney-client privilege, therefore, does not apply to the White House-DOJ documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   b. Agency-DOJ Documents\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Where the White House-DOJ documents obtain no protection, the Agency-DOJ documents fare better. These consist of a chain of emails between an undisclosed executive-branch agency and three offices inside DOJ - namely, OIP, OLA, and OLC. Included with the emails are two attachments, one of which is a draft agency document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Brinkmann Decl., \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Unlike the White House-DOJ documents, some of these emails contain a clear request for advice from a government office - OLC - whose \"principal function\" concerns the provision of legal advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 15. There can be no doubt, moreover, that at least some of the communications divulge confidential agency information in the request for legal advice. Based on its\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, the Court determines that many of these emails - and any legal advice rendered in response - fall comfortably within the scope of the attorney-client privilege. Two categories of communications merit further discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Court concludes that the privilege extends to the draft attachment. A draft document is protected under the attorney-client privilege if \"the draft itself contains protected confidential communications from the client or the attorney.\"\n   <em>\n    Loftin v.

The Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review, backed up by DOJ's assertion that this record is \"a draft,\" Brinkmann Decl., \u00b6 12, establish that the attachment is not the final version of the document.

The sending of the document to legal counsel for the purpose of review, accordingly, means that the draft falls within the scope of the privilege and is entitled to protection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, included in the withheld chain are, admittedly, emails that do not communicate any \"confidential information\n   <em>\n    concerning the [a]gency\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Tax Analysts\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11967576,3707851\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/117/607/\">\n    117 F.3d at 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even if the attached letter reflects no deliberative process of the agency itself, the decision to single out that letter for circulation from the several letters received by the administration evinces a decision reflective of the deliberative process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. MSJ at 10. The record does not support such a contention. The unredacted portion of the email notes that \"the administration has received several letters\n   <em>\n    like the attached\n   </em>\n   .\" White House-DOJ Documents at 5 (emphasis added).

For the reasons already stated, the lack of any opinion expressed in the redacted material mitigates any negative impact on the potential for open, frank discussions.
