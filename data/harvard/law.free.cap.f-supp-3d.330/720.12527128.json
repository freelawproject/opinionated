Gomes moves to suppress (\"Motion\") (ECF No. 55) his arrest, the search of his vehicle, all tangible evidence that law enforcement officers seized on April 17, 2017, and the subsequent search of his iPhone 5, on the basis that they are the product of a warrantless arrest without probable cause. The Court held an evidentiary hearing on the Motion on May 24 and 29, 2018 (\"Hearing\"). After considering the evidence and the parties' arguments, for the following reasons, the Motion is denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I. Background\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the Hearing, the government offered the testimony of Detective Michael Iacone and Sergeant Lori Sweeney, both with the Special Victims Unit of the Cranston Police Department, and Officer Brian Corvese, also with the Cranston Police Department. The Court finds the following facts from their testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 11, 2017, Detective Iacone received an anonymous tip that two juveniles were possibly involved in prostitution through Backpage.com (\"Backpage\") advertisements.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Hr'g 1 Tr. 12:4-17, ECF No. 67.) On April 12, Detective Iacone, in conjunction with Special Agent Donaghy of Homeland Security, searched for and located a Backpage advertisement for the victim, a seventeen-year-old minor female named \"NB.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:4-9.) The advertisement referenced NB as \"H3nny,\" and provided revealing pictures of her and a cell phone number. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16:18-20.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Sometime before noon, Detective Iacone texted \"H3nny\" using the phone number provided on her Backpage advertisement to arrange an \"in call\" \"date\" for commercial sex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Hr'g 1 Tr. 19:1-10, 20:9-11, 21:1-6.) Detective Iacone testified that he\n   intended his text message to identify solely where the prostitution was occurring. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25:12-15.) Later that day, H3nny called Detective Iacone and specified an address of 15 Esten Street in Providence, Rhode Island. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26:24-25, 27:1-4.) Around noon, officers cancelled that date with H3nny and took up a surveillance position in a parking lot where they had a clear vantage point of the 15 and 20 Esten Street area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 27:24-25; 28:1-10.) 20 Esten Street was significant to officers because it was Defendant Leandro \"Leo\" Gomes's home, which was diagonal from 15 Esten Street, the anticipated \"date\" location. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30:5-11, 32:15-19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At approximately 1:00 p.m., officers observed five individuals, three males and two women, exit 20 Esten Street. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:18-19.) Officer Iacone testified that he identified one of the women as the victim, \"NB,\" by a distinct, upper-chest tattoo that he recognized from her Facebook page. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:20-25, 34:1-9.) After exiting the home, the men began working on a black Nissan Infiniti (\"black Infiniti\"), with a Texas registration plate, HPC4386.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:19-21, 35:1-15.) Around 1:30 p.m., the two females and two of the men got in the vehicle and drove away. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:3-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Once the officers completed the surveillance, they returned to the station where they ran the vehicle's registration plate; information on it could not be gleaned from either the computer database normally used by Cranston Police Department or the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41:3-25, 42:1.) Officers also learned that NB was missing from a Department of Children, Youth and Families facility in Newport, Rhode Island, and that the second woman seen exiting 20 Esten Street was Andrea, an 18-year-old female recently released from the Rhode Island Training School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 42:2-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Around 1:30 p.m. on April 17, officers re-engaged with NB through text message using a different cell phone number, again trying to solicit a \"date\" with her. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 43:22-25, 44:18-20.) Officers successfully arranged an \"out call date\" for a \"two girl special\" for $500, which was to occur at an undercover apartment at 825 Pontiac Avenue in Cranston, Rhode Island, where Officer Iacone, Special Agent Donaghy, Detective Lee, and another Homeland Security Agent were positioned. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44:9-12, 47:23-25, 48:1-13.) Other state and local police officers surveilled outside the apartment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:4-7.) While on the way to the apartment, H3nny called the officers twice, once for directions and a second time to inform them she had arrived. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49:15-20, 50:1-6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Once the officers knew that H3nny was in the vicinity of the undercover apartment, they radioed outside surveillance to look out for a \"dark-colored sedan heavily tinted with this Texas plate\" or a \"black Maxima tinted with Texas Plates.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 51:16-24; Hr'g 2 Tr. 52:19-21, ECF No. 68.) Sergeant Sweeney surveilled the apartment from an undercover police vehicle parked directly across the street. (Hr'g 2 Tr. 52:22-25, 53:1-8.) He testified that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [O]nce [Detective Iacone] said that [H3nny and a second female] should be here, I observed a black tinted out what appeared to be a Maxima with Texas plates pass by my location.... I could see the ... front passenger only. The window was completely down. It was a white female, brown hair. She was on the phone. She was kind of looking\n   around and then focused to the entrance of the apartment complex.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:25, 54:1-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sergeant Sweeney lost sight of the vehicle once it passed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:1-5.) Soon afterwards, she observed the white female passenger and a second female enter the apartment building, and radioed Officer Iacone to inform him. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:17-18.) Once the two females, one of whom Officer Iacone identified as NB, entered the apartment, they were taken into custody. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 52:10-15.) The other female identified herself as Justine Marzilli, who officers believed was twenty-eight to twenty-nine years old. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52:22-25, 53:1-6.) Officers transported both females to the Cranston Police Station, where they were booked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 54:7-10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After arresting NB and Ms. Marzilli, Officer Iacone radioed outside surveillance units to move in on the black Infiniti. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53:21-25, 54:1.) Sergeant Sweeney testified that shortly after the females' arrest, Officer Corvese radioed in that he had located the vehicle idling on Dixwell Avenue, approximately 200 feet from the main entrance of the apartment complex. (Hr'g 2 Tr. 32:12-25, 33:1-6, 56:15-25, 57:1.) Officer Corvese ran the vehicle's registration and learned that it did not match the vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 32:25, 33:1-3.) He pulled behind the vehicle and made contact with the driver, Gomes, who was alone and looking down at his cell phone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33:4, 34:4-5, 36:6-9, 37:22-24.) Officer Corvese could not tell what Gomes was doing on his phone, but it was illuminated. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 37:22-25, 38:1-6, 40:11-19.) Upon Officer Corvese's arrival and at his request, Gomes rolled down the driverside window and provided a valid license, issued in his name.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 36:13-15, 37:2-8.) Officer Corvese testified that Gomes appeared visibly nervous, stuttering as he spoke. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:9-17.) Gomes informed Officer Corvese that he was in the area to drop off a friend; he could not, however, provide an exact name or location for the friend. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 38:25, 39:1-11.) While Officer Corvese spoke with Gomes, Sergeant Sweeney and other agents arrived on the scene. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:1-4.) At Sergeant Sweeney's direction, Officer Corvese arrested Gomes for pandering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:5-10.) Officer Corvese testified that he seized two cellphones from Gomes (the iPhone 5 and a white Samsung). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40:20-25.) Around 6:00 p.m. on April 17, Gomes was taken to the police station and booked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:14-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   While at the police station, Ms. Marzilli told Officer Iacone that the juvenile had visited the apartment to engage in commercial sex and that she was there for her protection. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 54:19-21, 55:3-9.) Officer Iacone testified that, later that day the victim asked to retrieve two phone numbers from her cellphone, one for her mother, and another for her \"uncle,\" \"Uncle Sincere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:3-12.) Officer Iacone knew the name Sincere from a previous investigation related to minor sex trafficking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 56:18-25.) Gomes was released from custody that evening on a $5,000 personal recognizance bond; police, however, retained his two cellphones. (Hr'g 2 Tr. 10:24-25, 11:1; Hr'g 1 Tr. 57:22-24.) On April 20, three days after his arrest, officers obtained search warrants for both of Gomes's phones. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 58:10-13, 60:4-6.) Officers could not obtain any information from the iPhone 5, because it had a passcode that officers could not unlock. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:2-22.) Officers did gain access to the Samsung, but it lacked any data or information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:23-25, 60:1-3.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On April 24, Agent Iacone and Agent Donaghy visited the victim, NB, at the Rhode Island Training School. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:7-10.) NB told them how she became involved in prostitution and that Gomes and his co-defendant would take her to multiple locations in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New York to have sex for money. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60:16-25, 61:1-2.) On May 10, 2017, officers used this information to obtain federal search warrants issued by Magistrate Judge Sullivan for Gomes's iPhone 5. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:6-8, 13-16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Gomes was later arrested and charged with four counts of sex tracking a minor. This Motion followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II. Discussion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A.

(Hr'g 1 Tr. 52:6-15.) Officers arranged a \"date\" via text message and phone call with H3nny, where she and another female were supposed to meet at the undercover apartment to engage in commercial sex. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 46:9-16.) The two females were transported to the apartment for the \"date\" by a black Infiniti with Texas Temporary Plate HPC4386. (Hr'g 2 Tr. 53:24-25, 54:1-10.) The two females entered the undercover apartment, where police took them into custody. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:17-22.) On both April 12 and 17, officers observed the same car with an identical license plate transport NB to or from two different locations where she had arranged to engage in prostitution. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 51:25, 52:1-5, 69:3-9, 70:12-15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In isolation, perhaps Gomes driving a car that dropped two women at an apartment might be unsuspicious. This fact combined with the other circumstances of this case, however, suffices for reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516711\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/537/#p543\">\n    888 F.3d at 544\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Attempting to analyze each piece of evidence in a vacuum is inconsistent with Supreme Court case law, which makes pellucid that each item is to be considered as part of the totality of the circumstances.\") Other circumstances included: (1) the car's unique Texas license plate; (2) the car transporting the alleged\n   victim from the location where she was supposed to engage in commercial sex on both April 12 and 17; (3) the car dropping off two women, including the alleged victim, at the undercover apartment to engage in commercial sex on April 17; and (4) Gomes, the sole occupant of the vehicle, sitting in the idle car on Dixwell Avenue, approximately 200 feet from the apartment complex's main entrance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grassia v. Piers\n   </em>\n   , 427 Fed. App'x 18, 21-22 (1st Cir. 2011) (explaining that, in the context of an ongoing investigation, it was objectively reasonable for the officer to view the video image of a unique automobile, owned by the defendant and positioned at the crime's location, as suggesting the defendant's involvement in criminal activity). Accordingly, on April 17 it was objectively reasonable for the officers to suspect that Gomes was involved in transporting prostitutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Admittedly, as Gomes argues, this probable cause determination is somewhat of a close call, and the Court recognizes that the phone conversations between H3nny and the officers on the way to the apartment do not compel the inference that Gomes knew of their criminal activity. Officer Iacone testified that the verbal exchange between the officers and H3nny that Gomes could have overheard while driving only included the address of and directions to the undercover apartment. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 49:12-25, 50:1-3.)

Three days after the arrest, officers obtained a state search warrant, but it was fruitless because the iPhone could not be unlocked. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 58:10-13, 59:2-22, 60:4-6.) On May 10, approximately one month after Gomes's arrest, the officers obtained a federal search warrant and were able to unlock the iPhone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61:3-16.) Officer Iacone testified that he would have sought a warrant for Gomes's phone whether or not it was seized at his April 17 arrest because, in human trafficking investigations, evidence of the crime can be obtained from the suspected pimp's cellphone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 63:6-11, 64:3-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   These circumstances are analogous to\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   , where the officer, after arresting the defendant for drug distribution, knew he would seek a search warrant for the defendant's room because hotel rooms are frequent criminal-activity hubs likely to uncover evidence. Because Gomes was arrested driving a car linked to a criminal investigation that dropped off two females at an apartment to engage in commercial sex, it was reasonable for officers to suspect Gomes of pandering and his phone of containing incriminating evidence. Thus, the officers had probable cause to seize the phone and obtain a warrant to search it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In addition, the officers' decision to obtain a federal search warrant was based on the strength of the agents' interview with\n   the alleged victim three weeks after officers seized Gomes's phone. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 60:16-25, 61:1-8.) This decision was independent of Gomes's arrest. Therefore, the officers' decision to obtain a search warrant was not based on any 'unlawful' search of Gomes's phone. The officers had probable cause to arrest Gomes and lawfully obtain a warrant before searching his iPhone.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The second question is whether \"the affidavit that [the officers] submitted to procure the warrant, when stripped of any knowledge derived from the initial [search], contained enough facts to support a finding of probable cause.\"\n   <em>\n    Flores\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516711\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/537/#p543\">\n    888 F.3d at 546, 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that even if the evidence obtained during the warrantless search was removed from the affidavit-the drug found in the apartment during the warrantless entry-what remained would suffice for probable cause and \"thus ... justify the issuance of the warrant\"). It does. In this instance, the alleged victim's statement, which implicated Gomes in the prostitution scheme weeks after his arrest but before the officers obtained a search warrant for Gomes's phone, supports probable cause and therefore \"justif[ies] the issuance of the warrant.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516711\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/537/#p543\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516711\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/537/#p543\">\n    at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   2. Inevitable Discovery Doctrine\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Next, the government urges application of the inevitable discovery doctrine to the iPhone seized from Gomes incident to his arrest.

Application of the inevitable discovery exception invites three questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [F]irst, whether the legal means by which the evidence would have been discovered was truly independent; second, whether the use of the legal means would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence; and third, whether applying the inevitable discovery rule would either provide an incentive for police misconduct or significantly weaken constitutional protections.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, Officer Iacone testified the he would have sought a warrant to obtain Gomes's phones even if Officer Corvese had not seized them during Gomes's arrest. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 64:3-7.) The \"legal means\" the officers used to obtain the federal warrant-the interview with the alleged victim subsequent to her arrest-was truly independent from Gomes's arrest. Before Officer Corvese stopped Gomes and subsequently arrested him, the alleged victim, NB, was already in police custody, and thus the use of NB's interview to obtain the warrant \"would have inevitably led to the discovery of the evidence\" in Gomes's iPhone.\n   <em>\n    Almeida\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931726\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/25/#p28\">\n    434 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   28 ; (Hr'g 1 Tr. 53:21-25, 54:1.)

In addition, by waiting to search his phones until they received a warrant three days after its seizure, the officers refrained from violating Gomes's Fourth Amendment rights. Thus, the three-day delay was permissible and did not violate Gomes's Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   III. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Having found that sufficient probable cause supported the warrantless search and arrest of Gomes, and the subsequent searches of his cellphones, particularly the iPhone5, were conducted after the officers obtained valid search warrants, the Motion (ECF No. 55) is DENIED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Backpage.com was a website used to advertise individuals for the purpose of commercial sex. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 6:6-7.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    An \"in call\" is when the customer comes to the prostitute's location for sex. (\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    at 19:17-21.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    The vehicle was also described in police reports as a black Nissan Maxima. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 36:4-21.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Gomes never provided the vehicle's registration. (Hr'g 2 Tr. 37:3-6.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    The name \"Sincere\" was confirmed as a nickname for Reysean Williams, a co-defendant in this case. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 57: 1-5.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    Indeed, Officer Iacone testified that the incriminating conversation between the officers and H3nny regarding the details of the \"date\" (a \"two girl special\" and $500 payment) occurred via text. (Hr'g 1 Tr. 44:9-12.) Previously, however, both parties represented in their papers that this conversation occurred over the phone ten minutes prior to the car arriving at the apartment. (ECF No. 55 3; Resp. 5.) Had this been true, it certainly would have been easier to impute knowledge of the criminal activity to Gomes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
