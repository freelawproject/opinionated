CHEN, United States District Judge\n     The parties disagree whether anything remains to be litigated in this case following the Ninth Circuit's reversal of this Court's prior grant of summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs under the interstate commerce clause. Plaintiffs insist that, following their loss of the commerce clause claim, they may now pursue a theory challenging Defendants' conduct under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have waived that theory. For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees. Accordingly, Defendants' motion is\n      <strong>\n       GRANTED\n      </strong>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-10\">\n      <strong>\n       I.\n       <em>\n        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       </em>\n      </strong>\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      Plaintiffs' initial complaint alleged six causes of action, including for violations of the dormant Commerce Clause, equal protection under the federal and state constitutions, Medicaid statutes and regulations, and for declaratory, injunctive, and other equitable relief.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 1-2 at 12. After pressing the Court to bifurcate liability and prospective relief from the question of retrospective damages, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment\n      <em>\n       only\n      </em>\n      on their Commerce Clause and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) claims.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 39 at 15-20.

Plaintiffs did not advance any argument under the equal protection clause.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-12\">\n      After Plaintiffs' motion, Defendants cross-moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' causes of action, including the equal protection claim.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 51 at 18-20. Plaintiffs opposed Defendants' motion, arguing in part that the alleged conduct violated the equal protection clause.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 52 at 19-20. However, Plaintiffs' argument on the claim was brief: it consisted of a single page with a conclusory argument that Defendants' claim of administrative necessity could not satisfy rational basis review for the same reasons it could not survive scrutiny under the commerce clause (\n      <em>\n       id.\n      </em>\n      ), which subjects discriminatory laws to a \"virtually\n      <em>\n       per se\n      </em>\n      rule of invalidity.\"\n      <em>\n       Chemical West Mgmt., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs did not challenge that assertion in their reply\n     brief.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 58. They left the claim of abandonment of the equal protection claim unanswered.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-14\">\n      Defendants' reply brief in support of their own cross-motion re-iterated that Plaintiffs had abandoned the equal protection claim by failing to affirmatively move on it, and by noting that Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment on that claim merely reiterated their argument under the commerce clause without discussing the necessary elements of an equal protection claim.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 59 at 12-15.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-15\">\n      At the October 15, 2015 hearing on the cross-motions, Plaintiffs did not rebut the abandonment assertion or argue in favor of an equal protection claim.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 89.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-16\">\n      The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment; it found that Defendants had violated the commerce clause.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 65 at 43. It also partially granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment under \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A).\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 44. The judgment was partial insofar as Plaintiffs had only sought judgment on liability, not damages. The Court did note that it \"need not reach Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claims.\"\n      <em>\n       Id.\n      </em>\n      at 43. Since Plaintiffs had not moved for judgment on their equal protection claim, the Court was referring to disposition of Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment on that issue.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-17\">\n      The Court then ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs regarding whether Plaintiffs were entitled to retroactive monetary relief. Plaintiffs' supplemental brief surprisingly argued that their complaint \"contains no federal causes of action and seeks no remedies under federal law,\" and that \"[i]nstead, it contains only state law causes of action and seeks only remedies provided for under California law.\" Docket No. 70 at 1. Plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to monetary relief under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1085, and expressly argued that the Court should not decide the question of retroactive relief pursuant to\n      <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n        Id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      In its order regarding retroactive damages, the Court observed that \"Plaintiffs expressly waived federal claims, stating that the state complaint contains\n      <em>\n       only state law causes of action and seeks only remedies provided for under California law.\n      </em>\n      \" Docket No. 82 at 4 (emphasis added);\n      <em>\n       see also\n       <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      (\"Plaintiffs expressly now disavow any federal causes of action....\").

However, because the appeal was premature (there was not yet a final judgment), the Ninth Circuit granted Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeal.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 99.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-19\">\n      Based on Plaintiffs' disavowal of any federal cause of action and the Court's holding that \u00a7 1085 did not afford Plaintiffs a basis for relief, Defendants sought leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the Court's summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the commerce clause claim, arguing that the order was not supported by any cause of action in light of the Court's holding regarding \u00a7 1085 and Plaintiffs' disavowal of a federal cause of action.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 92. The Court granted Defendants leave to file for reconsideration.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 110. In response, Plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint to state a cause of action under\n      <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n      </extracted-citation>\n      in order to save their judgment on the commerce clause.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 111. The proposed amended complaint repeated the same six causes of action initially pled in state court, but added a seventh cause of action titled \"federal claims\" seeking relief under\n      <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n      </extracted-citation>\n      and 1988 based on violations of the interstate commerce clause, equal protection clause, and federal Medicare laws.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 113 \u00b6 57.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-20\">\n      Technically, the amended complaint re-asserts an equal protection claim. However, in requesting leave to amend, Plaintiffs explained that their proposed amended complaint \"merely makes clear what this Court and the defendants were already assuming during the prior summary judgment process, which is that the plaintiffs are asserting a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.... [I]t is the defendants that necessitated the amendment to plaintiffs' Complaint by challenging through their motion for reconsideration this Court's December 21, 2015 partial summary judgment Order. Had the defendants never filed that motion for reconsideration which questioned the correctness of this Court's December 21, 2015, Order, plaintiffs' proposed amendment would have been unnecessary and redundant.\" Docket No. 116 at 3-4. In other words, there was no reason for the Court or Defendants to believe that the amended complaint was intended to preserve an equal protection claim; rather, it was expressly presented by Plaintiffs as necessary only to reassert a\n      <em>\n       federal\n      </em>\n      cause of action in support of relief under the commerce clause, a clarification needed after Plaintiffs' disavowed any federal claim. With that understanding, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Docket No. 121 at 5. Hence, notwithstanding the amended complaint, Plaintiffs have never pursued in earnest an equal protection claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-21\">\n      Further supporting the conclusion that Plaintiffs did not intend to actively litigate the equal protection claim, at the September 22, 2016 hearing concerning their motion for leave to amend the complaint, Plaintiffs \"request[ed] that based on the Court's rulings to date [the Court] enter a final judgment so the case [can] move forward.\" Docket No. 142 at 37:10-12;\n      <em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n        id.\n       </extracted-citation>\n      </em>\n      <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n       at 37:18-19\n      </extracted-citation>\n      (\"We would just prefer that a final judgment be entered.\").

B (AOB 6) (emphasis added); and (viii) in response to Defendants' challenge to the Court's holding under the commerce clause, Plaintiffs never argued to the Ninth Circuit that the Court's judgment should be affirmed on the alternative basis of the equal protection clause. Furthermore, Plaintiffs never discussed the equal protection theory in\n     their case management statements. In the earliest statement, they \"request[ed] that this Court bifurcate the liability and prospective remedy issues from the issue of the retroactive reimbursement due the plaintiffs, and schedule cross-motions for summary judgment,\" without referring to the equal protection claim. Docket No. 37 at 3. After the summary judgment motions were fully briefed, the parties submitted another case management statement in which Plaintiffs did not indicate that further liability issues remained outstanding.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket No. 61. Plaintiffs did not suggest that they intended to preserve or pursue their equal protection claim in any subsequent, pre-appeal case management statement.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      Docket Nos. 66, 67, 72, 73.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-33\">\n      On the other hand, Plaintiffs (i) opposed Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the equal protection claim on the merits, albeit in a brief and conclusory fashion; and (ii) retained the equal protection claim in their amended complaint.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-34\">\n      While not entirely free from ambiguity, the overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that Plaintiffs waived their equal protection claim, as inferred from their litigation conduct. It may be that any one of these factors in isolation would not have been enough to give rise to a waiver, but here, all of them operating together overwhelmingly support that conclusion because Plaintiffs failed to raise equal protection arguments at nearly every juncture despite having the opportunity to do so.\n      <em>\n       See\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       U.S. v.

A final appealable judgment is generally one that resolves all claims against all parties. In this case, Plaintiffs requested a final judgment (potentially encompassing all claims)-even though the equal protection claim had not been adjudicated.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-37\">\n      The final judgment rule does not necessarily mean that a Court has no choice but to adjudicate each and every claim or alternative theory advanced by a plaintiff, even if resolution of a single claim can effectively provide the plaintiff with full relief-as happened here. The rules of procedure are pragmatic, and they recognize that in certain cases judicial economy may be better served by focusing on resolution of a plaintiff's key claims, rather than the entire kitchen-sink of alternative theories. Hence, Rule 54(b) permits the Court, at its discretion, to enter partial final judgment on fewer than all claims in a multi-claim or multi-party action if it \"expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Rule 54(b) gives the district court the opportunity to consider that question, usually in response to a party's motion to seek such certification. The court of appeals then would have the opportunity to \"scrutinize for an abuse of discretion in light of the interest of sound judicial administration the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims [both certified and uncertified] so as to prevent piecemeal appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units.\"\n      <em>\n       Curtiss-Wright Corp. v.

As a result, neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to assess the pros and cons of Plaintiffs' litigation plan (to seek judgment on the commerce clause theory first, and then be in a position to assert the equal protection clause claim if they lost on appeal). Plaintiffs never put the issue before the court. There was no reason for the Court to believe they were seeking anything less than a true final judgment. This is especially so since Plaintiffs never contested Defendants' assertion that Plaintiffs had abandoned the equal protection claim.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-39\">\n      To the extent Plaintiffs contend certification under Rule 54(b) was not necessary because this Court's grant of summary judgment on the commerce clause claim gave Plaintiffs as much relief as they could have achieved under the equal protection claim and that there is no need to litigate alternative theories to obtain duplicative relief, the Court need not reach the question whether Plaintiffs' equal protection and commerce clause claims constituted a single claim or separate claims for purposes of Rule 54(b).\n      <em>\n       Compare\n      </em>\n      <em>\n       Wood v.

That question is ultimately immaterial to the outcome of this case: if the two claims were similar enough so as to constitute a single claim under Rule 54(b), Plaintiffs could and should have raised the equal protection argument to support the judgment on appeal; if they were distinct and separate claims, Plaintiffs effectively waived the equal protection claim by requesting final judgment (rather than certification under Rule 54(b) ). Generally, a judgment \"must conclusively terminate the litigation in order to be considered final\" and \"an order that\n      <em>\n       may\n      </em>\n      terminate the proceeding is insufficient,\"\n      <em>\n       Cheng\n      </em>\n      ,\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10533842\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/878/306/#p309\">\n       878 F.2d at 310\n      </extracted-citation>\n      .\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-41\">\n      With respect to the second factor, Plaintiffs made no argument to the Ninth Circuit that the Court's judgment in their favor should be affirmed on the alternative basis of the equal protection clause if the Ninth Circuit were to disagree with the commerce clause holding.
