CHEN, United States District Judge <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1201\" href=\"#p1201\" id=\"p1201\">*1201</a>The parties disagree whether anything remains to be litigated in this case following the Ninth Circuit's reversal of this Court's prior grant of summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs under the interstate commerce clause. Plaintiffs insist that, following their loss of the commerce clause claim, they may now pursue a theory challenging Defendants' conduct under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Defendants argue that Plaintiffs have waived that theory. For the reasons explained below, the Court agrees. Accordingly, Defendants' motion is <strong>GRANTED</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-10\"><strong>I. <em>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-11\">Plaintiffs' initial complaint alleged six causes of action, including for violations of the dormant Commerce Clause, equal protection under the federal and state constitutions, Medicaid statutes and regulations, and for declaratory, injunctive, and other equitable relief. <em>See</em> Docket No. 1-2 at 12. After pressing the Court to bifurcate liability and prospective relief from the question of retrospective damages, Plaintiffs moved for summary judgment <em>only</em> on their Commerce Clause and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A) claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See</em> Docket No. 39 at 15-20. They did <em>not</em> move for summary judgment on their equal protection claim. <em>Id.</em> Although as pled in the complaint, violation of Section 1396a(a)(13)(A) also violated equal protection, <em>see</em> Compl. \u00b6 42 and note 1, <em>supra</em> , Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment relied exclusively on statutory grounds. <em>See</em> Docket No. 39 at 17-20. Plaintiffs did not advance any argument under the equal protection clause.</p><p id=\"p-12\">After Plaintiffs' motion, Defendants cross-moved for summary judgment on all of Plaintiffs' causes of action, including the equal protection claim. <em>See</em> Docket No. 51 at 18-20. Plaintiffs opposed Defendants' motion, arguing in part that the alleged conduct violated the equal protection clause. <em>See</em> Docket No. 52 at 19-20. However, Plaintiffs' argument on the claim was brief: it consisted of a single page with a conclusory argument that Defendants' claim of administrative necessity could not satisfy rational basis review for the same reasons it could not survive scrutiny under the commerce clause (<em>id.</em> ), which subjects discriminatory laws to a \"virtually <em>per se</em> rule of invalidity.\" <em>Chemical West Mgmt., Inc. v. Hunt</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729096\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/334/\">504 U.S. 334</extracted-citation>, 344 n.6, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729096\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/334/\">112 S.Ct. 2009</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11729096\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/504/334/\">119 L.Ed.2d 121</extracted-citation> (1992) (quotation omitted).</p><p id=\"p-13\">In their subsequently filed brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment, Defendants argued that Plaintiffs abandoned their equal protection claim because Plaintiffs had not affirmatively moved for summary judgment thereon. <em>See</em> Docket No. 56 at 9. Plaintiffs did not challenge that assertion in their reply <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1202\" href=\"#p1202\" id=\"p1202\">*1202</a>brief. <em>See</em> Docket No. 58. They left the claim of abandonment of the equal protection claim unanswered.</p><p id=\"p-14\">Defendants' reply brief in support of their own cross-motion re-iterated that Plaintiffs had abandoned the equal protection claim by failing to affirmatively move on it, and by noting that Plaintiffs' opposition to Defendants' motion for summary judgment on that claim merely reiterated their argument under the commerce clause without discussing the necessary elements of an equal protection claim. <em>See</em> Docket No. 59 at 12-15.</p><p id=\"p-15\">At the October 15, 2015 hearing on the cross-motions, Plaintiffs did not rebut the abandonment assertion or argue in favor of an equal protection claim. <em>See</em> Docket No. 89.</p><p id=\"p-16\">The Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment; it found that Defendants had violated the commerce clause. <em>See</em> Docket No. 65 at 43. It also partially granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment under \u00a7 1396a(a)(13)(A). <em>Id.</em> at 44. The judgment was partial insofar as Plaintiffs had only sought judgment on liability, not damages. The Court did note that it \"need not reach Plaintiffs' Equal Protection claims.\" <em>Id.</em> at 43. Since Plaintiffs had not moved for judgment on their equal protection claim, the Court was referring to disposition of Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment on that issue.</p><p id=\"p-17\">The Court then ordered the parties to file supplemental briefs regarding whether Plaintiffs were entitled to retroactive monetary relief. Plaintiffs' supplemental brief surprisingly argued that their complaint \"contains no federal causes of action and seeks no remedies under federal law,\" and that \"[i]nstead, it contains only state law causes of action and seeks only remedies provided for under California law.\" Docket No. 70 at 1. Plaintiffs argued that they were entitled to monetary relief under California Code of Civil Procedure \u00a7 1085, and expressly argued that the Court should not decide the question of retroactive relief pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation>. <em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> In its order regarding retroactive damages, the Court observed that \"Plaintiffs expressly waived federal claims, stating that the state complaint contains <em>only state law causes of action and seeks only remedies provided for under California law.</em> \" Docket No. 82 at 4 (emphasis added); <em>see also <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">id.</extracted-citation></em> (\"Plaintiffs expressly now disavow any federal causes of action....\"). The Court ultimately held that \u00a7 1085 did not permit recovery of retroactive damages. <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\"> at 10</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-18\">Plaintiffs then appealed the Court's order regarding retroactive damages. <em>See</em> Docket No. 83. However, because the appeal was premature (there was not yet a final judgment), the Ninth Circuit granted Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal of the appeal. <em>See</em> Docket No. 99.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Based on Plaintiffs' disavowal of any federal cause of action and the Court's holding that \u00a7 1085 did not afford Plaintiffs a basis for relief, Defendants sought leave to file a motion for reconsideration of the Court's summary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs on the commerce clause claim, arguing that the order was not supported by any cause of action in light of the Court's holding regarding \u00a7 1085 and Plaintiffs' disavowal of a federal cause of action. <em>See</em> Docket No. 92. The Court granted Defendants leave to file for reconsideration. <em>See</em> Docket No. 110. In response, Plaintiffs sought leave to amend their complaint to state a cause of action under <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation> in order to save their judgment on the commerce clause. <em>See</em> Docket No. 111. The proposed amended complaint repeated the same six causes of action initially pled in state court, but added a seventh cause of action titled \"federal claims\" seeking relief under <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1203\" href=\"#p1203\" id=\"p1203\">*1203</a><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation> and 1988 based on violations of the interstate commerce clause, equal protection clause, and federal Medicare laws. <em>See</em> Docket No. 113 \u00b6 57.</p><p id=\"p-20\">Technically, the amended complaint re-asserts an equal protection claim. However, in requesting leave to amend, Plaintiffs explained that their proposed amended complaint \"merely makes clear what this Court and the defendants were already assuming during the prior summary judgment process, which is that the plaintiffs are asserting a claim for relief under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.... [I]t is the defendants that necessitated the amendment to plaintiffs' Complaint by challenging through their motion for reconsideration this Court's December 21, 2015 partial summary judgment Order. Had the defendants never filed that motion for reconsideration which questioned the correctness of this Court's December 21, 2015, Order, plaintiffs' proposed amendment would have been unnecessary and redundant.\" Docket No. 116 at 3-4. In other words, there was no reason for the Court or Defendants to believe that the amended complaint was intended to preserve an equal protection claim; rather, it was expressly presented by Plaintiffs as necessary only to reassert a <em>federal</em> cause of action in support of relief under the commerce clause, a clarification needed after Plaintiffs' disavowed any federal claim. With that understanding, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to file an amended complaint. Docket No. 121 at 5. Hence, notwithstanding the amended complaint, Plaintiffs have never pursued in earnest an equal protection claim.</p><p id=\"p-21\">Further supporting the conclusion that Plaintiffs did not intend to actively litigate the equal protection claim, at the September 22, 2016 hearing concerning their motion for leave to amend the complaint, Plaintiffs \"request[ed] that based on the Court's rulings to date [the Court] enter a final judgment so the case [can] move forward.\" Docket No. 142 at 37:10-12; <em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\"> at 37:18-19</extracted-citation> (\"We would just prefer that a final judgment be entered.\"). At Plaintiffs' request, on October 12, 2016, the Court entered final judgment, incorporating its summary judgment order as well as the subsequent orders granting Plaintiffs leave to amend and partially granting Defendants' motion for reconsideration. <em>See</em> Docket No. 126. That final judgment as requested by Plaintiffs contained no adjudication of any equal protection claim.</p><p id=\"p-22\">Plaintiffs thereafter moved for attorneys' fees pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201988\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988</extracted-citation> and Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(d). <em>See</em> Docket Nos. 127 and 128. The Court granted the request. <em>See</em> Docket No. 159.</p><p id=\"p-23\">Meanwhile, Plaintiffs appealed from final judgment with respect to the Court's retroactivity ruling, <em>see</em> Docket No. 129, and Defendants appealed with respect to the Court's commerce clause ruling, <em>see</em> Docket No. 141, and the award of attorneys' fees and costs.</p><p id=\"p-24\">In their opening brief on appeal, Plaintiffs asserted that \"the Ninth Circuit has jurisdiction over the Hospitals' appeal pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291</extracted-citation> because this appeal is from a final judgment that <em>disposes of all parties' claims.</em> \" Sondheimer Decl., Ex. B (AOB 6) (emphasis added). Defendants took the same position. Sondheimer Decl., Ex. C (AOB 4).</p><p id=\"p-25\">There were three appeals before the Ninth Circuit: the Department's appeal of the commerce clause holding, the Department's appeal of the attorneys' fees and costs award, and the Hospitals' appeal of the Court's holding on retroactivity. <em>See</em> <em>Asante v. Cal. Dep't Health Care Servs.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516485\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/795/#p798\">886 F.3d 795</extracted-citation>, 798 (9th Cir. 2018). The only arguments pressed by Plaintiffs on appeal were that Defendants' policies violated the commerce clause and that Section 1085 permits retroactive relief. <em>See</em> First Br. on <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1204\" href=\"#p1204\" id=\"p1204\">*1204</a>Cross-Appeal, Case No. 16-17080, Docket No. 14 (9th Cir. Apr. 27, 2017). They made no reference to the equal protection clause other than noting in passing that the complaint had asserted a claim. <em>Id.</em> at 2. Defendants' cross-brief touched on the same issues, but also argued that the District Court abused its discretion by permitting Plaintiffs to amend their complaint. <em>See</em> Second Br. on Cross-Appeal., Docket No. 16, at 50-58 (9th Cir. Jun. 29, 2017). In response, Plaintiffs argued leave to amend was proper because it was for the purposes of clarifying that they had always been seeking prospective relief under federal law; but they made no argument that an equal protection claim remained pending or unresolved. <em>See</em> Third Br. on Cross-Appeal, Docket No. 21 at 34-41 (9th Cir. Jul. 18, 2017).</p><p id=\"p-26\">The Ninth Circuit reversed the Court's judgment on the commerce clause. <em>Asante</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516485\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/886/795/#p798\">886 F.3d 795</extracted-citation>. The Court held that it had \"jurisdiction pursuant to <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291</extracted-citation>.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\"> at 799</extracted-citation>. It concluded that Defendants had not violated the commerce clause. <em><extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\"> at 802</extracted-citation>. In resolving that issue, the Ninth Circuit found it unnecessary to reach the questions presented in the other two appeals, namely, the Hospitals' appeal of the retroactivity holding and the Defendants' appeal of attorneys' fees and costs. <em><extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\"> at 803</extracted-citation>. It also did not reach the other issues raised in Defendants' appeal, including whether the Court erred by granting Plaintiffs leave to amend, apparently believing that the issue was mooted by resolution of the commerce clause claim.</p><p id=\"p-27\">The Ninth Circuit issued its mandate on May 22, 2018, <em>see</em> Docket No. 174, reversing without expressly stating that the case was being remanded for further proceedings on any issue.</p><p id=\"p-28\"><strong>II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></strong></p><p id=\"p-29\">The question now before the Court is whether Plaintiffs may now proceed with their equal protection claim or whether they have effectively waived or abandoned it through their litigation conduct in this Court and on appeal before the Ninth Circuit. The parties have also briefed the question whether the Court has jurisdiction to entertain Plaintiffs' new state law assertion that Defendants have violated State Plan Amendment 15-020.</p><p id=\"p-30\">A. <em>Plaintiffs are Foreclosed From Pursuing Their Equal Protection Claim</em></p><p id=\"p-31\">The complicated procedural history recounted above is not entirely free of ambiguity as to whether Plaintiffs ever intended to pursue their equal protection claim.</p><p id=\"p-33\">On the other hand, Plaintiffs (i) opposed Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the equal protection claim on the merits, albeit in a brief and conclusory fashion; and (ii) retained the equal protection claim in their amended complaint.</p><p id=\"p-34\">While not entirely free from ambiguity, the overwhelming weight of the evidence supports the conclusion that Plaintiffs waived their equal protection claim, as inferred from their litigation conduct. It may be that any one of these factors in isolation would not have been enough to give rise to a waiver, but here, all of them operating together overwhelmingly support that conclusion because Plaintiffs failed to raise equal protection arguments at nearly every juncture despite having the opportunity to do so. <em>See</em> <em>U.S. v. Dreyer</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4357387\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/804/1266/#p1277\">804 F.3d 1266</extracted-citation>, 1277 (9th Cir. 2015) (\"Generally, an appellee waives any argument it fails to raise in its answering brief.\"); <em>In re Cellular 101, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3845304,3119806\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/539/1150/\">539 F.3d 1150</extracted-citation>, 1155 (9th Cir. 2008) (a party waives an argument when it could have raised it on an appeal but did not do so); <em>BankAmerica Pension Plan v.

A final appealable judgment is generally one that resolves all claims against all parties. In this case, Plaintiffs requested a final judgment (potentially encompassing all claims)-even though the equal protection claim had not been adjudicated.</p><p id=\"p-37\">The final judgment rule does not necessarily mean that a Court has no choice but to adjudicate each and every claim or alternative theory advanced by a plaintiff, even if resolution of a single claim can effectively provide the plaintiff with full relief-as happened here. The rules of procedure are pragmatic, and they recognize that in certain cases judicial economy may be better served by focusing on resolution of a plaintiff's key claims, rather than the entire kitchen-sink of alternative theories. Hence, Rule 54(b) permits the Court, at its discretion, to enter partial final judgment on fewer than all claims in a multi-claim or multi-party action if it \"expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Rule 54(b) gives the district court the opportunity to consider that question, usually in response to a party's motion to seek such certification. The court of appeals then would have the opportunity to \"scrutinize for an abuse of discretion in light of the interest of sound judicial administration the district court's evaluation of such factors as the interrelationship of the claims [both certified and uncertified] so as to prevent piecemeal appeals in cases which should be reviewed only as single units.\" <em>Curtiss-Wright Corp. v. General Elec. Co.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179993\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/1/#p10\">446 U.S. 1</extracted-citation>, 10, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179993\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/1/#p10\">100 S.Ct. 1460</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179993\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/1/#p10\">64 L.Ed.2d 1</extracted-citation> (1980).</p><p id=\"p-38\">Plaintiffs could have but did not request partial final judgment under Rule 54(b), expressly reserving the equal protection claim. As a result, neither this Court nor the Court of Appeals had the opportunity to assess the pros and cons of Plaintiffs' litigation plan (to seek judgment on the commerce clause theory first, and then be in a position to assert the equal protection clause claim if they lost on appeal). Plaintiffs never put the issue before the court. There was no reason for the Court to believe they were seeking anything less than a true final judgment. This is especially so since Plaintiffs never contested Defendants' assertion that Plaintiffs had abandoned the equal protection claim.</p><p id=\"p-39\">To the extent Plaintiffs contend certification under Rule 54(b) was not necessary because this Court's grant of summary judgment on the commerce clause claim gave Plaintiffs as much relief as they could have achieved under the equal protection claim and that there is no need to litigate alternative theories to obtain duplicative relief, the Court need not reach the question whether Plaintiffs' equal protection and commerce clause claims constituted a single claim or separate claims for purposes of Rule 54(b). <em>Compare</em> <em>Wood v.

That question is ultimately immaterial to the outcome of this case: if the two claims were similar enough so as to constitute a single claim under Rule 54(b), Plaintiffs could and should have raised the equal protection argument to support the judgment on appeal; if they were distinct and separate claims, Plaintiffs effectively waived the equal protection claim by requesting final judgment (rather than certification under Rule 54(b) ).
