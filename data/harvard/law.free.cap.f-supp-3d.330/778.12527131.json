Pls.' Rule 56.1 Statement (\"Pls.' Facts\") \u00b6 1, ECF No. 99-1. Oyola occupied apartment 1L; Sanchez occupies apartment 3L; and former plaintiff Kathleen Santiago occupied apartment 1R.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. The Tenants Association is an unincorporated association\n   purportedly comprised of Sanchez, Oyola, Santiago, and their families. Defs.' Rule 56.1. Statement of Undisputed Facts (\"Defs.' Facts\") \u00b6 2, ECF No. 96-2. The Tenants Association was founded in 1998 by a group of the Building's Latino tenants with the goal of \"establish[ing] ... a functioning landlord-tenant relationship [and] ... ensuring the habitability and proper maintenance of their building and their homes.\" Compl. \u00b6 20, ECF No. L Beginning in or about 2001, Latino members of the Tenants Association began to move out of the Building, either of their own volition or after accepting buy-outs \"after years of not getting repairs made to their apartment[s].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 23-40. After each family moved out, the landlords renovated their apartments, each of which the landlords had allowed to fall into a state of disrepair, and new Hasidic Jewish tenants moved into the apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Following Oyola's eviction in October 2017, Sanchez is the only remaining Latino tenant in the Building; all of the rest of the tenants are believed to be Hasidic.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 41-46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant 273 Lee Realty, an LLC of which defendant Steinmetz is the sole member, purchased the Building in or about early 2006, at which time Defendants inherited a history of rancor and conflict between the Plaintiffs, who identify as Latino, and their former landlords, who are alleged to have been Hasidic. Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 3-4; Pls.'

Plaintiffs allege when Steinmetz-who is also alleged to be Hasidic-took over ownership of the building in 2006, he sought to continue a trend that had already been playing out in the Building, and South Williamsburg more broadly, for several years: the marginalization of and active discrimination against Latino residents in favor of other Hasidic Jewish residents. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 3-10. Specifically, Plaintiffs allege they have \"experienced discrimination at the hands of Defendants and Defendants' agents\" particularly by being \"treated differently from, and in an inferior manner to, their Hasidic Jewish neighbors.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs allege they have \"experienced severe harassment and discrimination at the hands of the various Hasidic Jewish landlords to own the Premises since 1996,\" including Defendants, and, as a result of Defendants' discrimination against them, Plaintiffs \"have not only lived with various conditions of disrepair and a lack of services, despite their requests for assistance, but they have also suffered the indignity of watching Defendants perform preferential repairs for, and provide superior services to, their Hasidic Jewish neighbors.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 47-48. Plaintiffs allege Defendants have hired at least seven different management companies since 2010, which often left Plaintiffs without a point of contact to request repairs, either due to a gap between companies where there was no responsible party or because tenants were not notified of the changes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 49-52. However, under all management companies hired by Defendants, except for one, both the contact persons and workers provided to Plaintiffs differed from those provided to the building's Hasidic Jewish residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 52.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   This alleged discrimination, described in further detail\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , culminated in a trial in the Kings County Civil Court (hereinafter, the \"Housing Court\") to recover possession of the units occupied by plaintiff Oyola and former plaintiff Santiago (together, \"the Respondents\"), which Steinmetz contends was motivated by his desire to have his daughters move into the apartments. Defs.' Facts \u00b6\u00b6 8-9. The parties dispute whether Steinmetz was aware Plaintiffs were not Hasidic prior to the trial in 2016 when the parties saw each other for the\n   first time, although the record suggests Steinmetz may have known.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6; Pls.'

Housing Conditions Experienced by Plaintiffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Plaintiffs identify a number of conditions they contend are the result of purposeful discrimination against them, as Latino tenants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. In or about and between 2009 to 2011, Plaintiffs interacted primarily with an unidentified male worker, who informed Plaintiff Oyola he had been told to perform \"poor repairs\" and who would \"often make things worse or refuse to make the requested repairs.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 53-54. This worker's actions included refusing to fix a cabinet because it was not literally falling off the wall and \"fiddling\" with a light that needed to be fixed by an electrician, causing the entire apartment to black out, and then never calling the needed electrician.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. During the same period, an apartment of the building was being gut renovated, and was subsequently leased to Hasidic tenants.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. In 2011, the same worker cut the water lines to Plaintiffs' washing machines and directed Plaintiffs to remove their washing machines from their units, even though the renovated apartments appear to have washing machines operating in them.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 56-57.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. When a new company was hired to manage the Building in 2011, Plaintiffs rarely received requested repairs, whereas they often observed workers performing maintenance for their Hasidic neighbors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. When Plaintiffs did receive repairs, they were \"piecemeal and substandard,\" such as placing sticky tiles over water damaged floors.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. During the same period, Plaintiffs observed high quality building materials and new appliances being brought into the Building for the renovation of the other apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. When given the opportunity to visit one of the newly renovated apartments, Plaintiffs observed a stark contrast between these apartments and their own, which had outdated fixtures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 62-63. A worker for this company apologized to Plaintiffs Oyola and Sanchez about the state of their apartments, but explained he had been directed not to make quality repairs in these apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 64-65. This company was terminated in 2014, after which Plaintiffs were left without a point of contact for a several months, during which time they suffered from inadequate heating in their apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Since 2009, Plaintiffs have often had to live without adequate heating during winter months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 69-77. In 2009, the thermostat from the building was moved into the apartment of a Hasidic tenant, who would turn off the heat when the tenant's family left the Building for the weekend.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 70-73. The thermostat was then moved to the apartment of another Hasidic neighbor in 2010, but the heating problems persisted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 73-74. When the maintenance company was terminated in 2014, Plaintiffs were left without a point of contact, and had to call 311 regarding; their heating issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74, The heating issues persisted until early 2015, when a new management company took over.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 75. The thermostat was then moved to a shared hallway, but covered and locked in a plastic box; Plaintiffs were not given access to the thermostat\n   until November 2015, but even then were not taught how to use it or given permission to do so.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 76-77.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   4. In May 2015, a leak was reported in the apartment of one of Plaintiffs' Hasidic neighbors-apartment 2L-and Defendants' agents immediately took action to repair it, even though plaintiff Oyola-who lived in apartment 1L-had been experiencing and complaining of the same leak for over a year.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 79-80. A plumber was sent to inspect plaintiff Sanchez's bathroom-in apartment 3L-and determined the leak was not in her apartment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. The plumber then found a broken pipe in the bathroom of apartment 2L, and broke down the bathroom wall to fix it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 82-83. The plumber also broke down the wall of plaintiff Oyola's bathroom, and left the walls unrepaired, covered only by a plastic sheet, for three months.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-85. When the wall was later repaired, workers \"only used plastic panels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86. Around this same time, a light fixture in plaintiff Oyola's apartment began leaking, but this remained unrepaired until apartment 2L was renovated in January 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 87-88. Further, in January 2016, plaintiff Oyola's bathroom sink overflowed and the condition was allowed to persist for so long that the apartment's floors and bathroom door became warped and damaged,\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-96. Plaintiffs eventually initiated a proceeding in Housing Court to get the condition repaired, and, even then, the repairs were done in a shoddy manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 94-96.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   5. Plaintiffs also allege they have \"experienced countless problems with their building's main entrance doors and the doors of their respective apartments.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. Specifically, the doors of Plaintiffs Oyola's and Sanchez's apartments have key locks that are faulty and which take a great deal of time to open and/or doors that do not close properly, but which Defendants have failed to repair in a timely manner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 99-101. On the other hand, Plaintiffs' Hasidic neighbors have combination locks on their doors,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98, and receive repairs to those locks immediately upon request,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101. Plaintiffs have also experienced issues being locked in and out of the Building due to difficulties with the combination lock placed on the front door and, when their counsel contacted the management company, were accused of having broken the lock and \"making trouble.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 104-106.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs' apartments were plagued by recurring conditions of disrepair. Pls.' Facts \u00b6 31. Plaintiffs contend they languished for extended periods of time without repairs and, when repairs were made, they received inferior repairs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 24(a). Defendants state Plaintiffs often denied or postponed access to perform repairs or failed to inform Defendants of necessary repairs. Defs.' Facts \u00b6 26(q). City records reveal, as of September 11, 2017, there are thirty open violation records for the Building, all of which conditions are in apartments 1L, 1R, and 3L-the apartments occupied by Plaintiffs and former plaintiff Santiago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Louis Decl. Ex. 60, Open Violation Summary Report, ECF No. 100-60. During the period Defendants owned the Building, from 2006 through September 11, 2017, there were a total of 700 closed housing code violations, with a majority of violations for units occupied by Hispanic tenants, including Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.'

Facts \u00b6 19. However, Sanchez explicitly denied applying for any of the vacant units; and Oyola testified she had inquired with Diego Lozano, purportedly an agent of Steinmetz, in 2011 or 2012, regarding the availability of vacant apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Oyola was reportedly told there were no available apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Steinmetz testified units were typically rented through word of mouth to friends or relatives of friends.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 23. Further, rental applications required potential tenants to indicate the synagogue affiliation for themselves and their parents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Vacant apartments were ultimately rented, but exclusively to Hasidic residents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Housing Court Proceedings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Unsurprisingly, the aforementioned difficulties between Plaintiffs and Defendants have resulted in a great deal of litigation between the parties, which has included at least fifteen cases litigated in Housing Court, along with the instant suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl \u00b6\u00b6 107-17. Of particular relevance to the instant action, in January 2011, Steinmetz served required notices on Respondents informing them of his intent to initiate owner's use holdover (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , eviction) proceedings against them in Housing Court pursuant to Section 2524.4 of the Rent Stabilization Code, a provision that allows an owner to recover possession of a rent-stabilized apartment where the owner intends to use it as a primary residence for himself or a member of his immediate family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 118-21. In or around March 2011, Steinmetz instigated legal proceedings in Housing Court consistent with the notices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 124. Defendants assert the Housing Court proceedings were instituted to obtain possession of the apartments for two of Steinmetz's daughters and their families. Defs.' Facts \u00b6 9. After five years of extensive negotiations, discovery, and motion practice, a trial commenced on June 23, 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In the course of discovery, Plaintiffs learned Steinmetz owns interests in several other buildings, but none of his children or other relatives live in those buildings. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 134-35. During the trial, Steinmetz testified he owns several buildings and had not thought to move his daughters into those buildings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 136, 140. Steinmetz's daughters also testified that they had both recently moved into new apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 137-39. During the pendency of this Housing Court proceeding, several apartments in the Building became available, none of which were offered to the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 142-50.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Carponter Decl., Ex. E (\"Decision Denying Stay\"), ECF No. 98-1. The Housing Court stated, \"Respondents were afforded every opportunity to prove to the court that [Defendants'] intent to terminate their tenancy was discriminatory, rather than a good faith intention to provide homes for his daughters and their families.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.

C (\"Housing Court Decision\"), ECF No. 97-3. The Housing Court\n   found Steinmetz and his daughters had credibly articulated a legitimate desire to move into the Respondents' apartments, which were on the ground floor-and therefore were easier to reach with strollers and/or young children and could be expanded to accommodate their growing families by renovating the basement-and only a block away from Steinmetz's home.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4. Accordingly, the Housing Court found Steinmetz had instituted the proceedings in good faith, despite the Respondents' testimony, among other challenges, that their apartments had fallen into disrepair only once the building was sold to Jewish owners, of which Steinmetz was the most recent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-11. The Housing Court Decision indicates the Respondents raised their concerns that they were treated less well than their Hasidic neighbors, but the Housing Court nonetheless found Steinmetz was acting in good faith in instituting the eviction proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Having found in Steinmetz's favor, the Housing Court issued warrants of eviction, which were stayed through June 30, 2017, to allow Respondents sufficient time to vacate their apartments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In cases where there is no class-wide finding of discrimination, application of the futility rule is more problematic. In addressing futile gestures in terms of standing generally, the Second Circuit has recognized, \"[a]lthough the ripeness doctrine does not require 'a futile gesture as a prerequisite for adjudication in federal court,' conclusory or unsupported allegations of futility will not suffice.\"\n   <em>\n    Safe Harbor Retreat, LLC v.

Because there is no indication that Plaintiffs were \"reliably informed\" of any discriminatory policy with respect to Defendants' leasing out vacant apartments, they did not have actual notice that Defendants would engage in discrimination, Any allegation of futility is conclusory and unsupported, and Plaintiffs' reliance on the \"futile gesture\" theory fails as a matter of law.

(noting plaintiffs may establish their initial burden by making a \"modest showing\" that they were \"not provided the same services or facilities in connection therewith made available to others under circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference of prohibited discrimination\" (citation omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiffs have carried their initial burden in establishing potential violations of housing discrimination laws during the relevant time period (following the Accrual Dates). Indeed, the record contains evidence representing the current conditions of their apartment, which, considering all facts in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, are dilapidated and potentially dangerous. As of September\n   11, 2017, all open city violation records for the Building were for the apartments occupied by Plaintiffs and former plaintiff Santiago.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.Y.C. Housing Maintenance Code \u00a7 27-2002 (establishing code as minimum standards of health and safety). And, as the Court has found\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , there is sufficient evidence by which a reasonable factfinder could reach the conclusion that Defendants' challenged actions were motivated by discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Since Plaintiffs have stated a prima facie claim, the burden falls on Defendants to proffer legitimate reasons for their actions. While Defendants argue they have satisfied this burden by proving in Housing Court that Steinmetz's intention was to recover the Building for his family's use, as this Court has discussed, the Housing Court's determination on Steinmetz's intent was limited to his commencing the holdover proceedings. Here, Defendants have failed to set forth nondiscriminatory reasons for their failure to provide adequate accommodations and repairs, as alleged in the Complaint. With respect to the ultimate issues remaining in the case, specifically Defendants' motivations behind the alleged violative conduct, material issues of fact exist, which must be adjudicated by a factfinder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   And this Court must tread lightly in deciding whether summary judgment should be granted in a discrimination case that turns on intent. \"It is the rare occasion when discrimination boldly smacks one in the face, rather, it is 'often accomplished by discreet manipulations and hidden under a veil of self-declared innocence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Fair Hous.
