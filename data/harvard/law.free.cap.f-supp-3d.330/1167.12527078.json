CHEN, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns the planned Futenma Replacement Facility (FRF), a U.S. military facility in Okinawa, and its potential impacts on the Okinawa dugong, an endangered sea mammal important in Japanese culture. Negotiations between the United States and Japanese governments regarding the FRF have a long and fraught history. As explained in more detail below, they ultimately resulted in an agreement to relocate the Marine Corps Air Station Futenma from Ginawan City to an area adjacent to Camp Schwab and the Oura and Henoko Bays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In 2003, Plaintiffs filed suit pursuant to Section 402 of the National Historic Preservation Act (\"NHPA\"), challenging Defendant U.S. Department of Defense's plans to pursue the FRF without first \"taking into account\" (TIA) its potential adverse effects on the Okinawa dugong. Judge Patel, assigned to this case, agreed that Defendants had failed to perform an adequate TIA process and granted summary judgment in Plaintiffs' favor. However, because of political uncertainty about the future of the FRF, Judge Patel administratively closed the case in 2012. In 2014, Defendants informed the Court that they had completed a TIA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment concerning the adequacy of Defendants' TIA process under Section 402 of the NHPA. Plaintiffs contend that the process was inadequate because Defendants failed directly to consult Plaintiffs, cultural practitioners, local and Okinawa government officials, and failed to notify the public or Plaintiffs that the TIA process was underway. Plaintiffs also contend that, even if the Section 402 TIA process was adequate, Defendants' finding that the FRF would have no adverse effect on the Okinawa dugong were arbitrary and capricious under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , because it ran contrary to the scientific evidence and failed to consider important aspects of the problem.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court finds in favor of Defendants. Though Defendants' Section 402 process could possibly have been more inclusive, Defendants' efforts were sufficient to satisfy Section 402's modest procedural requirements. Further, Defendants adequately explained their conclusions based on the evidence available to them, such that their conclusions were not arbitrary or capricious under the APA. Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   and Defendants' motion is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The FRF and Okinawa Dugong\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Since the end of World War II and pursuant to various treaty arrangements, the United States has maintained military facilities on the Japanese island of Okinawa. This case concerns the planned relocation of the existing Marine Corps Air Station Futenma (\"MCAS Futenma\") in Ginawan City. The United States and Japan agreed to relocate it because its current location became problematic after substantial population growth in the surrounding area. The new site is referred to as the Futenma Replacement Facility (\"FRF\"). The plans for the FRF have been evolving for more than a decade pursuant to negotiations between Japan and the United States. According to a 2006 roadmap agreement, the two countries agreed that the FRF would be located offshore the existing Camp Schwab, near Henoko Point. The FRF plan calls for a \"V-shaped\" runway that will be partially built on landfill extending into Oura and Henoko Bays.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The intrusion into the Bays prompted this litigation. The waters in question are a habitat used by the Okinawa dugong, an endangered sea mammal. Plaintiffs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   a group of Japanese individuals and environmental organizations concerned about the Okinawa dugong's fate and the U.S.-based Center for Biological Diversity, filed suit in 2003 after relocation plans were first announced under Section 402 of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA). Section 402 of the NHPA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Prior to the approval of any undertaking outside the United States that may directly and adversely affect a property that is on the World Heritage List or on the applicable country's equivalent of the National Register, the head of a Federal agency having direct or indirect jurisdiction over the undertaking shall take into account the effect of the undertaking on the property for purposes of avoiding or mitigating any adverse effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20307101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 307101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Plaintiffs alleged that the Okinawa dugong was \"property\" on Japan's equivalent of the National Register within the meaning of Section 402. Judge Patel, then-presiding over the case, agreed and declined to dismiss the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dugong v.

Mar. 2, 2005) (\"\n   <em>\n    Dugong I\n   </em>\n   \"). Consequently, the NHPA required that, \"[p]rior to the approval of any undertaking outside the United States [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the FRF] that may directly or adversely affect [the Okinawa dugong],\" Defendants \"shall take into account the effect of the undertaking on the [dugong] for purposes of avoiding or mitigating any adverse effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20307101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 307101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). After Judge Patel's earlier ruling and a 2006 announcement about a new roadmap for the FRF, plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint and Defendants produced an administrative record to prepare for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At summary judgment, Judge Patel held that the FRF was a \"federal undertaking\" within the meaning of Section 402 of the NHPA,\n   <em>\n    Dugong v. Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1101 (N.D. Cal. 2008) (\"\n   <em>\n    Dugong II\n   </em>\n   \"), and that Defendants were therefore required to \"take into account the effect of the undertaking on the property for purposes of avoiding or mitigating any adverse effect.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20307101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 307101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). This is referred to as the \"take into account\" (TIA) process. Judge Patel sketched the basic outline of what a Section 402 TIA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   process should look like and held that Defendants had failed to comply.\n   <em>\n    Dugong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d at 1102-1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . She entered summary judgment for Plaintiffs and ordered Defendants to comply with NHPA Section 402. Due to subsequent uncertainty over the future of the FRF, Judge Patel held the case in abeyance and administratively closed it in February 2012, instructing the parties to move to re-open the case \"[w]hen plans for Henoko become more finalized or are abandoned.\" Docket No. 147 at 4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Over two years later, in April 2014, Defendants filed a notice that they had completed the Section 402 TIA process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 151. With the Court's leave, Plaintiffs thereafter filed a supplemental complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 152-1. Defendants successfully moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 186, 188, but the Ninth Circuit reversed and remanded.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 198. On remand, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment concerning the adequacy of Defendants' TIA process and the soundness of their conclusions under the APA. Those motions are now before the Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Nos. 221, 222, 223.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Defendants' \"Take Into Account\" Process\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsequent to Judge Patel's order, Defendants undertook a TIA process that involved several components. Each is described in more detail below, but the steps included,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , (1) a report on the FRF's potential impact on the dugong's\n   <em>\n    biological\n   </em>\n   well-being prepared by Dr. Thomas Jefferson (the \"Jefferson Report\"); (2) a report on the FRF's potential impact on the dugong's\n   <em>\n    cultural\n   </em>\n   significance prepared by a private research institute, International Archeological Research Institute, Inc. (IARII) (the \"Welch 2010 Report\"); (3) the Japanese government's Environmental Impact Statement (\"EIS\") regarding the FRF; and (4) miscellaneous other reports or sources of information described below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 10997. After considering these reports, Defendants rendered their findings that the FRF would not have adverse effects on the dugong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The various reports make reference to certain locations, including Henoko Bay, Oura Bay, and Kayo; the maps below illustrate the geography of the FRF and those areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The following reports constitute part of Defendants' TIA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Jefferson Report (Biological Assessment)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Defendants commissioned an internal study by Dr. Thomas A. Jefferson titled \"Biological Assessment of the Okinawan Dugong: A review of Information and Annotated\n   Bibliography Relevant to the Futenma Replacement Facility.\" US 3356. The report consists of a literature review concerning the taxonomy of the dugong, their distribution and abundance, typical lifespan, ecology, behavior and social organization, and threats to their population.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The general threats to the Okinawa dugong identified were hunting, bycatch, vessel traffic, chemical pollution, and habitat loss/degradation.

US 3369.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Jefferson concluded that, for conservation purposes, \"[m]anagement actions must be focused on human activities known to be actual causes of mortality for dugongs in this population, and this generally means the closure or relocation of gillnet and setnet fisheries that catch dugongs to locations outside the population's range.\" US 3373. He also noted that stopping the FRF would be futile in preserving the dugong without additional conservation efforts: \"Eliminating activities that may have the potential to limit population recovery (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the FRF), while ignoring the issues\n   <strong>\n    known\n   </strong>\n   to be causing population decline (e.g., possible illegal hunting and incidental catches in fisheries), will not help the population.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).

US 4163. Although the bulk of the report focuses on the cultural significance of the dugong, it also reviews biological and ecological literature concerning the dugong, including threats to their existence. US 4175-4184.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Sources of Information\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   IARII assembled a team of archeologists, a cultural anthropologist, and a biologist to prepare the report. The team consulted with cultural and natural resource specialists at Marine Corps Base Camp Butler and ultimately interviewed 16 informants, including seven archaeologists, two biologists, three archivists/professors, and four folklorists or individuals with local traditional knowledge about the dugong. The researchers also visited a number of organizations and museums, including Uruma City Cultural Sea Museum, University of the Ryukyus Museum, Higashi Village Museum, Ishigaki City Yaeyama Museum, Nakijin Village Museum of Culture and History, Nago Museum, Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium, and the Okinawa Prefectural Archaeology Center (organizations which were on Plaintiffs' list). US 4170. Additionally, the team visited the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education and municipal Boards of Education nearest to the proposed project (Chatan Town, Ginoza Village, Nakijin Village, and Nago City). The researchers also conducted a review of relevant academic literature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Findings of Adverse Effect\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on their research, the authors of the Welch report discussed both direct and indirect effects on the dugong's cultural significance. Direct effects were those that might directly affect the\n   <em>\n    cultural\n   </em>\n   importance of the dugong, while indirect effects were those that might cause\n   <em>\n    biological\n   </em>\n   harm to the species and thereby indirectly diminish its cultural significance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to the \"direct\" effects, the report concludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Based on the results of this study, the construction and operation of the FRF should have little direct adverse impact on the cultural significance of the dugong or on traditional cultural practices associated with the dugong. Since the\n   area in which the FRF will be built ... is already off-limits to the general Okinawan population, no cultural events or social/religious ritual ceremonies involving the dugong take place in these areas. Because of the dugong's rareness, its status as a GOJ endangered biological species, and its designation as a protected cultural property, hunting has not taken place, except perhaps surreptitiously and only occasionally, since the immediate post-war years. Because hunting is now illegal, the FRF will not directly affect hunting.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   US 4253. The study noted, however, that certain rituals honoring the sea deity are still held in Henoko Village adjacent to Camp Schwab and that \"temporary construction activities and later operational activities could disturb the performance of these rituals.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It further concluded that although the seagrass beds in the vicinity of Henoko might be impacted by the FRF because of the feeding trenches in the area, \"the project research found no indication that any culturally important activities are conducted in or associated with this area.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Welch report then discussed \"indirect\" effects on the dugong's cultural significance based on its assessment that \"[i]f the dugong population is lost, then it is likely that those traditions that help create Okinawan identity will become increasingly meaningless to future generations.\" US 4254. The report identified six potential threats to the dugong's existence: hunting, bycatch/incidental catch, vessel traffic, acoustic disturbance, chemical pollution, and habitat loss/degradation. AR 4180-83. Among these, the report stated that habitat destruction/alteration, pollution, and vessel collisions are the potential threats from military activities. Based on review of biological literature, the report stated that although dugongs were not currently living in Henoko Bay, \"destruction of seagrass beds along Henoko Bay will limit areas that could provide habitat in the event of recovery and increase in the current dugong populations.\" US 4254. It also states that \"noise from the construction and operation of the FRF could still affect the dugongs in [the area to the east of Oura Bay].\" US 4255.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although the Welch report identified these \"potential\" or \"possible\" effects, it made no attempt to quantify the likelihood that the threats would materialize. In other words, the Welch report does not analyze the FRF or related operations and the likelihood that they would cause harm to the dugong. It merely identified a list of possible threats worth consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   E.\n   <em>\n    Bi-Lateral Expert Study Group (2010)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The United States-Japan Security Consultative Committee also directed a group of experts to study the FRF's location, configuration, and construction method to help achieve the earliest possible relocation. US 7306. This study evaluated two alternative construction plans in consideration of the safety of local communities and U.S. military personnel, operational requirements for U.S. forces, noise impact, environmental concerns, and effects on the local community. US 7307. It concluded that one plan (the \"V\" plan) would require losing a beach on the east side of Camp Schwab and thus \"result[ ] in the loss of some animal and plant habitat,\" without further elaboration. US 7309. The other plan (the \"I\" plan) would preserve the beach but \"the impact on animal and plant habitat remains to be assessed.\" US 7311. Plaintiffs have cited the latter language as evidence of an incomplete process, but because Defendants have adopted the \"V\" plan, the language regarding the \"I\" plan is not material to the question of compliance with Section 402.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   F.\n   <em>\n    Survey of Marine Mammals in Okinawa (SuMMO) (2011-2012)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This report was commissioned to update the Integrated Natural Resources/Cultural Resources Management Plan for Marine Corps Base Camp Smedly D.

The Japanese EIS is over 1600 pages long. US 4793. It involves a comprehensive analysis of how likely the FRF's construction and planned manner of operation is to impact the Okinawa dugong. The Japanese EIS also underwent a robust public notice and comment process. These components are discussed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Public Notice and Public Comment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The Japanese EIS had 3 phases of public comment: first, about the planned scope of the EIS; second, about the draft EIS; and third, about the final EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 3032 (flow chart of process). The administrative record includes an English translation summary of 32-pages of public comments regarding the Japanese EIS's proposed scoping.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 1218. With respect to seagrass beds and dugong, the comments include,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , concerns that \"[t]he sea areas in the vicinity of Henoko are considered as very important breeding ground for the small population of Japanese dugongs,\" comments regarding whether the planned survey period would be of sufficient duration, whether research about dugongs in other countries could be applied directly to the Okinawa dugong, whether the planned survey to observe dugong was sufficiently broad in its geographic scope, how the survey would account for measuring impact of sound on dugong, and so on. US 1238-41. Indeed, about four pages of translated public comment in the Japanese EIS are dedicated specifically to the Okinawa dugong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiffs do not allege that they were unable to participate in this process. As explained above, the record indicates that members of the Japanese public were able to participate. The Okinawa Prefecture, akin to the regional government of Okinawa state, was also actively involved in the public comment process. The then-governor of Okinawa, Hirokazu Nakaima, submitted public comment regarding the proposed scope of the Japanese EIS on December 21, 2007 and January 21, 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 1251, 1319. The translated documents are 28-29 pages long. The comments are robust and detailed, and include, among other things, recommendations for how to assess impact caused by acoustic noise and vibrations, aircraft noise, water contamination, turbidity caused by sediments, impact on seaweeds and seagrasses used by dugong, and impacts on the dugong themselves.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , US 1269-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On March 4, 2008, the Department of Cultural and Environmental Affairs of the Okinawa Prefectural Government also submitted \"Comments on the Additions and Revisions to the Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping Document\" for the FRF.

Defendants were aware of these criticisms and internally circulated media coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 8150-8158 (e-mail thread reproducing media coverage of Okinawa prefecture's criticism of the Japanese EIS). This included criticism of the report's findings regarding potential effects on the dugong but the substance of the critique is unclear from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Substantive Findings of Japanese EIS\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Whereas the Welch and Jefferson reports only identify\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   adverse effects to the dugong from military activities, the Japanese EIS purports to determine the\n   <em>\n    likelihood\n   </em>\n   such harm will occur in light of the specific construction and operation plans for the FRF.

This amounts to the loss of 7.5% of the seagrass beds in the sea area in front of Henoko Bay and 37.7% of the beds on the side of Oura Bay (13% of the 600.4 hectares in both bays combined). Based on an independent evaluation of the data provided in the GoJ DEIS and the data collected and presented in the USMC [United States Marine Corps]'s expert's report (Encl 1), the USMC finds that, while the seagrass beds in Henoko and Oura bays are a potential natural habitat\n   and food source for the Okinawa dugong, because these seagrass beds are not consistently or routinely used by resident dugong and there are other seagrass beds sufficient to maintain the current population of Okinawa dugong, the loss of some of the seagrass beds in Henoko and Oura bays is not considered an adverse effect on the Okinawa dugong as a natural monument.

Moreover, they provide no standard for determining what parties meet the criteria for being \"affected.\" Nor do the guidelines consider the possibility that in some cases, the nature of a property or of a particular undertaking might be such that the number of interested parties is intractable. In this case, the property is the Okinawa dugong, an animal species without a fixed location, and the potential effects on the dugong range from cultural to biological. That sets this case apart from the typical NHPA Section 106 cases in which the cultural property is a geological or archeological feature with a fixed location and only a small number of groups with an entitlement to consulting party status claim to live in or use the affected property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In contrast, here, the cultural significance of the dugong to Okinawan society at large means that a variety of different groups (if not\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   individuals), could claim an interest in the dugong. Moreover, special concerns arise because most potentially interested parties under Section 402, by definition, live in the jurisdiction of another sovereign nation, not in the United States.

Plaintiffs do not allege that the Japanese notice-and-comment was inadequate to convey their views about the FRF and its potential impact on the dugong.

As explained above, IARII assembled a team of archeologists, a cultural anthropologist, and a biologist to consult 16 interviewees. The team did not directly speak with cultural practitioners. Instead, the research team formed a list of persons to be interviewed. A team anthropologist, Dr. Arne Rokkum, with three decades of fieldwork in the region, conducted archival research and \"knew individuals who were likely to have\n   information about the dugong in Okinawan culture.\" US 4170.

US 11072.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Plaintiffs fault Defendants for failing to consult cultural practitioners directly rather than indirectly through academics and other experts. It is true that two members of Defendants' team recognized the importance of local practitioners.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 3207 (Mr. Hideo Henzan's advice \"that if [DOD] really want[s] to learn about the role of Dugongs in Okinawa life then they should take to the local ward mayors and/or the elders living around Henoko Bay\"); US 4149 (Dr. Goodfellow's e-mail stating that \"the one place where we are really weak is that we did not have sufficient time to contact and get meetings arranged with cultural practitioners.

To do this would have required the Marines to have radically altered the time allowed for this project.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   However, on the facts of this case, Defendants' reliance on academic experts was not unreasonable under Section 402. The agency acknowledged it did not speak directly with cultural practitioners, but determined its analysis was nevertheless reliable because it obtained sufficient information on cultural significance from other sources. In the view of the Navy's cultural resource expert, the \"cultural experts [who were consulted] and cultural practitioners [who were not] both do have overlap with one another so if [the investigators] talked to one [group] that could get the gist of what the other does.\" US 4149. Furthermore, some of IARII's interviewees\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   spoken directly with cultural practitioners who passed on their views to the research team.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 4172-73 (\"A few of the informants had talked to cultural practitioners to whom the interview team could not get access and had information regarding rituals and other cultural practices that has never been published....

Plaintiffs have not identified any information that cultural practitioners would have provided that might have led Defendants to discover adverse effects that were not considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   In addition, the cultural practitioners do not appear to be analogous to any of the four analogous entities entitled to consulting party status as a matter of right under the Section 106 guidelines.

As Plaintiffs' counsel recognized\n   at the hearing, \"the traditional native Okinawan communities are quite secretive about some of their practices.\" Docket No. 230 at 27:9-10. Additionally, the researchers were required to obtain advanced permission from the Japanese embassy before speaking to any Japanese nationals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 4149. The limited access to the persons in question must be taken into consideration. Plaintiffs have not claimed that cultural practitioners attempted to consult with Defendants but were refused.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In light of these factors, Defendants' decision to rely on academic cultural experts was not unreasonable where, in Defendants' judgment, direct sources were inaccessible but the researchers could access the necessary information through other means.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Consult Local Okinawa Government\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Plaintiffs also claim that Defendants did not consult the local Okinawa government. This is not an accurate characterization of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   In fact, Defendants' researchers consulted the Okinawa Prefectural Board of Education and municipal Boards of Education in nearby towns,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   US 11072, which have responsibility over cultural properties and are equivalent to State Historic Preservation Offices in the U.S. (with which consultation is required under Section 106 of the NHPA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.2\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Furthermore, as discussed above, Defendants indirectly took into consideration the views of the Okinawa Prefectural Government as set forth in detailed, comprehensive comments submitted by then-governor Hirokazu Nakaima during the Japanese EIS amounting to approximately 60 pages of comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 1251, 1319, 8150. Defendants also considered comments from Okinawa's Department of Cultural Affairs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 1567. These entities could be considered an analog to local government representatives under the Section 106 framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20800.2\">\n    36 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   Plaintiffs' only evidence of a failure to consult the local government is an April 2018 letter from Takeshi Onaga, a newly elected Governor of Okinawa, claiming the Okinawa Prefectural Government was not consulted or notified and that it would have provided (unspecified) views contrary to those presented in the Japanese EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. at 12, n. 3. However, Mr. Onaga was elected\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   Defendants completed the TIA process, and his letter was sent four years\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the process was completed. The record demonstrates that the views of Okinawa's prior leadership were in fact considered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Importantly, throughout this entire process, Defendants have been in direct consultation with the Japanese national government. Defendants' direct consultation with the Japanese government is reasonable; \"the Okinawa dugong is Japan's cultural and historical property and therefore, Japan's judgment regarding how best to protect that property should be of great concern to [Defendants].\"\n   <em>\n    Dugong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Of course, it is rarely the case that a single government entity can purport to represent the full panoply of views held by a country's entire population. Although the Japanese national government's position regarding the FRF may be in tension with or different from the views held by the Okinawa Prefectural government or the population of Okinawa, Defendants did receive the views of local government actors and agencies. Given the political complexity of Japan's internal political divisions on the matter, NHPA's Section 402 should be read to afford deference to Defendants' judgment of how to conduct a Section 402 consultation in a manner sensitive to Japan's sovereignty,\n   diplomatic relations between Japan and the United States, and international norms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   In light of these considerations, it was not unreasonable for Defendants to engage in direct consultation only with the Japanese national government, and to consider the views of the local Okinawa province indirectly through the Japanese EIS public-and-comment and through the contacts made by Defendants' researchers with Okinawan cultural authorities and practitioners. Moreover, as above, Plaintiffs have not identified what information would have been obtained that might have led to the evaluation of additional potential adverse effects had Defendants engaged in direct (as opposed to indirect) consultation with local representatives.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Give Public Notice or Solicit Public Comment\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   Plaintiffs also criticize Defendants for failing to give public notice of their TIA process or to solicit public comment from the Japanese public. Section 402 does not create an express obligation for such notice-and-comment. Although Section 106 regulations require such a process in the context of domestic undertakings, no such input is mandated by the Section 402 guidelines. It was not unreasonable for Defendants to refrain from doing so under the circumstances of this case. As discussed above, the Japanese government performed its own robust public notice-and-comment process in connection with its EIS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 3032 (flow chart describing at what steps there were opportunities for public comment in Japanese EIS process, including public comment before and after the draft and final EIS); US 3062 (PowerPoint apparently summarizing local residents' opinions on draft EIS); US 3069 (chart apparently indicating over 700 public comments received); US 1218 (33-page English translation of the summary of public comments on EIS). That EIS is part of the record considered by Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Plaintiffs claim that this process was inadequate because the Japanese EIS did not assess the effects of the FRF on the dugong as a cultural resource.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 10. However, the Japanese EIS involves extensive discussion of the dugong and potential impacts of the FRF.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , US 5015 (beginning of section summarizing surveys of dugong sightings); US 5027 (noting that dugongs have been designated as \"national protected animals under the Act on Protection of Cultural Properties\"); US 5108 (noting that one effect considered is on seaweed beds \"which provide a feeding ground to dugongs\"). Furthermore, the public comment submitted in connection with the Japanese EIS did, in fact, include extensive discussion of the FRF's potential impact on the dugong.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 1238-41. Plaintiffs have not established what would have been gained had Defendants pursued their own, separate public notice-and-comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dugong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Duplicative, inconsistent efforts are not required.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Plaintiffs have thus failed to demonstrate that Defendants' reliance on the public notice-and-comment undertaken by Japan's government was unreasonable under Section 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   6.\n   <em>\n    Failure to Inquire About Adverse Impact\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   Plaintiffs also argue that Defendants' consultation with academics and cultural figures through the Welch report was inadequate because they consulted those figures only regarding the cultural significance of the dugong, without asking their views on \"the\n   <em>\n    effect\n   </em>\n   of the undertaking [i.e., FRF] on the property [i.e., dugong].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20307101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 307101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) (emphasis added). It is true that the informants contacted by the consultants were told only that they\n   would be interviewed \"concerning the role of the dugong in Okinawan culture\" to \"help the Marine Corps carry out its mission and future planning in Okinawa.\" US 3252. The outreach letter does not identify the FRF or state that the purpose was to understand \"the effect\" of the FRF on the Okinawa dugong.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=54%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20307101\">\n    54 U.S.C. \u00a7 307101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e). Arguably, that reflects a weakness in the TIA process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   However, standing alone, that weakness does not render Defendants' TIA process unreasonable under Section 402. The Section 402 TIA process does not necessarily require that\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   consultation address\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the cultural significance of the monument\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the expected effects. Indeed, certain interlocutors may have expertise on one aspect (cultural significance) but not the other (assessing the physiological or biological impact of the FRF). It was not necessarily unreasonable for the IARII consultants to speak with cultural experts about cultural significance, and then analyze separately the biological research to determine, scientifically, how the FRF would impact those cultural features. As Judge Patel noted, \"an agency has some discretion in deciding who will be consulted,\n   <em>\n    to what extent\n   </em>\n   , and at precisely what time.\"\n   <em>\n    Dugong II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3767145\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/543/1082/#p1101\">\n    543 F.Supp.2d at 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

The record demonstrates that Defendants' analysis of the effects was based on a consideration of the information collected through both processes. Further, Defendants engaged in a full consultation with the Japanese government itself and considered the views of local agencies. The Court cannot conclude that the failure to specifically ask local cultural experts about the impacts of the FRF rendered the TIA process unreasonable or non-compliant under Section 402 in these circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   7.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Plaintiffs have not shown that Defendants' scoping of the consultation was unreasonable and violative of Section 402.

Despite these criticisms, Defendants did not act unreasonably under these circumstances because they considered other sources of information about the intermittent and sporadic presence of Okinawa dugong in the affected FRF area. As explained below, that is sufficient under the arbitrary and capricious standard of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Internal Criticism\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Plaintiffs rely on certain examples of internal criticism but, as explained below, these remarks are taken out of context.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs identify a March 2010 e-mail by Dr. Thomas Jefferson who stated that \"[t]he quality of the EIA itself think [sic] it was extremely poorly-done and does not withstand scientific scrutiny in my opinion am happy to change the wording in the report to reflect this but as we discussed we need to do this in diplomatic fashion.\" US 4706. However, it is not clear to which specific aspect of the 1,600-page Japanese EIS Dr. Jefferson was referring. This stray comment provides little insight about the nature of Dr. Jefferson's criticism and whether it is material in particular to Plaintiffs' complaint about the population studies, or otherwise undermines Defendants' conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs claim that Defendants \"concede\" that \"the data are not sufficient to establish population size, status, and viability\" of the dugong and that \"it would be beneficial for [the Government of Japan] to conduct new systematic surveys or modeling\" to develop information about the Okinawa dugong population. US 10988, 10993. In fact, Defendants' complete findings state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   The USMC has reviewed all available studies regarding the distribution of the Okinawa dugong in waters around Okinawa. Observations include at least one mother-calf pair, which indicates that reproduction is still occurring in the population. Estimates made over the past thirteen years of the Okinawa dugong population range between 3 to 50 individuals. The available data are sufficient to conclude that a remnant population of dugongs exists around Okinawa. However, the data are not sufficient to establish population size, status, and viability. In the immediate vicinity of the FRF, seagrass beds are found to the north at Kayo and south of the FRF, in Henoko Bay. As noted in Section 2.4,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     dugongs have been sighted in the vicinity of the FRF or FRF footprint only sporadically since June 2009\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . During that time, steady and routine dugong activity has been documented off Kayo (north and east of the FRF),\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     with only sporadic dugong activity observed directly in Henoko and Oura Bays\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   (6/09, 4/12, 5/12, 6/1, 3/13, 5/13, and 11/13).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   US 10988 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   Thus, although Defendants acknowledged the lack of scientifically reliable estimates about the total size of the Okinawa dugong population, they had sufficient information about the relatively sporadic and intermittent presence of dugong in the FRF-affected areas and those immediately adjacent (Henoko and Oura Bays and Kayo). Further, with respect to their statement that \"it would be beneficial\" if Japan conducted further studies, Plaintiffs ignore the immediately subsequent statement that: \"Notwithstanding the absence of recent\n   <em>\n    total\n   </em>\n   population data,\n   <em>\n    we do have current\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    and valid population data for Henoko and Oura bays.\n   </em>\n   \" Findings at 17 (emphasis added).

In response, Dr. Sue Goodfellow, the supervisor of the project, stated that \"[t]he USMC sees no need for the more elaborate SOW that NAVFACPAC is now proposing,\" and noted that the lack of resolution was delaying execution of the survey contract and funds might be lost until the following budget cycle if not used soon. US 8094. In line with Richie's prediction, the SuMMO final report states that \"[i]t is not possible to say anything\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     definitive\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   about densities of dugongs,\" because the study did not involve an \"effective dugong monitoring program.\" AR 9269 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Although Richie stated a more thorough method was required to provide \"conclusive\" and \"definitive\" information about dugong density, that does not render Defendants' ultimate conclusions arbitrary and capricious. Indeed, as Richie made clear in the e-mail, the need for more rigorous methods was caused by the very low density of dugong in the FRF area itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 9269. In other words, the available data confirmed a very low density of dugong in the FRF area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , US 10979(citing data revealing intermittent observance in Oura Bay in several months between September 2010 and November 2013 and in the seagrass beds in the FRF-area between June 2009 and November 2013); US 10984(citing Japan's EIS surveys reporting sightings of dugong); US 5015-19 (citing surveys reporting sporadic sightings in Okinawa waters, analysis of feeding trails, and so on); USREF 1580, 2064 (external academic literature re: dugong sightings and feeding trails around Okinawa). Defendants' conclusion of low dugong presence in the FRF area was not unreasonable in light of the available data.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Env. Protection Info. Ctr. v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3271669\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/451/1005/#p1018\">\n    451 F.3d 1005\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1018 (9th Cir. 2006) (under National Forest Protection Act, which imposes certain substantive requirements, \"monitoring difficulties [of a species' presence in a particular area] do not render a habitat-based analysis [of the species' viability in that area] unreasonable, so long as the analysis uses all the scientific data currently available\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   That low density, in turn, was the basis for Defendants' conclusion that the FRF\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   was unlikely to have an adverse effect (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , because of the low probability of vessel impact). Indeed, this close connection between the low density in the FRF-area and Defendants' conclusion confirms why it was not unreasonable to refrain from a more detailed scientific study. Defendants recognized there was a lack of reliable global population studies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 9243 (\"There are many recent records of sightings, strandings, and captures (both direct and indirect), although by all accounts the species is now badly depleted and considered endangered in Okinawa.

But Section 402 did not require Defendants to determine the total global Okinawa dugong population; it only required them to take into account the impacts on the dugong in the FRF-area based on data sufficient to show their relative density in the affected area and resulting potential impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   This situation is very much unlike the case cited by Plaintiffs,\n   <em>\n    Bonnichsen v.

There, in a dispute under Section 106 of the NHPA, the defendant was required to consider the potential adverse effects of burying a site where culturally significant human remains were found. An Army Corps of Engineers scientist had noted that \"the erosion at the site was 'not as serious as that occurring at many other Corps of Engineers Reservoirs,' \" but advised \" 'cautio[n] about long term deleterious effects of engineering site protection measures.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7345461,9248510\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/367/864/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nevertheless, \"the project proceeded without significant study to determine the characteristics of the site, including what archaeological resources might exist, and there [was] little evidence that alternative methods of erosion[ ] control that might mitigate potential data loss were seriously considered.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1163-64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   In contrast, here, Richie did not warn about potential adverse effects that went unstudied, but rather, described what would be needed for a scientifically defensible population study of the dugong in light of their very low density. There is no reason to construe Richie's criticisms (premised on the difficulty of a low density population) to suggest that the local dugong population was even greater than believed and thus at greater risk of negative encounters with FRF construction or operational activities. Plaintiffs do not suggest that a more detailed study would have revealed that the dugongs in fact traversed the area more than \"intermittently\" or feed more than \"occasionally.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 10979.

Nevertheless, it is not accurate to state that Defendants simply limited their study to the impacts identified by Judge Patel. Rather, the Welch 2010 report identified six general threats to the dugong as a species: hunting, bycatch/incidental catch (including in gill nets), vessel traffic, acoustic disturbance, chemical pollution, and habitat loss/destruction. US 4180-83. It opined that threats from military activities could include pollution, habitat destruction/alteration, and vessel collisions. US 4183. The Jefferson report identified the same six general threats and noted that the primary threats were bycatch and habitat destruction/alteration. US 3369-70. Notably, these are the same threats identified by Plaintiffs' expert, Dr. Hines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Hines Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 30-34 (listing noise and acoustic pollution, destruction and degradation of seagrass beds, contaminant pollution, and increased vessel activity as potential threats to the dugong).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   Defendants properly focused on and discussed each of the threats identified by all the relevant experts, both their own and Plaintiffs'. The Japanese EIS, which Defendants relied upon, considered the impact of ship routes, including the possibility of incidental capture in gill nets if dugongs entered the Bay, effects on water quality, and effects on habitat by harm to seabeds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   US 6141-47. Defendants considered those issues as well. US 10988-93. It was not unreasonable for Defendants to examine and consider the threats specifically identified by three experts as the most significant to the dugong possibly exacerbated by the FRF.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   Although Plaintiffs suggest the study should have also considered population fragmentation, none of the experts (including Plaintiffs' own expert, Dr. Hines) identified that issue as a threat to the Okinawa dugong. Plaintiffs also claim Defendants did not consider the disruption of dugong travel routes, but Defendants considered whether ship routes and aircraft noise would alter dugong \"behavior.\" Finally, the Welch report explicitly notes that \"[r]egardless of whether [seabeds in Henoko and Oura Bay] are currently being used by dugongs, destruction of seagrass beds along Henoko Bay will limit areas that could provide habitat in the event of recovery and increase in the current dugong populations.\" US 4156. Thus, the issue of how the FRF might impede future recovery efforts (if not harm the current population) was before Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   In short, Plaintiffs have not shown a failure to consider an important aspect of the problem. The NHPA 402 does not identify particular issues that must be considered, and the agency's identification of the scope of issues-based on the threats\n   to the dugong identified in the Welch and Jefferson reports, which were consistent with the threats identified by Plaintiffs' expert Dr. Hines-was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Whether \"No Adverse Effect\" Is Supported By Record\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs challenge Defendants' conclusion of no adverse effect on the merits, arguing that the record shows the FRF\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   likely to adversely impact the dugong. They claim that Defendants' conclusion runs counter to the 2010 Welch Report. However, the Welch report identified\n   <em>\n    potential\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    possible\n   </em>\n   effects without any attempt to quantify the likelihood they would materialize. As explained above, the Japanese EIS, like Defendants' own findings, concluded that because of the very low presence of dugong in the FRF-area, the potential adverse effects identified in part by the Welch report were unlikely to materialize in practice. That conclusion, though debatable, was based on a reasonable interpretation of the data, and was not arbitrary and capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Protect Our Comtys. Found. v.

Defendants also relied on the Japanese EIS, which involved a public outreach process in which Plaintiffs and others had an opportunity to participate, and in which the Okinawa Prefectural Government submitted extensive comments. Defendants also considered Plaintiffs' views as presented in this litigation. Defendants engaged in direct consultation with the Japanese national government. While Defendants' outreach could and perhaps should have been broader to individuals,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs, the Court cannot say Defendants violated to procedural requirements of Section 402. On the facts of this case, defendants discharged their obligations to \"take into account\" potential adverse effects of the FRF on the Okinawa dugong under Section 402 of the NHPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   Furthermore, Defendants' conclusions of no adverse effect were not arbitrary or capricious. They had sufficient scientific information upon which to conclude there was a very low density of dugong in the Oura and Henoko Bays. They reasonably concluded it was unlikely that events related to the FRF would harm the dugong, particularly in light of the particular details of their construction and operational plans. Their conclusion of no adverse effect was not arbitrary and capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   The Court is aware of the high stakes at issue. The Court understands the concern of Plaintiffs and those of affected citizens about the potential harm to the endangered dugongs of Okinawa. But Section 402, while requiring the U.S. government to take account the effect of its undertaking in constructing the FRF, offers a limited scope of judicial review. Under that limited scope of review, the efforts taken by Defendants to comply with Section 402, including implementation of mitigating measures, fulfill the requirements of Section 402 and support a finding of no adverse effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   For these reasons stated above, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment.
