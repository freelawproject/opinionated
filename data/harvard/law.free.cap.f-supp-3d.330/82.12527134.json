INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiffs Bancroft Global Development, Michael Stock, and Melissa Bates Stock seek the return of documents seized during the execution of a search warrant in 2011, as well as money damages for the allegedly unlawful disclosure of their confidential tax return information. In particular, Plaintiffs allege that employees of several federal agencies told employees of other federal agencies that Plaintiffs were being audited, the likely result of the audit, and commented about Plaintiffs' behavior during the audit. Additionally, Plaintiffs allege that the government agencies that had originally seized their confidential tax\n   information gave a portion of those documents to another undisclosed government agency without the legal authority to do so. The Government has moved to dismiss each of Plaintiffs' unlawful disclosure claims on the grounds that they are either time-barred or insufficiently pleaded. For the reasons stated below, the Court dismisses Counts III and VII of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim and dismisses Mr. and Mrs. Stocks' claims in Count VI and a portion of Count IV for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In furtherance of that investigation, on November 9, 2011, the FBI and ICE executed three search warrants: two authorizing the seizure of property in Bancroft's D.C. offices and one authorizing the seizure of property in Mr. and Mrs. Stock's home in McLean, Virginia.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201924\">\n    \u00b6 26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In furtherance of that audit, the IRS issued formal Information Document Requests seeking records that would establish the accuracy of Bancroft's tax returns during those years. However, because the FBI and ICE had seized most of Bancroft's hard copy and electronic records, Bancroft was unable to comply with the IRS's requests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201924\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201924\">\n    \u00b6 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In an attempt to comply with the requests, Bancroft wrote to Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Malis about the status of the seized records, explaining that the government's retention of the documents prevented Bancroft from complying with the IRS's Information Document Requests.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The Government has moved to dismiss Counts III, IV, V, VI, and VII of Plaintiffs' Second Amended Complaint on several grounds. First, the Government argues that Plaintiffs have not shown that they filed suit within the applicable limitations period for Counts IV, V, VII. Defs.' Mot. at 6-10. This failure to demonstrate timeliness, the Government argues, deprives the Court of subject matter jurisdiction over these counts. Second, the Government argues that Plaintiffs have failed to state viable claims for violations of \u00a7 6103 in all of their unlawful disclosure counts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 10.

As explained below, the Court finds that Counts III and VII were insufficiently pleaded and therefore dismisses those claims.

The Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Government contends that several of Plaintiffs' unlawful disclosure claims were untimely filed, and that because \u00a7 7431's statute of limitations is jurisdictional, the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over the untimely claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 6-10. To support\n   their argument that \u00a7 7431's statute of limitations is jurisdictional, the Government points to\n   <em>\n    Aloe Vera of Am. v.

In the alternative, the Government argues that the allegedly untimely counts may be dismissed for failure to state a claim because Plaintiffs' \"pleadings show that they knew or had reason to know of the disclosures more than two years before filing suit.\" Defs.' Mot. at 7. Plaintiffs respond that, Ninth and Fifth Circuit opinions notwithstanding, \"a decade of Supreme Court and D.C. Circuit precedent ... mak[es] clear that a limitations period like the one contained in Section 7431(d) is a non-jurisdictional affirmative defense on which the Government bears the burden at all times.\" Pls.' Opp'n at 9. And regardless, Plaintiffs argue, their Second Amended Complaint makes clear that Plaintiffs discovered each alleged offense within the limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12. As explained below, the Court finds that \u00a7 7431's statute of limitations is not jurisdictional, but rather is an affirmative defense. Therefore, viewing the facts alleged in the Second Amended Complaint in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, the Court finds that it cannot at this point in the proceedings determine whether Counts IV, V, and VII are time-barred, and therefore denies the Government's motion to dismiss on this ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Nature of \u00a7 7431's Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 7431 provides, in a subsection called \"Period for bringing action,\" that \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law, an action to enforce any liability created under this section may be brought, without regard to the amount in controversy, at any time within 2 years after the date of discovery by the plaintiff of the unauthorized inspection or disclosure.\" 26 U.S.C. 7431(d). This limitations period applies both to suits against the United States when employees of the United States violate \u00a7 6103,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7431(a)(1), and suits against non-employees when they violate \u00a7 6103,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7431(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   When the United States is named as a defendant in a suit, a cause of action's statute of limitations generally falls into two major categories.

As such, statutes of limitations in suits between private parties are not ordinarily jurisdictional.

Accordingly, the Court concludes that \u00a7 7431's statute of limitations is a nonjurisdictional affirmative defense and that the Court must analyze Plaintiffs' pleadings as to timing under the Rule 12(b)(6) standard, as opposed to the Rule 12(b)(1) standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

For example, with regard to the IRS's disclosure of tax information to the Department of Justice (Count IV) and Government Agency's disclosure of tax information to its parent agency and at least nine federal employees (Count VII), Plaintiffs explicitly recount that they did not learn about the unauthorized disclosures until May 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

However, because the referenced copies of these tax and financial documents were obtained directly from Plaintiffs, and because these copies themselves did not pass through the IRS before landing in the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Offices' possession, they are not \"returns\" or \"return information\" under \u00a7 6103 and \u00a7 7431.

However, disclosure of the existence of an audit to the Department of Justice for the purpose of retrieving files does not indicate similar disclosures to another, entirely separate agency. And what is more, even if Plaintiffs had informed ICE that it was under audit in its attempt to regain possession of its property, that would not explain how Special Agent Dietrich also knew about the likely outcome of the IRS's audit. Therefore, the Court cannot dismiss Count VI on the ground that it is possible that ICE received some of Plaintiffs' confidential tax information from Plaintiffs themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Similarly, Plaintiffs' complaint does not indicate in any way that Plaintiffs may have disclosed to Government Agency the tax information that Government Agency allegedly disclosed to employees of Government Agency's parent agency and nine other unnamed federal employees.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   2d Am.

Plaintiffs recount that in January 2017, once Government Agency's parent agency, which Bancroft refers to as Organization, learned that Bancroft was a bidder for a \"sole-source contract,\" Organization declined to enter into a contract with Bancroft because \"Organization had been made aware of the IRS audit,\" and had been told \"that the IRS was going to shut down Bancroft[ ] and that Bancroft's reputation involved a troublesome history of audits.\" 2d Am.
