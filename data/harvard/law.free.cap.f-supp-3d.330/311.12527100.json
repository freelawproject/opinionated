COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   As the nation ponders current political controversies, this case evokes one from the past: the Reagan Administration's covert effort to undermine Nicaragua's Sandinista government in the 1980s.\n   <em>\n    Pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff Richard Grell is a U.S. Army veteran who was deployed to Central America in the 1980s and objects to how the government categorizes the missions in which he served. Grell insists that he engaged in combat operations in aid of an undeclared war in Nicaragua, while the military classifies his service as mere training and war games exercises. In a sprawling, 98-page complaint, Grell brings suit against five government defendants in their official capacities: President Donald Trump, Secretary of Defense James Mattis, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (collectively, \"defendants\"). Grell alleges unspecified constitutional violations on his own behalf and on behalf of other veterans who served in similar circumstances. Grell's complaint also vaguely sketches a claim under the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), seeking review of an Army Board for Correction of Military Records (\"ABCMR\") determination. He requests both monetary damages and equitable relief to remedy the loss of recognition and benefits that he claims to have suffered as a result of the government's misclassification of his service.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss all claims on either jurisdictional or merits grounds; alternatively, they urge the Court to strike Grell's Amended Complaint. After review of the parties' briefing, the Court concludes that Grell's constitutional claims are barred by the political question doctrine and therefore grants defendants' motion to dismiss them. But the Court will strike the remainder of the Amended Complaint, and permit Grell to re-file a more concise complaint that clarifies any APA claim he wishes to bring against a proper government defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Mr. Grell, a U.S. Army veteran, was stationed in Central America from approximately September 1983 to August 1985.
