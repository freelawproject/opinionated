The Assistant Secretary determined that the amendment violated IGRA in two ways. First, the Assistant Secretary determined that the amendment violated IGRA by making one tribe liable for another's revenue losses. Second, the Assistant Secretary determined that the amendment violated IGRA by requiring mitigation payments for Class II gaming and ancillary businesses.

Plaintiff and Federal Defendants argue that the provision is unambiguous. Plaintiff cites a Ninth Circuit case concluding that IGRA's catchall provision is unambiguous.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Indian Gaming Related Cases\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7351442,9114551\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/331/1094/\">\n    331 F.3d 1094\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1111 (9th Cir. 2003). This out-of-circuit opinion is not binding on the Court.

Without explanation, the Court is not persuaded by this out-of-circuit opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Instead, the Court agrees with Defendant Intervenors and finds the catchall provision to be ambiguous. Based on the text of IGRA, it is unclear how attenuated the relationship between the subject of the compact and the operation of gaming activities may be while remaining direct. Additionally, it appears that the Assistant Secretary treated the catchall provision as though it was ambiguous. In reaching his decision, the Assistant Secretary construed the provision in light of the purposes of IGRA, used legislative history, and conducted a case-by-case approach.

But Plaintiff argues that the Court should not proceed to this next step. According to Plaintiff, even if the statute is ambiguous,\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference does not apply for two reasons. First, Plaintiff contends that when a statute involving Indian Law is ambiguous, we must construe the statute liberally in favor of Indians, with ambiguous provisions interpreted to their benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cobell v. Norton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11140530,3677773\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/240/1081/\">\n    240 F.3d 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1101 (D.C. Cir. 2001). According to Plaintiff, the Indian law canon would require that we interpret the catchall provision broadly to allow more subjects for compacting. Second, Plaintiff argues that the Assistant Secretary's interpretation\n   is not entitled to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference because it does not have precedential effect and is not binding on third parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fogo De Chao (Holdings) Inc. v.

Cir. 2014). The Court is not persuaded by either of Plaintiff's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   First, the Court concludes that the Indian law canon does not apply under these circumstances. The Indian law canon does not apply simply because the statute in question involves Indian law or Indian tribes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Stand Up for California! v.

Instead, the Indian law canon developed from the general trust relationship between the United States government and Indian tribes and ensures that statutes passed for the benefit of Indian tribes are interpreted to their benefit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bryan v. Itasca County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177519\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/373/#p392\">\n    426 U.S. 373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 392,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177519\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/373/#p392\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6177519\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/426/373/#p392\">\n    48 L.Ed.2d 710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Here, the general trust relationship between the United States government and Indian tribes is not implicated. Applying the Indian law canon would not benefit an Indian tribe vis-\u00e0-vis the federal government. Instead, as will be discussed further below, applying the Indian law canon as Plaintiff suggests would benefit Plaintiff at the expense of another tribe, Menominee.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   III.B.1. The Court declines to apply the Indian law canon where the interests of all tribes are not aligned.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde Cmty. of Oregon v.

IGRA limits the subjects that are permissible in tribal-state gaming compacts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C)(i-vii). In drafting IGRA, Congress balanced the states' interests in the regulation and conduct of Class III gaming against Indian tribes' interest in autonomy. A broad reading of the catchall provision would increase the scope of subjects that states can negotiate in a compact. Increasing the scope of subjects for compacting would allow states to increase their jurisdiction over Indian tribes, which is not in the best interest of tribes generally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GasPlus, L.L.C. v.

Plaintiff cites\n   <em>\n    Fogo De Chao\n   </em>\n   as support for the proposition that\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference should not apply to the Assistant Secretary's construction.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4265552,4285148\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/769/1127/\">\n    769 F.3d at 1136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, he found that the amendment \"shift[ed] the burden of loss revenues from existing gaming operations to another tribe without the consent of the other tribe.\" FCPCAR001464. Second, he found that the amendment included mitigation payments for revenue from Class II gaming and other ancillary activities. Granting the Assistant Secretary's interpretation of the catchall provision\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference, his determination that the 2014 compact amendment is not directly related to the operation of gaming activities is not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Imposing Risk of Loss on Another Tribe\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It was not arbitrary or capricious for the Assistant Secretary to conclude that the 2014 compact amendment was contrary to IGRA because the compact called for \"Mitigation Payments that guarantee[d] [Plaintiff's] profits by another tribe.\" FCPCAR001465.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court grants\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference to the Assistant Secretary's determination that the IGRA's catchall provision does not encompass a compact under which one tribe guarantees another's gaming revenue. This interpretation is reasonable and consistent with IGRA's purposes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chemical Mfrs. Ass'n v.

The catchall provision requires that the subject of compacts be \"directly related\" to the \"operation of gaming.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(3)(C)(vii).

So, it does not fall within the plain language of the catchall provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Moreover, such an amendment conflicts with the purposes of IGRA. Congress passed IGRA to ensure that the operation of gaming by Indian tribes would lead to economic development, self-sufficiency, and strong tribal governments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Michigan v.

Interpreting the catchall provision to allow states to create significant barriers to entry for tribes attempting to open new gaming facilities would not further IGRA's goal of promoting tribal economic development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCPCAR001460 (explaining that the amendment would \"impose a substantial financial burden on the Menominee community, which has among the highest unemployment rates, the highest poverty, and the lowest health indicators of any community in Wisconsin.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a compact which forces one tribe's risk of\n   lost revenue on another tribe without its consent is not in line with the purposes of IGRA, it was reasonable for the Assistant Secretary to interpret the catchall provision narrowly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rincon Band of Luiseno Mission Indians of Rincon Reservation v.

Furthermore, the Assistant Secretary's determination that the 2014 compact amendment was such a compact is not arbitrary or capricious. The Assistant Secretary considered the text of the amendment and supporting documents to conclude that, under the amendment, Menominee is responsible for making mitigation payments intended to insulate Plaintiff's revenues from increased competition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Plaintiff argues that the Assistant Secretary's disapproval was arbitrary and capricious because the plain text of the amendment states that the \"State is responsible for ensuring that the Mitigation Payments are paid in a timely manner and in full.\" FCPCAR000032. Despite this language, the Assistant Secretary found that \"in fact ... Menominee would be responsible for making all of the Mitigation Payments.\" FCPCAR001464. There is evidence in the administrative record that permitted the Assistant Secretary to conclude that Menominee would make the mitigation payments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fuller v.

The amendment \"anticipate[s] that the State will enter into agreements under which the Applicant will agree to pay the Mitigation payments.\" FCPCAR000032. The only named Applicant is Menominee. FCPCAR000029. The amendment also sets forth a \"State Alternative Mitigation Payment Mechanism\" under which Plaintiff \"shall negotiate in good faith to reach an agreement on reasonable terms proposed by the State which would obligate the Applicant or other third party to make some or all of the Mitigation Payments.\" FCPCAR000032. The amendment contemplates that these alternative mechanisms could include payments made from the \"Lock Box established in the Menominee Compact.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546210,3497245\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/1095/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And again, Menominee is the only named Applicant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The supporting documents in the administrative record also buttress the Assistant Secretary's determination that the amendment would result in Menominee making the mitigation payments. The Assistant Secretary reviewed statements by Governor of Wisconsin Scott Walker explaining that the State would only \"compensate the [Plaintiff] for losses that are not covered by the Menominee.\" FCPCAR001411. This statement indicates that the Governor believed Menominee would make at least some of the mitigation payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Similarly, the Assistant Secretary considered a letter from members of Congress supporting the amendment. According to the letter, the State and Plaintiff \"anticipate entering into agreements under which the Menominee will agree to make annual payments to [Plaintiff] to mitigate lost revenue.\" FCPCAR001642. The members explained it was their \"hope that, pursuant to this Amendment, any required Mitigation Payments will in fact be fully covered by the Menominee and that Wisconsin taxpayers will not be required to cover any of these costs.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3546210,3497245\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/588/1095/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Again, this letter supports the Assistant Secretary's determination that Menominee would in fact cover any mitigation payments required of the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Assistant Secretary also credited submissions by Menominee contending that the tribe would be required to make mitigation payments to Plaintiff in order to get approval from the Governor to open a new gaming facility. The submission by Menominee notes that the amendment \"assumes that the Menominee Tribe will pay for any [of Plaintiff's gaming] facility revenue losses allegedly caused by [Menominee's proposed] gaming facility.\" FCPCAR000389. And letters from representatives of Menominee to the Assistant Secretary contend that the amendment is designed to make it difficult for the Governor to approve Menominee's proposed gaming facility by tying his approval to Menominee's agreeing to make the mitigation payments. FCPCAR001160. Menominee's submissions further support the Assistant Secretary's finding that approval of the 2014 compact amendment would result in Menominee making the mitigation payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Finally, the Assistant Secretary's determination is supported by the context in which the amendment was submitted. Since at least 2000, Menominee had been attempting to develop a casino on land approximately 33 miles from Plaintiff's casino. FCPCAR000685 and FCPCAR001462.

Finally, in 2013, the Assistant Secretary approved Menominee's application to take the land into trust for gaming purposes. FCPCAR000014. Soon thereafter, Plaintiff and the state began the arbitration process that resulting in the 2014 compact amendment.

Plaintiff argues that the Assistant Secretary's narrow interpretation is not consistent with the goals of IGRA because the inclusion of Class II gaming in the 2014 compact amendment only benefitted Plaintiff by increasing the amount of revenue that Plaintiff would be compensated for.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   This argument fails for two reasons. First, Plaintiff conflates what is in its own interest with what is in the interest of tribes generally. It would not be in the interest of Menominee, or other Applicant tribes, to be expected to compensate Plaintiff for losses from non-Class III gaming activities. Second, making Class II gaming and ancillary businesses a permissible subject for compacting would allow states in future compacts to assert influence and regulatory control over non-Class III gaming activities. It is not in the interest of Indian tribes generally to increase the scope of the subjects over which states can regulate Indian tribes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    GasPlus, L.L.C. v.

Therefore, tribal-state compacts which do not directly relate to the operation of Class III gaming are not permissible compacts. Furthermore, the Assistant Secretary's determination that the 2014 compact amendment did not directly relate to Class III gaming was not arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   If the Governor approved a gaming facility between 30 and 50 miles from Plaintiff's casino, the Amendment required mitigation payments based on the \"Milwaukee Net Revenues.\" FCPCAR000030.

The small town of Flandreau is different from the urban city of Milwaukee. And Plaintiff has not shown that the ancillary activities included in the amendment would not exist without Plaintiff's casino. Moreover,\n   <em>\n    Flandreau\n   </em>\n   was a suit to enjoin state taxation of ancillary activities. The case did not concern whether mitigation payments for Class II gaming and ancillary businesses are a permissible subject for compacting. Finally, as the case involved state taxation, the Department of the Interior was not a party and is in no way bound by the court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Flandreau\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Moreover, the Assistant Secretary's disapproval is not necessarily contrary to\n   <em>\n    Flandreau\n   </em>\n   . The Assistant Secretary did not conclude that Class II gaming and ancillary activities could never be a permissible subject for compacting under the catchall provision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCPCAR001465 n.32 (explaining that even if ancillary businesses are located near gaming facilitates \"[i]t does not necessarily follow\" that the ancillary businesses are directly related to gaming activity). Instead, he more narrowly determined that the 2014 compact amendment regulated activity not directly related to Class III gaming. The Assistant Secretary noted that Plaintiff's \"new, $97 million, 360 room hotel, restaurant and conference complex are located beyond the exterior boundaries of [Plaintiffs'] trust lands at the Milwaukee casino.\" Given the Plaintiff's particular situation, mitigation payments for Class II gaming and ancillary businesses were not directly related to the operation of Class III gaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   As the Court previously established, the Assistant Secretary's interpretation of the catchall provision as requiring that compacts be directly related to the operation of Class III gaming is entitled to deference. And, the plain language of the amendment supports the Assistant Secretary's determination that the amendment would require mitigation payments for revenue lost from Class II gaming and other ancillary businesses not directly related to Class III gaming. Based on the evidence before the Assistant Secretary in the administrative record, the Assistant Secretary's disapproval on this ground was not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States Sugar Corporation v.

Benefit of the Bargain\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, in addition to being arbitrary and capricious, the Assistant Secretary's disapproval deprived Plaintiff of the benefit of its bargain with the state. As agreed in the 2003 and 2005 compact amendments, Plaintiff has paid the state $234.3 million in lump-sum payments and increased revenue-sharing payments. And Plaintiff continues to make these increased revenue-sharing payments each year. Pls.' Mot., 43, ECF Nos. 79-1. In exchange for these payments, the 2005 amendment provided that, if the state ended the tribe's exclusivity, Plaintiff would be compensated in the manner agreed upon in the last-best-offer arbitration process. Plaintiff argues that the disapproval of the 2014 amendment invalidated the primary economic benefit that Plaintiff had negotiated, exclusivity. This argument fails for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   First, Plaintiff has received benefits from its payments by being permitted to conduct gaming activities which are forbidden\n   to non-Indians. Even after the \"no fly zone\" provision was withdrawn from the 2003 amendment Plaintiff \"reassured [the Department of the Interior] that it will receive the benefit of its bargain.\" FCPCAR000325. Without a \"no fly zone\" provision preventing competition from other Indian tribes, this benefit was, at least partly, based on exclusivity vis-\u00e0-vis non-Indian gaming. Moreover, if the lump-sum payments and the increased revenue-sharing payments were made solely in return for tribal gaming exclusivity, it is unclear why Plaintiff did not negotiate with the state for a reduction or a return of those payments in the event that the Assistant Secretary disapproved the result of the arbitration process, as he had disapproved Plaintiff's previous exclusivity provision. FCPCAR000008.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Second, even if we assume that the Assistant Secretary's disapproval would deny Plaintiff the benefit of its bargain, that fact is not relevant to the Assistant Secretary's analysis or to the Court's analysis. In considering whether to approve a compact, the Assistant Secretary considers only whether the compact violates IGRA, another federal law, or the United States' trust obligations to Indians.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(8)(B). And in reviewing the Assistant Secretary's approval or disapproval, the Court considers whether the Assistant Secretary's decision was arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

If the Assistant Secretary reasonably determines that a compact is contrary to IGRA, whether a party receives the benefit of its bargain with the state is simply not part of the analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Distinguishing other Compact Decisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In addition to questioning the reasoning behind the Assistant Secretary's disapproval, Plaintiff also criticizes the Assistant Secretary for failing to adequately distinguish past decisions either approving or deeming approved other compacts. Plaintiff argues that the Assistant Secretary's disapproval of the 2014 compact amendment was arbitrary and capricious because the Assistant Secretary provided no reasons for disapproving this amendment when other, similar compacts had been approved or deemed approved in the past.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   When an agency declines to follow past decisions, the agency must explain the change in policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

Here, the Court finds that the Assistant Secretary provided an adequate explanation distinguishing the disapproval of the 2014 compact amendment from the approval or deemed approval of other compacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The Assistant Secretary addressed compacts which were cited by Plaintiff and made reasonable factual distinctions between those compacts and the 2014 compact amendment. The Assistant Secretary made an overarching distinction between Plaintiff's amendment and all other approved or deemed approved compacts, explaining that \"none of the examples involve a revenue guarantee for a tribe that is operating gaming on so-called 'off-reservation' lands acquired by the Secretary in trust under a two part determination\" and \"none of the compact provisions define revenue\n   to include Class II gaming, food and beverage, hotel, and entertainment activities, which fall outside the permissible subjects of negotiation under the IGRA.\" FCPCAR001466. The Assistant Secretary also specifically distinguished some of the other approved or deemed approved compacts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Plaintiff argues that five Wisconsin compacts which were previously approved or deemed approved by the Assistant Secretary are materially indistinguishable from the 2014 compact amendment. But, considering the five Wisconsin compacts, the Assistant Secretary explained that \"compact amendments between other tribes and the State of Wisconsin do not specifically call for anything approaching the Mitigation Payments that guarantee the Tribe's profits by another tribe. Nor do these other compact amendments include Class II gaming and other revenues.\" FCPCAR001465.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   The Assistant Secretary's explanation distinguishing the 2014 compact amendment from other approved or deemed approved Wisconsin compacts was reasonable. Only one of the five Wisconsin compacts, the Lac Du Flambeau compact, was affirmatively approved. The Lac Du Flambeau compact is distinguishable from the 2014 compact amendment because, in the case of tribal gaming competition, it required the state to either indemnify the tribe for reductions in Class III gaming revenues or to arbitrate the event. BIA_003171. Importantly, the compact did not explicitly anticipate that the state would unload its payment obligation onto another tribe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   The remaining four Wisconsin compacts were only deemed approved to the extent that they are consistent was IGRA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202710\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 2710\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(8). The Ho-Chunk Nation compact initially contained a provision which required the applicant tribe to indemnify Ho-Chunk Nation if the state approved a new casino which would result in a substantial reduction in Class III gaming revenue. BIA_003426-27. But this provision was removed while the compact was under consideration and replaced with a provision which instead required the state to indemnify the tribe through reductions in revenue-sharing payments if a newly approved gaming facility resulted in a substantial reduction of Class III gaming revenue. BIA_003429-31. Similarly, the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribe compact provided only that revenue-sharing payments would be reduced if the state approves another tribe's application for a Class III gaming facility that results in a reduction of the tribe's annual net win from Class III gaming operations. BIA_003625. And the last two deemed approved Wisconsin compacts, the Oneida Nation and St. Croix Chippewa compacts, provided that if the state enters a compact protecting any tribe from competition, the state will negotiate similar compact amendments with the Oneida and the St. Croix Chippewa tribes. The remedy would be reductions in or return of revenue-sharing payments by the state. BIA_003569 (Oneida compact) and BIA_3596-97 (St. Croix Chippewa compact). Any amendments resulting from these negotiations would still need to be submitted for review for compliance with IGRA. FCPCAR001465. Accordingly, the Wisconsin compacts are distinguishable from the 2014 compact amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on the Michigan compacts to support its argument that the Assistant Secretary has previously allowed compacts which include inter-tribal revenue-sharing provisions. The Michigan compacts contain provisions stating that no tribe will submit an application for a new off-reservation gaming facility unless it has first entered into a revenue-sharing agreement with other tribes in the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   BIA_003265; BIA_003394. But, as the Assistant Secretary stated, the Michigan compacts are distinguishable because they \"were based on a model agreement and all of the signatories consented to its provision.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   FCPCAR001466. The letter approving the Michigan compacts emphasizes the importance of this difference, explaining that while tribal co-ownership of a gaming facility with sharing of revenue is permitted, \"it is not clear one tribe can own such an establishment and distribute revenue to the other tribes.\" BIA_003251.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Plaintiff also relies on the deemed-approved Seneca Nation compact. In deeming this compact approved, the then-Assistant Secretary found that the compact's exclusivity provision was consistent with IGRA because the tribe received geographic exclusivity in exchange for revenue-sharing payments. BIA_003182-84. Plaintiff argues that this compact demonstrates that exclusivity provisions are permissible subjects for gaming compacts. But, in disapproving the 2014 compact amendment, the Assistant Secretary never claimed that exclusivity provisions are contrary to IGRA. FCPCAR001465-66. And he did not disapprove the 2014 compact amendment because it contained an exclusivity provision. Instead, he disapproved the amendment because it, unlike the Seneca Nation compact, \"ma[de] another tribe the guarantor of [Plaintiffs'] profits.\" FCPCAR001466. The importance of this distinguishing factor is underscored by the then-Assistant Secretary's decision on the Seneca Nation compact explaining that \"I still find a provision excluding other Indian gaming anathema to basic notions of fairness in competition and, if pushed to its extreme by future compacts, inconsistent with the goals of IGRA.\" BIA-003183. Here, it was reasonable for the Assistant Secretary to find that the 2014 compact amendment pushed its exclusivity provision to the extreme.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The Assistant Secretary distinguished two other compacts relied on by Plaintiff. First, the Little Traverse Band of Odawa Indians compact relieved the tribe of its revenue-sharing payments in the case of competition rather than requiring mitigation payments from another tribe. FCPCAR001585-86. And the North Fork compact provided for a diversion of 2 percent of North Fork's revenue-sharing payments to another tribe. But this provision is not a profit guarantee and North Fork, the tribe required to make the payments, was a party to the agreement. FCPCAR001466. The 2014 compact amendment requires Menominee, a tribe which was not a party to the agreement, to guarantee Plaintiff's profits from Class III gaming, Class II gaming, and ancillary businesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff also cites the Oklahoma tribe compacts which contain an exclusivity provision requiring the state to pay liquidated\n   damages based on gross revenue to the tribe if the state authorizes a nontribal entity to operate additional gaming machines within 45 miles of a tribe's casino. Pls.' Reply and Opp'n, 25, ECF No. 86. But these compacts were not before the Assistant Secretary and are not part of the administrative record, so they cannot be considered.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hill Dermaceuticals, Inc. v.

Cir. 2013) (explaining that a reviewing court should not have more information before it than the agency did when making its decision). Moreover, even if the Court were to consider the Oklahoma compacts, they are readily distinguishable as they involve the protection of tribal gaming against non-tribal competition, so they do not implicate IGRA in the same way that a provision on inter-tribal competition does.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Finally, in arguing that the 2014 compact amendment was not beyond the pale of other compacts approved or deemed approved by the Assistant Secretary, Plaintiff points to comments from the Office of Indian Gaming Management proposing that the 2003 compact amendment contain a provision under which the Governor agrees not to concur in the development of an off-reservation casino within 50-miles of Plaintiff's existing casino unless the other tribe entered into a binding indemnification agreement with Plaintiff. But Plaintiff's reliance on this language is misplaced for two reasons. First, this language was \"for discussion purposes only\" and was \"not cleared by the Acting Assistant Secretary.\" FCPCAR000157. Second, after these comments were made, Plaintiff and the state agreed to remove the exclusivity provision in the pending 2003 amendment at the insistence of the Assistant Secretary so that the remaining amendment would be approved. FCPCAR000291.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Considering the arguments of all parties, the Court finds that the Assistant Secretary reasonably distinguished his disapproval of the 2014 compact amendment from decisions on other compacts. Because he sufficiently distinguished his disapproval from past decisions, the Assistant Secretary's disapproval was not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    West Coast Media, Inc. v. FCC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1492092,5869309\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/695/617/\">\n    695 F.2d 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621 (D.C.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Based on the above analysis, the Federal Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors are entitled to summary judgment on all claims. Plaintiff is not entitled to its first claim for relief under the APA because the Assistant Secretary's disapproval of the 2014 compact amendment was not arbitrary or capricious.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(a). Similarly, Plaintiff is not entitled to its third claim for relief under the Declaratory Judgment Act because the Assistant Secretary's disapproval was proper under the APA.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 02. Finally, Plaintiff is not entitled to its second claim for relief because the 2005 amendment did not create a \"ministerial duty\" to approve the 2014 amendment, for one compact cannot bind the Secretary to approve a later amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20293.4\">\n    25 C.F.R. \u00a7 293.4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"all compacts and amendments ... must be submitted for review and approval by the Secretary under IGRA\"). And Plaintiff does not contest Federal Defendants' or Defendant-Intervenors' motion for summary judgment on its second claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court DENIES Plaintiff's [79] Motion for Summary Judgment, GRANTS Federal Defendants' [81] Cross-Motion for Summary Judgement, and GRANTS Defendant-Intervenors'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   [82] Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.
