Petitioner's emphasis on the Pakistani proceedings-which have no bearing on the outcome in this case-is misplaced, particularly considering the evidence and testimony presented during Petitioner's trial was not presented during the Pakistani proceedings.

Here, trial counsel's declaration reveals the defense team not only called several Pakistani witnesses at trial, but was aware of and considered calling additional alibi witnesses. Sosinsky Decl. at 4-6. Additionally, an April 3, 2013 defense letter regarding bail identified four alibi witnesses who provided the defense team with affidavits. ECF No. 126-16 at 8-9. Significantly, as Petitioner acknowledges, three of the witnesses identified in the Report Zimni were known to the defense team prior to trial. Rule 33 Mot. at 13 n.8.

However, as described\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the defense team called three witnesses who contradicted the version of the events as described by Seemab and Rukhsana, whose testimony Petitioner argues \"provided the prosecution's case with the essential links between Mr. Choudhry in Brooklyn and the events in Pakistan.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The testimony of these purported alibi witnesses, even assuming they are able to testify, would be cumulative because the proffered testimony is \"simply additional evidence to that which was presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    White\n   </em>\n   , 972 F.2d at 21.

Petitioner contends the information contained in this document-that Ashfaq had initially been denied bail pending trial-would have undermined \"the subtext of the government's claim that Mr. Choudhry's family was sufficiently powerful politically in Pakistan that any witnesses exculpating him or the others alleged to have been involved could not be trusted, and that his family controlled the investigation by authorities in Pakistan.\" Rule 33 Mot. at 7;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply Memo at 25.

Judge Kharian's Summary from Mazhar Iqbal's Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner points to two portions of a document that he claims was prepared by a Pakistani judge-Additional Sessions Judge Kharian-in connection with the trial of Mazhar Iqbal, Ashfaq's co-defendant. Rule 33 Mot. at 7-8 (citing Ex. 3 to Dratel Rule 33 Decl. at 3, 10, ECF No. 123-3). With respect to the summary of the testimony of Asif Akhter Naqash, the draftsman who created the sketch of the scene of the killings, Petitioner fails to show how this document, or testimony from the draftsman about the location of drains, contradicts Seemab's testimony regarding the location of Madeeha's body after the killings. Seemab testified that \"[t]here was a drain close to the wall[, and Madeeha's] body was on the drain.\" Tr. at 158. Judge Kharian's summary of the draftsman's testimony-which states it is \"incorrect that there is a drain in the middle of the street.... [T]here are two drains available on both side[s] of the street,\" Dratel Rule 33 Decl. Ex. 3 at 3 (ECF pagination)-does not contradict Seemab's testimony. Indeed, Seemab's testimony is consistent with Judge Kharian's summary, and Government's Trial Exhibit 806, which Seemab testified depicted her father's body in the street after the killings and which she used to indicate the location of her sister Madeeha's body in relation to her father's body,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 166, also shows a drain on both sides of the street,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. D to Gov't Opp., ECF No. 136-4. In short, proffered testimony that is consistent with the testimony presented during trial is neither material nor likely to result in an acquittal, and does not warrant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Petitioner's arguments regarding Judge Kharian's statement that Asghar \"had his enmity with different people,\" and \"[i]t is correct that Mohammad Afzal etc. have their political rivalry and enmity with influential persons,\" Dratel Rule 33 Decl. Ex. 3 at 10 (ECF pagination), also miss the mark. While the summary prepared by Judge Kharian itself may not have been available until after Petitioner's trial, Petitioner fails to show that evidence of Asghar's hostilities and Afzal's political rivalries could not have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence prior to or during trial. In fact, Rukhsana was asked on cross-examination about a land dispute involving her husband and family, including whether she was aware of a police complaint, court order, and threats made to her concerning the land dispute. Tr. at 833-34;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 3 (\"[T]he undersigned at trial questioned Rukhsana Kousar concerning this very issue [of the land dispute involving Asghar to show the possibility of an alternative perpetrator] and she disclaimed any knowledge of the dispute.\"). Moreover, in a recorded telephone call between Amina and Petitioner on February 25, 2013-the day of the killings-Petitioner stated, \"[t]here are hundreds of people involved.... They blame us, it could be someone else.\" Gov't Ex. C at 45;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 3 (\"On this issue of others with potential motives to do Asghar harm ... were statements made by Mr. Choudhry in the final recorded conversation he had with his daughter in which he told her a number of times that there were many others who would have wanted to do harm to Asghar, to whom he owed sums of money and who were falsely blaming her family for the murders.\"). Thus, neither evidence of Asghar's hostilities nor Petitioner's family's political rivalries constitutes newly discovered evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Even if this evidence could be considered newly discovered, it still does not warrant a new trial. As just described, the\n   possibility of an alternative perpetrator with a motive to harm Asghar was adequately explored during trial, and any additional evidence on this topic would be merely cumulative of evidence presented during trial. Furthermore, evidence of Petitioner's family's political rivalries is not material and not likely to result in an acquittal in light of the overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's guilt. Accordingly, this evidence does not warrant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Amina's Declaration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   As an initial matter, Petitioner argues the information Amina provides in her declaration was unavailable during trial, and therefore constitutes newly discovered evidence, because \"Amina was a government witness to whom the defense, despite requests, did not have any access.\" Rule 33 Mot. at 13 (citation omitted). According to Petitioner, it was only from Amina's review of the trial transcripts that the information contained in her affidavit became available to Petitioner.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14. However, Petitioner has failed to offer any explanation as to why the information Amina provides in her declaration was not available during trial, either through cross-examination of Amina or through other sources. As described more fully\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , much of this information was presented to the jury during trial, further undermining any argument that it constitutes newly discovered evidence. Petitioner's trial counsel was free to ask Amina about any of the topics raised in her declaration, which contains various assertions regarding Seemab's mode of transportation to and from school, the length of time it takes to walk from Seemab's bus stop to her home, whether Asghar owed money to any creditors who may have had a motive to harm him, and a rumor regarding a relative who had allegedly been killed for abandoning an arranged marriage, among other items. Amina Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To the extent Petitioner argues the newly discovered evidence is Amina's assertion that Seemab and Rukhsana did not testify truthfully, her observations constitute impeachment evidence that is not material and does not warrant a new trial. \"Evidence of impeachment is material if the witness whose testimony is attacked supplied the only evidence linking the defendant(s) to the crime, or where the likely impact on the witness's credibility would have undermined a critical element of the prosecution's case.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Addressing Petitioner's contention that he should have called certain additional witnesses, Petitioner's trial counsel explained the defense had called \"three witnesses, none of them related to or having friendships with defendant's family, who collectively, if believed, established that Rukhsana's and Seemab's sworn claims to the jury about having been eyewitnesses to the slayings of Muhammad and Madeeha Asghar were false.\" Sosinsky Decl. at 4;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5 (\"[T]he defense also introduced a translated police report\n   from the date of the murders which placed both Rukhsana and Seemab at a different location from that at which they claimed to have observed the shootings.

Furthermore, Seemab and Asghar did not provide the only evidence of Petitioner's guilt. As described in detail, the Government presented additional, overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's guilt. Accordingly, Amina's assertions regarding alleged false testimony are immaterial and do not warrant a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The information itself in Amina's declaration is cumulative of other evidence presented during trial and is immaterial. With regard to Amina's statements concerning Seemab's transportation to and from school, as noted previously, Petitioner called Manzoor Ahmed as a witness, who testified that in 2012 and 2013, including on February 25, 2013, he drove a private van which he used to transport Seemab, among other students, to and from school. Tr. at 1265-75. Amina's observation that Seemab \"would not take public transportation\" and Seemab \"always took the bus driven by Manzoor Ahmed to and from school,\" Amina Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-3, is thus cumulative of evidence presented to the jury during trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, Amina's assertion that she does, in fact, know Manzoor, and that \"[t]here are many people named Manzoor in Pakistan,\" Amina Decl. \u00b6 4, is immaterial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Similarly, Amina's assertion that Seemab's version of the timeline of events on the day of the murders could not be true, Amina Decl. \u00b6 5, was thoroughly explored during trial. Seemab testified it takes \"around half an hour\" to walk from the location of the bus stop to home, she arrived at the bus stop on February 25, 2013 at approximately 1:35 P.M., and the murders occurred at approximately 2:30 P.M. Tr. at 193, 198-200, 204. Petitioner's trial counsel cross-examined Seemab regarding her recollection of the timeline of events.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190564\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/112/#p122\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11190564\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/217/112/#p122\">\n    at 193-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, as this Court noted during the cross-examination, \"[i]t's clear what the testimony is and what the testimony was. [Seemab] said it was approximately 1:30.

As a preliminary matter, to the extent Petitioner seeks to use Amina's statement regarding what she heard Rukhsana allegedly say to show the possibility of an alternative perpetrator-which Petitioner acknowledges, Reply Memo at 26-it is hearsay, and therefore inadmissible and immaterial. On that basis alone, it does not warrant a new trial. Even if this statement were admissible, and even if Asghar did owe money to creditors, this evidence is immaterial in light of the overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's guilt. The fact that Asghar may\n   have owed money to creditors is simply not a basis to grant a new trial, particularly given that the theory of an alternative perpetrator was already before the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Indeed, trial counsel thoroughly cross-examined Rukhsana regarding an alleged land dispute and threats related to that dispute. Tr. at 833-34; Sosinsky Decl. at 3. Trial counsel showed Rukhsana a document concerning the topic of \"the dispute over land and threats and guns that are contained within the document\" in an attempt to refresh her recollection, which it did not. Tr. at 837, 840;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 3 (\"The fact is that the undersigned at trial questioned Rukhsana Kousar concerning this very issue and she disclaimed any knowledge of the dispute, even, as I recall, after being shown a copy of the very documents in question.\"). Notably, Petitioner's argument that this information \"would have further impeached Ms. Kousar,\" Rule 33 Mot. at 10, is itself an acknowledgment that Rukhsana's credibility was already impeached-indeed, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner's trial counsel offered ample evidence to impeach Rukhsana's credibility during trial, and Amina's statement would be merely \"an additional basis for doing so\" and therefore \"cumulative and hence immaterial.\"\n   <em>\n    Orena\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1344554\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/145/551/#p559\">\n    145 F.3d at 559\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

(\"Dratel 2255 Decl.\"), ECF No. 126-2. In the email exchange, Petitioner-writing from the email address of his son, Shakeel-alleged Shujat was \"trying his level best to come to USA by hook and by crook\" and stated Shujat had a \"henious [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] criminal record\" and escaped from the custody of authorities in the UAE. Ex. 2 to Dratel 2255 Decl. at 2-3, ECF No. 126-2. Petitioner wrote he had \"come to know that [Shujat] have developed [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] friendship/close relationship with\" Amina.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Petitioner argues this email exchange-which occurred around the same time as the murders of Asghar and Madeeha-shows that \"rather than engaging in a conspiracy to kill members of Shujat Abbas's family, Mr. Choudhry was instead communicating with the U.S. government, through proper channels, seeking assistance in securing the safety of his daughter from someone he believed did not have salutary purposes in aiding her departure from Pakistan.\" 2255 Pet. at 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Reply Memo at 2-3. Petitioner argues these emails would have provided the jury with evidence that Petitioner was allegedly \"using lawful means, and harbored only lawful intentions, to disengage his daughter Amina Ajmal from the influence of Shujat Abbas.\" Reply Memo at 2-3. Petitioner argues this email exchange is admissible to show his state of mind and \"consciousness of innocence.\" 2255 Pet. at 19.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Petitioner's claim fails because he cannot show trial counsel's decision not to offer the email exchange into evidence was objectively unreasonable. Indeed, Petitioner's trial counsel explained that in his view-and in this Court's view too-introducing this email exchange carried the risk of \"paint[ing] Mr. Choudhry as an even more devious and desperate man, hell-bent on trying anything and everything to put a stop to Shujat's relationship with his daughter.\" Sosinsky Decl. at 3. In trial counsel's opinion, this was particularly true given the closeness in time of this email exchange and the recordings of Amina's and Petitioner's phone conversations in which Petitioner threatened Shujat's family.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. According to trial counsel, there was also no support for Petitioner's claim in the email exchange regarding Shujat's alleged criminal record.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As the Second Circuit noted in its decision on Petitioner's direct appeal, \"[w]hether to offer evidence and call particular witnesses 'is peculiarly a question of trial strategy which courts will practically never second-guess.' \"\n   <em>\n    Choudhry\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337473\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/649/60/\">\n    649 F.

Here, given the substantial risks to Petitioner of introducing the email exchange, trial counsel's well-reasoned decision not to offer it into evidence was certainly within the wide range of professionally competent assistance. Moreover, Petitioner cannot demonstrate prejudice given the highly inculpatory evidence implicating him in the murders.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strouse\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1138297\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/928/548/#p556\">\n    928 F.2d at 556\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (no prejudice given overwhelming evidence of guilt).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Documents Relating to Prior Attack on Asghar\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Next, Petitioner argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to offer into evidence Pakistani court documents allegedly related to a lawsuit filed by Asghar\n   against a neighbor in connection with a land dispute. 2255 Pet. at 19-20; Ex. 3 to Dratel 2255 Decl., ECF No. 126-3. Petitioner argues these documents \"would have provided considerable proof in Mr. Asghar's own words that others had threatened him,\" and \"the prospect of an alternative perpetrator would have been established by Mr. Asghar himself.\" 2255 Pet. at 20. Petitioner specifically points to a statement allegedly provided by Asghar in which he describes being threatened at gunpoint by the defendants in the lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (quoting Ex. 3 to Dratel 2255 Decl.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Although Petitioner contends his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to offer these documents into evidence, as Petitioner's trial counsel points out, Petitioner does not suggest any basis upon which these documents would be admissible.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20; Sosinsky Decl. at 3. Petitioner's trial counsel therefore did not act unreasonably in failing to offer into evidence inadmissible documents. Even assuming these documents were admissible, Petitioner's claim still fails. As discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   in the context of Petitioner's Rule 33 motion, the theory of an alternative perpetrator was presented to the jury during trial.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Sosinsky Decl. at 3-4; Gov't Ex. C at 45-46; Tr. at 833-34. Indeed, Petitioner himself referenced the possibility of an alternative perpetrator with a motive to harm Asghar in one of the recorded telephone calls between Amina and Petitioner. Gov't Ex. C at 45-46. Petitioner's trial counsel did not act unreasonably in failing to offer into evidence documents that were cumulative of other evidence before the jury, and in any event, Petitioner's trial counsel asked Rukhsana about the very documents in question and she denied knowledge of them. Sosinsky Decl. at 3. Similarly, Petitioner cannot show prejudice for failing to offer into evidence documents allegedly showing the possibility of an alternative perpetrator when that theory was already presented to the jury, and in light of the overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's guilt, the result would not have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    iii. Purportedly Exculpatory Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Petitioner argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a number of purportedly exculpatory witnesses. 2255 Pet. at 20-34. According to Petitioner, these witnesses would have contradicted the testimony of Seemab and Rukhsana, who testified that members of Petitioner's family were present at the scene and committed the murders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Petitioner focuses primarily on trial counsel's decision not to call Zameer Abbas, who was driving the motorcycle on which Asghar and Madeeha were riding and who was also shot during the incident, as a witness. 2255 Pet. at 22-28; Reply Memo at 4-5. Petitioner points to two affidavits submitted in connection with Petitioner's April 2013 bail application in which Zameer states that individuals identified by Rukhsana as being present at the scene of the murders were, in fact, not there. 2255 Pet. at 23; Ex. 4 to Dratel 2255 Decl., ECF No. 126-4; Ex. 5 to Dratel 2255 Decl., ECF No. 126-5. Petitioner also cites two documents described earlier in the discussion of Petitioner's Rule 33 motion-the Report Zimni and a document prepared in connection with the Pakistani trial of Mazhar Iqbal-which summarize statements Zameer allegedly made in which Zameer denied the involvement of Petitioner's relatives in the murders. 2255 Pet. at 24-27; Ex. 7 to Dratel 2255 Decl., ECF No. 126-7; Ex. 8 to Dratel 2255 Decl., ECF No. 126-8.

As Mr. Sosinsky explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   As I recall it, at my final meeting with Zameer Abbas, I became increasingly concerned that he would not appear to be a credible witness. Most important, there was a major issue regarding an initial statement purportedly made by Zameer to the police and/or to medical/hospital personnel on the very date of the shooting. Although I was aware through our investigation that there had been such an initial report filed, we were not able to obtain this document until the eve of trial. In this statement, which Zameer had disavowed making, it was reported that the shootings occurred in essentially the same manner and involved the very same individuals as had already been testified to by Rukhsana and Seemab Asghar. When pressed over how there could have been such a fundamental discrepancy between this statement and his subsequent statements to the contrary, Zameer did not have an answer which inspired confidence in me. In addition, although Zameer was certain that none of the many (perhaps 11) named individuals claimed by Rukhsana and Seemab to have been present at the scene of the shooting were there, he was unable to describe in any detail the appearance of the shooters. This too caused me doubts about his veracity. Further, he disclaimed knowing much of anything concerning the earlier shooting of Asghar's vehicle even though it was undisputed that it was following this event that he was asked to stay at Rukhsana's house with them. In addition to concern over specific aspects of his proposed testimony, I also concluded that Zameer would likely not be a strong witness. He struck me in person as a particularly nervous young man. Since the defense had already presented testimony from three witnesses who, if believed, cast significant doubt about the Government's witnesses, it did not seem at all prudent to put on a witness who I had little faith would withstand a spirited cross-examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 5-6. Moreover, as discussed in detail already, trial counsel presented the testimony of three witnesses whose version of events, if credited, contradicted the testimony of Rukhsana and Seemab:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   To begin with, although Zameer Abbas was present in New York at the time of trial, and I had planned on, in all likelihood calling him as a witness, the final determination not to do so was made only after the defense had presented the testimony of three witnesses, none of them related to or having friendships with defendant's family, who collectively, if believed, established that Rukhsana's and Seemab's sworn claims to the jury about having been eyewitnesses to the slayings of Muhammed and Madeeha Ashgar were false. We called bus driver\n   Manzoor Ahmed who testified that he drove Seemab Asghar home from school on the date of the murders and that prior to dropping her off, he was notified by telephone that she would be met at the bus stop by police officers, which he testified, in fact occurred. The defense also called one of those police officers, Waqas Ali, who picked Seemab Asghar up at the bus stop where Manzoor had left her and brought her into the city near the crime scene well after the shootings took place. Finally, the defense introduced the testimony of school teacher Nazia Khanum (by deposition) who witnessed the shooting. Khanum testified that the murders were carried out by two unknown individuals, neither of whom was any of the many people that Rukhsana or Seemab identified as having carried out the shootings and with whom Khanum was familiar. Most significantly, Khanum testified that neither Rukhsana nor Seemab were present on the scene when the shooting took place. Rather, Khanum testified, she observed Rukhsana come down to the scene some time later where she was joined by her daughters. Additionally, the defense also introduced a translated police report from the date of the murders which placed both Rukhsana and Seemab at a different location from that at which they claimed to have observed the shootings. Thus, through the unbiased and independent witnesses we had presented, the jury had before it evidence which, combined with what we argued was an implausible story about what transpired immediately after the shooting, allowed them to conclude that they had not heard the truth from the Government's witnesses about that date.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Mr. Sosinsky's declaration clearly demonstrates that his decision not to call Zameer as witness was not unreasonable, and trial counsel acted within the wide range of professionally competent assistance. Trial counsel's brief references to the possibility of Zameer testifying do not change the analysis and do not carry the weight Petitioner attributes to them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Trial counsel made a reasoned \"tactical decision\" not to call Zameer despite his reference to Zameer's anticipated testimony. Sosinsky Decl. at 6. Accordingly, Petitioner cannot show he received the ineffective assistance of counsel based on trial counsel's decision not to call Zameer as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Petitioner also argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call a number of other purported alibi witnesses who would have allegedly refuted the testimony of the Government's witnesses. 2255 Pet. at 28-33; Reply Memo at 6-7. Again, Petitioner's claim with respect to these other witnesses fails because Petitioner's trial counsel acted more than reasonably in deciding not to call them. Trial counsel was rightfully concerned about the reliability and trustworthiness of these potential witnesses. As Mr. Sosinsky explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   [W]hile conducting pretrial investigation, I was very much concerned with the undisputed fact that almost immediately following the murders, none of the men identified as having been involved in the murders could be located at their home or otherwise - notwithstanding that most or all later claimed to have alibis. In fact, even defense witness Waqas Ali testified that he was part of the police team that immediately went looking to arrest those men who had beer identified\n   on the spot by Rukhsana Kousar and that none, including Mr. Choudhry's brother Mohammed Akmal Choudhry, could be found at or around their residencies. Indeed, as I recall it, most of those named by Rukhsana and Seemab remained fugitives from justice in Pakistan, up through the time of the trial of Mr. Choudhry. Thus, although there were witnesses who reported to have been with Akmal at his home at the time of the shooting... given that Akmal had apparently left his home in the village shortly before the police came looking for him, an issue wholly unaddressed in any of their statements, I viewed these witnesses statements, and therefore all such \"alibi\" statements involving others, with more than healthy skepticism. That no one seemed to know where Akmal and others identified as participants in the murders but not yet arrested were as we prepared for trial did not engender in this lawyer greater confidence in their accounts. Moreover, the prospect of offering alibi testimony in an American courtroom regarding, in many cases, fugitives from justice in their own country was not one I would seriously entertain.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 7-8. Petitioner's trial counsel acted more than reasonably in declining to call witnesses whose testimony was highly suspect.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weeks v. Senkowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9098139\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/275/331/#p341\">\n    275 F.Supp.2d 331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 341 (E.D.N.Y. 2003) (Weinstein, J.) (counsel's failure to call alibi witnesses was a \"sound strategic choice\"). Moreover, the testimony of these purported alibi witnesses would have been cumulative of the testimony provided by the witnesses Petitioner did call during trial, who refuted the version of events provided by the Government's witnesses. Petitioner fails to sustain his burden of establishing either prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard for ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <strong>\n    iv. Other Purportedly Exculpatory Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Petitioner's next argument is that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to (1) offer into evidence cell site data pertaining to Babar's location at the time of murders; (2) introduce court documents indicating Ashfaq, one of Petitioner's co-conspirators, was initially denied bail pending trial; (3) call the draftsman who created a sketch of the scene of the murders used in connection with the Pakistani trial of Mazhar Iqbal, Ashfaq's co-defendant; and (4) introduce evidence from Mazhar Iqbal's Pakistani trial related to Asghar's purported enemies and Afzal's alleged political rivalries. 2255 Pet. at 34-36. This Court has already rejected Petitioner's argument that this same evidence warrants a new trial. For many of the same reasons, Petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance with respect to this evidence also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Even assuming their admissibility, the cell site records pertain to a single co-conspirator, and Petitioner has failed to establish a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had they been admitted. With respect to the Bail Order, it was far from unreasonable for trial counsel to have misgivings about \"emphasizing to a jury that named perpetrators were imprisoned pretrial for the crimes they were accused of committing,\" Sosinsky Decl. at 8, and the Bail Order itself undermines the very claim Petitioner argues it supports. Petitioner's ineffectiveness claim related to the draftsman's description of the scene of the murders fails because it was completely reasonable for trial counsel not to seek to admit testimony consistent with the Government's witnesses and exhibits, nor did Petitioner suffer any prejudice as a result. Lastly, failing to introduce evidence from Mazhar Iqbal's Pakistani trial related to\n   either Asghar's alleged hostilities or political rivalries of Petitioner's family was not unreasonable and did not result in prejudice to Petitioner. At bottom, Petitioner cannot show that trial counsel acted unreasonably in failing to seek to admit this evidence, nor can Petitioner show that he suffered prejudice under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Regarding documents and other evidence from the Pakistani trials of Petitioner's co-conspirators, Petitioner's trial counsel explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [W]ith respect to the trial(s) of any of the named individuals in Pakistan, the undersigned understood that the courts there did not and likely would never hear the sworn testimony of Amina Ajmal, Rukhsana Kousar or Seemab Asghar, nor would the audiotaped recordings of Mr. Choudhry's threats be presented to those tribunals. For this reason alone (and there were many others), to the undersigned, decisions made in those courts could hardly have been premised upon the same considerations as were present here. I was always guided accordingly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 9. Trial counsel's reluctance to introduce evidence related to the Pakistani proceedings was well-founded. The Pakistani proceedings in which Petitioner's co-conspirators were acquitted have no bearing on the proceedings before this Court, and were reached without all of the evidence presented to the jury in this case. Petitioner's reliance on the outcomes of those proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2255 Pet. at 34 n.13, is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Failure to Object\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Petitioner argues trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to certain expert testimony from Government expert witness Professor Katherine Ewing and to certain testimony from other Government witnesses. The Court addresses Petitioner's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    i. Professor Ewing's Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Petitioner first argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to certain parts of Professor Ewing's testimony because the testimony was either unduly prejudicial under Rule 403 and/or beyond the scope of permissible expert testimony. 2255 Pet. at 38-39. Some context is important for analyzing Petitioner's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The Government initially gave notice in a June 1, 2014 letter of its intention to call \"an expert witness to testify regarding the role of honor killings, arranged marriages and gender dynamics in Pakistani culture. In particular, the government expects that this witness will testify regarding the frequency and typical circumstances of such honor killings.\" ECF No. 70. In a letter dated June 4, 2014, the Government identified Professor Katherine Ewing, a \"trained anthropologist and professor of religion at Columbia University, [whose] fields of specialization include anthropological approaches to religion; Islam and Islamization; religious movements; identity politics and postcoloniality, ethnicity and migration; gender and sexuality; and cultural and social theory,\" as the expert it anticipated calling to testify at trial. ECF No. 72. Also on June 4, 2014, Petitioner's trial counsel filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   seeking to preclude Professor Ewing's testimony. ECF No. 73. On June 6, 2014, the Government filed a response to the defense's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , in which it provided a detailed summary of Professor Ewing's anticipated testimony. ECF No. 76 at 2-3. During a June 9, 2014 pretrial conference, this Court denied the defense's motion to preclude the expert testimony. Gov't Ex. E (Transcript of June 9, 2014 Pretrial Conference) at 28-30, ECF No. 136-5. Petitioner's trial counsel objected again to the Government's motion to certify Professor\n   Ewing as an expert during trial, which the Court overruled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Tr. at 657-58.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   With this important background, it is clear Petitioner's claim must fail. Petitioner acknowledges his trial counsel filed a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   , but nonetheless argues the motion \"did not represent fulfillment of [trial counsel's] obligation to monitor the individual answers during the expert's testimony.\" 2255 Pet. at 38; Reply Memo at 7. But the portions of testimony cited in Petitioner's motion fall squarely within the areas of testimony contemplated in the Government's June 6, 2014 response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 76 at 2-3. It would have been frivolous for trial counsel to make further objections to Professor Ewing's testimony. As Petitioner's trial counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-124\">\n   What Mr. Choudhry fails to acknowledge, however, is that each of the passages of Professor Ewing's testimony which he finds objectionable yet not specifically objected to in front of the jury were the subject of a detailed\n   <em>\n    motion in limine\n   </em>\n   made just prior to trial in which the bases for the defense's objections to such testimony were set forth - and thereafter opposed by the Government's proffer. This issue, among others, was the subject of colloquy with the Court at the final pretrial conference. And the proffered testimony was ruled admissible by the Court at that final pretrial conference, over the defense's continuing objection. Accordingly, objecting in the presence of the jury to what I knew the Court had already ruled admissible would have accomplished nothing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 9-10. Trial counsel did not act unreasonably in failing to make frivolous objections that would have been overruled.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Cohen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1241120\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/427/164/#p170\">\n    427 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 170 (2d Cir. 2005) (\"[T]he failure ... to raise an otherwise futile objection could not have rendered counsel ineffective.\" (citations omitted) );\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Dec. 2, 2005) (Preska, J.) (\"The failure to make demonstrably futile arguments cannot constitute constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Petitioner also argues his trial counsel should have cross-examined Professor Ewing. 2255 Pet. at 44; Reply Memo at 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 687. Again, this argument fails because trial counsel's decision not to cross-examine Professor Ewing was a sound strategic decision. As Petitioner's trial counsel explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   As to the claim that I should have cross-examined Professor Ewing, it is notable that counsel does not suggest even a single area of inquiry that might have proved fruitful. In the end, that decision not to cross-examine this witness was borne of an evaluation by counsel that inasmuch as Professor Ewing, as she stated, was not testifying about or with knowledge of the particular circumstances present in the case on trial, it was the better course of action to have her leave the witness stand sooner than later.... If I believed based on what I knew, that there was likely to be helpful information elicited on cross, I would have certainly attempted to get it from her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 10. In his reply, Petitioner asserts it would have been \"useful\" for trial counsel to \"reinforce for the jury\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   during cross-examination that Professor Ewing's testimony was not based on her knowledge of the facts of the case. Reply Memo at 7. But as Petitioner implicitly acknowledges, this was already established on direct examination, as Professor Ewing stated in response to the Government's own questions that she had not directly participated in the Government's investigation of the case and had not reviewed any of the Government's evidence. Tr. at 656. At a minimum, it was certainly within the wide range of professionally competent assistance not to seek to cross-examine Professor Ewing regarding this previously-established point, notwithstanding Petitioner's contention that it would have been \"useful.\" Accordingly, because trial counsel did not act unreasonably, Petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Objections to Other Testimony\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Next, Petitioner argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object on hearsay and Rule 403 grounds to certain testimony by Seemab, Amina, and other Government witnesses. 2255 Pet. at 44-47. Petitioner's arguments are meritless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues his trial counsel should have objected on hearsay grounds to the portions of Seemab's testimony during which Seemab testified that Amina told her Babar \"is so shorter than me and my family wanted me to marry him.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44 (citing Tr. at 70). This statement is not hearsay because it was not being offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but rather was offered to show Amina's understanding of her family's wishes. It would have been pointless for trial counsel to object. Even if it were hearsay and trial counsel should have objected, Petitioner cannot show prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues his trial counsel should have objected to Seemab's testimony regarding statements made by Javed as inadmissible hearsay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 44-45 (citing Tr. at 91, 127). But Petitioner's trial counsel\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   object to these statements both pre-trial and again during trial. Specifically, trial counsel objected to the Government's pre-trial motion to admit co-conspirator statements,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 74 at 1-2, and the Court overruled those objections,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. E at 14. During trial, Petitioner's counsel again objected when Seemab testified regarding Javed's statements. Tr. at 79-80, 90-91, 126-27. To the extent Petitioner is now arguing trial counsel should have objected\n   <em>\n    again\n   </em>\n   , any further objection would have been frivolous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object on Rule 403 grounds to Seemab's testimony regarding the January 2013 attack on her family's car and Amina's fear of her uncle in Pakistan. 2255 Pet. at 45-46. Regarding Seemab's testimony about the January 2013 attack, there was other, overwhelming evidence of Petitioner's family's involvement, including Petitioner's own statements in consensually recorded calls (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. C at 11) and Rukhsana's testimony. Accordingly, it is meritless to argue Petitioner suffered prejudice within the meaning of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test as a result of the admission of this testimony. With respect to Seemab's testimony concerning the bullet holes in the family car, the Government introduced into evidence a photograph in which bullet holes are clearly visible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. F, ECF No. 136-6. Moreover, in light of the overwhelming\n   evidence of Petitioner's guilt, it is implausible to suggest there is a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different had Seemab's testimony regarding her anger or Amina's testimony regarding being fearful not been admitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Fourth\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues trial counsel should have renewed his objection to Amina's testimony regarding a rumor she heard about a cousin who fled an arranged marriage. 2255 Pet. at 46-47 (citing Tr. at 565-66); Reply Memo at 8-9. Petitioner also argues trial counsel should have provided a more specific basis for the objection. 2255 Pet. at 46-47; Reply Memo at 8-9. As Petitioner concedes, trial counsel\n   <em>\n    did\n   </em>\n   , in fact, object to this testimony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 565-66 (\"Mr. Sosinsky: Objection, Judge, to rumor.\"). It would have been pointless to object again given that the Court already overruled trial counsel's objection, and it certainly was not unreasonable for trial counsel not to renew his objection or articulate another basis for the objection. Although Petitioner argues trial counsel should have objected to this testimony on the basis of hearsay, as the Government notes, it was not eliciting the rumor for its truth, but rather to show Amina's state of mind, and it was also relevant for that purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Opp. at 41. The testimony was therefore not hearsay. Moreover, Petitioner has not come anywhere close to meeting his burden of showing prejudice within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   with respect to this testimony. The notion that Petitioner's trial may have turned out differently if the jury never heard this brief testimony strains credulity given all of the evidence of Petitioner's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   Regarding Petitioner's claim that he should have objected more often, Petitioner's trial counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   As for Mr. Choudhry's claim that I should have objected more often during the testimony of Amina Ajmal, Rukhsana and Seemab, and by failing to do so, I somehow failed to prevent the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence (Choudhry Memorandum in Support, pp. 44-47), my recollection is that I objected regularly throughout the trial and argued outside the presence of the jury on a number of occasions regarding the basis for objections that were overruled. I do not believe that had I objected to any of the challenged testimony, the Court would have sustained a single objection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Sosinsky Decl. at 10. This Court agrees. Petitioner's claims that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object more are meritless, and Petitioner cannot come close to showing that there is a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different even if trial counsel had objected more.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Failure to Cross-Examine Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Petitioner argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to more thoroughly cross-examine Seemab, Rukhsana, and a witness from Western Union. 2255 Pet. at 48-50. Once again, Petitioner fails to establish either prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , and his claim fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues trial counsel should have cross-examined Seemab more extensively regarding \"important subjects.\" 2255 Pet. at 49. \"Decisions about 'whether to engage in cross-examination, and if so to what extent and in what\n   manner, are ... strategic in nature' and generally will not support an ineffective assistance claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunham v.

Petitioner fails to specify precisely what subject or subjects trial counsel neglected to explore during cross-examination in his motion, nor does he identify those subject or subjects in his reply memorandum. As Petitioner's trial counsel noted, \"[Petitioner] does not even recite what it is that counsel purportedly neglected to question [Seemab] about.... What is clear is that the request was to ask a single additional question.\" Sosinsky Decl. at 11. Petitioner's failure to identify precisely what subject or subjects trial counsel neglected to pursue on his extensive cross-examination of Seemab is fatal to his claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , Petitioner argues trial counsel failed to sufficiently cross-examine Rukhsana regarding \"essential issues,\" including a Pakistani police report which was later admitted into evidence. 2255 Pet. at 49.

While I neglected to confront the witness with the information in this report while on cross, I recognized the omission while the witness was still on the stand and thought that the Court would permit me but a few minutes to question her on this. The Court did not.

Even if trial counsel's cross-examination was inadequate-which it was not-trial counsel's declaration clearly demonstrates Petitioner cannot show prejudice given that trial counsel was still able to use the report to attempt to contradict Rukhsana's testimony.

Petitioner argues a reply brief would have provided an opportunity to address and/or correct the purported errors in the brief appellate counsel filed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   With respect to the filing of a reply brief, Petitioner's appellate counsel explained Petitioner and his family wanted the brief to be reviewed by another lawyer prior to filing, and she sent the brief to Petitioner's son and Petitioner's trial counsel for their review but heard nothing from Petitioner or his son after receiving an extension of time to file from the court. Stafford Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 24-26.

Although Petitioner cites several emails between his son and Ms. Stafford,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Reply Memo at 11 &amp; Ex. 3 to Reply Memo, ECF No. 140-3, none of those emails directly contradict Ms. Stafford's statement that Petitioner instructed her not to file a reply until Petitioner and/or other counsel signed off on it. In any event, even if what Petitioner alleges is true, he cannot show prejudice. Petitioner argues a reply brief could have (1) cited to certain portions of the testimony of Manzoor Ahmed; (2) cited additional case law; and (3) provided a \"plain error\" analysis regarding the jury charge on Count Three. 2255 Pet. at 62-64. But Petitioner fails to adequately explain why his appeal would have turned out differently even if his appellate counsel had raised these issues in a reply brief. Accordingly, because there is not a reasonable probability of a different outcome on appeal, Petitioner's claim regarding the reply brief fails.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington v.
