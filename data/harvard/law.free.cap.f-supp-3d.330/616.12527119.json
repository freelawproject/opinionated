Relevant Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The following facts are drawn primarily from the parties' statements of material facts, D. 66; D. 69,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the exhibits filed by Jackson, D. 70, and are undisputed unless otherwise noted. Jackson was first prescribed and regularly took Risperdal starting on or about February 4, 1999 (when he was eleven years old), until January 2001 (when he was thirteen years old). D. 66 \u00b6 15; D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 4. This antipsychotic medication was initially prescribed by Dr. Christopher Bellonci for treatment of Jackson's psychiatric conditions. D. 69 \u00b6 4. Dr. Bellonci is one of the three experts disclosed by Jackson. D. 67-2 at 2. Prior to taking Risperdal, Jackson was prescribed several other medications to treat his behavioral and psychotic disorders including Trilafon, Congentin, Lithium, Ritalin, Adderall, Depakote and Nortriptyline. D. 67-3 at 7; D. 66 \u00b6 25. According to Jackson, Risperdal caused him to become obese, D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 5-7, 9, 16; D. 67-6 at 8, diabetic, D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 10-12, 16, to develop gynecomastia (i.e., breast enlargement ), D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 14, 16, and to develop high prolactin levels, D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 15-16. On August 3, 1999, approximately six months after Jackson began taking Risperdal, Dr. Bellonci noted that \"[Jackson] has gained a lot of weight.\" D. 70-10 at 2. Diagnosed as obese in November 2000, Jackson was referred to Children's Hospital for \"new onset diabetes patient\n   management and education.\" D. 70-11 at 4. Dr. Bellonci, testified, however, that despite a correlation between Risperdal and Jackson's weight, it is plausible that the weight gain could have derived from the effect of Jackson ceasing to take Adderall, D. 67-3 at 10, although Jackson reports that this medication has a side effect of appetite suppression, D. 66 \u00b6 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 6, 2000, Jackson was admitted to Rhode Island Hospital due to increased glucose levels. D. 70-13 at 2. During this stay, hospital records indicated that \"it is possible that [Jackson] has gained a lot of [weight] from Risperdal (a known common [side effect] ) and question whether this [weight] gain has contributed to the onset of [diabetes mellitus ].\" D. 70-14 at 3. On November 11, 2000, a subsequent notation further indicated that Risperdal is known for causing weight gain and also that Jackson had gained fifty pounds during the previous year. D. 70-12 at 5. Jackson was discharged from Rhode Island Hospital on November 15, 2000 with a diagnosis of Type II diabetes. D. 70-13 at 2-3. The discharge notes specified that Jackson was \"presumed to have diabetes type II given [his weight] and given [his] negative antibody levels and the high insulin levels.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. Dr. M. David Kurland, one of Jackson's treating physicians, but not one of his disclosed experts, later suggested in a medical document, dated February 26, 2001, that due to Jackson's weight and enlarged breasts, Jackson should switch to Seroquel, which has less of an appetite-increasing effect than Risperdal and does not produce endocrinal changes, which can be a side effect of Risperdal. D. 70-7 at 2. Dr. Kurland further noted that Jackson's weight affected his Type II diabetes and that Jackson \"complained of breast enlargement and breast pain in November and was found to have a prolactin level of 21.4, which is high for his age and gender.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   After switching from Risperdal to Seroquel, Jackson's weight and prolactin levels decreased.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants dispute, however, that Risperdal caused Jackson's injuries given that there are multiple alternative causes of Jackson's conditions, \"including puberty, obesity, and certain medications.\" D. 66 \u00b6 16; 67-4 at 8. According to Dr. Bellonci, one of Jackson's treating physicians, an 11-year old child \"would certainly be gaining weight as [he] grew.\" D. 67-3 at 15-16. Dr. Bellonci further testified that several years ago \"side effects were thought to be less in second generation antipsychotics like Risperdal.\" D. 67-3 at 4. Additionally, Dr. Charlotte Boney, another of Jackson's treating physicians, testified that gynecomastia, is \"really common in boys starting puberty\" and also that a \"good 50 percent of boys in early puberty develop some breast tissue.\" D. 67-9 at 3-4. Dr. Boney also testified that \"[a]nytime there is a risk of obesity, there is a risk of gynecomastia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4. Gynecomastia is listed as a side effect not only of Risperdal, D. 67-4 at 7, but also of Trilafon, D. 67-7 at 4, one of the medications Jackson ingested prior to Risperdal, D. 67-3 at 7; D. 66 \u00b6\u00b6 25-26, and of Seroquel, D. 67-10 at 3, which Jackson was also later prescribed. Dr. Victoria Wolfson, another one of Jackson's treating physicians and one of Jackson's experts, testified that she never diagnosed Jackson with gynecomastia or diabetes, D. 67-4 at 18, and that there are multiple causes of diabetes, D. 67-4 at 18, 22. Dr. Wolfson further testified that even if she were aware gynecomastia was a frequent side effect of Risperdal, she would still have prescribed it to Jackson. D. 67-4 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Jackson's antipsychotic medications were administrated through physician submissions to the Suffolk County Probate Family Court (the \"Probate Court\") since Jackson was a ward of the Department of Child and Family Services\n   (\"DCF\"), formerly DSS.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   D. 66 \u00b6 12; D. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 2, 3. Jackson's current counsel has indicated that since his March 2017 appearance in this case, \"both Jackson's counsel and Defendants' counsel sought to gain access to Jackson's probate file and to the physicians who prepared Jackson's Roger's petitions.\" D. 70 \u00b6 20. The Probate Court denied these requests for access to the probate file as a result of the \"sensitive nature of the probate file\" even when Jackson initially requested such access.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22. On May 17, 2017, Jackson moved for inspection of records in the Probate Court. D. 70-4 at 2. On April 3, 2018, after the motion was granted, Jackson was permitted to view, but not copy, his file at the Probate Court. D. 70 \u00b6\u00b6 23-24. According to Jackson, at this point, \"it became apparent that the parties [ ] [were] working with an incomplete record in this matter\" given that \"[c]ertain additional Roger's petitions and/or missing pages of petitions already obtained through discovery, appear[ed] to [have been] present in the probate file.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. Jackson filed a motion in Probate Court to copy files together with an affidavit of support on April 3, 2018. D. 70-6 at 2. As of July 5, 2018, the Probate Court had not ruled on Jackson's motion, D. 70 \u00b6 27, and there was no further update of this matter provided at the summary judgment hearing on July 25, 2018, D. 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On October 26, 2015, Jackson initiated this lawsuit in Norfolk Superior Court. D. 1-1. Defendants removed the case to this Court on December 1, 2015. D. 1. As part of the initial scheduling order in this case, Jackson's expert disclosures were due by October 21, 2016. D. 26. The Court granted a joint motion for extension of time to complete discovery, D. 28, extending Jackson's expert disclosure deadline until March 23, 2017, D. 29. On February 2, 2017, the Court allowed the motion of Jackson's original counsel to withdraw. D. 34. While awaiting the entry of successor counsel, the Court extended Jackson's expert disclosure deadline to June 30, 2017. D. 38. After Jackson's current attorney entered his appearance, D. 42, the Court allowed the parties' joint motion to extend pretrial deadlines by sixty days, 4, extending Jackson's expert disclosure deadline to August 31, 2017, D. 44. On August 2, 2017, the parties jointly moved to extend discovery, which the Court again granted until November 13, 2017, D. 49. Jackson subsequently filed an emergency motion for an extension of time to file expert disclosures, D. 53, which Defendants did not oppose provided that staggered expert disclosure dates for the parties remain, that any extension only apply to expert discovery and dispositive motions and that either party could proceed with additional medical depositions previously noticed if they decided to do in light of the expert disclosures. D. 54. The Court granted Jackson's motion, extending his expert disclosure deadline to February 14, 2018, maintaining a staggered defense expert disclosure date one month later (March 14, 2018) and resetting the close of expert discovery for April 13, 2018. D. 55.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Despite the multiple extensions, Jackson did not serve his expert disclosures (disclosing three treating physicians as experts) on Defendants until February 27, 2018, after the deadline of February 14, 2018. D. 67-2. In light of this delay, Defendants and Jackson moved, in relevant part, for further modification of the schedule, to allow Defendants to take the deposition of\n   Dr. Wolfson, one of these treating physicians. D. 59. The Court granted the parties' joint motion and gave Defendants until May 14, 2018 to make their expert disclosures and until June 14, 2018 to file a summary judgment motion. D. 60. Given Dr. Wolfson's unavailability, the Court granted a further motion extending Defendants' expert disclosure until June 30, 2018, D. 63. On June 14, 2018, Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. D. 64. Jackson responded to the motion on July 5, 2018, contending that the Court should deny the motion, or allow him more time for expert discovery, since he claimed for the first time that such discovery was incomplete. D. 68. The Court heard oral argument on these matters on July 25, 2018, taking the Defendants' summary judgment motion and Jackson's opposition to same under advisement. D. 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     Additional Time for Discovery Is Not Warranted\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jackson now contends that Defendants' motion for summary judgment is \"premature,\" D. 68 at 4, because he contends that he requires additional time to review Defendants' \"voluminous\" supplemental document,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, obtain his medical file from the Probate Court,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7, and complete deposition of Dr. Kurland,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Considering Jackson's request under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d), the Court begins its analysis of Jackson's response here. With the pendency of a summary judgment motion, a non-movant may resist a motion for summary judgment by seeking additional time for discovery under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d). Under Rule 56(d), a non-movant must show by affidavit or declaration that \"for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition\" and seeks further time for discovery, opposes the motion for summary judgment or such other appropriate order. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(d) ;\n   <em>\n    Velez v. Awning Windows, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373443\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/35/#p40\">\n    375 F.3d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 40 (1st Cir. 2004). Even with these requirements of the rule, \"[c]onsistent with the salutary purposes underlying Rule 56(f) [precursor to Rule 56(d) ], district courts should construe motions that invoke the rule generously, holding parties to the rule's spirit rather than its letter.\"\n   <em>\n    Resolution Trust Corp. v.

The purpose of this rule is to \"safeguard against judges swinging the summary judgment axe too hastily.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11207925\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/124/#p133\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Keeping this standard in mind, the Court has considered Jackson's filings and the affidavit of his counsel, D. 70, as invoking Rule 56(d) or its \"functional equivalent.\"\n   <em>\n    Velez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9373443\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/35/#p40\">\n    375 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   39-40 ;\n   <em>\n    Wichita Falls Office Assoc. v.

Certainly, Jackson has put the Court on notice that he seeks additional time for discovery prior to the Court's ruling on Defendants' motion for summary judgment, D. 68 at 1, 4; 6-8, and has offered some evidence that he has exercised due diligence in attempting to acquire the necessary materials - at\n   least with respect to the Roger's petitions from the Probate Court. Significantly, however, he has failed to demonstrate that further discovery will influence the outcome of the pending summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=978%20F.2d%20915\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That is, even at this juncture, after multiple extensions of the expert disclosure deadlines and after the Defendants have moved for summary judgment, Jackson has failed to show that the additional discovery he seeks to review or obtain will likely produce expert testimony to satisfy his burden of showing medical causation for his alleged injuries, which as discussed below, is the key to the merits of each of his claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Andrews v. Target Pharmacy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12410061\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/714/4/#p7\">\n    714 F. App'x 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 7 (1st Cir. 2017) (affirming dismissal where \"plaintiffs did not offer a scintilla of expert testimony to prove causation\"). Rather, in attempting to invoke the benefits of Rule 56(d), Jackson argues, as mentioned above, that he needs time to review Defendants' supplemental document production of January 16, 2018, obtain a copy of the probate file for further investigatory purposes and to depose Dr. Kurland, whom Jackson maintains he has not been able to reach. D. 68 at 4-8. Jackson has failed to demonstrate, however, how any of these efforts will conceivably garner material evidence as to causation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v.

Even considering these avenues of discovery in the light most favorably to Jackson, none, including Dr. Kurland, another of Jackson's treating physicians, come close to providing an opinion that Risperdal caused Jackson's injuries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   D. 70-7 at 2 (Dr. Kurland noting only possible side effects of Risperdal ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court concludes that granting Jackson's request additional time to conduct discovery, whether cast as a Rule 56(d) motion or its functional equivalent or even as a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b)(4) to extend discovery by which Jackson has not shown \"good cause,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   D. 73 at 3-5, is not warranted here. Despite the multiple extensions of time to allow him to produce any evidence of expert opinion supporting his claims, he has failed to do so and, at this critical juncture with Defendants' motion for summary judgment pending, D. 64, and a trial date looming, D. 58, it would be inequitable to allow Jackson to continue to press these claims without sufficient evidentiary support to support them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Proof of Causation Is Required\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Turning to Defendants' motion for summary judgment, Defendants argue that Jackson's counts fail because Jackson lacks sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the antipsychotic medication, Risperdal, caused his alleged injuries.

To prevail on an affirmative fraud claim, a plaintiff must show, under the same heightened Rule 9(b) standard as to the misrepresentation, that Defendants \"1) falsely represented material information, 2) did so knowingly, 3) with the intention of inducing reliance and 4) plaintiffs detrimentally relied upon it.\n   <em>\n    Harry v.

Whether asserting fraudulent concealment by Defendants to toll the applicable statute of limitations or asserting a separate fraud claim, Jackson has failed to show in the first instance what misrepresentation were made by Defendants and certainly has not met the Rule 9(b) standard for doing so and this claim also fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    VI. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, this Court ALLOWS Defendants' motion for summary judgment, D. 64.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    So Ordered.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    As an initial matter, the Court notes that Jackson has failed to controvert the undisputed facts as set forth in Defendants' statement of facts, D. 66, even as the Court has also considered Jackson's affirmative statement of facts, D. 69. Accordingly, the \"[m]aterial facts of record set forth\" in Defendants' statement of undisputed facts are \"deemed for the purposes of the motion to be admitted.\" D. Mass. L. R. 56.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    As a result of being a ward of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, consent to administer antipsychotic medications were handled through submissions to the Probate Court referred to as \"Roger's petitions.\" D. 66 \u00b6 12; D. 69 \u00b6 3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    In his opposition to the Defendants' summary judgment motion, Jackson also cites \"obesity\" as a fourth injury. D. 68 at 2. This injury (even as it may logically relate to weight gain) was also not the subject of any expert disclosure or proffered expert testimony in this case and Jackson's showing of causation fails as to this alleged injury as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    Given this conclusion, the Court need not reach Defendants' further argument regarding Jackson's failure to overcome the learned intermediary doctrine.
