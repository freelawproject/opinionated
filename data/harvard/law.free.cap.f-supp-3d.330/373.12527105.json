INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\"), Plaintiffs Ryan Noah Shapiro and Property of the People, Inc. seek disclosure of certain portions of entries appearing on an electronic calendar maintained by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (\"OMB\"). Both parties have moved for summary judgment. Citing FOIA Exemption 5's deliberative process privilege, OMB contends that factual information featured in some calendar entries-including, the identities of meeting participants and the locations of meetings-is not subject to release. This is so, OMB argues, even though Plaintiffs do not seek the release of the specific subject matters of any purportedly deliberative meetings. In addition, citing the presidential communications privilege, OMB asserts that it may withhold other entries in full. As explained below, the Court rejects OMB's claim that, in the context of this case, the deliberative process privilege covers factual information featured in the calendar entries logging the OMB Director's meetings. With respect to OMB's withholdings under only the presidential communications privilege and under both the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege, the Court denies the cross-motions for summary judgment. The declarations submitted by OMB are insufficiently detailed and conclusory, and thus, do not permit the Court to determine whether the agency may properly withhold any of the disputed calendar entries under the presidential communications privilege. OMB may file a renewed motion for summary judgment and must submit supplemental declarations and other materials supporting its claimed exemption. And Plaintiffs may renew their cross-motion in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In May 2017, Plaintiffs Ryan Noah Shapiro and Property of the People, Inc. submitted\n   a FOIA request to OMB, seeking (1) all official visitor logs and/or records concerning visits made to OMB; (2) all phone call logs for Director Mick Mulvaney or any acting or permanent OMB Director; and (3) all calendar or appointment books for Director Mulvaney or any acting or permanent OMB Director, generated since January 20, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Heather Walsh (\"First Walsh Decl.\") \u00b6 6, ECF No. 12-3;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 9, ECF No. 1. OMB later informed Plaintiffs that it does not maintain visitor logs or call logs, and thus, it possesses no records responsive to the first two categories of requested documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Walsh Decl. \u00b6 6. Plaintiffs are apparently satisfied with that response, and the motions presently before the Court concern only the final category of records.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mem. P. &amp; A.

MSJ\"), ECF No. 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its search for records responsive to Plaintiffs' request for calendar or appointment books, OMB reviewed Microsoft Outlook calendars maintained by Mark Sandy-the Acting Director of OMB from January 20, 2017 until mid-February 2017-and by current OMB Director Mick Mulvaney.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Walsh Decl. \u00b6 8. OMB identified 208 pages of calendar records as responsive to Plaintiffs' request.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Walsh Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-13. OMB released all 208 pages to Plaintiffs, but redacted numerous calendar entries, citing FOIA Exemptions 5 and 6.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Walsh Decl. \u00b6 17. Plaintiffs do not challenge the adequacy of OMB's search and do not challenge OMB's withholdings under FOIA Exemption 6. But Plaintiffs dispute a portion of OMB's Exemption 5 withholdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Statement of Material Facts Supp. Def.'s Mot. Summ. J. \u00b6 16 (\"Def.'s SMF\"), ECF No. 12-2. Specifically, this suit concerns certain withholdings under Exemption 5's deliberative process and presidential communications privileges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Pls.' MSJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Pursuant to the deliberative process privilege, OMB has redacted \"calendar entries that would reveal the particular subject matter of agency meetings, as well as entries for preparatory sessions that would reveal the deliberations occurring in subsequent meetings.\" Def.'s SMF \u00b6 13;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   First Walsh Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18, 20-25. More precisely, OMB contends that it has \"redacted certain entries that reference specific narrow discussions reflecting the thinking and deliberations of Executive Branch officials, including the Director.\" First Walsh Decl. \u00b6 21. OMB has provided a general description of the topics of discussion at the meetings memorialized by the calendar entries-for example, \"tax policy\" or \"healthcare policy.\" First Walsh Decl. \u00b6 24; First Walsh Decl. Ex. 1, ECF No. 12-3. In addition, OMB has redacted one calendar entry under the deliberative process privilege because, though the subject\n   matter of the meeting is not featured directly on the calendar, the entry features the names of meeting participants and, OMB contends that \"[i]f the names of those individuals were released, the topic of the meeting would be easily ascertained given public, external events going on at the time the meeting occurred.\" Second Walsh Decl. \u00b6 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs do not challenge OMB's withholding of the subject matter of the meetings for which OMB has asserted the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' MSJ at 1, n.1. Rather, Plaintiffs challenge OMB's redaction of additional information included in these calendar entries-such as, the names of meeting attendees, the locations of meetings, and the \"inviter\" who added the meetings to the Director's calendar.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pls.' MSJ at 1-11. OMB has agreed to turn over this information with respect to many calendar entries, but insists that redaction is warranted to shield the names of meeting participants, the locations of meetings, and the like with respect to entries for which the agency has determined that release of this information \"would so expose the deliberative process that it must be covered by the privilege.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Consolidated Opp'n to Pls.'

According to OMB, it has \"only redacted those entries in which (1) the President or Vice President attended the meeting; (2) the meeting took place in a location in which it would be easily inferred that the President or Vice President was in attendance; or (3) the calendar entry reflected preparation for a meeting that fell under one of the previous two categories.\" Second Walsh Decl. \u00b6 3. These meetings include \"instances in which Director Mulvaney either advised the President or Vice President directly or provided advice to other [Executive Office of the President] officials who would use that information and analysis to inform their advice to the President.\" Second Wash Decl. \u00b6 5.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   This case concerns OMB's invocation of FOIA Exemption 5 to shield, in part or in full, entries from the electronic appointment calendar of the OMB Director. Citing the deliberative process privilege, OMB contends that it may withhold information such as the names of meeting attendees, the locations of meetings, and the \"inviter\" who scheduled meetings because such information may be revelatory of agency deliberations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 4-11. And, citing the presidential communications privilege, OMB maintains that it may withhold in full calendar entries that memorialize meetings between the OMB Director and the President, Vice President, and/or the President's senior advisors-as well as certain entries that reflect meetings held to prepare for meetings between the OMB Director and the President, Vice President and/or the President's senior advisors-that were conducted in furtherance of presidential decisionmaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 11-24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   As explained below, with respect to records for which OMB asserts only the deliberative process privilege, the Court denies OMB's motion for summary judgment and grants Plaintiffs' motion for the same. OMB must release factual information-including the names of meeting attendees, the name of an \"inviter,\" and the locations of meetings-featured in these records. With respect to OMB's withholdings under only the presidential communications privilege and under both the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege, the Court denies the cross-motions for summary judgment.

First, it is not at all clear how release of the disputed material might reveal any aspect of the agency's deliberative process. In the context of this case, details about where a meeting was held, who scheduled a meeting,\n   and who attended a meeting reveal, at most, insignificant or readily observable details about an agency's decisionmaking process. Indeed, because Plaintiffs have not challenged the withholding of the subject matters of these meetings, it is not even apparent exactly what decisionmaking processes are at issue with respect to any particular calendar entry. Though Plaintiffs might infer the general topic of a meeting from a list of meeting participants-the most potentially revelatory information in dispute-release of this information would expose no suggestions, no recommendations, no proposals, and no other aspect of the agency communications, and it is not apparent how disclosure of this information might in any way discourage candid discussion within the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Access Reports\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488530,10546660\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1192/\">\n    926 F.2d at 1195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"[t]he 'key question' in identifying 'deliberative' material is whether disclosure of the information would 'discourage candid discussion within the agency' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Dudman Commc'ns Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"519434,4329652\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/815/1565/\">\n    815 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1567-68 ) ).

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   , the disputed materials in this case have scant potential to expose internal agency deliberations. Revealing, for example, that the OMB Director scheduled a \"regulatory policy\" meeting with certain White House advisors would offer, at the very most, only very limited insight into possible topics of discussion at the meeting. Certainly, in the context of this case, disclosure of the fact that certain officials met-or, at least,\n   planned to meet-in a particular location does not shed light on whether the agency resolved or even considered any matter at all, let alone expose the exact substance of internal agency decisions and the timing of those decisions, as in\n   <em>\n    Wolfe\n   </em>\n   .

And it appears from OMB's filings that it may have asserted the privilege with respect to meetings between individuals who are decidedly not immediate White House advisers under Circuit precedent. In arguing that the privilege should apply to the subset of calendar entries that OMB has deemed potentially revelatory of presidential decisionmaking, OMB points to the several meetings that it left unredacted that purportedly \"involved the same presidential advisers to whom the D.C. Circuit extended the [presidential communications privilege].\" Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 12. The cited unredacted entries memorialize, among other things, a meeting between the OMB Director and the Secretary of State, a meeting between the OMB Director and the Secretary of Homeland Security; and a meeting between the OMB Director and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 12-13. OMB argues that \"[t]he fact that [it] released these and many other calendar entries describing meetings with presidential advisers reinforces the agency's assertion that it invoked the [presidential communications privilege] judiciously and only for those entires that it deemed sufficiently revelatory of presidential decisionmaking.\" Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 13. But, as explained above, OMB appears to misapprehend the reach of the privilege, as the heads of agencies that are subject to FOIA are not immediate White House advisers for purposes of the application of the privilege. Indeed, OMB seems to rely on the functional definition of presidential adviser that was explicitly\n   rejected in\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660852,9257614\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/1108/\">\n    365 F.3d at 1112, 1121-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And because OMB has not provided an entry-by-entry accounting of the positions of purported White House advisers involved in meetings for which the agency has asserted the presidential communications privilege, the Court is unable to discern whether any of entries involve advisors for whom the privilege actually applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Relatedly, OMB asserts that some of the redacted entries catalog meetings among internal agency staff to prepare for meetings with the President or other White House advisers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Opp'n &amp; Reply at 11 &amp; n.5. However, OMB fails to explain why these entries might meet the requirement that documents or other communications directly involved the President or were solicited and received by the President or his immediate White House advisers. OMB cannot rely on the notion that preparatory meetings served some Executive Branch function to claim that a privilege specially related to the unique role of the President applies. As the Circuit explained in\n   <em>\n    In re Sealed Case\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch\n   </em>\n   , the presidential communications privilege does not shield internal agency communications that never reached the President or immediate White House advisers, even if the documents bear on matters of Presidential decisionmaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

To meet its burden of showing that the presidential communications privilege shields the disputed calendar entries, OMB may show that the \" 'communications directly involve[ed] and documents [were] actually viewed by the President,' \" or that \"documents [were] 'solicited and received' by the President or his 'immediate White House advisers [with] ... broad and significant responsibility for investigating and formulating the advice to be given to the President.' \"\n   <em>\n    Loving\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5742243,3575196\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/32/\">\n    550 F.3d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alterations in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5660852,9257614\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/365/1108/\">\n    365 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1114 ). Alternatively, OMB may show that \"[t]he material withheld either memorializes, summarizes, describes or otherwise reflects the content of actual communications between the President or White House advisers or their staff and agency personnel, even though it was not transmitted to or from the White House in its current form.\"\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Wash.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2008%20WL%202872183\">\n    2008 WL 2872183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). OMB may file a renewed motion for summary judgment and must submit supplemental declarations and other materials supporting its claimed exemption, as explained in this Opinion. To do so, OMB must provide sufficient information about each calendar entry and may not rely on broad claims to the exemption based solely on the OMB Director's function as an advisor to the President. Plaintiffs may renew their cross-motion in response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to OMB's withholdings under only the deliberative process privilege. Both parties' motions are\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   with respect to OMB's withholdings under the presidential communications privilege or under both the presidential communications privilege and the deliberative process privilege. OMB may file a renewed motion for summary judgment and must submit supplemental declarations and other materials supporting its claimed exemption. And Plaintiffs may renew their cross-motion in response.

OMB relies on the \"mosaic theory,\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Def.'s MSJ at 12 n.4, 19, which recognizes that \"[t]housands of bits and pieces of seemingly innocuous information can be analyzed and fitted into place to reveal with startling clarity how the unseen whole must operate.\"\n    <em>\n     Halkin v.

Cir. 2003) (describing the deference owed to the Executive in the FOIA national security context). And OMB fails to explain why application might be appropriate in this case given that it apparently bears no connection to national security. Furthermore, it seems to this Court that such an extension is potentially limitless and would grossly undermine the purpose of FOIA.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-58\">\n    This conclusion applies to calendar entries for which OMB has asserted only the deliberative process privilege. For calendar entries for which OMB has asserted both the deliberative process privilege and the presidential communications privilege, the Court will reserve judgment regarding which portions, if any, of those records must be disclosed because, as explained below, the presidential communications privilege sweeps farther than the deliberative process privilege and may shield factual information included in protected records.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
