WOODCOCK, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A lender seeks to foreclose after a borrower defaulted on her loan payments. Because the right to cure letter overstated the amount that the borrower had to pay in order to cure her default and Maine law requires strict adherence to all statutory foreclosure requirements, including an accurate itemization of all past due amounts that caused the loan to be in default and the total amount due to cure the default, the lender is not entitled to foreclose on the property. However, the same fatal error does not apply with the lender's lawsuit on its promissory note and breach of contract counts and the Court grants the lender judgment on those counts. The Court also grants the lender's request to correct the legal description of the subject property in the mortgage deed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Jones' Position\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ms. Jones argues that judgment must be entered against U.S. Bank because the Notice of Default and Right to Cure Letter was defective for several reasons.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 1;\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 1-2. First, Ms. Jones claims that Maine law and the terms of the mortgage require the mortgagee-not the servicer-send the notice.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Second, she contends that the figures in the demand letter were incorrect because the total included $2638.32 in a \"Corporate Advance Balance\" line item, which she maintains was for attorney's fees and costs that U.S. Bank had no right to recoup from her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Jones also asserts that U.S. Bank's Exhibit 8, the spreadsheet of transactions for her loan, was not properly admitted into evidence or should be accorded no weight for several reasons.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. First, Ms. Jones argues that Ms. Lopez's testimony about the \"boarding\"-or records transfer-of Ms. Jones' loan from a previous servicer must be disregarded and stricken as hearsay because the boarding occurred on November 11, 2014, more than a year before Caliber hired her.\n   <em>\n    Id.; Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 2. Second, she contends that U.S. Bank has not adequately authenticated the document because there was no testimony about the fidelity of the printout to the electronic database and the blacked out account number on the printout indicates it does not \"accurately reflect the electronic information it purported to demonstrate.\"\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Jones sees a number of discrepancies in the loan records which undermine their reliability. Ms. Jones says that Caliber's late charges total $432.81 in its demand letter but total $1442.70 in its September 13, 2017 spreadsheet,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex. 1\n   </em>\n   , even though the charges should cover the same period.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5. Ms. Jones suggests there is also a discrepancy between the per diem interest rates on Caliber's spreadsheets,\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   8,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   1, and a letter from the previous servicer, Seterus,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   2, and says the interest totals for the period are mathematically incorrect because they are not even multiples of the per diem interest amount.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Finally, Ms. Jones urges the Court to avoid a cursory analysis of the business records exception, particularly because \"the party offering the records did not actually create those records,\" but merely received them from a separate entity without \"knowledge of the transmitting entity's recordkeeping practices....\"\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9;\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 3. She is skeptical of so-called \"integration\" of business records, whereby some courts admit business records of a previous entity because a subsequent entity incorporated those records and relied upon them.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 6-9;\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 3 (citing\n   <em>\n    Keybank N.A. v.

It explains that Ms. Lopez can testify about the reliability of the records even though she was not yet employed at Caliber when the documents were created, because the witness need not be the person who actually prepared the record, so long as the witness can explain and be cross examined concerning the manner in which the records are made and kept.\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Caliber's mailing of the demand letter did not make U.S. Bank's notice defective.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Ms. Jones' first argues that the demand letter was defective because the lender's servicer, Caliber, rather than the lender, U.S. Bank, sent the notice. This argument rests on a particularly stringent parsing of the phrase in the statute requiring \"that written notice ... is given by the\n   <em>\n    mortgagee\n   </em>\n   to the mortgagor....\" 14 M.R.S. \u00a7 6111(1) (emphasis supplied). Ms. Jones points to no case, however, where a Maine court has found a demand letter defective because it was sent by the mortgagee's servicer, rather than the mortgagee. Furthermore, such a narrow interpretation ignores well established agency principles without any indication that the Maine Legislature intended this result. Even with the Maine Supreme Judicial Court's instruction that lenders are to strictly comply with the requirements of the statute, in an industry where lenders often hire servicers to handle loans, including\n   foreclosures, the Court does not predict that Maine courts would block foreclosures based on such a cramped and impractical interpretation of the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Subparagraphs B and C of \u00a7 6111 require an \"itemization\" of the amounts the debtor must pay. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court indicates that \"the amount due as stated in the notice of default is the precise amount that the mortgagor has thirty-five days to pay in order to cure the default....\"\n   <em>\n    Greenleaf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927805\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/96/700/\">\n    2014 ME 89\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 31,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6927805\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/96/700/\">\n    96 A.3d 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (invalidating a demand letter because it did not state the precise amount of fees due). The Court agrees with Ms. Jones that \u00a7 6111 implicitly requires an accurate or \"precise\" itemization.

She insists that U.S. Bank had no right to charge her for those expenses, a contention U.S. Bank never refuted at trial and conspicuously ignored in its post-trial memoranda.\n   <em>\n    See Trial Tr.\n   </em>\n   at 42:20-47:14 (ECF No. 33).

Ms. Jones argues that U.S. Bank failed to establish the amount due under the Note and Mortgage because its summary table and spreadsheet of transactions were not properly admitted into evidence. The dispute implicates the rules of authentication and written evidence, FED. R.

FED. R. EVID. 1001(e). Ms. Jones cites no authority for her assertion that the proponent must produce testimony to satisfy Rule 1001's requirement that a \"duplicate\" be the result of a \"mechanical, photographic, chemical, electronic, or other equivalent process or technique that accurately reproduces the original.\" Every time a party seeks to introduce a printout or photocopy they need not have a witness testify about the inner workings of inkjet or laser printer technology.

Caliber redacted Ms. Jones' account number with the prior servicer of the loan, but that alone does not create a genuine question about the authenticity of the record or the fidelity of the printing process. In other words, even assuming that Plaintiff's Exhibit 8 is a duplicate, it is admissible to the same extent as the original and Ms. Jones has not presented \"a genuine question about the original's authenticity\" and has not raised questions that \"make it unfair to admit the duplicate.\" FED.

The Business Records Exception to the Rule Against Hearsay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Federal Rules of Evidence generally prohibit parties from introducing any out of court assertion offered for the truth of the matter asserted, unless an exception applies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   801(c), 802. To be admissible under the business records exception, the record must satisfy Rule 803(6), which provides that \"[a] record of an act, event, condition, opinion, or diagnosis\" is not excluded by the rule against hearsay if it satisfies five requirements.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(6). The first three requirements are that \"the record was made at or near the time by-or from information transmitted by-someone with knowledge\"; that \"the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business ...\"; and that \"making the record was a regular practice of that activity.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(6)(A)-(C). The fourth requirement of Rule 803(6) is that the first three conditions \"are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another qualified witness, or by a certification that complies\n   with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(6)(D). The fifth, and final, requirement of Rule 803(6) is that \"neither the source of information nor the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   803(6)(E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Ms. Lopez was qualified to establish the elements of the business records exception even though many entries were created before Caliber hired her.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Ms. Jones argues that Ms. Lopez could not testify as to the accuracy of the records because the loan boarding process occurred prior to her employment with Caliber. This argument fails because it conflates the \"person with knowledge\" requirement of Rule 803(6) with the \"custodian or other qualified witness\" requirement of the rule. The record custodian or other qualified witness does not have to be the individual with personal knowledge of the event or the one who created the business record.\n   <em>\n    Wallace Motor Sales, Inc. v.

If the witness had to be employed during the creation of the document, \"no business could ever admit a business record under Rule 803(6) that had been created before the hiring date of its most senior employee, a proposition that is nonsensical.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Leary v.

The late charges do not indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Ms. Jones points out that Caliber's late charges total $432.81 in its demand letter but total $1442.70 in one of its later spreadsheets, even though the charges should cover the same period. The problem with Ms. Jones' argument is that the demand letter was sent on August 3, 2016, and that particular spreadsheet,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   1, was created on September 13, 2017. The simple explanation is that the figure in the spreadsheet includes late charges that accrued after the demand letter. U.S. Bank is not entitled to charge late fees after sending the demand letter, a fact it acknowledged and rectified by dropping all late charges from its claim. But the fact that U.S. Bank included some late fees to which it was not entitled on September 13, 2017 does not undermine the trustworthiness of the spreadsheet of transactions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    5. The discrepancy in the per diem interest calculations does not indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Ms. Jones points out a discrepancy between the per diem interest rates on Caliber's spreadsheets,\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   8,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   1, and a letter from a previous servicer, Seterus.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   2. On Caliber's spreadsheets, dated September 13, 2017 and November 1, 2017, the per diem interest is $23.42,\n   <em>\n    Pl.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   8,\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   1 at 1, while Seterus' letter, dated December 11 and 16, 2012, contains a per diem interest statement of $23.46.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Ex.\n   </em>\n   2 at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Contrary to Ms. Jones' assertions, this $0.04 discrepancy does not undermine the trustworthiness of Seterus and Caliber's record-keeping systems. The per diem interest calculation appears to be a straightforward multiplication of the principal balance and the annual interest rate, divided by the number of days in a year, 365. This calculation gives a snapshot of the interest accruing on a debt in a given day. That snapshot, however, is only useful for a narrow time period, because the per diem calculation will change as the principal balance changes. In December 2012, an interest rate of 5.50% and a principal balance of $155.657.49 yields a per diem interest amount of $23.458. In November 2017, an interest rate of 5.50% and a principal balance of $155,409.02 yields a per diem interest amount of $23.418. In short, the per diem numbers represent different calculations,\n   not a discrepancy in Caliber's record system as servicer of U.S. Banks's loan to Ms. Jones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Ms. Jones also alleges that the interest totals for the period of default are mathematically incorrect because they are odd numbers when they should be even multiples of the even per diem interest amount.\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Br.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6;\n   <em>\n    Def.'s Reply\n   </em>\n   at 3. Defense counsel cleverly pointed out that an even per diem number multiplied by any whole number of days, will only yield an even interest total. But counsel was too clever by half. In this case there are two flaws in what is otherwise a generally irrefutable proposition. First, as just indicated, the per diem figure of $23.42 is the result of rounding to two decimal places. That means an odd number could result from the multiplication of the per diem figure and a whole number, depending on when Caliber's system rounded the numbers. Second, the per diem figure is only a snapshot of the interest accruing on a loan at a particular time. As a result of compounding interest and changes in the principal balance during the course of the default period, the actual interest accrued over the default period will not equal a simple multiplication of the number of days in the period and the per diem figure for the end of that period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The Court finds no discrepancies in the interest figures.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <strong>\n    6.

The Maine Supreme Judicial Court approach in\n   <em>\n    Deutsche Bank\n   </em>\n   makes eminent sense if the opponent of admission has raised issues under Rule 803(6)(E) that \"would require the testimony of a person of both businesses' regular practices to demonstrate the reliability and trustworthiness of the information.\"\n   <em>\n    Eddins\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20ME%2047\">\n    2018 ME 47\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 12,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494900\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/182/1241/\">\n    182 A.3d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Absent such a showing, the Court's view is that the integrated bank records are sufficiently reliable for admission based on the unrebutted testimony of Ms. Lopez.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   A focus on financial reliance and other indicia of trustworthiness for integrated\n   business records also raises the residual exception to the hearsay prohibition. Rule 807 allows the admission of hearsay statements, even when no other exception applies, if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (1) the statement has equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   (2) it is offered as evidence of a material fact;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (3) it is more probative on the point for which it is offered than any other evidence that the proponent can obtain through reasonable efforts; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (4) admitting it will best serve the purposes of these rules and the interests of justice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   FED.

As just explained, Caliber's accuracy checks, incorporation, and financial reliance are equivalent circumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness. That is particularly true where, as here, the borrower does not dispute the transaction history by claiming overbilling or unrecorded payments. Ms. Jones' only arguments about the trustworthiness of the records were sharp but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to poke immaterial holes. The amount due is a material fact for contract claims, and the records are perhaps the only probative evidence Caliber can offer to prove that material fact. Finally, admitting the spreadsheet entries serves the purposes of the Rules of Evidence and the interests of justice. There is no real question here but that Ms. Jones took out a loan from U.S. Bank's predecessor and that she has not paid the loan in accordance with its terms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   The Court finds the financial records meet the requirements for admissibility under both Rule 803(6) and Rule 807 and are reliable and unrebutted.

The thesis of that scholarly commentary is:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n    When addressing faulty foreclosures, courts are afraid to bar future attempts to foreclose-that is, afraid of giving borrowers \"free houses.\" While courts rarely explain the reasoning behind this aversion, it seems to arise from a reflexive belief that such an outcome would be unjust. Courts are therefore quick to sidestep well-established principles of res judicata in favor of ad hoc measures meant to protect banks against the specter of \"free houses.\"\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n    This Comment argues that this approach is misguided; courts should issue final judgments in favor of homeowners in cases where banks fail to prove the elements required for foreclosure. Furthermore, these judgments should have res judicata effect-thus giving homeowners \"free houses.\" This approach has several benefits: it is consistent with longstanding res judicata principles in other forms of civil litigation, it provides a necessary market-correcting incentive to promote greater responsibility among foreclosure litigators, and it alleviates the tremendous costs of successive foreclosure proceedings.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    Megan Wachspress, et al., Comment,\n    <em>\n     In Defense of \"Free Houses,\"\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=125%20Yale%20L.J.%201115\">\n     125 Yale L.J. 1115\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1115-16 (2016).
