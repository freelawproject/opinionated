The Plan has paid approximately $110,000 to cover medical expenses incurred by defendants James and Nicole Bonavita as a result of a car accident.

Defendants contend that New York General Obligation Law \u00a7 5-335 (\"Section 5-335\"), a statute that precludes insurers from exercising subrogation or reimbursement rights on a claimant's tort recovery, prohibits the Plan from obtaining reimbursement from defendants' possible recovery in their personal injury lawsuit. Defendants, to whom the state court granted summary judgment on the issue of liability, also argue that plaintiffs' action is premature because defendants do not currently possess identifiable funds from which the Plan can recover.

Pls.' Mem. of Law 2. Defendants oppose plaintiffs' motion on three grounds. First, they argue that Section 5-335 prevents the Plan from seeking reimbursement on a potential personal injury settlement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mem. of Law 3-4; Napoli Decl. Ex. B \u00b6 3. Second, defendants assert that, even if Section 5-335 does not apply to the Plan, plaintiffs' motion must be denied because there are \"no identifiable funds [from] which the plan can recover,\" and the defendants must \"be made whole before the plan can recover[ ].\" Defs.' Mem. of Law 5-6. In other words, defendants contend that plaintiffs do not seek \"appropriate equitable relief\" under ERISA \u00a7 503(a)(3). Third, they argue that plaintiffs' lawsuit is premature and, thus, that a declaratory judgment would be inappropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. I will address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    I. ERISA preempts the application of Section 5-335 to the Plan because the Plan is self-funded.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Defendants first argue that plaintiffs' claim \"is barred by\" Section 5-335. Napoli Decl. Ex. B \u00b6 3. According to defendants, this is because \"[f]ully-funded ERISA plans are not entitled to reimbursement for New York State Settlements.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. Alternatively, defendants appear to argue that plaintiffs' claim is barred because the Plan is not self-funded and, therefore, that Section 5-335 is not preempted by ERISA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

First, I find that a judgment in this case \"will serve a useful purpose in clarifying\" the legal issues involved, namely that Section 5-335 does not apply to the Plan and that the relief plaintiffs seek is equitable under ERISA \u00a7 502(a)(3). Further development of the factual record would not change these conclusions. Second, a judgment in this case will \"finalize the controversy and offer relief from uncertainty\" by giving force to the equitable lien by agreement and thus foreclosing defendants' ability to dissipate the funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Borchard,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 542 (\"[A] claim of lien ... when declared, serves to impress the property with something like a trust, hence a protection to the claimant and a warning to the defendant not to deal with the property or the claimant's rights in disregard of his declared interest.\");\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 984 (\"It [is] frequently necessary to safeguard an existing right, even though its exercise may have to be postponed until further facts have become established, or notwithstanding the fact that a condition precedent has not been literally fulfilled.\");\n   <em>\n    Dow Jones &amp; Co. v.
