Presently before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. (Dkt. 11; Dkt. 15).

If so, the claimant is not disabled.

If the claimant does not have a severe impairment or combination of impairments, the analysis concludes with a finding of \"not disabled.\" If the claimant does, the ALJ continues to step three.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At step three, the ALJ examines whether a claimant's impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a listed impairment in Appendix 1 of Subpart P of Regulation No. 4 (the \"Listings\").\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(d). If the impairment meets or medically equals the criteria of a Listing and meets the durational requirement (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.909), the claimant is disabled. If not, the ALJ determines the claimant's residual functional capacity (\"RFC\"), which is the ability to perform physical or mental work activities on a sustained basis, notwithstanding limitations for the collective impairments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The ALJ then proceeds to step four and determines whether the claimant's RFC permits the claimant to perform the requirements of his or her past relevant work.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20416.920\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 416.920(f).

To do so, the Commissioner must present evidence to demonstrate that the claimant \"retains a residual functional capacity to perform alternative substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy\" in light of his or her age, education, and work experience.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rosa v.

At step one, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff had not engaged in substantial gainful activity since September 5, 2013, his application date. (Dkt. 7-2 at 11). At step two, the ALJ found that Plaintiff suffered from the severe impairments of anxiety, depression, panic disorder, degenerative disc disease of the lumbar spine, and obesity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ also found that Plaintiff suffered from a non-severe right shoulder impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). At step three, the ALJ found that Plaintiff did not have an impairment or combination of impairments that met or medically equaled the severity of any listed impairment. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The ALJ particularly considered the criteria of listings 1.04, 12.04, and 12.06 with respect to Plaintiff's physical impairments, as well as the \"paragraph B\" and \"paragraph C\" criteria with respect to Plaintiff's mental impairments. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Before proceeding to step four, the ALJ determined that Plaintiff retained the RFC to perform \"light work\" except that Plaintiff \"is limited to performing simple and routine tasks in a low stress environment defined as involving only occasional decision-making, no interaction with the general public, and an environment in which work is performed primarily alone\n   with only occasional supervision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In making this determination, the ALJ considered \"all symptoms and the extent to which these symptoms can reasonably be accepted as consistent with the objective medical evidence and other evidence,\" as well as the opinion evidence provided. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Among the materials considered was the opinion of social worker Beverly Dodd, who opined that Plaintiff is unable to maintain attention for two-hour segments, sustain an ordinary routine without special supervision, and complete a normal workday without interruptions from psychological symptoms. (Dkt. 7-8 at 573). Ms. Dodd also noted that Plaintiff would miss work more than four days of work per month. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 574). The ALJ stated that Ms. Dodd was not an acceptable medical source under the regulations; that Ms. Dodd had indicated that Plaintiff was not compliant with his treatment regimen and that she could not assess whether he was malingering; and that her opinion that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month was conjectural. (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). The ALJ assigned \"very limited weight\" to Ms. Dodd's opinion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The ALJ also considered the opinion of Dr. Suhda Bakshi, a psychiatrist who saw Plaintiff for therapy every three weeks and for medication every two to three months. (Dkt. Dkt. 7-2 at 16; Dkt. 7-8 at 179). Dr. Bakshi opined that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month, but also noted that Plaintiff has only mild to moderate limitations in multiple areas of functioning, including carrying out simple instructions, maintaining attention for two-hour segments, working in coordination with others, and making simple work-related decisions. (Dkt. 7-2 at 16; Dkt. 7-8 at 181). The ALJ assigned Dr. Bakshi's opinion \"limited weight,\" concluding that her opinion regarding Plaintiff's limitations was inconsistent with her conclusion that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month. (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). The ALJ also noted that Dr. Bakshi's clinical notes indicate that Plaintiff's condition is \"fairly stable.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     The Treating Physician Rule\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The treating physician rule\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   provides that a treating physician's opinion is entitled to \"controlling weight\" when it is \"well-supported by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques and is not inconsistent with the other substantial evidence in [the] case record[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=20%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20404.1527\">\n    20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2).

Feb. 6, 2018). An ALJ may not disregard opinion evidence from a non-medical source simply because the evidence is from such a source.\n   <em>\n    Canales v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3928182\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/698/335/#p344\">\n    698 F.Supp.2d 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 344 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (holding that ALJ erred in disregarding opinion of social worker simply because it was the opinion of a social worker, \"not on account of its content or whether it conformed with the other evidence in the record\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Here, the ALJ afforded Ms. Dodd's opinion \"very limited weight\" for reasons other than the fact that she is a social worker. (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). He noted that the Plaintiff had not been compliant with his treatment at the time of Ms. Dodd's evaluation, and, additionally, that Ms. Dodd indicated that she was unable to assess whether Plaintiff was malingering. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Indeed, subsequent evidence in the record shows that Plaintiff's condition improved with treatment. (Dkt. 7-8 at 51, 121-42). The ALJ was not required to treat Ms. Dodd's opinion as a treating physician's opinion, and he did not err in declining to assign it controlling weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Next, Plaintiff argues that the ALJ erred in failing to provide \"good reasons\" for affording Dr. Bakshi's opinion limited weight. (Dkt. 11-1 at 24). The ALJ stated that there was insufficient evidence in the record to substantiate Dr. Bakshi's claim that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month, and that Dr. Bakshi's own clinical notes indicate that Plaintiff's condition is \"fairly stable.\" (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). Defendant responds that the ALJ properly declined to give Dr. Bakshi's opinion controlling weight because it was not consistent with other substantial evidence in the record. (Dkt. 15 at 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court concludes that the ALJ relied on a mischaracterization of the record in affording \"limited weight\" to Dr. Bakshi's opinion and therefore violated the \"good reasons\" rule. The ALJ explained that Dr. Bakshi's opinion that Plaintiff would miss more than four days of work per month was inconsistent with her conclusion that Plaintiff has mild to moderate limitations in multiple areas of functioning. (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). However, the ALJ failed to note that Dr. Bakshi rated Plaintiff's impairments in various areas as category III, which indicates that the impairment \"[p]recludes performance from 11% to 20% of an 8-hour workday.\" (Dkt. 7-8 at 181). Four missed days of work per month is equal to just under 20% of full-time work. Dr. Bakshi rated Plaintiff's impairments as category III with respect to his ability to: \"[m]aintain regular attendance and be punctual within customary, usually strict tolerances\"; \"[c]omplete a normal workday and workweek without interruption from psychologically based symptoms\"; \"[g]et along with co-workers or peers without unduly distracting them or exhibiting behavioral extremes\"; and \"[t]ravel to unfamiliar places or use public transportation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 181-82). Dr. Bakshi also rated Plaintiff as categories I and II on a number of other abilities/aptitudes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). It is not clear that Dr. Bakshi's ratings are inconsistent with the conclusion that Plaintiff would miss four days of work per month. The ALJ summarily concluded that Dr. Bakshi's opinion was internally inconsistent, and, without further explanation, that was a mischaracterization of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ also mischaracterized Dr. Bakshi's opinion in noting that \"Dr. Bakshi's own treatment notes indicate that despite ongoing psychiatric symptoms, the claimant's condition is fairly stable.\" (Dkt. 7-2 at 16). The ALJ suggests that being \"fairly stable\" is inconsistent with missing four days of work per month. However, as the court explained in\n   <em>\n    Colvin v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-CV-132 FJS/VEB,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204055324\">\n    2011 WL 4055324\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (N.D.N.Y.

Thus, the ALJ mischaracterized Dr. Bakshi's opinion in assigning it \"limited weight\" based, in part, on the conclusion that Dr. Bakshi's opinion is internally inconsistent.
