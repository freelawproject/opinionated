Touvian alleges that a trio of adverse actions were taken to retaliate against her for this and related events, and she asserts retaliation claims under Title VII and the D.C. Human Rights Act.

For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the motion in part and deny it in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The District of Columbia Public Schools system (DCPS) hired Naomi Touvian in\n   the summer of 2016 as a speech pathologist at Barnard Elementary School. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 12, 14. Touvian reported to Dr. Maribel Vargas, who supervised Touvian's caseload and day-to-day activities, and to Ms. Tiffany White, who served as Touvian's clinical supervisor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   About two weeks after beginning work, Touvian emailed Vargas and White to request leave for seven days in October so that she could observe the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, and Sukkot.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17-19. A week later, Vargas summoned Touvian to her office, explained that \"[i]t is a lot of days and I don't like it,\" and said \"I know there is nothing you can do about it, but I am going to report it to your supervisor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22. Vargas then \"reprimand[ed]\" Touvian and said she had emailed the head of the Speech-Language Department to \"report[ ]\" Touvian and to \"express[ ] her dissatisfaction\" with Touvian's request.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Touvian became upset and did not report to work the next day; instead, she emailed Dr. Grace Reid, Barnard Elementary's principal, and relayed the statements Vargas had made.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Touvian returned to work on September 8, she was \"shunned by her coworkers,\" including Reid, as \"[o]ffice and administrative staff avoided her at every turn\" and \"people physically turned away from her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25. She \"received the same unwelcome and cold treatment from her coworkers again on September 9th.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27. Touvian felt it was \"impossible for her to continue working at [Barnard],\" and she did not return.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. She was later transferred to two other schools within the DCPS system.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 20, Touvian and her attorneys met with DCPS representatives-including Vargas and Reid-and Touvian complained about the treatment she received from Vargas and her coworkers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 29-30. DCPS agreed to \"take certain steps\" to avoid similar incidents in the future, but to date, DCPS has \"not taken such actions\" and has not come to any agreement with Touvian.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Touvian continued to work at two other DCPS schools until December 2016, when she traveled abroad to care for a sick family member.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31. Upon her return in January 2017, DCPS informed Touvian that \"her position ... was no longer available to her.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Touvian applied for other positions with DCPS between January and March, and though she received one interview, she was never offered a job.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 39-41.

ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Touvian alleges three instances of protected activity and three corresponding adverse actions: (1) that Touvian's email requesting time off to observe Jewish holidays was protected activity, and that Vargas's criticism and threats constituted adverse action; (2) that Touvian's email to Reid reporting Vargas's behavior was protected activity, and that the subsequent workplace shunning constituted adverse action; and (3) that Touvian's meeting with DCPS officials to complain about Vargas, Reid, and the shunning was protected activity, and that DCPS's termination of and refusal to rehire her constituted adverse action. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant DCPS's motion to dismiss Touvian's retaliation claims insofar as they rely on the first and second theories, but will allow Touvian's third retaliation claim to proceed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Touvian claims she sent an email to her supervisors requesting seven days of leave to observe Jewish holidays. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-19.
