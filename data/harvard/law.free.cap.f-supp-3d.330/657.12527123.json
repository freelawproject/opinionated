Circuit. From 2013 to 2015, the record before this court does not indicate any work on the graphic images. Instead, the working group decided to detour into developing new text, which included the creation and review of the text for accuracy, consultation with outside experts as to proposed study designs, conducting focus groups on the texts, and further revisions of the text in the fall of 2015.

After initial images were designed, the marking firm conducted interviews to assess whether target audiences understood the images. This was completed in June 2016.

Hr'g Tr. 39:11-40:2 [# 46].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   After the hearing, the FDA filed its\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Filing\n   </em>\n   [# 48], in which it acknowledged that if an agency does not hear back from OMB within sixty days, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=44%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203507\">\n    44 U.S.C. \u00a7 3507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , approval may be inferred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The FDA conceded that it did not use the non-response mechanism.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Def.'s 2d Suppl. 2-3 [# 48].

Whereas the final rule was initially set to be completed by June of 2011, the FDA now represents to the court that the final rule will not be completed until one decade later, in November 2021. As justification for its extraordinary delay, the agency argues that its process \"has only grown more complex, because its new rulemaking must now also be informed by the D.C. Circuit's critiques of the initial rule.\" Def.'s Mem. 16 [# 33]. The FDA argues that \"[a]gency action is often the culmination of many steps, but even so, the courts will not second-guess timelines that involve complex scientific and technical questions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   However, the D.C. Circuit's decision did not apply to the substance of the textual warnings. The FDA, of its own accord, decided to revise the texts for two years and delay work on the images until 2015. Despite repeatedly referencing the D.C. Circuit's decision as the basis for its delay, the agency's actions are neither responsive nor required by\n   <em>\n    Reynolds\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, even more troubling is the gaps of time where little to no work was completed on the graphic images. From 2013 to 2015, the record does not indicate any work on the graphic images. Aside from the drawings completed by the certified medical illustrator, the record does not indicate any work on the images from June 2016 to October 2017.
