COOPER, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   In spring of 2017, the Federal Communications Commission (\"FCC\" or \"Commission\") promulgated a proposed rule to establish regulations for broadband internet service providers. Captioned \"Restoring Internet Freedom,\" the rulemaking sought to repeal prior regulations promoting \"net neutrality\"-the principle that internet service providers afford equal access to all internet-enabled data. The proposal received significant public attention, garnering an unprecedented twenty-four million public comments on the administrative record. The number of fraudulent, duplicative,\n   or otherwise dubious comments was equally unprecedented. These questionable comments have drawn the attention of FCC Commissioners, Members of Congress, and journalists including Jason Prechtel, the plaintiff in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Prechtel filed Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests seeking details about the use of two electronic comment-submission tools that the FCC had enabled to facilitate public participation in the regulatory process: comma-separated value (\".CSV\") files and an Application Programming Interface (\"API\"). These tools allowed members of the public to comment on the proposal without going directly to the Commission's website and accessing its comment platform (or Electronic Comment Filing System (\"ECFS\") ). A .CSV file is a template provided by the FCC-essentially, a spreadsheet in which every row contains a separate comment-that allows an individual or organization to solicit and compile multiple comments and upload them into ECFS in one fell swoop. These submissions are sometimes referred to as \"bulk comments.\" By way of example, if an organization wanted its membership to submit comments supporting the FCC's proposed actions, it might ordinarily be forced to encourage each member to access the ECFS website and submit an individual comment. The bulk comment submission process enabled the organization to collect its members' comments, format them into the .CSV spreadsheet, and submit them all at once by transmitting that spreadsheet to ECFS.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   An API, in turn, is a mechanism that facilitates communication between ECFS and other websites. As relevant here, it allows website developers to place comment-submission tools on third-party websites, meaning that visitors to those websites can submit comments to ECFS directly from those websites. For example, if a group opposing the Commission's proposed actions wanted visitors to its website to submit comments into the record, it might ordinarily include a link to ECFS, forcing a visitor to leave its website to submit a comment. The API instead enabled the group to place a comment form directly on its own website, allowing a visitor to type a comment and submit it into ECFS without leaving the site. Those seeking to host an API capable of communicating with ECFS must register for a \"key,\" which confirms to ECFS that the information being transmitted comes from a registered source-essentially, a unique code that opens the door to ECFS so a comment can be left inside.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Prechtel filed two FOIA requests: one with the Commission and one with the General Services Administration (\"GSA\"), the executive agency that manages the Commission's API system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. Ex. A; Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts (\"SUMF\") Ex. B. In this suit, Prechtel challenges how the agencies handled his requests. Specifically, he challenges the adequacy of the FCC's search for the requested records, its invocation of several statutory exemptions to withhold or redact those records, and the GSA's constructive denial of his FOIA request. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 24, 27-28; Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J. &amp; Opp'n at 1. The Court addresses only the second challenge, aimed at the Commission's withholdings. Prechtel belatedly served the GSA and it has not had the opportunity to submit an affidavit clarifying its response to his FOIA request. Accordingly, the Court reserves judgment on the GSA's actions. And because a GSA affidavit should clarify ownership of the API keys, which implicates the adequacy of the FCC's search, the Court also reserves judgment on Prechtel's challenge to that search. The Court will thus deny without prejudice all parties' motions for summary\n   judgment on those issues. Regarding Prechtel's challenge to the Commission's withholdings: The Court will grant the Commission's motion for summary judgment on its withholding of certain privileged emails and its server logs; grant Prechtel's motion for summary judgment on the email addresses used to submit .CSV files; and direct the parties to confer regarding the .CSV files themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 4, 2017, Prechtel filed FOIA requests with the GSA and the FCC. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9, 16. His request to the GSA sought two sets of documents: (1) all public API keys used to submit online comments relating to the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" proceeding, including the associated registration names and email addresses, and copies of all data files submitted through those API keys; and (2) logs of all dates and times that those API keys were used to submit comments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. Prechtel's FOIA request to the FCC sought the same information as well as: (1) \"the email addresses associated with .CSV comment uploads, along with all .CSV files uploaded in response to [the] Proceeding\"; (2) \"logs of all dates and times the email addresses submitted comments\"; and (3) \"all email inquiries to ECFSHelp@fcc.gov regarding .CSV comment submissions to the Proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On June 5, the GSA informed Prechtel that the requested files were not within its \"jurisdiction.\" Pl.'s SUMF Ex. B, at 1 (GSA response to Prechtel's FOIA request). After several email exchanges, the GSA elaborated that the FCC was the \"API owner\" and therefore that Prechtel's request was \"more appropriate[ly]\" addressed to the FCC.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After receiving no substantive response from the FCC, Prechtel filed this suit on September 7, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl.;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 9-12. Twenty days later, the Commission released fifteen pages of documents responsive to the fifth part of his request-that seeking communications to the ECFSHelp@fcc.gov \"help desk\" email address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' SUMF Ex. B, at 2 (FCC response to Prechtel's FOIA request). It redacted several emails within these records and withheld all records responsive to other aspects of Prechtel's request, invoking several of FOIA's statutory exemptions to justify its redactions and withholdings.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-4. Further, it indicated that it did not maintain documents responsive to Prechtel's request for the API keys and associated information, asserting that the GSA maintains these records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, after which Prechtel amended his complaint to add the GSA as a defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 9-15, 21-24. However, Prechtel did not serve the GSA until after briefing had commenced. The GSA has joined the FCC's motion for summary judgment. But it has not provided an affidavit or declaration explaining its response to Prechtel or the extent to which it is in tension with the FCC's response regarding API keys and attendant information. The Court held a telephonic status conference with the parties regarding this issue, after which Prechtel served the GSA. Based on the status conference, the Court expects that the GSA will provide a declaration detailing how it handled Prechtel's FOIA request, which will clarify the issues surrounding the API keys and associated information. Consequently, the Court will deny without prejudice all parties' motions for summary judgment on matters not resolved in this opinion. The parties may renew such motions in the future, if necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The agency may satisfy its burden of showing that a FOIA exemption applies through an affidavit or declaration that \"describes the justifications for withholding the information with specific detail, demonstrates that the information withheld logically falls within the claimed exemption, and is not contradicted by contrary evidence in the record or by evidence of the agency's bad faith.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076968,3553786\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/628/612/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

But his argument is unavailing because it does little more than cast aspersions on the Commission's declaration by suggesting that there must be some non-exempt information that the declarant did not acknowledge. This claim is factually unfounded and thus legally inadequate. \"Agency [declarations]-so long as they are relatively detailed and non-conclusory-are accorded a presumption of good faith, which cannot be rebutted by purely speculative claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Mobley v.

The Commission's response that all non-exempt responsive information was already public appears to reveal a misunderstanding of Prechtel's request. While the submitted comments are publicly available on ECFS, the .CSV files themselves do not appear to be.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Reply at 6 (\"[A]s to Mr. Prechtel's request for the\n   <em>\n    CSV files themselves\n   </em>\n   , the FCC repeats that the\n   <em>\n    information in those files\n   </em>\n   other than the submitter email addresses is already publicly available on the FCC's website along with all other submitted comments....

It is as though someone submitted hundreds of individual letters in an envelope and Prechtel has asked to inspect the return address on the envelope and the letters it contained.

Whether or not the Commission properly withheld the email addresses of\n   bulk submitters, it still must justify independently the withholding of the files themselves. If the Commission maintains access to the files and cannot show why they are independently exempt, it must disclose them.

While the Commission correctly notes that courts in this district have attached a \"substantial\" privacy interest to the email addresses of \"private individual[s],\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, the facts of the cases cited by the Commission differ from\n   those here.\n   <em>\n    Judicial Watch, Inc. v.

This makes them more akin to individual commenters who provide their email addresses when petitioning the government than to \"any other private individual[s]\" whose email addresses the government happens to possess. Any difference between public commenters' and bulk submitters' privacy interests is one of degree, not kind. And the degree of difference is minimal where, as here, a message directed to bulk submitters alerted them that \"[a]ll information submitted\" would be publicly available. In other words, when someone submits multiple comments to influence public policy and is told that her email address will become part of the public record, her privacy interest in that email address is not as strong as the Commission now suggests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Still, bulk submitters have\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   privacy interest in non-disclosure of their email addresses. For Prechtel to successfully challenge the withholding, he must show that the public interest in disclosure of these email addresses outweighs that privacy interest. The \"public interest\" in this context must relate to FOIA's \"core purpose\" of \"shed[ding] light on an agency's performance of its statutory duties.\"\n   <em>\n    DOJ v.

And while courts have sometimes allowed agencies to withhold\n   information such as telephone numbers and home addresses, they have not done so automatically. The propriety of such withholdings depends largely on whether the information sought is independently valuable in illuminating the agency's actions. In\n   <em>\n    Alliance for Wild Rockies v. Department of Interior\n   </em>\n   , which considered disclosure of public comments on the proposed re-introduction of grizzly bears into a particular geographic ecosystem, the court found that disclosure of commenters' home addresses clarified whether the agency gave greater weight to the views of residents of the affected region than it did to those who lived elsewhere.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11584376\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/53/32/#p37\">\n    53 F.Supp.2d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, the court in\n   <em>\n    People for the American Way Foundation v. National Park Service\n   </em>\n   declined to order the release of the telephone numbers and home addresses of individuals who had written to the government regarding a display at the Lincoln Memorial because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Alliance for Wild Rockies\n   </em>\n   , plaintiffs had not indicated \"any apparent significance attached to the individual commenters' geographical locations.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703562\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/284/#p306\">\n    503 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   307 n.8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   This case is closer to the former than the latter. Never mind the plaintiff; here, the\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   , through\n   <em>\n    its\n   </em>\n   actions, has shown the significance attached to email addresses. The Commission has released the email addresses of over twenty million public commenters on the rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FCC Public Notice, FCC Facilitates Review of Restoring Internet Freedom Record, WC Docket No. 17-108 (Nov. 7, 2017). Outside groups have examined this information and highlighted the extent to which public comments were associated with clearly fraudulent or otherwise dubious email addresses, such as example@example.com.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Pew Research Ctr.,\n   <em>\n    Public Comments to the Federal Communications Commission About Net Neutrality Contain Many Inaccuracies and Duplicates\n   </em>\n   (2017), https://perma.cc/B9SZ-JUWC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Moreover, after dissenting Commissioners had called for a delay in the vote on a final rulemaking due to concerns about the fraudulent comments,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hamza Shaban,\n   <em>\n    FCC Commissioner, New York Attorney General Call for Delay of Net Neutrality Vote Over Fake Comments\n   </em>\n   , Wash. Post (Dec. 4, 2017), https://perma.cc/WRD7-S8WZ, the Commission assured the public that \"those comments in no way impeded the Commission's ability to identify or respond to material issues in the record,\" FCC, Declaratory Ruling, Report and Order, and Order, Restoring Internet Freedom, WC Docket No. 17-108, at \u00b6 345 (rel. Jan. 4, 2018). The Commission's assurances highlighted thousands of easily discounted comments from email addresses that were obviously created with fake email generators.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703562\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/284/#p306\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 345 n.1178. The Commission cannot now turn around and say that there is no public interest or independent significance in information that will illuminate whether .CSV files containing scores of comments were submitted by similarly dubious email addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   To illustrate, if someone had used example@example.com or an email address created with a fake email generator to submit a .CSV file containing hundreds or thousands of comments, it would be at least as relevant as individual comments bearing those same indicia of fraud. The disclosure Prechtel seeks would thus reveal information at the heart of FOIA's purpose of illuminating agency action: It would clarify the extent to which the Commission succeeded-as it assured the American people it had-in managing a public-commenting process seemingly corrupted by dubious comments. The relative public value of this information might have been a slightly closer call had the Commission not already released over twenty million\n   email addresses. But it has, and that information has generated significant questions about the agency's procedures; it cannot now claim that the outstanding information is irrelevant to the public's scrutiny of those procedures. Thus, Prechtel has convincingly shown the independent significance attached to the email addresses associated with bulk comment submissions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In addition to enabling scrutiny of how the Commission handled dubious comments during the rulemaking, disclosure would illuminate the Commission's forward-looking efforts to prevent fraud in future processes. The Commission, its Chairman, Members of Congress, and more than a dozen state attorneys general have all expressed concern about the extent to which fake comments were submitted into the rulemaking record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SUMF Ex. F (letter from Members of Congress to FCC Chairman Ajit Pai);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703562\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/284/#p306\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. J (letter from state attorneys general to FCC Chairman and Commissioners); Pl.'s Reply Ex. A (letters from FCC Chairman Ajit Pai to Sens. Jeff Merkley and Patrick J. Toomey). The Government Accountability Office has agreed to investigate the issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s SUMF Ex. I (letter from GAO to Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr.). The Commission's Chairman has expressed a desire to implement mechanisms to prevent future abuses of the public-commenting process.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply Ex. A. He has suggested that longstanding Commission policies might be partly to blame, which implies that they might be revisited.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2, 5. In other words, the public-commenting process appears to have been corrupted by endemic fraud and the Commission hopes to take action to ensure that this problem will not reoccur. Disclosure of the email addresses and .CSV files will enable interested observers to scrutinize that action (or its absence) by defining the scope of the problem. It may be the case, for example, that hundreds of comments were submitted in bulk .CSV files by plainly fake email addresses, or that the comments submitted through .CSV files were all above-board and most problematic comments were submitted through other means. In either instance, Prechtel seeks information that sheds light on the suitability of the Commission's efforts to prevent future public-commenting fraud and abuse. It is surely in the public interest to further the oversight of agency action to protect the very means by which Americans make their voices heard in regulatory processes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Commission maintains that the email addresses cannot illuminate its actions because they were stored by a third party and not accessed during the relevant agency action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Opp'n &amp; Reply at 5. But knowing whether dubious email addresses were used to submit bulk comments will shed light on the relative wisdom of the Commission's non-scrutiny of this information. Given the controversy surrounding dubious comments and the Commission's subsequent assurances that its response was adequate, the public has an interest in knowing whether a keener eye (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , accessing the information) could have revealed information that would have enabled the Commission to better distinguish between real and fake comments. The Commission notes that Prechtel has not explained why a .CSV file submitted with a fraudulent email address would compel the Commission to reject the underlying comments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   True, Prechtel has not argued that the Commission\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   discount such comments. But FOIA exists to illuminate not just\n   <em>\n    whether\n   </em>\n   an agency complied with its statutory duties, but also\n   <em>\n    how\n   </em>\n   it chose to do so. Prechtel need not allege that the Commission\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   to act a certain way to seek information about its chosen actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The public interest in disclosure of bulk submitters' email addresses is significant when compared to the privacy interest at stake. The Court therefore grants Prechtel's motion for summary judgment on this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    2. .CSV Files\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   To the extent that the Commission maintains access to the .CSV files themselves, their disclosure would further illuminate the agency's actions, particularly in light of the ordered disclosure of the email addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Disclosure of the files would allow scrutiny of the Commission's success in combatting fraud. If, for example, a .CSV file contained 1,000 comments, 800 of which were dubious on their face, the public might question the validity of the remaining 200. Or, if a .CSV file containing 1,000 seemingly legitimate comments were submitted by a plainly suspicious email address, the public might question whether the Commission should have discounted those comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, disclosure of the full .CSV files alongside the email addresses could shed light on whose comments the Commission placed most weight. The Commission's release of over twenty million email addresses belies its argument that there is no public interest in the email addresses of those seeking to influence the Commission's actions here. The already released email addresses can reveal important information about the identity of commenters,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which in turn might suggest to whom the government is responsive: Technology experts or laypeople? Consumers or industry? Internet service providers or social media companies? Courts have repeatedly recognized the public interest in this information.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    People for the Am. Way\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5703562\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/503/284/#p306\">\n    503 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   306 ; Lardner,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20758267\">\n    2005 WL 758267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *18 ;\n   <em>\n    Alliance for Wild Rockies\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11584376\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/53/32/#p37\">\n    53 F.Supp.2d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the already public information paints only a part of the picture. The .CSV files will reveal which public comments were submitted together and-with disclosure of the bulk submitter email addresses-by whom. The public might better understand the agency's responsiveness to various constituencies if it knows which stakeholders solicited and facilitated bulk public comments and which comments they submitted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Commission's non-use of the email addresses does not negate this value. Disclosure illuminates the relative weight an agency places on various constituencies' comments whether or not that weighing is conscious or overt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is heuristic value\n   for assessing an agency's actions when disclosure reveals that an agency relied more heavily on certain constituencies' comments, or that its reasoning aligned with the preferences of one constituency over another.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   That value is independent of what the agency knew at the time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Because the Commission's apparent misunderstanding of Prechtel's request left the issue unbriefed, it is unclear whether the Commission currently possesses the .CSV files themselves and, if so, how they are stored.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court therefore directs the parties to meet and confer regarding the release of the .CSV files, applying the analysis set forth in this opinion to the relevant facts. If a dispute remains, the Commission may file a renewed motion for summary judgment on this issue. Any such motion shall include a declaration providing a factual explanation of whether and how the Commission stores the .CSV files.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    The Server Logs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Finally, Prechtel sought the release of FCC electronic server logs detailing all dates and times that .CSV files were submitted.

SUMF Ex. B, at 3-4. The Court finds that the Commission has properly invoked Exemption 7(E) and has shown that the properly withheld information is not reasonably segregable from the other information; therefore, there is no need to address the invocation of Exemption 6.

The agency can meet this burden by showing with \"reasonable specificity\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   that the non-exempt information is not reasonably segregable.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.

Prechtel maintains that these submissions are insufficient because segregating server logs is an easy task, as demonstrated by the fact that another agency has done so in the past. Pl.'s Reply at 7-8. But another agency's action does not undermine the Commission's explanation. Agencies do not necessarily have parallel IT architectures or use identical techniques.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Prechtel also contends that, at most, the Commission's declaration indicates that segregation is possible, but involves multiple steps.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.

The Commission has explained that \"extracting any non-exempt information\" is complicated \"[d]ue to idiosyncrasies in how ECFS is built.\" Second Yates Decl. \u00b6 15. Further, it notes that \"[e]ven attempting to create the records [Prechtel] seeks would require substantial coding work by the Commission's IT staff to craft algorithms tailored to the Commission's server architecture.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \"Courts in this Circuit have held repeatedly that records [are] not reasonably segregable where the agency attest[s] that it lack[s] the technical capability to edit the records in order to disclose non-exempt portions.\"\n   <em>\n    Milton v.
