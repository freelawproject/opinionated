Additionally, the Report recommends that the Court lift the automatic stay to allow the State Court Action (as defined below) to proceed to judgment, but that the stay be maintained with respect to the execution or enforcement of any such judgment. The Court has received two objections to Judge Dein's Report. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry Nos. 58 and 60.) Specifically, on April 15, 2018, the Corporaci\u00f3n de Servicios Intergrales de Salud del Area de Barranquitas, Comer\u00edo, Corozal, Naranjito y Orocovis (the \"Corporaci\u00f3n\") filed its\n   <em>\n    Objection to Magistrate's Report and Recommendation\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 58, the \"Corporaci\u00f3n Objection\"). On April 30, 2018, certain Plaintiffs in the above-captioned adversary proceeding (the \"Additional Objectors\" and, together with the Corporaci\u00f3n, the \"Objectors\") filed their\n   <em>\n    Objections to Magistrate's Report and Recommendation on the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Motion for Abstention\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 60, the \"Omnibus Objection\" and, together with the Corporaci\u00f3n Objection, the \"Objections\"). The Commonwealth filed an omnibus reply\n   submission on May 30, 2018. (Docket Entry No. 62.) The Court has reviewed all of the submissions of the parties carefully and, for the following reasons, adopts the Report. The Objections are overruled in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In 2002, Plaintiffs commenced a suit against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (the \"Commonwealth\") for retroactive unpaid \"wraparound payments\" or \"WAPs\" in the State Court in an action captioned\n   <em>\n    Asociaci\u00f3n de Salud Primaria de Puerto Rico, Inc., et al. v. Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico, et al.\n   </em>\n   , Civil No. KPEO2-1037 (the \"State Court Action\"). As explained in the Report, the WAPs are amounts payable to certain federally qualified health care providers that receive Medicaid funds. On August 2, 2017, Plaintiffs commenced the instant adversary proceeding by removing substantially all of the State Court Action to this Court under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) (the \"Removed Claims\"). There is no dispute that, in light of the Commonwealth's filing of a debt adjustment petition under Title III of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (\"PROMESA\"), this Court has jurisdiction of the Removed Claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On November 14, 2018, the Commonwealth filed its Abstention Motion, requesting that the Court abstain from hearing this adversary proceeding and remand the Removed Claims to the State Court. (Docket Entry No. 29). The Commonwealth proffered that it would agree to a limited modification of the automatic stay to permit the State Court proceedings to continue through the entry, but not the execution or enforcement, of judgment. Plaintiffs oppose the Abstention Motion and argue that the Court lacks authority to abstain and should entertain the adversary proceeding. On April 2, 2018, Judge Dein issued the Report, recommending that the Court (i) grant the Abstention Motion and remand the above-captioned adversary proceeding to the State Court, and (ii) lift the automatic stay to allow the State Court Action to proceed to judgment, but that the stay be maintained with respect to the execution or enforcement of any such judgment in the State Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Standard of Review\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In reviewing a report and recommendation, a district court \"may accept, reject, or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or recommendations made by the magistrate judge.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n    28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1)(C) (West 2018).

Section 7 reads in its entirety as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   Except as otherwise provided in [PROMESA], nothing in this chapter shall be construed as impairing or in any manner relieving a territorial government, or any territorial instrumentality thereof, from compliance with Federal laws or requirements or territorial laws and requirements implementing a federally authorized or federally delegated program protecting the health, safety, and environment of persons in such territory.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202106\">\n    48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (West 2017). The Corporaci\u00f3n also argues, among other things, that abstention will impede the efficient administration of the Commonwealth's bankruptcy estate and that Plaintiffs would be prejudiced by the resulting delays and expenses. The Corporaci\u00f3n incorporates by reference its arguments on the original motion, and identifies pages eight to eighteen of the Report, which comprise the entire \"Discussion\" section of the Report, as the portion of the Report to which the Corporaci\u00f3n objects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In the Omnibus Objection, the Additional Objectors also argue that this Court has exclusive jurisdiction over the Removed Claims under Title III of PROMESA. They further contend that this Court's abstention from hearing the Removed Claims would render PROMESA Section 7 a \"nullity,\" asserting that the Report's construction of PROMESA Sections 306 and 309 \"eviscerates the prohibition against impairment or relieving the Commonwealth from its compliance obligations.\" (Omnibus Objection at II.A., II.C.) The Additional Objectors also take issue with the Report's characterization of their removal of the claims from the State Court as \"forum shopping,\" arguing that the Eleventh Amendment permits them to seek only prospective injunctive relief in the pending federal district court action and that the State Court lacks the authority to enforce a monetary judgment in favor of Plaintiffs under Puerto Rico law. The Objectors also argue that the Report errs both in its selection of factors for analysis in connection with the propriety of abstention and in its application of those factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <em>\n    Power to Remand and Abstain Under PROMESA Sections 306 and 309\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Judge Dein concluded in the Report that this Court has the authority under PROMESA Sections 306(d)(2) and 309 to abstain from hearing the Removed Claims and to remand them. The Court has reviewed\n   <em>\n    de\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    novo\n   </em>\n   the analysis of these issues as set forth in the Report and adopts section III.A. thereof in full. As the Report explains, this Court has non-exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings such as the Removed Claims, and Section 309 authorizes the Court to abstain from entertaining such proceedings, including such proceedings involving issues of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Objectors' invocation of Section 7 of PROMESA as a barrier to remand or abstention is unavailing. Section 7 guides\n   the construction of PROMESA, directing that PROMESA is not (except as otherwise provided) to be construed to impair, or in any manner relieve, a territorial government of certain obligations in connection with federal health, safety and environmental laws and related programs. Even assuming (without so deciding) for purposes of this discussion that all aspects of the Removed Claims implicate \"laws and requirements implementing a federally authorized ... program protecting the health, safety and environment of persons in\" the Commonwealth, the exercise of the Court's power to determine where the scope of the Commonwealth's obligations under such laws is to be adjudicated does not impair or relieve the Commonwealth from such obligations. Nothing in the decision to remand and abstain from pre-judgment determinations precludes or impairs the pursuit within the Title III proceedings of enforcement of any judgment rendered in the State Court Action. Accordingly, Section 7 of PROMESA does not preclude the normal operation of Sections 306 and 309 of PROMESA.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-101\">\n    The Debtors in these Title III Cases, along with each Debtor's respective Title III case number and the last four (4) digits of each Debtor's federal tax identification number, as applicable, are the (i) Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (Bankruptcy Case No. 17 BK 3283-LTS) (Last Four Digits of Federal Tax ID: 3481); (ii) Puerto Rico Sales Tax Financing Corporation (\"COFINA\") (Bankruptcy Case No. 17 BK 3284-LTS) (Last Four Digits of Federal Tax ID: 8474); (iii) Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (\"HTA\") (Bankruptcy Case No. 17 BK 3567-LTS) (Last Four Digits of Federal Tax ID: 3808); and (iv) Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\"ERS\") (Bankruptcy Case No. 17 BK 3566-LTS) (Last Four Digits of Federal Tax ID: 9686).

References to \"PROMESA\" sections herein are to the uncodified version of the statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    Nor is the Court's exclusive jurisdiction over the property of the Commonwealth as a Title III debtor preclusive of remand or abstention. Suffice it to say that the Objectors' property-based exclusive jurisdiction argument would nullify the remand and abstention provisions of PROMESA and of the federal Bankruptcy Code entirely, since both statutes provide that the Court has exclusive jurisdiction of the property of the debtor or of the estate, as applicable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <em>\n     Objectors' Further PROMESA Section 7 Arguments\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    The Corporaci\u00f3n asserts that Section 7 of PROMESA requires this Court to hear the Removed Claims. In the Omnibus Objection, as noted above, Plaintiffs argue that this Court's abstention from hearing the Removed Claims would render PROMESA Section 7 a \"nullity.\" Neither of the Objectors has demonstrated that this Court's remand of, and abstention from hearing, the Removed Claims would be at all inconsistent with the provisions of PROMESA Section 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    First of all, notwithstanding the references to Section 7 in Plaintiffs' Notice of Removal, no pleading in the State Court Action invokes Section 7 of PROMESA. The underlying actions were commenced more than ten years ago, and assert claims under federal laws relating to Medicaid and federal health care programs. An argument that Section 7 precludes discharge in the Title III proceeding of the types of claims that have been asserted in the State Court Action is asserted in a separate adversary proceeding in this Court, but forms no part of the Removed Claims. Secondly, as explained above, Section 7 provides interpretive direction only. It does not purport to confer new rights or create any cause of action, and its provisions are not hindered or nullified by the continuation of proceedings that were commenced to determine and quantify any retroactive financial obligations of the Commonwealth in connection with the federal statutory provisions under which the Removed Claims were brought. Finally, the Commonwealth has not argued, nor does a remand or abstention decision entail a finding, that PROMESA relieves the Commonwealth of the obligation to pay any judgment resulting from the Removed Claims. The Court therefore concludes that abstention is not inconsistent with Section 7.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    <em>\n     Abstention Factors\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    The Objectors, proceeding from their reasoning that PROMESA Section 309 is rendered inoperative by PROMESA Section 7, argue that the Court may only properly consider non-PROMESA-based abstention doctrines. As explained above,\n    PROMESA Sections 306 and 309 remain operative with respect to the Removed Claims. Thus, the Court may remand the Removed Claims \"on any equitable ground\" pursuant to PROMESA Section 306(d)(2).\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n     48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2166\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(2) (West 2017). PROMESA Section 309 authorizes the Court to abstain from adjudicating the Removed Claims if it determines that abstention is in the interests of justice, providing that \"[n]othing in this [title] prevents a district court in the interests of justice from abstaining from hearing a particular proceeding arising in or related to a case under this title.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 2169. The language of Section 306(d)(2) is substantially similar to that of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201452\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1452\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , and the language of Section 309 tracks the language of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201334\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (c)(1). Those Sections of Title 28 govern removal and abstention in matters pertaining to cases under the federal Bankruptcy Code, and Judge Dein appropriately applied the standards governing abstention in bankruptcy cases in interpreting and applying the parallel provisions of PROMESA. The Court, having reviewed the Objections and the Report thoroughly under the\n    <em>\n     de\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     novo\n    </em>\n    standard, adopts section III.B. of the Report.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    To Judge Dein's fine and thorough analysis the Court adds the following, in light of the Objections. The federal nature of the claims under the health-related laws is not at all unimportant. It does not, however, outweigh other factors warranting abstention. The Court notes in this connection that the State Court has jurisdiction of the Removed Claims and is competent to adjudicate those claims, as it has been since the cases underlying the State Court Action were originally filed. The State Court has, as the Report notes, familiarity with the legal context and with the Spanish-language proceedings that have been under way for over a decade. This competence and familiarity, as well as the complexity of the proceedings, weigh in favor of abstention, particularly given the breadth and complexity of the debt adjustment aspects of the Title III proceedings that are before this Court and the relatively limited resources of this Court, in which a single district judge presides over all of the jointly administered Title III cases of Puerto Rico and its instrumentalities as required by PROMESA. Under these circumstances, recommitting the Removed Claims to a court of competent jurisdiction for the finalization of determinations of the scope and economic specifics of any liability of the Commonwealth is in the interests of justice and of the expeditious administration of the Title III cases.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    <em>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    For the foregoing reasons, the Court adopts Judge Dein's thorough and well-reasoned Report in its entirety and the Objections are overruled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The Commonwealth's Motion for Abstention is granted and the Clerk of Court is respectfully directed to effectuate the remand promptly. The automatic stay imposed by 11 U.S.C. Section 362(a) as made applicable to these PROMESA Title III proceedings by Section 301 of PROMESA is lifted to the extent necessary to permit the State Court Action and related appeals to proceed through the entry, but not the execution or enforcement, of final judgment.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    This Order resolves Docket Entry Nos. 29, 55, 58, and 60 in Case No. 17-AP-00227.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION ON THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO'S MOTION FOR ABSTENTION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    Judith Gail Dein, United States Magistrate Judge\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    In re: THE FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT BOARD FOR PUERTO RICO, as representative of\n    THE COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO, Debtors.\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-53\">\n    ASOCIACI\u00d3N DE SALUD PRIMARIA DE PUERTO RICO, INC.\n    <em>\n     et\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     al.\n    </em>\n    , Plaintiffs,\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    -v-\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    COMMONWEALTH OF PUERTO RICO,\n    <em>\n     et\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     al.\n    </em>\n    , Defendants.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    <strong>\n     I.\n     <em>\n      INTRODUCTION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    The plaintiffs are not-for-profit federally-qualified health centers that receive Medicaid funds for services they provide.

In 2002, the plaintiffs brought suit against the Commonwealth for retroactive unpaid WAPs in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance, San Juan Part (the \"State Court\").

Around that same time, the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Rio Grande\n    </em>\n    filed two motions before Judge Gelpi that are relevant to this adversary proceeding. First, they filed\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Motion for Assumption of Jurisdiction over Prior \"Special Master Period\" and for Meeting in Chambers Regarding Said Motion and Memorandum in Support\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     Rio Grande\n    </em>\n    , 03-1640 (GAG), Dkt.

Therein, the\n    <em>\n     Rio Grande\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs asked Judge Gelpi to assume jurisdiction over the period from 2006-2010, which he previously had ruled was barred by the Eleventh Amendment. It is the plaintiffs' contention that by filing the Title III petition, the Commonwealth waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Second, on December 5, 2017, the plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     Rio Grande\n    </em>\n    filed\n    <em>\n     Plaintiffs' Motion to Transfer and Consolidate and Memorandum in Support\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9034169\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/56/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9034169\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/397/56/\">\n     ,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    Dkt.

The plaintiffs requested that this Court wait to decide the Abstention Motion until the First Circuit entered a ruling related to the applicability of the PROMESA stay to the appeals from Judge Gelpi's ordered relief on prospective payments.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Dkt. No. 47 at 3 (\"There is the distinct possibility that the First Circuit will issue a determination that will be relevant to this Court's decision on the [Abstention Motion].\"). As noted above, the First Circuit has now entered an order holding the relevant appeals in abeyance pending the lifting of the stay in this Court. In doing so, the First Circuit acknowledged the \"broad consensus that the wraparound payment litigation should proceed notwithstanding any stay[.]\"\n    <em>\n     Atlantic Medical Ctr., Inc. et. al.\n    </em>\n    , First Circuit No. 17-1812, Document 00117261571. After careful consideration of the issues pending in the First Circuit, this Court has determined that the issue of abstention in this adversary proceeding is ripe for resolution. The questions raised by this Motion, in particular whether the PROMESA Court has the authority to remand this action to the State Court, along with an evaluation of the factors relevant to the abstention decision, are not before the First Circuit. Therefore, this Court now addresses the merits of the Abstention Motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    <strong>\n     III.\n     <em>\n      DISCUSSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    A.\n    <em>\n     This Court Has Authority to Abstain Under PROMESA\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    The Commonwealth moves for abstention under PROMESA \u00a7\u00a7 306(d)(2) and 309 (codified at\n    <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202166\">\n     48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2166\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (d)(2) and\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202169\">\n     48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2169\n    </extracted-citation>\n    respectively). PROMESA \u00a7 306(d)(2) permits the Court to remand a removed case as long as this Court does not have exclusive jurisdiction over the claims therein (\"[t]he district court to which the claim or cause of action is removed ... may remand the claim or\n    cause of action\n    <em>\n     on any equitable ground\n    </em>\n    .\") (emphasis added).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     also\n    </em>\n    PROMESA \u00a7 306(a) (conferring exclusive and not exclusive jurisdiction over certain proceedings).

Plaintiffs, however, argue that these provisions do not apply to the Removed Claims.

The issues which make up the merits of the Removed Claims, which are the only issues before the Court on this motion, did not arise under PROMESA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    The Removed Claims, however, are \"related to\" the Title III case.

Cal. July 29, 2008).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    This Court draws from both sets of factors in evaluating abstention under PROMESA. For the reasons explained more fully below, this Court finds that abstention is warranted based on an analysis of the most relevant factors. Despite involving issues of federal law, the Removed Claims are only remotely related to the main Title III case, abstention promotes the efficient administration of the estate, the plaintiffs will not be prejudiced by remand, there is a likelihood that removal was an attempt to forum shop, and retaining jurisdiction of the Removed Claims would create an unnecessary burden on this Title III docket.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    First, while federal issues predominate, this alone does not mandate retention of the proceeding. The Removed Claims seek a writ of mandamus against the Commonwealth and a declaratory judgment obligating retroactive Medicaid payments. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 32, 36. The resolution of those claims relies on the interpretation of federal statutes. However, while the predominance of federal law is a factor that weighs against abstention, it is not dispositive.\n    <em>\n     In re Middlesex\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414485,9413831\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/61/\">\n     292 F.3d at 69\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"The scope of the bankruptcy court's sale order under the Code is an issue of federal law, and, as such, is a factor that weighed against abstention. However, the bankruptcy court also considered other factors which weighed in favor of abstention.\"). This is particularly true in the instant case where the State Court has been interpreting the federal law for more than a decade. Just as in\n    <em>\n     In re Middlesex\n    </em>\n    , this Court finds that other factors favoring abstention outweigh the presence of federal issues.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Second, abstention promotes the efficient administration of the estate. Where issues are far removed or peripheral, and do not involve issues central to the restructuring, abstention is warranted in bankruptcy cases.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Loewen Group Int'l, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5859667\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/344/727/#p730\">\n     344 B.R. 727\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 730 (D. Del. 2006) (\"... the instant matter deals only with a peripheral contract dispute. Resolution of that dispute may indirectly impact creditor recovery by potentially affecting the value of the securities issued under the plan. This does not, however, impact the efficient administration of the estate.\"). The Removed Claims relate to the plaintiffs' rights to Medicaid payments from the Commonwealth and are not central to the restructuring at issue in this Title III case. They do not involve issues requiring interpretation of PROMESA, nor are they directly related to the restructuring process. While it is true that a judgment against the Commonwealth could impact the estate - having those claims adjudicated in the State Court does not hinder the Title III restructuring process. In fact, the efficiency gained by retaining only those cases integral to this Title III process weighs heavily in favor of remanding the Removed Claims to the State Court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Third, the plaintiffs are not prejudiced from this Court's decision. The State Court is capable of presiding over the Removed Claims and the Commonwealth has offered to modify the automatic stay such that the State Court Action can proceed to judgment. Through their supplemental briefing to this Court, the plaintiffs have belatedly raised the argument that the State Court lacks the authority to provide the plaintiffs complete relief. Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief, Dkt. No. 47 at 4. The plaintiffs rely on\n    <em>\n     Roman v. SLG Ruiz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461789\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/160/116/#p121\">\n     160 D.P.R. 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 121 (P.R. 2003) in arguing that \"under Puerto Rico law even when\n    public funds are available for payment no lien or attachment of public funds can be ordered to ensure compliance with judgment.\" Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief at 4. As an initial matter, it is unclear that this principle is relevant here.\n    <em>\n     Roman v. SLG Ruiz\n    </em>\n    concerns the inability to garnish public funds.\n    <em>\n     Roman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461789\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/160/116/#p121\">\n     160 DPR at 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (as translated). The plaintiffs' use of that case seemingly overlooks the fact that \"there are less onerous remedies that may be used by the State's creditor.\"\n    <em>\n     Stump Corp. D/B/B Aluminum Construction Co. v. Superior Court of P.R. et. al.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8812484\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pr-dec/99/179/#p183\">\n     99 D.P.R. 179\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 183 (P.R. 1970) (as translated). More importantly, the litigation in the State Court on remand would only proceed to judgment; questions of execution and enforcement of any judgments would await further ruling by the PROMESA Court. Abstention Motion \u00b6 10. Allowing the State Court to resume jurisdiction over the Removed Claims is not only possible, but the most efficient way forward.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Fourth, the plaintiffs' removal of the State Court Action is an apparent attempt at forum shopping. The plaintiffs have been litigating their claims in the State Court for over fifteen years. The plaintiffs now ask this Court to analyze the same set of facts. Moreover, this Court was not the plaintiffs' first choice. The plaintiffs originally filed this adversary proceeding in the PROMESA Court with the intention of consolidating this action with the Federal Court Action. Plaintiffs' Opposition at 12-13. Judge Gelpi has already denied that request. To the extent that the plaintiffs have removed their claims simply in order to progress in another forum, this weighs heavily in favor of abstention.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     In re Encompass Servs. Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"37875\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/337/864/#p879\">\n     337 B.R. 864\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 879 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. 2006) (abstaining from hearing an adversary proceeding where there was an \"overwhelming presence of indications that [the party] is trying to take the proverbial second bite at the apple.\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    Finally, abstention will prevent a heavy burden on this Court's already busy docket. This case has been litigated, in Spanish, in the State Court for over fifteen years. For this Court to pick up the pen now would be no small task. Where the State Court has shown experience and competence with the handling of the Removed Claims, assumption by this Court in the eleventh hour would be irresponsible. Courts have decided accordingly in litigations that have made far less progress.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Estate of Scott v.

The avoidance of unnecessary burden weighs in favor of abstention.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.\n     <em>\n      CONCLUSION\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    For the reasons herein, this Court recommends to the District Judge to whom this case is assigned that the\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico's Motion for Abstention\n    </em>\n    (Dkt.
