Defendants Alcoa, Inc., Alcoa World Alumina LLC, and Harvey Aluminum Company of Delaware move to dismiss; they argue that all claims are subject to mandatory arbitration and that Nanko Shipping has failed to state a claim on which relief may be granted. The Court finds that Nanko Shipping is not subject to the arbitration provision in the contract between the Republic of Guinea and Harvey Aluminum Company and, therefore, its contract claims are properly brought in court. As a result, Nanko Shipping may complain of racial discrimination under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985.

The Alcoa Defendants move to dismiss, arguing that the CBG Convention requires all claims to be submitted to arbitration and, in the alternative, the tortious interference and civil conspiracy claims fail because Nanko Shipping failed to allege affirmative and intentional interference by Alcoa. Halco moves to dismiss as well; it argues that (1) the CBG Convention requires arbitration; (2) Nanko Shipping failed to allege any duty under the CBG Convention that Halco may have breached, so its breach of contract and \u00a7\u00a7 1981 and 1985 claims must fail; and (3) the Third Amended Complaint fails adequately to plead claims of tortious interference and civil conspiracy.

Under the CBG Convention, however, Nanko Shipping can seek to benefit from its alleged entitlement to a larger share of bauxite shipments from Guinea but is not thereby bound to arbitrate that dispute.

The parties do not dispute that the CBG Convention is a valid contract between Guinea and Halco, that the Technical Assistance Agreement is a valid contract between Guinea and Nanko Shipping, and that the Technical Assistance Agreement assigned Guinea's rights under Article 9 of the CBG Convention to Nanko Shipping. The parties therefore do not dispute that because Nanko Shipping is an assignee of Guinea's rights under the CBG Convention, there is a valid contract between Nanko Shipping and Halco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nanko Shipping alleges that Halco, as a signatory to the CBG Convention, had a duty to act in good faith to ensure that Guinea, and by extension its assignee, Nanko Shipping, received the benefits contemplated by Article 9 of the CBG Convention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TAC \u00b6\u00b6 3, 19-20 (setting forth the text of Article 9 of the CBG Convention);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CBG Convention, Art. 9 at 33-34. Further, the Third Amended Complaint alleges that the Corporation's Board, which executed the CBG Convention on the Corporation's behalf, has recognized Nanko Shipping's rights under Article 9. TAC \u00b6\u00b6 27, 75-78. Halco responds that Article 9 does not delineate a specific duty that binds Halco. To the contrary, it contends, the Corporation is the party whose duty it is to fulfill the obligations of Article 9. This argument raises questions on the merits which are premature and for which the current record is insufficient. On a motion to dismiss a court decides only if a complaint's allegations are plausible on their face; it does not decide the ultimate merits of those allegations. Accordingly, the Court finds Nanko Shipping has adequately alleged that Halco owes it a duty under the CBG Convention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Halco further challenges the adequacy of the allegations of breach in the Third Amended Complaint. According to the complaint, despite Halco's knowledge of Nanko Shipping's rights under Article 9 of the CBG Convention, \"HALCO Consortium members Alcoa, Rio Tinto, and DADCO steadfastly refused to honor Guinea's transfer of it[s] shipping rights to N[anko Shipping].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 31 (\"Defendants refused\n   to honor and took affirmative steps to ensure that the TAA was not implemented.\");\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33-41, 79-81. Halco argues that none of these allegations is specific to Halco or provides facts to show how Halco, not Alcoa, breached the CBG Convention. It is true that the allegations in the Third Amended Complaint often group Halco and Alcoa and make general statements about actions taken by Alcoa with Halco's approval or ratification,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g., id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 31, 34, 39-41, 65-67, but the Court finds that these allegations are sufficient to meet the plausibility standard of\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   . After discovery, Nanko Shipping may not be able to support its allegations with evidence and Halco may demonstrate that Alcoa acted independently; however, neither of those post-discovery possibilities renders the allegations facially implausible or insufficient to give notice to Defendants so they can prepare a defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Finally, the Court finds that Nanko Shipping has sufficiently alleged damages associated with the alleged breach, that is, its loss of profits from the shipment of the percentage of bauxite guaranteed to Guinea, with conditions, in Article 9 of the CBG Convention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 81;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 30.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Court will deny Halco's motion to dismiss Count I, which alleges a breach of contract by Halco.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    2.
