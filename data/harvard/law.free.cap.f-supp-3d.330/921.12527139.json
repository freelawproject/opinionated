WOLFORD, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Presently before the Court is the Government's motion to authorize payment\n   from defendant Harris Hickman's (\"Defendant\") inmate trust account in order to satisfy the criminal monetary obligations imposed by the judgment against Defendant in this case. (Dkt. 66). Defendant, proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , opposes the motion. (Dkt. 67). Because the Government has failed to present sufficient proof of Defendant's alleged default in his payment obligations, the Court denies the Government's motion without prejudice. (Dkt. 66).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Following a guilty plea, Defendant was convicted of sex trafficking of a minor in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1591\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) and (b)(2). (Dkt. 60 (Plea Agreement); Dkt. 63 (Judgment) ). On November 21, 2016, this Court sentenced Defendant to a total of 188 months' imprisonment, followed by five years of supervised release. (Dkt. 63 at 2-3). The Court also ordered Defendant to pay a fine of $3,000 and a mandatory special assessment of $100. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Defendant's fine was due according to the following schedule:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   While incarcerated, if the defendant is non-UNICOR or UNICOR grade 5, the defendant shall pay installments of $25 per quarter. If assigned grades 1 through 4 in UNICOR, the defendant shall pay installments of 50% of the inmate's monthly pay. While on supervision, the defendant shall make monthly payments at the rate of 10% of monthly gross income.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6). Defendant's special assessment was \"due immediately,\" with payment to begin under the Bureau of Prison's (\"BOP\") Inmate Financial Responsibility Program. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). No restitution was requested or ordered as part of Defendant's sentence. Defendant did not appeal his conviction or sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 4, 2018, the Government moved for an order authorizing the BOP to turn over $3,100.00 of the funds held in Defendant's inmate trust account to the Clerk of Court as payment of Defendant's outstanding criminal monetary penalties (the fine and special assessment). (Dkt. 66). According to the Government, as of the date of the motion, Defendant had not made any payments toward either the fine or the special assessment, but he had $3,467.32 in an inmate trust account maintained by the BOP. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 3, 5). The Government submitted no evidentiary proof in support of its motion, which was unsworn. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201591\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 19, 2018, Defendant responded in opposition to the Government's motion. (Dkt. 67). In a similarly unsworn filing lacking any evidentiary support, Defendant represents that \"on April 8, 2018, the BOP 'disbursed' $25.00 from [his] Inmate Trust Fund Account, 'finally' complying with this Honorable Court's original [judgment].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). He represents that the funds in the account have come from his mother's estate and asks the Court to take $1,600.00 from his account, and, of that amount, apply $100.00 toward the special assessment and $1,500.00 to the fine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). He asks that the Court not seize the remaining $1,500.00 that would be owed on the fine, arguing that he is incarcerated until 2028, \"which is ample time to pay for the balance that is or would be due.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3). He proposes that the balance of $1,500.00 be paid quarterly. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"A defendant who has been found guilty of an offense may be sentenced to pay a fine.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203751\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3751\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Moreover, this Court agrees with the\n   <em>\n    Woodard\n   </em>\n   court that the purpose of ordering a defendant to pay a fine is different than the purpose of ordering him to pay restitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court concludes that, in order to seize funds from Defendant's inmate trust account to pay the outstanding fine, the Court must first conclude that Defendant has defaulted on his payment obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Government's motion lacks any evidentiary proof of the contents of Defendant's inmate trust account or proof that Defendant has defaulted on the payment of his fine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 66).
