As part of this process, members of the transition team interact with the staffs of federal agencies. This case arises from discussions between the most recent presidential transition team and Department of Energy (\"DOE\") staff, specifically discussions pertaining to a questionnaire on a variety of DOE-related issues, as well as certain other discussions regarding DOE personnel.

DOE explains that Kolb \"was the DOE employee in charge of all transition-related materials and was the DOE employee who communicated directly with the DOE transition team,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9, that she \"was involved in all communications with the DOE transition team,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10, and that \"DOE staff was instructed to send responses to Ms. Kolb,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.

To the contrary, it seems likely that other DOE employees would have discussed the Questionnaire without forwarding every such document to Kolb.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   DOE objects that it should not be required \"to search the records of every employee in the entire Department.\" Def.'s Reply at 3. The Court agrees such a search would be unreasonable, but Protect Democracy is not asking for that. It argues instead that DOE could (and should) have identified additional custodians likely to have responsive records. For example, Protect Democracy points to evidence in the record that Kolb emailed certain employees with a request to \"coordinate\" answers and send them to her.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply at 3-4; Pl.'s Reply Ex. 1. Such employees would be a logical starting place for DOE in identifying a bounded universe of additional custodians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Therefore, the Court will order DOE to conduct an additional search that encompasses the files of additional custodians. The Court is not in a position to dictate precisely which custodians a reasonable search would encompass. Instead, the Court will direct the parties to meet and confer regarding additional custodians; if they cannot entirely agree, then DOE should proceed with its search and the parties may address the issue in renewed summary judgment briefing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Search Terms\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Court is less convinced by Protect Democracy's argument that DOE's search terms are too limited.

It has also rejected the proposition that the government must affirmatively explain why every search term proposed by the plaintiff is unnecessary.

Protect Democracy asked for records \"regarding or including Presidential Transition Team questionnaires about climate change (aka 'global warming').\" Def.'s Ex. A. While the search terms did not include all the phrases in the request-in particular, \"climate change\" and \"global warming\"-Protect Democracy is not looking for all documents about climate change, but for documents about a questionnaire that was, only in part, about climate change. Indeed, despite Protect Democracy's characterization of the questionnaire as \"about climate change,\" the questions covered a broad range of topics, such as the DOE's \"statutory authority ... with respect to cybersecurity,\" \"the number of Assistant Secretaries set by statute,\" and the \"reports to Congress or other external parties that are due in 2017.\" Pl.'s Ex. 14 (questions 3, 39 and 51). And while many of the questions no doubt relate to climate change in some way,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Reply SoMF \u00b6 2, not one of the questions appears to have actually used the term \"climate change\" or \"global warming,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Ex. 9; Pl.'s Ex. 14; Def.'s Reply Ex. B; Pl.'s Reply Ex. 2. Thus, the terms DOE used appear to cover the request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   As a result, the burden shifts to Protect Democracy to raise \"substantial doubt\" about DOE's search.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iturralde v.

There may be a large volume of agency records that discuss \"climate change\" or \"global warming\"-and there would certainly be a large number that contain generic terms like \"question.\" In this case, DOE's objection is particularly appropriate given that Protect Democracy proposes to have DOE use each term in isolation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Br. at 12-13; Pl.'s Reply at 5-8.
