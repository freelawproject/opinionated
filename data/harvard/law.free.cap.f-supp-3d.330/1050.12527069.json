BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Superseding Indictment charges defendant with campaign finance violations in connection with two congressional campaigns: (1) the 2012 congressional primary campaign of United States Representative Robert Brady (\"Brady\") and (2) the 2014 congressional primary campaign of Marjorie Margolies. With respect to the Brady campaign, the Government charges that defendant and his co-conspirators facilitated unlawful payments totaling $90,000 to induce Jimmie Moore-Brady's primary challenger-to drop out of the primary race. In connection with the Margolies campaign, defendant is charged with facilitating unlawful campaign contributions through two political consulting entities which he owned and disguising those unlawful contributions as refunds of general election contributions. The Court summarized the charges and the facts at length in its Memorandum dated July 13, 2018. It will do so again in this Memorandum only as necessary to explain its rulings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LEGAL STANDARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The contents of an indictment are governed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 7(c)(1), which instructs that an indictment or information \"be a plain, concise, and definite written statement of the essential facts constituting the offense charged.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Smukler's Motion to Dismiss Count Two Under the Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant seeks dismissal of Count Two of the Superseding Indictment on the ground that two of the three contributions identified occurred outside the statute of limitations. The Government argues that, because one of the three alleged payments occurred within the statute of limitations-as extended by two tolling agreements-and each of the three alleged contributions were made within a single calendar year, a single count charging all three contributions is timely. The parties agree that the statute of limitations for a violation of FECA is five years.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030145\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Count Two charges defendant with \"willfully caus[ing] contributions to the Jimmie Moore for Congress campaign in excess of the limits of the Election Act, which aggregated $25,000 and more in calendar year 2012\" in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(i) &amp; 30116(f) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant asserts that, because the tolling agreement pertained only to the August 2012 payment-which was allegedly caused by D.A. Jones-the statute of limitations bars prosecution for the June 13, 2012, and July 17, 2012, payments, which were allegedly caused by defendant. And defendant argues that because the grand jury could not have indicted him for the third payment made in August, the entirety of Count Two must be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Government counters that all three payments were within the statute of limitations, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   , the\n   Government charged defendant with violation\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201029\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), which makes it a crime to \"knowingly and with intent to defraud ... use[ ] ... unauthorized access devices during any one-year period, and by such conduct obtain[ ] anything of value aggregating $1,000 or more during that period.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201029\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). The Government alleged that Dees made three purchases in violation of the statute, only one of which was made within the statute of limitations. Dees asserted that, because the first two payments-which fell outside the statute of limitations period-constituted offenses in themselves, he could not be prosecuted for those payments in connection with the third payment, which did fall within the statute of limitations period.\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11211306\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/378/\">\n    215 F.3d at 379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, he argued that each of the earlier two payments should have been charged in separate indictments.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11211306\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/378/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Third Circuit reversed the district court's dismissal of the indictment in\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   , explaining that \"inasmuch as the offense is defined as activity 'during any one-year period,' the offense is complete as to any one-year period when there is or are unauthorized uses of access devices and the aggregated value of things obtained through the use of those access devices within the one-year period ending on its last day equaled or exceeded $1,000.\"\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11211306\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/215/378/\">\n    215 F.3d at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on that ruling, the offense as actually charged in\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   was completed on the date of the last payment and the statute of limitations began running at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendant seeks to distinguish\n   <em>\n    Dees\n   </em>\n   on the ground that the criminal statute under which Dees was charged specifically provided for the aggregation of amounts within a one-year period whereas the underlying criminal statute in this case-\u00a7 30116-does not. In this case, the Government relies on \u00a7 30109(d)(1)(A)(i) in conjunction with \u00a7 30116 in charging defendant with making unlawful campaign contributions. It is \u00a7 30109(d)(1)(A)(i), entitled \"Penalties,\" that provides for aggregation within a one-year period. Defendant argues that the calendar year aggregation matters\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for penalty purposes, not for defining the crime. The Court disagrees with defendant and declines to read \u00a7 30116 in isolation from \u00a7 30109.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Defendant cites no support for the proposition that the two provisions- \u00a7\u00a7 30109 and 30116 -should be read in isolation. Indeed, the legislative history of FECA and its amendments suggest that Congress intended to criminalize payments exceeding $25,000 aggregating in a calendar year. In 2002, Congress passed the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (\"BCRA\"), which amended FECA. According to its sponsors, one purpose of the BCRA's amendments to FECA was to \"make[ ] knowing and willful violations of the act involving at least $25,000 in a year a felony.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constitution and Campaign Reform, Hearing on Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 Before Senate Committee on Rules and Administration\n   </em>\n   , 107th Cong. 172-173 (2000) (statement of Senator Fred Thompson);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 175 (statement of Senator Joe Lieberman) (\"The bill would allow felony prosecutions only if, first, the defendant knowingly and willfully violated the law ... and second, if the offense involved at least $25,000.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   To that end, \u00a7 30109 is the only place in FECA that proscribes criminal liability for violations of FECA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Violations of FECA provisions merit criminal punishment only if such violations are committed \"knowingly and willfully.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2030109\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A)(i) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Daniel Murner et al.,\n   <em>\n    Election Law Violations\n   </em>\n   , 55 AM.

The Court address defendant's arguments with respect to each campaign in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   i.\n   <em>\n    Brady for Congress-Counts I-V\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Counts I-V of the Superseding Indictment charge offenses related to the Brady campaign. The Superseding Indictment alleges that defendant and his co-conspirators agreed to pay $90,000 to Moore in exchange for his agreement to withdraw from the primary election race, which Moore did on February 29, 2012. Count Two charges defendant with willfully causing contributions to the Moore campaign, and Counts Three, Four, and Five charge defendant with willfully causing the Moore and Brady campaign to file false FEC reports by mischaracterizing or failing to report those contributions altogether. And Count One charges a conspiracy to accomplish these unlawful ends.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The gravamen of defendant's argument is that the payments alleged were not \"contributions\" because they were not \"made ... for the purpose of influencing any election,\" as defined by FECA. Specifically,\n   defendant contends that payments to induce a candidate to withdraw cannot have been made for the purpose of influencing an election, because the payments were not for the purpose of getting that candidate elected. Moreover, defendant contends that payments made after the primary election was over and the outcome determined cannot be contributions. The Court rejects these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   FECA defines contribution as \"(i) any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person\n   <em>\n    for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office;\n   </em>\n   or (ii) the payment by any person of compensation for the personal services of another which are rendered to a political committee without charge for any purpose.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8)(A)(i). The Court agrees with the Government that payments made for the purpose of inducing a candidate to withdraw from an election for federal office are designed to influence an election-namely, by reducing the pool of candidates to ensure election of another candidate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Defendant also argues that payments made after the conclusion of the primary election are not contributions because \"there was no longer any 'election' to 'influenc[e].' \" Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to Allege Contributions at 12. Defendant recognizes that the FEC recognizes post-election payments as contributions. He urges the Court to disregard such guidance, because agency interpretations should not be afforded\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   deference in criminal cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Defendant ignores that several courts have concluded, in criminal cases, that post-election payments to campaigns run afoul of the FECA.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Defendant argues that the Court must interpret the FECA's contributions limit as applicable only to pre-election payments pursuant to the rule of lenity. \"The rule of lenity requires ambiguous criminal laws to be interpreted in favor of the defendants subjected to them.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, even were the Court to do so, such an interpretation is insufficient to establish ambiguity. As previously stated, FECA defines \"contributions\" as \"(i) any gift, subscription, loan, advance, or deposit of money or anything of value made by any person for the purpose of influencing any election for Federal office.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=52%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2030101\">\n    52 U.S.C. \u00a7 30101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (8)(A)(i). The Government alleges such a payment in this case. A contrary finding has the potential to create an exception that swallows the rule and to defeat FECA's purpose.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Instead, defendant states the Superseding Indictment alleges that the payments were routed to Moore personally, to Cavaness, and to various third-party vendors. As an initial matter, defendant misstates the charges set forth in the Superseding Indictment. The Government charges that the Moore campaign owed nearly $90,000 to Moore himself and approximately $35,000 to Cavaness and that defendant and his co-conspirators arranged to pay Moore $90,000 to repay those debts. Superseding Indict. \u00b6\u00b6 16(d), (e). Of those funds, approximately $21,000 was paid to third-party vendors and $19,500 to Moore directly; Moore and Cavaness retained the remainder of the funds in Cavaness's personal bank account.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1353814\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/637/1276/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 16(bb)-(dd). Although the funds were never received directly by the Moore campaign, the Government charges that the funds were used to benefit the campaign by repaying campaign debts. Defendant's interpretation of those payments would permit candidates to circumvent FECA's contribution limits by simply paying the candidate or his campaign manager directly with instructions to use that money for the benefit of the campaign. Based on this analysis, the Court concludes that payments made to allow Moore to pay campaign debts constitute contributions under FECA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   ii.\n   <em>\n    Marjorie 2014-Counts VI-VII, IX-X\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Defendant also seeks to dismiss Counts Six, Seven, Nine, and Ten of the\n   Superseding Indictment, related to the Marjorie 2014 campaign, on the ground that the Government fails to allege contributions. Count Seven charges defendant with causing excess contributions to the Marjorie 2014 campaign through his entities BBM and InfoVoter, which were disguised as \"refunds\" to the campaign. Count Nine charges defendant with making a conduit contribution-a contribution in the name of another-passed through Margolies herself, to the campaign. And Count Six charges defendant with causing the campaign to make false statements to the FEC to disguise these unlawful payments, while Count Ten charges defendant with causing the Margolies campaign to file false expenditure reports with the FEC. Defendant argues that these counts of the Superseding Indictment fail to allege contributions because: (1) payments made after the close of the election cannot be contributions; (2) the payments were not made for the purpose of influencing an election; (3) the payments were permissible vendor repayments. The Court addresses these arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the Court rejects defendant's first argument-that payments after the close of the election cannot constitute contributions.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   , Section B.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defendant next argues that the Government fails to allege that the payments were made \"for the purpose of influencing an election,\" because \"the [G]overnment alleges that the purpose of all of those payments ... was 'to conceal the fact that [Marjorie] 2014 had impermissibly spent contributions raised for the general election on primary election expenses' in order 'to procure the dismissal of a complaint filed with the FEC against [Marjorie] 2014.' \" Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to Allege Contributions at 18 (quoting Superseding Indictment, Count VI \u00b6\u00b6 3, 7). The Government argues that the Superseding Indictment sufficiently alleges \"contributions,\" because it alleges that defendant caused the campaign to impermissibly spend general election funds in the primary election for the purpose of influencing the primary election in Margolies' favor. Govt.'s Resp. in Opp. to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to Allege Contributions at 18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The Court agrees with the Government and concludes that the Superseding Indictment is sufficient to charge defendant with unlawful campaign contributions. The Superseding Indictment charges that May, the Marjorie 2014 campaign treasurer, informed defendant that the campaign had run out of funds that it could permissibly spend on primary election expenses. Superseding Indictment at \u00b6 9(c). Specifically, a campaign is prohibited from spending contributions raised for the general election on primary election expenses and must \"use an acceptable accounting method to distinguish between contributions received for the primary election and contributions received for the general election.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20109\">\n    11 C.F.R. \u00a7 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).

In sum, the Superseding Indictment charges that defendant solicited excess campaign contributions from a close associate to allow the campaign to impermissibly spend\n   general election funds during the primary election. Defendant's assertion that such payments were not for the purpose of influencing an election is without merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to the defendant's argument that the FEC's express guidance permits vendor repayments and does not consider such vendor repayments to be contributions, defendant again misinterprets the Government's theory of the case and again conflates defendant's alleged cover-up with the criminal conduct charged in the Superseding Indictment. The basis of the Government's charges is that the payments were not vendor repayments but were instead unlawful campaign contributions which were concealed as vendor repayments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Huet\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863805\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/665/588/#p594\">\n    665 F.3d 588\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 595 (3d Cir. 2012) (\"In evaluating a Rule 12 motion to dismiss, a district court must accept as true the factual allegations set forth in the indictment.\") (citations omitted) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In the alternative, defendant asserts that Count Nine should be treated as a misdemeanor.

Subsequently, those entities repaid the campaign. That BBM and InfoVoter had allegedly already spent the money they received from the campaign is immaterial, defendant argues, because \"money is fungible.\" Mot. to Dismiss for Failure to Allege That Mr. Smukler Willfully Caused Any False FEC Filings at 22. Moreover, the FEC requires campaigns to report such vendor repayments as \"refunds,\" not \"contributions.\" In short, defendant's argument is that the statements were \"technically true.\" The Court disagrees and concludes that the Superseding Indictment is sufficient with respect to these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   As stated previously, FECA prohibits campaigns from spending general election funds on primary expenses. The Superseding Indictment charges that defendant learned that the Margolies campaign was running out of funds to spend on the primary election and defendant sought to circumvent this requirement by spending general election funds on primary election expenses. To do so, defendant allegedly directed the campaign treasurer to continue spending campaign funds, despite that the campaign had run out of money that it could legally spend on the primary election. Superseding Indictment, Count VI, \u00b6 9(c). To conceal that the campaign had unlawfully spent general election funds on the primary election, defendant solicited funding from two of his associates, which he then used to repay the campaign. Based on these facts, the Superseding Indictment charges that the payments were not refunds within the meaning of FECA-that is, the payments were not \"contributions made for the general election\" which must be refunded should the candidate lose in the primary election-they were instead unlawful campaign contributions. The Superseding Indictment goes on to allege that defendant\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   the funds were not general election funds which had been set aside in the event that Margolies prevailed in the primary election and that, despite this knowledge, he caused the campaign to report these unlawful contributions as refunds. The Court thus concludes that the Superseding Indictment is sufficient: it recites the statutory language, specifies the time period during which defendant caused the false statements to be made to the FEC, and sets forth the factual basis for Counts Six and Ten.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

That the factual scenario of those cases involved circumstances in which internal campaign employees specifically instructed finance directors to make false representations to the FEC does not render the Superseding Indictment in this case insufficient.
