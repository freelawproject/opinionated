BATES, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Before the Court is [29] the motion by defendants Snowpoint Capital, LLC and SP Funding 452, LLC (together, the \"lender defendants\") for reconsideration of [24] the Court's order granting plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction. For the reasons explained below, the lender defendants' motion for reconsideration will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Because the Court has reviewed the lengthy factual and procedural history of this case in prior opinions, it will do so again here only briefly. Plaintiff Konstantin Shvartser and defendant Evelina Lekser are father and daughter, and in 2008 they purchased a house located at 2150 Florida Avenue in northwest Washington, D.C. (the \"property\") for $800,000. Verified Compl. [ECF No. 1] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 15, 17. Although Shvartser and Lekser initially intended to renovate the house and sell it at a profit, the pace of the renovations fell behind, and in 2015 Shvartser informed Lekser that he wished to sell the property to recoup his investment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 16, 29. According to Shvartser, this demand prompted Lekser to \"embark[ ] on a fraudulent scheme to withdraw equity from the Property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30. Shvartser alleges that Lekser forged a document that purported to grant her Shvartser's power of attorney to refinance the property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78, which she then used to obtain an $800,000 loan from the lender defendants,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 31, 40, the proceeds of which she kept for herself after paying off an existing mortgage on the property,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 101.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2016, Shvartser filed a complaint against Lekser alleging fraud, breach of contract, and other claims arising out of the forgoing alleged events. That complaint, and dispositive motions related thereto, are currently pending in another case before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shvartser v. Lekser\n   </em>\n   , Civil Action No. 16-1199 (JDB) (D.D.C. filed June 20, 2016). Shvartser filed this related case in late February 2018, after the lender defendants notified him of their intent to foreclose on the property because of Lekser's default on the $800,000 loan.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 184-85. Shvartser sought a temporary restraining order against the foreclosure, which the Court entered on March 1,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Order [ECF No. 6], and which Shvartser later moved to convert into a preliminary injunction,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl. Konstatin Shvartser's Mot. for Prelim. Inj. (\"Pl.'s PI Mot.\") [ECF No. 10].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Court then granted Shvartser's motion, explaining that Shvartser had satisfied the four-part test that courts use to decide whether to grant preliminary injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shvartser v. Lekser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n    308 F.Supp.3d 260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 264-65, 269 (D.D.C. 2018). First, the Court found that Shvartser had shown a \"likelihood of success on the merits\" of his claim to quiet title to the property.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n    at 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Under District of Columbia law,\" the Court explained, \"a deed of trust in favor of a mortgage lender is void if the power of attorney used to acquire it is a forgery.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Wells Fargo Bank\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286869\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/991/20/#p26\">\n    991 A.2d 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 26-27 (D.C. 2010) ). Here, Shvartser had not only testified under oath that the 2015 power of attorney was forged, but he had also presented several other reasons to doubt its validity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 265 (summarizing those reasons). The Court also rejected the lender defendants' reliance on the doctrine of equitable subrogation-which, the Court pointed out, they had not asserted as a counterclaim-and their argument that \"the deed of trust 'would still be valid [based] on Ms. Lekser's one-half interest in the Property.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266 (citations omitted). This latter argument, the Court concluded, was contrary to District of Columbia law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Second, the Court found that Shvartser had shown an irreparable injury because the foreclosure sale presented a \"certain and great\" threat of interference with his \"right to dispose of the property as [he] chooses\"-a right that the Court recognized as being \"[i]nherent in ownership of property.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267 (citations omitted). Third, the Court found that the balance of equities tipped in Shvartser's favor, since the harm to his property rights outweighed the purported harms to the lender defendants of having to wait to recover the balance of the loan (since interest was continuing to accrue on that loan), and of potentially having to obtain a new mediation certificate (a prerequisite to foreclosure under D.C. law) if the existing certificate were to expire in November 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 267-68. Fourth, the Court found that the public interest \"weighs slightly in plaintiff's favor\" because \"the public has an interest in seeing that an innocent property owner is not deprived of his or her interest in real property by fraud.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 268-69. Thus, the Court granted the motion and preliminarily enjoined the lender defendants from foreclosing on the property.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 269.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The lender defendants now seek reconsideration of that decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   SnowPoint Capital, LLC and SP Funding 452, LLC's Mot. for Recons. (\"Lender Defs.' Mot.\") [ECF No. 29] at 1. They do so on two grounds: first, they argue that the Court should have held an evidentiary hearing to test the veracity of Shvartser's testimony regarding the allegedly forged power of attorney,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-6; and second, they claim that the Court committed legal error when it concluded that the lender defendants could not foreclose on Lekser's one-half interest in the property if the power of attorney were indeed fraudulent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-10. Shvartser has filed a response to the lender defendants' motion,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Br. in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. for Recons. (\"Pl.'s Opp'n\") [ECF No. 32], which is now fully briefed and ripe for decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LEGAL STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As an initial matter, the Court must determine the correct legal standard to\n   apply to the lender defendants' motion for reconsideration. Although the lender defendants assume, and Shvartser does not dispute, that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) is the correct vehicle for their motion, the Court does not share the parties' confidence. Thus, out of an abundance of caution and for the reasons explained below, the Court will apply the less demanding standard of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), which governs the reconsideration of interlocutory decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scahill v.

Although the lender defendants argued primarily that they were entitled to foreclose on the entire property-either because Lekser had validly encumbered Shvartser's one-half interest,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Lender Defs.'

The Court rejected this argument, explaining that \"a deed of trust in favor of a mortgage lender is void if the power of attorney used to acquire it is a forgery,\"\n   <em>\n    Shvartser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n    308 F.Supp.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   265 (citing\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7286869\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/991/20/#p26\">\n    991 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   26-27 ). It also rejected the lender defendants' argument that an exception to this rule applies where, as alleged here, the person who forged the power of attorney is a joint owner of the property, because the lender defendants had \"cite[d] no authority for this proposition and it was contrary to [D.C.] law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 266.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The lender defendants renew this argument in their motion for reconsideration,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Lender Defs.'

This is reason enough to deny the lender defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In any case, even if the lender defendants were correct in their reading of D.C. law, they would still not be entitled to reconsideration. As the Court's prior opinion explained, the interest protected by the preliminary injunction was Shvartser's right to dispose of his interest in the property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shvartser\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525004\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/308/260/#p264\">\n    308 F.Supp.3d at 267\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , one of the core components of the \" 'bundle' of property rights\" that comes with property ownership,\n   <em>\n    Horne v.

Hence, even if the lender defendants could foreclose on Lekser's one-half interest alone, that foreclosure would still interfere with Shvartser's ownership rights because the lender defendants-not Shvartser-would\n   control the sale.

Therefore, in addition to interfering with Shvartser's exercise of his property rights, foreclosure by the lender defendants-whether as to the entire property or only as to Lekser's one-half interest-would upset the status quo and interfere with the Court's order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v.

Approximately five months have passed since the Court's entry of the preliminary injunction, however, and this case is no closer to trial than it was in April-due in large part to mediation attempts that seem to have proven unsuccessful thus far.
