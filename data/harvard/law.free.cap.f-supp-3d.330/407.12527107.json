It also provides a private right of action to sue EPA to enforce the law's statutory duties that are nondiscretionary.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207604\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2). Plaintiff Sierra Club brings this lawsuit to compel EPA to comply with three duties related to these guidelines that it asserts are nondiscretionary. Before the Court are the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment. ECF No. 12; ECF No. 13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons explained below, the Court concludes that two of the duties at issue are not nondiscretionary. Therefore, they may not be enforced through the private right of action invoked by Sierra Club, and claims related to them must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. With respect to the third duty, which the parties agree is nondiscretionary, the Court will order a schedule that establishes deadlines for EPA's compliance that fall between those proposed by the parties. Thus, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Sierra Club's Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 12), and grant in part and deny in part Defendant's Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment (ECF No. 13). The Court will also deny Sierra Club's Motion for Leave to File a Surreply (ECF No. 18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

But other provisions of the statute-in particular, the timing of the process by which states may resubmit revised state implementation plans to EPA-support EPA's reading, as opposed to Sierra Club's. Section 129 provides that after a state submits its implementation plan-which each state must do not later than one year after EPA promulgates the relevant guidelines-the Administrator must provide a written decision on that plan within 180 days; then, the state is permitted to \"modify and resubmit a plan which has been disapproved.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207429\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2). Thus, the statute allows for the possibility that two years after the promulgation date, a state may have only recently resubmitted a modified plan for EPA's approval. In light of that possibility, it would be surprising for Section 129 to mandate that the Administrator \"develop, implement\n   <em>\n    and enforce\n   </em>\n   \" a federal implementation plan, all within two years of the date the guidelines were promulgated.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207429\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 7429(b)(3) (emphasis added). That would hardly provide the states sufficient opportunity to develop their own plans, as the statute allows. And at that point, under the process set forth in the statute, EPA might well not even know the set of states that would need to be covered by the federal plan. In contrast, even assuming the Administrator did not make a decision on each revised state plan that had been resubmitted until sometime after the two-year mark, he\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   be able to retroactively determine which states had submitted \"approvable\" plans by then, as EPA's reading would require.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Sierra Club nonetheless argues that the purpose and overall structure of the statute suggest that it imposes a nondiscretionary two-year deadline on the agency to finalize a federal implementation plan. But none of its arguments carry the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, Sierra Club argues that Section 129's general purpose of reducing pollution from incinerators is better served by reading the statute to require EPA to create a \"backstop\" within two years of the promulgation of the relevant guidelines for states that do not create an implementation plan.

And in any event, as EPA acknowledged at oral argument, even under its reading, the agency is required to produce a federal implementation plan that would assure every incineration unit subject to it is in compliance within five years after it promulgated the relevant guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207429\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). Therefore, the ultimate deadline for pollution reduction under the law would be the same under either party's interpretation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Next, Sierra Club argues that, because Section 129(b)(2) provides that incinerators subject to state implementation plans have three years to come into compliance, its interpretation makes sense insofar as it would give incinerators subject to the federal implementation plan the same three years to do so. Pl.'s Opp. at 5. But Sierra Club mischaracterizes the statute's requirements for state plans. Section 129(b)(2) provides that a state plan \"shall provide that each unit subject to the guidelines shall be in compliance ... not later than 3 years after the State plan is approved by the Administrator\n   <em>\n    but not later than 5 years after the guidelines were promulgated\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207429\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (emphasis added). Therefore, the statute contemplates that incinerators subject to a state plan may have to achieve compliance in less than three years. For instance, if a state implementation plan were approved three years after the guidelines were promulgated, incinerators subject to that plan would have only two years to do so. Thus, EPA's interpretation of the statute, which could require incinerators subject to a federal implementation plan to come into compliance in less than three years, is entirely consistent with the state implementation plan regime. Moreover, that this provision implicitly anticipates that EPA may approve state implementation plans more than two years after it promulgates the relevant guidelines further undermines Sierra Club's argument that the statute requires the Administrator to completely \"develop, implement and enforce\" a federal implementation plan by that same date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Sierra Club also argues that EPA's interpretation of the statute would lead to \"absurd results\" because EPA could promulgate a federal plan one day before the five-year deadline, making it impossible for incinerators subject to that plan to be compliance in a timely manner. Pl.'s Opp. at 7-8. But EPA's reading would not result in an absurdity, when the relevant provisions are considered together in their entirety. As already explained, even under EPA's interpretation, a federal implementation plan must still \"assure that each unit subject to the plan is in compliance with all provisions of the guidelines not later than 5 years after the date the relevant guidelines are promulgated.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207429\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3). If, as in Sierra Club's hypothetical, EPA released a federal plan the day before the five-year deadline, that would hardly seem to fulfill that statutory mandate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Next, Sierra Club argues that EPA previously endorsed its preferred reading of the statute. Specifically, it points to a number of instances where EPA has, in a rulemaking, described Section 129 as requiring it to finalize a FIP within two years.

But the Court nevertheless rejects its claim that it cannot begin work until March 2020 for a number of reasons. First, by the agency's own admission, there are some SPPD resources currently committed to tasks such as responding to FOIA requests and \"stakeholder outreach\" that, in the Court's view, could be deployed to\n   assist with reviewing and revising the 2005 OSWI Standards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tsirigotis Aff. \u00b6 15.

Again, resources being allocated to these efforts could be devoted to reviewing and revising the 2005 OSWI Standards.

Pl.'s Opp. at 10-11. But as Sierra Club acknowledges,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.27\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    was promulgated to implement a different section of the Clean Air Act.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20Fed.%20Reg.%2053%2C339\">\n     40 Fed. Reg. 53,339\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 53,340 (Nov. 17, 1975) (implementing CAA Section 111). That is clear from the text of the regulation, which includes a number of deadlines inconsistent with Section 129(b). For instance,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2060.27\">\n     40 C.F.R. \u00a7 60.27\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b) says the Administrator will approve or disapprove a state plan within four months.

Thus, this regulation has no bearing on the proper interpretation of Section 129. Sierra Club also suggests that, regardless of the text of the regulation, EPA has adopted the position that it sheds light on the meaning of Section 129. Pl.'s Opp. at 11 (citing\n    <extracted-citation index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2026%2C040\">\n     81 Fed.

Second, as explained below, the meaning of Section 129 can be determined using \"traditional tools of statutory construction,\"\n    <em>\n     Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.

As an initial matter, because Sierra Club raised this argument in its opposition to EPA's motion for summary judgment,\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6209106\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/837/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    , the Court will deny Sierra Club's motion for leave to file a surreply, ECF No. 18. A \"surreply is not a vehicle for rehashing arguments that have already been raised and briefed by the parties.\"\n    <em>\n     Crummey v. Soc. Sec.

Cir. Feb. 6, 2012). Turning to the argument itself, there is no doubt that \"[t]he APA's waiver of sovereign immunity applies to any suit whether under the APA or not.\"\n    <em>\n     Chamber of Commerce of U.S. v.

It does not \"affect[ ] other limitations on judicial review or the power or duty of the court to dismiss any action or deny relief on any other appropriate legal or equitable ground.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n     5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
