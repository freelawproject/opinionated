Andujar\"), Badge # 8-16959, has been a\n   PRPD officer in the Fajardo Criminal Investigations Corps (\"CIC\") since 2015, where he currently oversees the Arrests and Searches Division. He has supervised over 500 arrests during his career. Sgt. Andujar was tasked with locating and arresting Chris Garc\u00eda (\"Garc\u00eda\"), who had an outstanding arrest warrant issued by the Commonwealth Court of Fajardo, Puerto Rico, for violation of controlled substances law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sgt. Andujar did not know Garc\u00eda, nor his whereabouts, and the arrest warrant does not specify Garc\u00eda's address or residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On May 9, 2017, homicide agents from the Fajardo CIC Division contacted Sgt. Andujar to inform him that they were debriefing an arrestee who claimed to have information regarding Garc\u00eda's whereabouts. Sgt. Andujar then checked the NCIC system and verified that the arrest warrant for Garc\u00eda was valid and outstanding. Early in the afternoon of May 9, Sgt. Andujar went to the R\u00edo Grande Police Station and debriefed the individual, who informed him-in a confidential manner-that Garc\u00eda was living in Finca Galateo Public Housing Project (\"Finca Galateo\"). The confidential source said that Garc\u00eda was staying in three different residences in Finca Galateo and would not stay in the same place every night because his life would be in danger if people found out where he slept. One of the residences was on Street # 8, another on Street # 5, and another on Street # 2 within Finca Gataleo. The confidential informant also told him that Garc\u00eda had a weapon. Sgt. Andujar did not take notes of the debriefing to instill confidence in and protect the identity of the informant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On that same day, Sgt. Andujar went, with a fellow officer, to Finca Galateo to corroborate the information, locate the three residences, and set up surveillance. He first went to the residence on Street # 8, but did not see anything. He then followed Street # 8 and turned left onto Street # 5. On Street # 5, close to the front of the administration building of Finca Galateo, he observed Garc\u00eda peer his head out of the doorway of residence J-2 to observe Sgt. Andujar's car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reportedly, when Garc\u00eda saw Sgt. Andujar's car, ducked inside the residence, and closed the door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sgt. Andujar observed Garc\u00eda from a distance of approximately 25 feet, during the daytime, for approximately 5 or 6 seconds. Sgt. Andujar was familiar with Garc\u00eda's description because he had been searching for him for a while, and he recognized Garc\u00eda from two pictures provided by the police officer that had filed the state drug trafficking charges that led to the issuance of the arrest warrant against him.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibits 2 and 3\n   </strong>\n   . Sgt. Andujar had also visited the residence of Garc\u00eda's mother, who had corroborated that the two photos were of Garc\u00eda. During his testimony, Sgt. Andujar observed that in one of the pictures,\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 2\n   </strong>\n   , Garc\u00eda had a darker skin tone. On May 9, 2017, Garc\u00eda had a darker skin tone, similar to the one shown in\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 2\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Sgt. Andujar decided he could not arrest Garc\u00eda at that moment because there were people walking around the neighborhood and the drug point was active. The drug point is across the street from the administration building, about 50-60 feet from the\n   J-2 residence. Sgt. Andujar had visited Finca Galateo on many occasions because it is a well-known high-crime area. During one of his visits, individuals had opened fire on Sgt. Andujar and other officers, and they had exchanged fire. On that occasion, the officers arrested one individual and seized two assault rifles and ammunitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After deciding not to arrest Garc\u00eda, Sgt. Andujar located the third residence mentioned by the confidential informant, located on Street # 2. He then left the housing project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After consulting the matter with fellow officers, Sgt. Andujar created a work plan to arrest Garc\u00eda at Finca Galateo. Sgt. Andujar did not obtain a search warrant because the plan was not to search the three houses. Instead, the PRPD officers were to knock on the doors of the residences, identify themselves, explain the purpose of their visit, and ask for permission to enter the house and check if Garc\u00eda was present. The working plan included Garc\u00eda's name, the information contained in the arrest warrant, and the addresses of the three residences. Sgt. Andujar explained that this is the PRPD's policy, so that the PRPD officers are organized and everyone knows their role. The plan also included the address and information of nearby hospitals, in case there was an emergency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On May 10, 2017, the officers that were to execute Sgt. Andujar's work plan began their shift at 4:00 a.m. Sgt. Andujar divided the officers into three groups, and each group was to visit one of the houses. Sgt. Andujar's group was to visit the house on Street # 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second witness, Wilder Llanos-Torres, (\"Agent Llanos\") Badge # 23777, has worked for the PRPD for 21 years. He is assigned to the Fajardo CIC, where he has worked for 5 years. His responsibilities include arresting individuals for whom an arrest warrant has been issued, and he has participated in over 100 arrests. On May 10, 2017, Agent Llanos began his shift at 4:00 a.m. and Sgt. Andujar-his immediate supervisor-assigned him to provide support to a group of officers that were to execute the working plan to arrest Garc\u00eda. Agent Llanos was tasked with providing support and security to his fellow officers and any civilians in and around the houses that they were to visit. Sgt. Andujar advised the officers that he believed that Garc\u00eda was carrying a firearm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Agent Llanos testified that, pursuant to the instructions and working plan prepared by Sgt. Andujar, the PRPD Agents were to visit three houses in Finca Galateo. Their instructions were to survey the residences assigned to them, talk to the people who lived there and ask them if they could search the house for Garc\u00eda, and arrest Garc\u00eda if he was found. They were instructed to arrest any person that attempted to flee. Agent Llanos was to visit the house on Street # 5, along with Officers \u00c1ngel Puig, \u00c1ngel Acevedo, and Jorge Cruz. Agent Llanos wore khaki pants, a blue polo, a bullet-proof vest, and his police identification badge. He familiarized himself with the likeness of Mr. Garc\u00eda through two photos provided by Sgt. Andujar.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibits 2 and 3\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On May 10, 2017, at around 6:00 a.m., Sgt. Andujar arrived at the residence on Street # 8, knocked on the door and spoke with the people present. He corroborated that Garc\u00eda was not there. Sgt. Andujar then went to the J-2 residence on Street # 5, where Agent Llanos and another officer were stationed. Sgt. Andujar's group left their vehicles in front of the residence on Street # 5 and walked over to the residence on Street # 2, knocked at the door, and explained that they were looking for Garc\u00eda. The residents granted him access to the residence, but Garc\u00eda was not\n   there. He then received a call from Agent Llanos, who told him that he did not find Garc\u00eda at the J-2 residence, but that they had arrested someone with a weapon. Sgt. Andujar then left the residence # 2, went to street # 5 to supervise, and spoke with Agent Llanos, who told him that he had observed through the window a man that matched Garc\u00eda's description, and arrested him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The PRPD Agents arrived at Finca Galateo at around 6:00 a.m., when the sun had begun to rise but it was not yet daylight. Agent Llanos described the house on street # 5 as a one-level concrete residence, with a carport on its right side with a car inside, a front door to the left of the carport, and white, aluminum windows along the left front of the house. Upon arriving at the front of the house, the officers walked to the front door, crossing the street and the front lawn, which was unfenced and accessible from the sidewalk. Within a minute of arriving at Street # 5, the rest of the agents positioned themselves in front of the door, which was closed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Agent Llanos positioned himself close to the windows to the left of the front door, approximately 12 inches away from them, close enough to look inside the residence because the windows were open.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 4 (marked by Agent Llanos)\n   </strong>\n   . From the window, and before any agents knocked on the door or announced their presence, Agent Llanos observed inside the residence a man walking along the hallway towards the door and living room, about ten feet away from him. The man was wearing a red hooded sweater with the hood over his head. Agent Llanos could not see the man's face, nor determine his skin tone. At the time, he could not determine if the man was Garc\u00eda, but Agent Llanos observed that he had a similar, slender build to Garc\u00eda's. He further observed that the man-based on his experience as a police officer-was carrying a dark weapon in his right hand. Llanos testified that he was able to see the individual because the kitchen light was on, behind and to the left of the individual.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 5\n   </strong>\n   . Agent Llanos believed that at the time it was not possible to knock on the door and ask the man for identification or if he had a valid weapons license. At the time, Agent Llanos did not know if the man possessed a weapons permit, and he did not know if the man was Garc\u00eda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon seeing the weapon, Agent Llanos alerted his fellow officers and exclaimed, \"He's got a gun.\" One of the fellow officers immediately yelled \"Police\" and Agent Puig kicked open the front door to access the interior of the house. Agent Llanos drew his weapon and entered the house first, followed by his fellow officers, \"to arrest the individual [he] saw with the firearm.\" The man inside the house turned around and ran away from the officers, down the hallway toward the back of the house, and went into a room at the end of the hallway, on the right. Agent Llanos followed the man down the hallway, never losing sight of him, and saw him toss the firearm into a clothes hamper located inside the room, immediately to the left of the doorway. The man then stepped to the middle of the room, and raised his hands. Agent Llanos commanded the man to lay down on the ground and place his hands behind his back. The man complied, and Agent Llanos arrested and handcuffed him. He searched the man, removed the hoodie, and corroborated that he was not Garc\u00eda. Agent Llanos arrested the man because he was in possession of a firearm, but at that moment, he did not ask if he had a permit for the firearm. He read him his rights in the room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The man was wearing jeans, tennis shoes, and a t-shirt under his jacket. Agent Llanos asked the individual he had just arrested for his name and residence, but\n   the man declined to provide the information. During the hearing, Agent Llanos identified the man he had arrested as defendant Daniel Torres-Viruet (\"Torres\"). After his arrest, Torres was advised of his rights. When Agent Llanos performed a security pat-down on Torres, he found a large amount of cash on his person.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 9\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   At the time, Torres did not provide his name or explain why he was inside the house. He only said he was sleeping, but never specified where he was sleeping. Agent Llanos did not observe pillows, sheets, or clothing on the living room sofa, which did not look like it was being used.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 10-13\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Agent Llanos then immediately went to the hamper and found the weapon, which was visible in plain sight and laying on top of the clothes. He took a picture of the weapon with his cellphone before seizing it.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 6\n   </strong>\n   . The weapon was a revolver, painted dark purple, and it was loaded with six rounds. Upon closer inspection, Agent Llanos identified the gun as a .38 caliber.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   While arresting Torres, Agent Llanos noticed there was a woman in the bedroom, sitting on the bed. She appeared anxious and scared, and wore sleeping clothes, a spaghetti-strap blouse and shorts. There was also a minor in the room, who was around 4 or 5 years old. Agent Llanos observed that the bed was half made, and the covers were thrown to one side, as if the woman had been covered with them and threw them to one side. It did not appear to Agent Llanos that another person was sleeping in the bed. There was another minor in the house, approximately 12 years old, who was sleeping in the room adjacent to the carport and closer to the entrance door, on the right side of the hallway.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 7\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   After the arrest and seizure, Agent Llanos spoke with the woman, who identified herself as Jocelyn Caraballo-Solivan (\"Caraballo\") and said she was the principal tenant of the house and the mother of the two minors. Agent Llanos asked her if she knew the man he had just arrested. Caraballo answered that she had no relationship with the arrested individual, but that she recognized him from the housing project and knew him by the alias \"Kripi/Crippy.\" She said she did not know how or why the man was there. When Agent Llanos asked her about Garc\u00eda, she said she did not know anything about Chris Garc\u00eda.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Agent Llanos also observed in the room tennis shoes and clothes that looked like they belonged to a man. When he asked Caraballo about these items, she replied that they belonged to a friend who visited her once in a while.\n   <strong>\n    Exhibit 8\n   </strong>\n   . Agent Llanos did not ask her about the firearm, and she did not say anything about the revolver. Agent Llanos then took more pictures of the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Agent Llanos then took Torres outside to one of the PRPD vehicles and called Sgt. Andujar to inform him of the arrest. After receiving the call from Agent Llanos, Sgt. Andujar headed over to the J-2 residence and saw Torres outside, with Agent Llanos. Sgt. Andujar testified that, at a glance, Torres looked like Garc\u00eda, as they were both slender, had the same height, and similar skin color. He had not seen Torres before that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sgt. Andujar spoke with Caraballo outside the residence, and she seemed a bit nervous, given the circumstances. He asked her if she knew the man who was arrested in her residence, and she replied that she had seen him in the housing project and that he would visit her on occasion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Sgt. Andujar asked her if she\n   knew Garc\u00eda, she said that she knew Garc\u00eda because he was born and raised in that housing project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Eventually, Agent Llanos left with Torres for the Fajardo police station. Garc\u00eda was not located on May 10, 2017, but was arrested approximately a month later.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Testimony of Jocelyn Caraballo\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Jocelyn Caraballo lives in house J-2, Street # 5 of Finca Galateo Housing Project in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. She testified that she rents the house from the Puerto Rico Government, although she does not pay rent, just utilities. She further testified that she lives there with her two sons and defendant Torres.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Caraballo has known Torres for three years, and is friends with him. She has authorized Torres to stay at her residence, and on May 10, 2017, he had permission to stay there. In response to questioning, she admitted that although the rental agreement states who can reside in the house and prohibits guests from staying for extended periods, she did not inform the government that Torres was living with her on May 10, 2017.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   She testified that Torres slept on the sofa in the living room, and that each night she would leave a blanket and pillow for him, which she put away each morning. Torres also kept some personal items and clothes in her bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Torres had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the J-2 residence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The government first challenges Torres's standing to assert a Fourth Amendment violation and argues that Torres has failed to show that he was an authorized guest at the residence, that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the bedroom where the firearm was seized, or that the seized firearm was his property.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 26\n   </strong>\n   at 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\" U.S. Const. amend. IV. To successfully claim that a search or seizure \"violated the Fourth Amendment, a defendant must show as a threshold matter that he had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place or item searched.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

At the evidentiary hearing, Caraballo testified that she had authorized Torres to stay at her residence over several weeks, and that on May 10, 2017 he had permission to stay there. Thus, in the light most favorable to defendant and for purposes of his claim, the Court finds that Torres had a legitimate expectation of privacy at the J-2 residence during the morning of May 10, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   During the hearing, the government argued that Torres could not have had a legitimate expectation of privacy at the J-2 house because, per the terms of the rental agreement, Caraballo cannot authorize him to reside there. The Court ordered the government to submit cases from the District of Puerto Rico where the government successfully argued that the defendant was not authorized to live in subsidized housing pursuant to the rental agreement with the Puerto Rico Government. The government complied and submitted two cases for the Court's consideration:\n   <em>\n    United States v. Joshua Valle-Col\u00f3n, et al.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    Crim.

Torres's situation is distinguishable from the cases cited in support of the ruling in\n   <em>\n    Rodr\u00edguez-Gonz\u00e1lez\n   </em>\n   . In the case at bar, Caraballo admitted during her testimony that she was aware\n   that the rental agreement prohibits guests from staying for extended periods, and that she had no authority to authorize Torres to live at the residence for an extended period of time. And, Caraballo did not inform the government that Torres was living with her on May 10, 2017. She also gave contradictory testimony as to how long Torres had lived at the residence, and did not clarify if he stayed there every night.

The motion to suppress fails on the merits.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Torres moves the Court to suppress the evidence seized from the J-2 residence and his person on several grounds.

Second, Torres argues that the PRPD lacked probable cause to arrest him.\n   <strong>\n    ECF No. 23\n   </strong>\n   at 10.
