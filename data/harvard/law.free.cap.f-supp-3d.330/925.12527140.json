WOODS, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff Carlos Davila is the founder of A New Beginning for Immigrant's Rights, Inc. (\"A New Beginning\"), an immigrants' rights organization. Through A New Beginning, Davila participated in the Department of Justice's Recognition and Accreditation Program, which permitted him to represent individuals in immigration proceedings as a non-attorney. In 2017, several news outlets reported negative stories about A New Beginning and Davila, and U.S. Representative Nydia Vel\u00e1zquez responded by committing that she would revoke Davila's accreditation through the Recognition and Accreditation Program. Later, Davila's accreditation was revoked because the Department of Justice learned that he had been convicted of first-degree manslaughter in 1988.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Davila seeks to hold the United States and Representative Vel\u00e1zquez (collectively, the \"Federal Defendants\") liable for injuries that he allegedly suffered resulting from the revocation of his accreditation and from public statements made by Representative Vel\u00e1zquez in connection therewith. Specifically, Davila brings claims for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and invasion of privacy. Davila also asserts that his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated and that the revocation of his accreditation was arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"). The United States, on behalf of the Federal Defendants, moves to dismiss all of the claims against the Federal Defendants pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim on which relief may be granted. For the reasons that follow, the Federal Defendants' motion to dismiss is GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Unlike\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   , Davila's claims did not include any form of search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment, nor did his claims include anything that could be construed to constitute cruel and unusual punishment towards Davila. While the\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   action brought in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   included a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment, that claim was substantially different than the due process claim brought by Davila under the Fourteenth Amendment. The claim in\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   related to gender discrimination in the workplace, whereas the claim\n   in the instant case relates to the revocation of a government accreditation. In addition, none of the aforementioned scenarios in which a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy has been permitted include any alleged First Amendment violations or any alleged infringement on expression or speech. Thus, Davila's due process claims under the First and Fourteenth Amendments implicate a new context for the application of a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Because Davila's claim presents a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   context, the Court must analyze whether special factors counsel hesitation in expanding\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   \"in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12604999\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/137/1843/#p1857\">\n    137 S.Ct. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1857 (citing\n   <em>\n    Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180250\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/14/\">\n    446 U.S. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180250\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/446/14/\">\n    100 S.Ct. 1468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). The Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Ziglar\n   </em>\n   explained that the \"special factors\" inquiry \"must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.

That is, a court begins with the premise that the Judiciary should not readily extend a\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   remedy to new claims, and before a court does so, it should consider a number of factors to determine whether \"Congress would want the Judiciary to entertain a damages suit in a given case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Among those factors is whether alternative remedies exist for addressing the constitutional violations raised by the claims of a particular case. The Supreme Court suggested that \"if there is an alternative remedial structure present in a certain case, that alone may limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In this case, Davila asserts a claim under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the First Amendment arising out of the revocation of his accreditation under the R &amp; A program and critical statements issued by Representative Vel\u00e1zquez.

The provision within the modified guidelines requiring disclosure that Davila cites is limited only to events occurring after August 28, 2000, and the modified provisions in Section 1292.12(a)(5) -the section under which Davila was terminated-contain no such time limit. From the lack of such a time limit, the Court can infer that the modified guideline was intended to apply to any \"serious crimes\" committed by the individual at any time, even those which occurred prior to the enactment of the new guidelines in December 2016. Because the plain language of the applicable regulation, which envisions retroactive application, allows OLAP to terminate a person who has been convicted of a felony, and OLAP terminated Davila because he was convicted of a felony, as set forth in the May 10, 2017 letter to Davila, the Court concludes that OLAP examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for its action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Farm\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p42\">\n    463 U.S. at 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6190630\" index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/29/#p42\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2856\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

DOJ articulated at length the bases for its rulemaking, including stating specifically that \"[r]egarding those convicted of a serious crime, this prohibition supplements the character and fitness requirement, as the Department has determined that individuals with serious crimes are not qualified to be accredited.
