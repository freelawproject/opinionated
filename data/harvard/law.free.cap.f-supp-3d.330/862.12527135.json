(\"NBTY\"), and NatureSmart LLC, alleging\n   that Defendants' labeling of their \"Ester-C\" vitamin C supplements as \"The Better Vitamin C\" is unlawful, deceptive, and misbranded. On September 30, 2016, the Court denied Plaintiffs' motion to certify a nationwide class, as well as California and Missouri subclasses. Pending before the Court is Defendants' motion for summary judgment as to Plaintiffs' individual claims. For the reasons set forth below, the Court grants Defendants' motion for summary judgment in its entirety and dismisses this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

(Defendants' 56.1 Statement (\"Defs.' 56.1\"), Dkt. 163, \u00b6 4.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to Plaintiffs, misrepresentations in Ester-C's packaging and marketing create a reasonable expectation with purchasers that Ester-C provides a form of immune system defense that protects users from illnesses, and decreases one's likelihood of getting or remaining ill. (Amended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\"), Dkt. 13, at \u00b6\u00b6 2, 25; Plaintiff's Memorandum in Opposition to Partial Summary Judgment, (\"Pl. Mem.\") Dkt. 71, at ECF 6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) There is no dispute that NBTY manufactures and sells dietary supplements under the trademark \"Ester-C\u00ae\", that Ester-C products are sold in various forms, including tablets, gummies, and powder, and that the suggested retail price for Ester-C has been as low as 7 cents per grain and as high as 75 cents per gram. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6\u00b6 1-7.) While evidence of the amount of damages in the forrn of a price premium is disputed by the parties, it is not disputed that the amount in controversy for that price premium, as to Plaintiff Hughes's and Plaintiff Hodjat's individual purchases of Ester-C products, does not amount to $75,000. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 8 to Plaintiffs' (\"Pl.\") 56.1, Dkt. 170-1, \u00b6 8 (Sealed).)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Plaintiffs do not dispute that they have adduced no extrinsic evidence of how consumers actually interpret Ester-C's \"immune support\" representation in isolation. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 19.) Plaintiffs have produced\n   no expert testimony or report concerning the immune benefits of vitamin C or lack thereof, the ability or inability of vitamin C to treat or prevent the common cold or influenza virus, or the relative bioavailability or absorbability of Ester-C and other forms of vitamin C, such as ascorbic acid. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 29). Plaintiffs proffer only a webpage on the servers of Oregon State University\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a journal article by Carol S. Johnston &amp; Bing Luo,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   purportedly showing that vitamin C from Ester-C was not more \"bioavailable\" than simple ascorbic acid, and that there are conflicting studies as to whether Vitamin C enhances immune function. (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 17; Defs.' 56.1 Response to Pl. Additional Statement of Material Facts, Dkt. 167, \u00b6\u00b6 1-9; Plaintiffs' Memorandum of Law, (\"Pl. Opp. Br.\"), Dkt. 170 (Sealed), at ECF 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Plaintiffs never testified that they saw or relied upon any of the purported implied disease claims on NBTY's website. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 67; Hodjat Dep. at 120:18-21, 192:6-193:6; Hughes Dep. at 77:5-7, 104:7-8; Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 69.) Plaintiff Hughes testified that he had already made up his mind to purchase Ester-C when he entered the store on the date of his sole purchase. (Defs.' 56.1 \u00b6 60, Hughes Dep. at 77:5-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Instant Motion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants filed the instant motion for summary judgment on January 19, 2018. (Dkt. 161.) Plaintiffs filed their opposition, under seal, on February 26, 2018. In it, Plaintiffs withdrew their common law claims for intentional and negligent misrepresentation. (Pl. Opp. Brief, Dkt. 170, at 10, n. 7.) Defendants filed their Reply Memorandum Brief with the Court earlier, on January 19, 2018, noting Plaintiffs' withdrawal of these claims. (Dkt. 166.) Thus, the remaining claims in this action are Plaintiffs' individual claims,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging: (1) as to Plaintiff Hodjat, violations of California's Consumer Legal Remedies Act (\"CLRA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201750\">\n    Cal.

To state a claim under the MMPA, a plaintiff must show that (1) [he] purchased the merchandise in question; (2) [he] purchased the merchandise for personal, family, or household use; (3) [he] suffered an ascertainable loss; and (4) the ascertainable loss was the result of an unfair practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Bryan v.

Thus, Plaintiffs' false advertising and misrepresentation claims under Missouri and California law share the following core elements: (1) that Defendants' labeling conveyed the allegedly false or misleading implied statements; (2) that the implied statements are, in fact, false or misleading;\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) that the implied statements were the motivating cause of Plaintiffs' purchase decisions; and (4) that Plaintiffs suffered damages or economic injury, here, in the form of a price premium.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Plaintiffs Cannot Demonstrate that Ester-C's Labeling Conveyed the Alleged Implied Disease Claims\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs' false advertising and misrepresentation claims are based on the following allegedly false implied statements: (1) \"immune support\" statements that, when viewed in combination with other statements contained in the labeling of Ester-C, convey the false message that Ester-C is capable of preventing or treating influenza or the common cold (Pl. 56.1 \u00b6 19); and (2) \"The Better Vitamin C \u00ae\" slogan that, in context, conveys a false message that Ester-C is more effectively absorbed into the human body than ascorbic acid. (Pl. Opp. Br. at ECF 12, 20-21.) Because Plaintiffs provide no evidence that a reasonable consumer perceived Defendants' labeling as conveying these implied disease claims, they cannot prove the first element of their false advertising and misrepresentation causes of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Under the CLRA, UCL, FAL, and MMPA, it is not enough for a plaintiff to assert, based on his or her own subjective belief that a statement on the defendant's label conveyed the alleged implied message.
