Humetewa, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This insurance coverage dispute is before the Court on cross-motions for summary judgment. Plaintiff, 757BD LLC (\"757BD\"), has moved for summary judgment, arguing that Defendant, National Union Fire Insurance Company of Pittsburgh (\"National\"), breached its contractual duty to defend and indemnify its insured, Aero Jet Services, LLC (\"Aero Jet\"), in connection with a lawsuit by 757BD against Aero Jet. (Doc. 60). National has cross-moved for summary judgment/partial summary judgment, arguing that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify Aero Jet on the claims against it by 757BD. (Doc. 62). Each party has filed separate statements of facts supporting their Motions (Docs. 61 and 63) and controverting statements of facts in response to the opposing party's facts. (Docs. 67 and 69). National filed a Response in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion and a Reply in Support of its Motion. (Docs. 68 and 73). 757BD filed a Response to Defendant's Motion and a Reply Memorandum in Support of Plaintiff's Motion. (Docs. 66 and 72).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This Court now denies 757BD's Motion for Summary Judgment and grants National's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The issue in this case arises out of a January 11, 2005, Aircraft Purchase Agreement for a 1989 Astra Jet aircraft. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 3; Doc. 69 \u00b6 3; Doc. 61-3). Plaintiff 757BD was the purchaser and non-party Brett Jet, LLC (\"Brett Jet\") was the seller. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 3; Doc. 69 \u00b6 3). Aero Jet is a company that \"manages, maintains and operates aircraft owned by other[s].\" (Doc. 61 \u00b6 5; Doc. 69 \u00b6 5). Defendant National issued two Gold Medallion Comprehensive Business Aircraft insurance policies\n   to Aero Jet. (Doc. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2; Doc. 61-1; Doc. 61-2). Plaintiff 757BD seeks insurance coverage from National for its claims against Aero Jet. (Doc. 1-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Aircraft Purchase and Corrosion Discovery\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to a January 11, 2005, Aircraft Purchase Agreement, Plaintiff 757BD agreed to purchase, and Brett Jet agreed to sell, a 1989 Astra Jet Aircraft (the \"Aircraft\"). The Aircraft Purchase Agreement was \"subject to an Inspection and test flight of the aircraft to occur on or before January 21, 2005.\" (Doc. 61-3, Article 3). Following the test flight, 757BD was to \"either reject the condition of the Aircraft or accept the condition of the Aircraft.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiff states that, on or around January 17, 2005, \"before 757BD took delivery of the Aircraft,\" an Aero Jet mechanic \"looked at and reviewed the Aircraft for and on behalf of 757BD.\" (Doc. 61 \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On January 21, 2005, 757BD and Aero Jet entered into a Management Services Agreement under which Aero Jet would provide services, including maintenance services for the Aircraft, to 757BD. (Doc. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10; Doc. 69 \u00b6\u00b6 9, 10). The Aircraft was delivered to Aero Jet's facilities that same day, January 21, 2005. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 8; Doc. 69 \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On November 1, 2005, during a routine inspection, Aero Jet discovered bubbling paint on the Aircraft's wing surfaces. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 12; Doc. 69 \u00b6 12). Based on the bubbling paint, Aero Jet informed 757BD that there was corrosion on the Aircraft and that inspection was needed. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 13; Doc. 69 \u00b6 13). The corrosion was found to have damaged the wing panels by consuming the metal and by compromising the Aircraft's structural integrity. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 20; Doc. 69 \u00b6 20). Expert analysis suggested that the corrosion was caused by \"exposure to chloride-based paint stripper when the Aircraft was repainted in 2002 by Duncan Aviation.\" (Doc. 61 \u00b6 18; Doc. 69 \u00b6 18). 757BD alleges that repair and maintenance costs in connection with the Aircraft were $865,935.86 and that it \"lost income and incurred other damages as a result of the loss of use of the Aircraft while repairs were being made.\" (Doc. 61 \u00b6\u00b6 21, 22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Insurance Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   National, as insurer, issued to Aero Jet, as insured, two Gold Medallion Comprehensive Business Aircraft policies. (Doc. 61-1; Doc. 61-2). The first policy, GM 1853858-01, was effective from January 30, 2005, through April 30, 2006. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 35; Doc. 67 \u00b6 35). The second policy, GM 1853858-02, was effective from April 30, 2006, through April 30, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Aircraft was considered a \"scheduled\" aircraft under both policies. (Doc. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37; Doc. 67 \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Both policies, under \"Coverage A - Liability for Scheduled Aircraft,\" state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   The Company will promptly pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury and property damage caused by an occurrence during the policy period arising out of the ownership, maintenance or use of a scheduled aircraft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Doc. 63 \u00b6 38; Doc. 67 \u00b6 38; Doc. 61-1 at 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Both policies' relevant definitions state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Property Damage\" means accidental damage to or destruction of the tangible property of others caused by an occurrence during the policy period and the resultant loss of use of the property. Property damage also includes the loss of use of the tangible property of others that is not physically damaged but that is caused by an occurrence during the policy period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   (Doc. 63 \u00b6 39; Doc. 67 \u00b6 39; Doc. 61-1 at 21).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Occurrence\" means an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the insured. However, the definition will include bodily injury or property damage resulting from the efforts to prevent dangerous interference with any covered aircraft operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Doc. 63 \u00b6 40; Doc. 67 \u00b6 40; 61-1 at 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Superior Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 30, 2008, 757BD brought suit in Maricopa County Superior Court against Duncan Aviation, Brett Jet, and Aero Jet (the \"Underlying Action\"). (Doc. 61-5 at 45). Brett Jet was dismissed from the Underlying Action based on lack of personal jurisdiction. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 45; Doc. 67 \u00b6 45). Duncan was dismissed from the Underlying Action pursuant to a $225,000 settlement agreement. (Doc. 63 \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47; Doc. 67 \u00b6\u00b6 46, 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Claims against Aero Jet included Count VI for Breach of Contract; Count VII for Breach of Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing; Count VIII for Breach of Fiduciary Duty; and Count IX for Fraud, Misrepresentation, and/or Negligent Misrepresentation. (Doc. 61-5 at 52-54). Count VIII for Breach of Fiduciary Duty focused on Aero Jet's alleged actions as the broker of the sale of the Aircraft; specifically, it alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   65. Defendant Aero Jet brokered the sale between Plaintiff 757BD and Defendant Brett Jet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   66. As the broker, Defendant Aero Jet owed a fiduciary obligation to obtain and disclose all material information to Plaintiff 757BD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   67. Defendant Aero Jet was aware of the repairs and paint job performed by Defendant Duncan and knew or should have known of the Aircraft's true condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   68. Defendant Aero Jet failed to provide such material information to Plaintiff 757BD.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   69. As a result of Aero Jet's breach of fiduciary duty, Plaintiff 757BD sustained significant damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (Doc. 61-5 at 53-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Count IX for Fraud, Misrepresentation, and/or Negligent Misrepresentation similarly focused on alleged misrepresentations by Aero Jet, which allegedly led to 757BD's purchase of the Aircraft; Count IX states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   71. Defendant Aero Jet knew or should have known of the Aircraft's true condition and of Defendant Duncan's work performed on the Aircraft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   72. Defendant Aero Jet represented to Plaintiff 757BD that the Aircraft was in normal working condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   73. Defendant Aero Jet provided Plaintiff 757BD with logs, service manuals and records reflecting that the Aircraft was in a normal working condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   74. However, the Aircraft was not in a normal working condition, but rather in an excessively corrosive condition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   75. By representing to Plaintiff 757BD that the Aircraft was in a normal working condition, Defendant Aero Jet intended for Plaintiff 757BD to purchase the Aircraft despite the fact that it was in a state of excessive corrosion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   76. Plaintiff 757BD, unaware of the Aircraft's true condition, reasonably relied on Defendant Aero Jet's\n   material misrepresentation and purchased the Aircraft.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   77. As a result of Defendant Aero Jet's misrepresentation, Plaintiff 757BD sustained significant damage.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   (Doc. 61-5 at 53-54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   National denied coverage and declined to defend Aero Jet based upon asserted lack of \"property damage,\" lack of an \"occurrence,\" lack of a triggering event during the policy period, and applicability of a care, custody or control exclusion. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 44; Doc. 67 \u00b6 44).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On February 29, 2012, in the Underlying Action, 757BD and Aero Jet submitted a Stipulation Regarding Entry of Judgment Against Aero Jet. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 49; Doc. 67 \u00b6 49). The Stipulation provided that the superior court could enter judgment in favor of 757BD and against Aero Jet \"based on the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action (Count VIII of the Complaint) and the negligent misrepresentation cause of action (Count IX of the Complaint).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In the superior court's March 5, 2012, judgment, the court directed entry of judgment in favor of 757BD and against Aero Jet in the amount of $591,496.61. (Doc. 63 \u00b6 50; Doc. 67 \u00b6 50). This stipulated judgment and subsequent order of judgment were entered pursuant to an agreement between 757BD and Aero Jet under which Aero Jet assigned to 757BD all of its rights, claims, and causes of action against National, in exchange for 757BD's agreement not to execute on the judgment against Aero Jet. (Doc. 61 \u00b6 30; Doc. 63 \u00b6 48).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    D. District Court Litigation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   On February 19, 2014, 757BD filed a declaratory judgment action against National in Maricopa County Superior Court. (Doc. 1-1). The action was subsequently removed to federal district court. (Doc. 1). Plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint on October 7, 2016. (Doc. 38). The Amended Complaint alleges two counts against Defendant: Count One for Declaratory Judgment and Count Two for Breach of Contract. (Doc. 38 at 4-5). The parties have now filed cross-motions for summary judgment regarding National's insurance coverage obligations. (Doc. 60; Doc. 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Legal Standards\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Summary judgment is appropriate where \"the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.

The buyers argued that the incident \"giving rise to the litigation\" was the \"roof leakage caused by snow blowing into the roof vents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.

Therefore, even though there was damage to the property, because the sellers' actions, as alleged in the complaint, did not cause the property damage, there was no insurance coverage.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under the terms of the Stipulation Regarding Entry of Judgment in the Underlying Action, judgment was entered against Aero Jet on Count VIII, based upon breach of fiduciary duty, and on Count IX, based upon negligent misrepresentation. (Doc. 61-5 at 27-28). Neither Count VIII nor Count IX contained allegations supporting the argument that property damage was caused by either the breach of fiduciary duty or the negligent misrepresentation. Instead, the allegations of both counts focused on Aero Jet's actions as the alleged broker for the sale of the Aircraft, on 757BD's reliance on Aero Jet when 757BD purchased the Aircraft, and on 757BD's financial losses as a result of the breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation. For example, Count VIII for breach of fiduciary duty alleged that Aero Jet brokered the sale, that \"[a]s the broker, Defendant Aero Jet owed a fiduciary obligation to obtain and disclose all material information to Plaintiff 757BD,\" that Aero Jet knew of the repair and knew or should have known of the Aircraft's true condition, that Aero Jet failed to provide that material information, and that 757BD\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   sustained significant damage as a result of this breach of fiduciary duty. (Doc. 61-5). Similarly, Count IX for misrepresentation alleged that Aero Jet knew or should have known of the Aircraft's true condition; that, \"[b]y representing to Plaintiff 757BD that the Aircraft was in a normal working condition, Defendant Aero Jet intended for Plaintiff 757BD to purchase the Aircraft despite the fact that it was in a state of excessive corrosion,\" and that \"Plaintiff 757BD, unaware of the Aircraft's true condition, reasonably relied on Defendant Aero Jet's material misrepresentation and purchased the Aircraft.\" All of these allegations reflect the claim that 757BD suffered an economic loss due to the alleged misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. As reasoned by the\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   court, the harm here is not the damage to the airplane caused by the corrosion; instead, the alleged harm is the misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty. Therefore, because the policy covers only property damage and there was no alleged property damage in this case that was caused by the insured's actions, there is no duty to indemnify.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   There is particularly no duty to indemnify for Counts VIII and IX because the allegations in those counts address events regarding the sale of the Aircraft, which all took place before the effective date of the insurance policies. The Aircraft Purchase Agreement was dated January 11, 2005; the Aircraft was allegedly inspected and test-flown by an Aero Jet representative on January 17, 2005; Aero Jet and 757BD entered into an Aircraft services agreement on January 21, 2005; and the Aircraft was delivered to Aero Jet on January 21, 2005. While the Complaint does not specify the date of the alleged misrepresentations, because the purchase must have been complete before the Aircraft was delivered to Aero Jet to maintain for 757BD on January 21, 2005, the alleged misrepresentations and breach of fiduciary duty leading to the sale must have occurred by that time. The first policy, however, was not effective until January 30, 2005. Therefore, because the policy only covers property damage \"caused by an occurrence during the policy period,\" even if the damages caused by the alleged misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty could somehow be construed as \"property damage,\" that damage occurred before the policy's effective date and there is no coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Last, there was also no duty to defend Aero Jet under the insurance policy. To determine whether there is a duty to defend Aero Jet, the Court must consider the legal claims against Aero Jet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Teufel v. American Family Mutual Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=244%20Ariz.%20383\">\n    244 Ariz. 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567790\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/546/#p548\">\n    419 P.3d 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 548-49 (2018). The duty to defend, which is broader than the duty to indemnify, \"generally arises if the complaint filed against the insured alleges facts that fall within the policy's coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567790\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/546/#p548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567790\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/546/#p548\">\n    at 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"[I]f any claims fall within policy coverage, the insurer must defend against all claims, including claims potentially not covered and\n   those that are groundless, false, or fraudulent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567790\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/546/#p548\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12567790\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/p3d/419/546/#p548\">\n    at 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotations omitted). In the Underlying Action, Aero Jet admitted liability for Breach of Fiduciary Duty and for Fraud, Misrepresentation, and/or Negligent Misrepresentation. (Doc. 61-5 at 27-28). As discussed above, there is no coverage for these claims because the claimed property damage was not a result of the misrepresentations and breach of fiduciary duty. Consistent with this, because the lack of coverage was apparent from the allegations in the Complaint, there was no duty to defend based on these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In the Complaint, there were two additional claims against Aero Jet: Breach of Contract and Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing. (Doc. 61-5 at 52-53). There was also no duty to defend based upon these claims. The Breach of Contract claim was based upon alleged failure to provide 757BD with logs and records in connection with operation and maintenance of the Aircraft, particularly the \"records and reports pertaining to Defendant Duncan's repairs and paint job on the Aircraft.\" (Doc. 61-5 at 52 \u00b6 55). The Breach of the Implied Covenant of Good Faith and Fair Dealing claim similarly focused upon Aero Jet's alleged failure \"to disclose its knowledge of the repairs and paint job performed by Defendant Duncan and its knowledge of the Aircraft's true condition.\" (Doc. 61-5 at 53 \u00b6 62).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   There is first no duty to defend these claims because they are breach of contract claims, which generally do not fit within the definition of occurrence under an insurance policy. In the policy, \"occurrence\" is defined as \"an accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to conditions, which results in bodily injury or property damage neither expected nor intended by the insured.\" Because a breach of contract is typically not an accident, there can be no occurrence, and, therefore, there is no coverage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    RTR Builders Inc. v.

This alleged failure to provide records regarding Duncan's work, even if it was a breach of contract, was not \"an occurrence\n   that caused property damage.\" First, failure to provide records cannot be considered to be an \"accident.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Craig\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%2010673964\">\n    2009 WL 10673964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3. Therefore, because the failure was not an \"accident,\" there was no occurrence.
