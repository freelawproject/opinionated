(ECF No. 1.) He has also filed two Motions for Leave to Proceed\n   <em>\n    In Forma Pauperis\n   </em>\n   . (ECF Nos. 4, 5.) For the following reasons, the Court will grant Marsh leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his claims without prejudice and with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Marsh previously worked in the kitchen at SCI Graterford, where he \"handwashed and dumped over 1,000 trays for both A-Block and B-Block on a regular basis.\" (Compl. at 6.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Exhibits attached to Marsh's Complaint show that on August 18, 2016, a staff member gave him an order to wash E-Block's trays. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13.) Marsh refused, \"stating his job was completed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The officer told Marsh to leave the kitchen. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Marsh was removed from his work assignment that same day. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) He contends that Delliponti removed him from his work assignment \"without justification\" and prior to a hearing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) He also claims that he did not receive pay \"for work perform[ed] in July to Aug[ust] 2016,\" and that she reduced his pay grade to $0.19 per hour. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Marsh appeared before Hearing Examiner J. Yodis for a disciplinary hearing on August 23, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15.) Yodis found Marsh guilty of refusing to obey an order, reduced the charge to a class 2 offense, and imposed a sanction of \"14 days loss of job.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15-16.) Marsh appealed, and the Program Committee upheld Yodis's determination on August 30, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Marsh appealed to Superintendent Link, who upheld the decision on September 14, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.) Chief Hearing Examiner Joseph Dupont upheld the decision on October 12, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Marsh filed several grievances about the loss of his job, all of which were denied. Superintendent Link was involved in the review of his grievances. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    at 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) On March 1, 2018, Marsh wrote a letter to Major Clark, in which he argued that Delliponti retaliated against him for filing grievances by not paying him for work he had completed and by taking away his $0.42/hour pay grade. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As relief, Marsh requests that his $0.42 pay grade be reinstated and that he be compensated for all pay that he lost by being removed from his job, which totals approximately $797.46. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) Marsh also states that punitive damages \"need[ ] to be pondered upon with the help of an attorney-wisdom [and] grace of the Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Court will grant Marsh leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   because it appears that he is not capable of paying the fees to commence this civil action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, Marsh's Complaint is subject to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii), which requires the Court to dismiss the Complaint if it fails to state a claim.

The Court construes Marsh's Complaint to be raising due process and retaliation claims against the Defendants.

Accordingly, Marsh cannot maintain a claim against Superintendent Link based on her involvement in the grievance process. Marsh's claims against this Defendant will therefore be dismissed without prejudice and with leave to file an amended complaint in the event he can allege facts that would state a claim under the law explained above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Claims Against Melissa Delliponti\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Loss of Job\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Marsh suggests that Delliponti violated his Fourteenth Amendment due process rights, as well as his rights under the Eighth Amendment, by removing him from his job in the kitchen prior to his disciplinary hearing. Inmates, however, do not have a constitutional right to employment during incarceration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson v. Sec'y Pa. Dep't of Corr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088082\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/567/75/#p78\">\n    567 F.

Quinlan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10530233\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/866/627/#p629\">\n    866 F.2d 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 629 (3d Cir. 1989) ) );\n   <em>\n    Fiore v.

App'x 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (3d Cir. 2011) (per curiam) (\"[P]risoners enjoy no protected interest in prison employment.\"). Thus, Marsh cannot maintain a due process claim based on the fact that he was fired from his job. Likewise, Marsh's Eighth Amendment claim fails \"[b]ecause a prison job is not one of life's necessities.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088082\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/567/75/#p78\">\n    567 F. App'x at 78\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Marsh also vaguely suggests that his Fourteenth Amendment equal protection rights were violated when Delliponti removed him from his job. To state an equal protection claim on a \"class of one\" theory, \"a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant treated him differently from others similarly situated, (2) the defendant did so intentionally, and (3) there was no rational basis for the difference in treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Cty. of Allegheny\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p243\">\n    515 F.3d 224\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 243 (3d Cir. 2008). Nowhere in Marsh's Complaint, however, does he set forth facts suggesting that he was treated differently from similarly situated inmates. Thus, his allegation is an undeveloped conclusion. While Marsh is not required to \"identify in the complaint specific instances where others have been treated differently,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p243\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3645156\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/515/224/#p243\">\n    at 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , his allegations are too vague to move his complaint from the conceivable to plausible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mann v. Brenner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4153386\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/375/232/#p238\">\n    375 F. App'x 232\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 238 (3d Cir. 2010). However, Marsh will be granted the opportunity to file an amended complaint to allege facts to support this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Retaliation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It also appears from the Complaint, and the exhibits attached thereto, that Marsh seeks to assert a retaliation claim against Delliponti. Marsh suggests that Delliponti failed to pay him for work he performed prior to losing his job and downgraded his pay scale in retaliation for filing grievances about her. It is unclear from the Complaint, however, whether these events occurred before or after Marsh filed his grievances. The Court will provide him the opportunity to file an amended complaint to allege facts that would support a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court will grant Marsh leave to proceed\n   <em>\n    in forma pauperis\n   </em>\n   and dismiss his Complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201915\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(ii).
