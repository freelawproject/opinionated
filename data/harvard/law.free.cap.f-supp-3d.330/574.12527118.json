Dennis Saylor, IV, United States District Judge\n  This is an action for patent infringement, breach of contract, and correction of inventorship. The technology at issue involves a device that improves the detection of near-infrared light, which has a variety of potential commercial and scientific applications. Plaintiff SiOnyx, LLC alleges that it approached defendant Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (\"HPK\") concerning a potential business partnership involving the technology. The parties entered into a nondisclosure agreement and SiOnyx provided HPK with certain technical information.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-9\">\n  SiOnyx alleges that after the approach proved unsuccessful, HPK violated the nondisclosure agreement, obtained patents on SiOnyx's technology without naming SiOnyx personnel as inventors, and infringed other patents held by SiOnyx. HPK contends that its engineers independently developed the technology contained in its patents and practiced by its products, and that it does not infringe SiOnyx's patents.\n </opinion>\n <opinion id=\"p-10\">\n  Defendants previously filed six motions for partial summary judgment, and plaintiffs filed a seventh, which the court addressed in a memorandum and order on July 24, 2018.

The photodiode is formed from a silicon semiconductor substrate that has two types of charge-neutral impurities: (1) those that donate electrons (n-type impurities) and (2) those that accept electrons (p-type impurities), which can be said to have electron \"holes.\" (ECF 377-1 at 87). When n-doped silicon is placed next to p-doped silicon, it creates a p-n junction, around which the electrons and holes rearrange themselves until they reach an equilibrium. (ECF 377-1 at 88-89). At equilibrium, there is a thin insulating layer at the juncture where the electrons and holes (charge carriers) have recombined (depletion region), and an electric field-created by the ions left behind when the electrons and holes diffused away-preventing further diffusion. (ECF 377-1 at 89;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 13:10-14:20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The outermost electrons associated with the silicon substrate are said to be in the \"valence band,\" and have a certain energy. The next-highest energy state available is in the \"conduction band.\" The difference in energy between the valence band and the conduction band is a physical property of the semiconductor material; for silicon, the band-gap energy is about 1.07 eV, which corresponds to light with a wavelength around 1100 nm. (ECF 377-1 at 1, 63-64).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   If a photon of sufficient energy (that is, for silicon, one with a wavelength of less than 1100 nm) interacts with the silicon substrate, it may transfer its energy to an electron in the valence band and promote it to the conduction band; in other words, the photon is absorbed. (ECF 377-1 at 63;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 10:21-11:21). Higher-energy photons will be absorbed closer to the light-incident surface, while lower-energy photons are absorbed deeper in the substrate. (ECF 386 Ex E at HPK0022535;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 12:8-13:9, 15:11-16:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   When a photon is absorbed, it creates an electron-hole pair (by promoting an electron to the conduction band). (ECF 377-1 at 93). If the photon is absorbed in the depletion region of the photodiode, the electron and the hole are immediately separated because of the electric field, which creates a current. (ECF 377-1 at 93-94). Photons absorbed too far away from the depletion region are much less likely to\n   produce a current. (ECF 201 at 15:11-16:16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Thus, in an ordinary p-n photodiode, light enters through one surface of the photodiode and, to some extent, is absorbed in the depletion region, resulting in electric current. (ECF 377-1 at 63). Light that is not absorbed will either go right through the photodiode (in which case it does not contribute to the sensitivity of the photodiode) or reflect off the back surface of the photodiode back into the photodiode, in which case it has another opportunity to be absorbed and turned into current. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 24-34). Whatever portion of that light is still unabsorbed after a second trip through the photodiode will either pass through the light-incident surface (again without contributing to the sensitivity of the photodiode) or be reflected by that surface, and so on. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 34-37). Infrared light is more likely to go through the photodiode without being absorbed than visible light, because its longer wavelength (and correspondingly lower energy) is absorbed deeper in the substrate and its energy may be insufficient to bridge the band gap of the silicon semiconductor. (ECF 377-1 at 6-7, 63-64;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 9:3-13; 12:1-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The technology at issue seeks to improve the sensitivity of the photodiode to near-infrared light by irradiating a surface of the silicon substrate with a laser. That irradiation creates an irregular texture on the surface, so that, instead of being smooth, it has micro- or nanometer-scale features that cause the surface to look black to the human eye. (ECF 377-1 at 6-7). Changing the parameters of the irradiation protocol can change the size and shape of those features. (ECF 377-1 at 55 tbl.3.2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   When applied to the back surface of a photodiode, the irregular asperity has the effect of improving the sensitivity of the photodiode to infrared light. In that case, the light enters the photodiode from one surface, and, as before, some is absorbed by the substrate. But instead of meeting a smooth surface on the backside of the photodetector, the unabsorbed light meets the irregular asperity. Light components that hit the asperity an angles greater than or equal to 16.6\u00b0 will be totally reflected, and because the asperity is irregular, they will be reflected back toward the first surface and the side surfaces in many different directions. ( '109 patent, col. 7 ll. 39-50). Because they are arriving from all different directions, they \"are extremely highly likely to be totally reflected\" on the first and side surfaces, and therefore to be \"repeatedly totally reflected on different faces to further increase their travel distance\" inside the photodiode. ( '109 patent col. 7 ll. 51-59). By increasing the travel distance of light inside the photodiode, the asperity makes a thinner piece of silicon act \"thicker,\" and infrared light that otherwise would pass through can be absorbed \"deeper\" than the photodiode actually is. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 16:12-18:3). The longer the light is trapped within the photodiode, the more likely it is to be absorbed and generate current, and the more sensitive the photodiode will be. ( '109 patent, col. 7 l. 59-col.8 l. 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 201 at 12:8-13:9; 17:20-18:3; 20:6-21:3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     HPK's Knowledge of Harvard's Early Black Silicon Work\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 12, 2006, James Roberts (of HC's University Sales and Marketing department) sent a report about Harvard's black-silicon technology to Koei Yamamoto (Senior Executive Managing Director and General Manager of HPK's Solid State Division). (ECF 482-3). It summarizes ten academic publications and two published patent applications that list Carey and Mazur as inventors: U.S. Patent Application Publication Nos. 2003/0029495 (Application No. 10/155,429) and\n   2005/0127401 (Application No. 10/950,230). Those applications are ancestors of the '467 patent, which is asserted in this action, and the '446 patent, which has been dropped from this action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Roberts updated the report in October 2006, to explain that Carey had left Mazur's lab to found SiOnyx and that SiOnyx had received seed funding, and emailed it to Yamamoto again. (ECF 474-9; ECF 526-2). The updated report cites to the same ten publications and two published patent applications that the original report cites to.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   HPK produced a slide presentation created by Terumasa Nagano (of HPK's Microelectrical Mechanical Systems Manufacturing Development Group) in November 2006, around the time that it began discussions with SiOnyx. That presentation describes Mazur and Carey's laser-texturing work at length. (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068525-39;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 536-1 (Harvard's U.S. Pat. App. Pub. No. 2005/0127401 ) ). It also includes two device architectures with surfaces textured by a silicon-dry-etching technique. The first shows a textured surface on the same side as the p-n junction (like Carey's preferred architecture, described below). The second has a textured surface opposite the p-n junction (like Carey's Alternative # 1, described below). (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068533). Neither diagram indicates the surface through which the light enters the device, and the second needs to be flipped upside-down to match up with Alternative # 1. An earlier slide in the same presentation states: \"During dry-etching of Si, debris, naturally oxidized film, and so forth that stuck to the Si surface become a micro-mass, and the pillar-shaped structure is formed. ? A failure for Si etching.\" (ECF 377-14 at HPK0068525).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The 2007 Nondisclosure Agreement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In late 2006, SiOnyx, through Mazur, reached out to HPK about a possible business relationship. (ECF 337-40 at 14:3-15:15; ECF 353 Ex. B at 119:4-24). Mazur, Carey, and Saylor went to Japan in November 2006 to meet with representatives of HPK, where Mazur gave a presentation introducing the technology. (ECF 386 Ex. F at 22:4-25:8;\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=U.S.%20Patent%20No.%208%2C080%2C467%2C\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Ex. E).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   SiOnyx and HPK entered into a mutual nondisclosure agreement on January 11, 2007, to facilitate a possible business relationship. (ECF 337-2). The nondisclosure agreement provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Each of the parties has developed certain products, technology and methodologies, including information that each party regards as confidential, proprietary, trade secret information. Each party proposes to disclose certain of such information to the other party, to be used by the other party solely for the limited purpose of\n   <em>\n    EVALUATING APPLICATIONS AND JOINTS [sic] DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITES OF PULSED LASER PROCESS DOPED PHOTONIC DEVICES\n   </em>\n   and for no other purposes whatsoever (the \"Permitted Purpose.\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   (ECF 337-2 at 1). SiOnyx and HPK agreed that any breach of the nondisclosure agreement would constitute irreparable harm, so that the \"Disclosing Party\" would be entitled to equitable relief to enforce the agreement. (ECF 337-2 at 2). And they agreed that all ownership rights in any intellectual property arising from \"Confidential Information\" would remain with the \"Disclosing Party\" in the absence of a separate written instrument expressly granting those rights. (ECF 337-2 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Confidential Architectures\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On January 16, 2007, Saylor and Carey met with Keith Kobayashi (of HPK's International Division) and Yamamoto by telephone to plan possible experimental prototypes. (ECF 337-3; ECF 337-40 at 17:13-19, 19:19-20:9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The following day, on January 17, 2007, Carey emailed Kobayashi \"the first draft of a device architecture we would like to pursue.\" (ECF 337-3 at 2). He explained that \"[t]he suggested device architecture was selected based on our past experiments and what we believe is compatible with current Hamamatsu photodetectors,\" and he \"also included two possible alternatives if the preferred architecture is difficult.\" (ECF 337-3 at 2-3). The \"preferred\" device architecture showed a laser-processed layer on the top of the device. (ECF 337-3 at 4). The first alternative-\"Alternative # 1\"-showed a p-n photodiode where the laser-textured layer was positioned on the back of the device, opposite the side where light would enter the device. (ECF 337-3 at 5; ECF 337-40 at 19:13-20:21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Carey testified that prior to his January 17, 2007 email, neither he nor anyone else at SiOnyx had ever discussed the idea of locating the laser-textured layer as depicted in Alternative # 1 with anyone outside SiOnyx. (ECF 337-4 at 345:20-346:2; ECF 337-40 at 20:10-21:1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    6.\n    <em>\n     The SiOnyx-HPK Collaboration\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   On April 4, 2007, Saylor traveled to Japan to meet with representatives of HPK. At the meeting, HPK representatives showed a presentation created by Akira Sakamoto (of HPK's Solid-State Production Development Group) at the direction of Yamamoto. The presentation outlined a plan for HPK to make four types of silicon test wafers, each created by up to three different processes. (ECF 337-8 at 55:5-57:17; ECF 337-7). The wafers would be laser textured by SiOnyx, sent back to HPK for final processing, and tested for their optical-response characteristics. (ECF 337-8 at 14:6-15:3). That presentation showed architectures very similar to those proposed by Carey, and included devices where the texture was placed on the light-incident surface. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-3\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Between April and November 2007, SiOnyx and HPK jointly tested 38 wafers. HPK fabricated the test devices up until the laser-texturing step, and mailed them to SiOnyx for texturing. SiOnyx then returned them to HPK for final processing and testing. (ECF 337-8 at 14:3-15:3; ECF 337-40 at 44:21-45:20). The results of the testing showed that at least some of the devices that were laser-textured by SiOnyx had improved infrared photosensitivity as compared to one of HPK's standard devices. (ECF 337-9 at HPK0010411). The testing also showed that the photosensitivity of devices having the laser-textured surface on the side of the device opposite from the direction of incident light (front illuminated, in this case where the textured surface is on the back) had stronger performance than devices having the laser-textured surface on the same side as the incident light (back illuminated), which performed significantly worse than the reference device. (ECF 337-11 at 14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Some knowledge about laser-texturing devices was in the public domain-due, in part, to Mazur's many academic publications on the topic. Carey testified, however, that SiOnyx had discovered that there was a preferred target size for the structures making up the texture, which balanced optical response against certain disadvantageous properties. That texture, and the process for making it, was confidential information of commercial value to SiOnyx. (ECF 337-40 at 21:2-22:1). SiOnyx, when it textured the test devices from HPK, used its confidential process to produce its preferred\n   texture. (ECF 337-40 at 49:21-50:14). But SiOnyx shared very limited information as to the process parameters for achieving that texture with HPK-nothing except the identity of the ambient gas in the laser-processing chamber. (ECF 337-10; ECF 45-2 at 69:4-15, 94:3-7). As part of the testing procedure, HPK took scanning-electron-microscope (\"SEM\") images of the textures, which showed detailed images of textures achieved and allowed structural features of the textures to be measured. (ECF 337-9 at HPK0010405-08, HPK0010415). Carey testified that the size of the features shown in these SEM images were within the target range identified by SiOnyx, which he considered to be confidential. (ECF 337-40 at 49:5-50:14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   An employee of HC was at the initial November 2006 meeting, and another employee of HC actually signed the nondisclosure agreement on behalf of HPK, but following that there were no communications between SiOnyx and HC. (ECF 97 at 13; ECF 345 Ex. Q at 172:10-19, Ex. S at 255:3-256:21, Ex. U at 121:10-15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    7.\n    <em>\n     The End of the Collaboration and HPK's Further Activities\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   After the testing was finished, Saylor and Kobayashi exchanged a few emails concerning the possibility of further tests. (ECF 337-12). But on January 15, 2008, Kobayashi responded as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   After discussing with related people mainly from technical aspects, we reached to the following conclusions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   As a commercial entity, [HPK], of course, has to study the possibility to enhance our product capability. However, we are not confident that black silicon technology will greatly contribute. We would rather like to stick with our own technique/technology for that purpose because we would like to keep our own pace of development and accumulate our own know-hows. In [HPK] culture, business decisions almost always come after full technical evaluation, which seems to be quite different from your company. Therefore, we would like to do study by ourselves without further reference to proprietary information of SiOnyx.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   (ECF 337-12 at 1). The collaboration effectively ended at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   That same day, someone from HPK's Central Research Laboratory emailed Kobayashi to say that technology regarding the processing of black silicon was a top priority. (ECF 337 \u00b6 45 (Pl. SMF);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 377 \u00b6 45 (Def. Response) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Nagano testified that HPK kept the test wafers than had been textured by SiOnyx until at least 2010. (ECF 337-13 at 84:5-16). Prototype reports from April 29 and May 22, 2008, show that HPK's Central Research Laboratory was attempting to replicate the quantum efficiency of the SiOnyx-textured device and comparing the textures they were able to achieve to those SiOnyx achieved. (ECF 337-36 at SIONYXHARVARD_00107908, SIONYXHARVARD_00107916; ECF 337-43 at HPK0012401, HPK0012412, HPK0012425;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 337 \u00b6 53). A presentation dated July 17, 2008-authored by Sakamoto and Nagano and titled \"Black Silicon Technology In-House Production\"-has, as its first page, a slide titled \"PD sensitivity characteristics increase by SiOnyx Company laser processing.\" (ECF 337-13 at 131:22-132:25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   ECF 337-14 (mostly in Japanese, but containing the words \"Black Si\" and \"SiOnyx\" in English) ). That slide shows a graph of photosensitivity at different wavelengths of light (the same characteristics measured during the SiOnyx-HPK collaboration) that compares the performance of SiOnyx's device (labeled \"SPL Si PD\") with HPK's standard silicon photodiode (labeled \"STD Si PD\").

(ECF 337-13 at 142:15-23; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515). The leftmost image is labeled \"SiOnyx.\" (ECF 337-13 at 142:24-25; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515). Under the third image, the text reads \"visually equivalent to SiOnyx's wafer\" and that, like SiOnyx's wafer, \"no silicon scum is attached.\" (ECF 337-13 at 145:4-13; ECF 337-17 at HPK0024515).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Sakamoto testified that HPK's Central Research Laboratory had examined SiOnyx's publications and attempted to estimate the process conditions for the laser texturing. However, it was unable to recreate the texture shown in those publications, and saw almost no surface roughness. (ECF 337-8 at 119:5-122:16). He also testified that \"[t]he samples provided to us by SiOnyx, we looked at them in the prototyping of the silicon photodiode black silicon processing.\" (ECF 337-8 at 122:1-16). Yamamoto testified that for the photodiode product that HPK produced, the \"wafers were prepared by Hamamatsu without using the wafers from SiOnyx.\" (ECF 337-19 at 140:12-15). He further testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   Q.

E at 1). It reminded Saylor and Mazur that when the HPK-SiOnyx talks terminated, HPK had \"informed you that we, by ourselves, would like to focus our development efforts on photovoltaic type,\" and explained that \"while we are greatly appreciating having given us an opportunity to think about further enhancement/improvement of our accumulated know-how as a photonics company, we do not think we are infringing any of your IP or originality, or breaching any obligation of confidentiality.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The email attached a file showing the architecture of HPK's device and a chart of its spectral photosensitivity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2). The email also described the device, stating that it \"has PN junction on the one side and the back side consists of an accumulation layer by ion implantation over the black silicon surface fabricated by laser in the inert gas atmosphere.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1). Saylor responded by email ten days later, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Regarding our prior collaboration and information exchanged under Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement, SiOnyx is confident that [HPK] will ensure the integrity of SiOnyx confidential information. While the diagram provided in your email is insufficient for our understanding, it looks very similar to the work product of our collaboration. Should [HPK] wish to provide SiOnyx detailed specifications and English translation versions of the presentation materials planned for the Photon Fair, we may be able to comment on your conclusion that your laser processed NIR enhanced Silicon Photodiode does not utilize SiOnyx IP or violate any provisions of our prior agreement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   (ECF 316 Ex.

Although we briefly discussed the results, our structure and processes in the attached file are our own idea. Therefore, we strongly believe that our developed product does not infringe your patents or use any of your proprietary information disclosed to us because the development is based on only our own wafer process technologies.

I at 1). That email attached a step-by-step process flow diagram, in English, describing how HPK's photodiode was made. (ECF 316 Ex. I at 4). HPK admits that the process-flow diagram was very similar to one discussed by the parties during the collaboration. (ECF 315 at 2-3;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ECF 316 Ex. B at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Saylor replied on March 10, 2009, that SiOnyx would \"review the information provided,\" and reiterated its interest in a possible business relationship with HPK. (ECF 316 Ex. K at 1). That same day, Kobayashi replied that HPK was not interested in a business relationship with SiOnyx at that time. (ECF 316 Ex. L at 1). On April 15, 2009, Kobayashi contacted Saylor again to say that he hadn't heard from him about the proposed disclosure at the Photon Fair and to thank him for his \"understanding that our technique explained in our e-mails is not infringing your intellectual property.\" (ECF 316 Ex. M at 1). There was no other communication between the parties about the photodiode HPK planned to show at the Photon Fair.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The parties were asked about those communications in their depositions. Carey testified that HPK's first email was concerning because it seemed to him that the diagram HPK sent depicted a device that would be covered by SiOnyx's intellectual property. (ECF 316 Ex. F at 265:16-266:11, 273:17). Mazur also testified that he\n   thought the device shown in the diagram would be covered by SiOnyx's intellectual property. (ECF 316 Ex. G at 157:14-24). He further testified that the differences HPK pointed out in their second email failed to convince him that the HPK product did not infringe SiOnyx's rights. (ECF 316 Ex. G at 161:5-24, 163:1-165:24, 167:1-171:24). Saylor, testifying as SiOnyx's Rule 30(b)(6) deposition witness, stated that the architecture of HPK's photodiode was \"the same architecture from an optical perspective as what Jim Carey disclosed.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 191:16-23). But he also testified that while Carey and another employee had suspicions because it was close to what SiOnyx and HPK had worked on together, Saylor \"emphasized with them that [HPK] is clearly articulating to us that they had independently developed all of this.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 192:4-19). He read the emails \"to mean that none of the people who worked on the project with us would have worked on this, because in big companies, you typically-what you would do is, you would firewall your team, so I'm assuming that's what they've done; otherwise, I don't know how he can claim that it's all their own know-how. They must have firewalled the team.\" (ECF 316 Ex. J at 189:3-10). He found Kobayashi's final email to be \"amusing\" because it thanked him for an understanding that he never gave, but he never corrected him or sent a response. (ECF 316 Ex. J at 201:14-202:15).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   A certified translation of an email sent on February 6, 2009, from Sakamoto to Kobayashi contains a draft of the email to SiOnyx. The text above that draft states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Thank you for all you'd done during the infrared high sensitivity device studies performed with SiOnyx the year before last. One sample prepared at that time was commercialized this time and the technology will be displayed at the Photon Fair. Although considered not likely to be in conflict with the patent filed by Harvard College, because there is a description, \"photodetector that detects even at the wavelength of energy at or less than the Si bandgap due to a femtosecond laser processing\" in one claim, and the N2 gas atmosphere is also described, we have been reviewing how to make the presentation. As a result, if it is commercialized and becomes successful business in the future, rather than hiding a risky notation, we have decided to appeal that our processing is completely different than the one performed by SiOnyx by clarifying the specifics. It is a fact that it was jointly studied in 2007 and since the structure of the sample fabricated at that time and the technique used were already defined, please convey this and notify of the commercialization.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   (ECF 326-4 at 6-7). In response to the draft, Kobayashi asked, \"Was the sample prepared at that time the one we prepared? And what kinds of information did we receive from SiOnyx for our preparing the sample?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5). Sakamoto responded that the sample was the one HPK had prepared, but that SiOnyx had done the black-silicon laser processing; that he thought they had received some information concerning the laser conditions from SiOnyx; and that while they had also received information concerning annealing conditions from SiOnyx, they were not currently using those annealing conditions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   When asked about that email exchange, Kobayashi testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Q.

The Maya2000 Pro incorporates Hamamatsu's (not-accused) S10420 CCD image sensor and uses aluminum mirrors. (ECF 529-3 at 50:4-11, 68:6-18). The Maya2000 Pro-NIR model incorporates Hamamatsu's (accused) S11510 CCD image sensor and uses gold mirrors, making it uniquely suited to taking measurements in the near-infrared spectrum. (ECF 529-2 at 9; ECF 529-3 at 68:6-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Starting in October 2009 and extending to late 2010, Ocean Optics approached SiOnyx about supplying an image sensor for one of its spectrometers that would be able to extend its spectral range. (ECF 529-11 at 81:12-87:15; ECF 529-16). It appears that SiOnyx supplied some sensors to Ocean Optics at that time, but it is not clear whether Ocean Optics ever sold a spectrometer that incorporated a SiOnyx sensor. (ECF 529-11 at 85:17-87:15). In early 2011, Ocean Optics reached out to SiOnyx again regarding linear arrays. (ECF 529-11 at 89:1-91:4). SiOnyx did not have a sensor that met the specifications of Ocean Optics at that time, but indicated that it could develop one, although there would be nonrecurring engineering costs associated with that effort, which presumably SiOnyx would expect Ocean Optics to share. (ECF 529-11 at 91:10-99:15). Ocean Optics ultimately chose to use the S11510 manufactured by HPK, which it purchased through HC.

(ECF 163-2 \u00b6\u00b6 127-168, 262-273). Count 15 seeks declaratory judgment of the same. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 169-173). Count 16 alleges that HPK breached the nondisclosure agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 174-181). Count 17 alleges that HPK and HC were unjustly enriched. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 182-188). Count 18 has been voluntarily dismissed. (ECF 422). And Counts 19-20 allege that all defendants have infringed each of SiOnyx and Harvard's patents. (ECF 163-2 \u00b6\u00b6 215-261).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   On September 30, 2016, HC petitioned the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") for\n   <em>\n    inter partes\n   </em>\n   review (\"IPR\") of the '591 patent. (ECF 485-6) (PTAB IPR2016-01910). That petition identified HPK as a real party-in-interest, and requested that an IPR be instituted as to all 26 claims of the patent, as to one or more of five grounds. (ECF 485-6 at 1, 18-52). Specifically, the petition requested review of:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \u2022 Claims 1, 4, 5, 7-9, 13, 24, and 25 for anticipation by Nakashiba;\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   \u2022 Claims 1-5, 7-9, 11, 13-22, and 24-26 for obviousness over Akahori\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   in view of Mazur;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   \u2022 Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-11, 13-21, and 23-26 for obviousness over Mabuchi\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in view of Mazur;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   \u2022 Claim 6 for obviousness over Mabuchi in view of Mazur and Uematsu;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \u2022 Claim 12 for obviousness over Mabuchi in view of Mazur and Furukawa.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   (ECF 485-6 at 18-52).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The PTAB instituted review on March 30, 2017. (ECF 485-8). But, as was its practice at the time, it instituted review only as to certain claims and certain grounds on which it deemed HC to have demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   \u2022 Claims 1, 4, 5, 7-9, 13, 24, and 25 for anticipation by Nakashiba;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   \u2022 Claims 1, 2, 4, 5, 7-11, 13-18, 21, and 23-26 for obviousness over Mabuchi and Mazur;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   \u2022 Claim 6 for obviousness over Mabuchi, Mazur, and Uematsu; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-135\">\n   \u2022 Claim 12 for obviousness over Mabuchi, Mazur, and Furukawa.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   (ECF 485-8 at 42-43). The PTAB determined that HC had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing in showing that claims 1-5, 7-9, 11, 13-22, and 24-26 were obvious over Akahori and Mazur because Akahori explicitly discourages texturing on the key surface. (ECF 485-8 at 27-28). It determined that HC had not demonstrated a reasonable likelihood of prevailing in showing that claims 19 and 20 were obvious over Mabuchi and Mazur because those references did not teach\n   \"forming surface features to have dimensions that selectively diffuse or selectively absorb a desired wavelength of electro-magnetic radiation\" as required by those claims. (ECF 485-8 at 37-38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   On May 26, 2017, in response to SiOnyx's motion for rehearing, the PTAB reversed its decision to institute review of claims 9, 24, and 25 for anticipation by Nakashiba, and the IPR did not go forward as to those claims on that ground. (ECF 522-14 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   The PTAB issued its final written decision on March 28, 2018. It ruled that claims 1, 2, 4-11, 13-18, 21, and 23-25 of the '591 patent were unpatentable, but upheld claims 12 and 26. (ECF 485-18 at 66). SiOnyx filed a notice of appeal on May 24, 2018. That appeal is still pending, and SiOnyx's opening brief is due September 7, 2018. (Fed. Cir. No. 18-2019). HC did not cross-appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   While the IPR was proceeding, discovery in this case was ongoing. Fact and expert discovery have now mostly closed, with the exception of some lingering disputes that have required the intervention of the magistrate judge or the undersigned. Defendants previously filed six motions for partial summary judgment, and plaintiffs filed one motion for partial summary judgment and a motion to amend the second amended complaint, which the Court addressed in a previous order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Defendants have filed five more motions for partial summary judgment asserting the following contentions: (1) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove willful infringement; (2) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove indirect infringement; (3) that SiOnyx has failed to prove infringement of the '591 patent ; (4) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove that Carey and Mazur are the sole co-inventors of the HPK patents; and (5) that SiOnyx and Harvard have failed to prove any claims against Ocean Optics. Defendants have also filed a motion to strike the declarations of Ezekiel Kruglick. SiOnyx in turn has moved for summary judgment regarding inter partes review estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Standard of Review\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   The role of summary judgment is to \"pierce the pleadings and to assess the proof in order to see whether there is a genuine need for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Mesnick v.

Claims 3, 4, 9, and 25 depend from claim 1, and claims 18-20 depend from claim 13. Claim 1 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-146\">\n   1. A photosensitive imager device, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-147\">\n   a semiconductor substrate having a substantially planar surface and multiple doped regions forming at least one junction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-148\">\n   a textured region coupled to the semiconductor substrate on a surface opposite the substantially planar surface and positioned to interact with electromagnetic radiation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-149\">\n   integrated circuitry formed at the substantially planar surface; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   an electrical transfer element coupled to the semiconductor substrate and operable to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   ( '591 patent, col. 18 ll. 33-45). Claim 13 recites:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n   13. A method of making a photosensitive imager device, comprising:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n   forming a textured region on a semiconductor substrate, wherein the semiconductor substrate has a substantially planar surface opposite the textured region and multiple doped regions forming a[t] least one junction, and wherein the textured region is formed in a position to interact with electromagnetic radiation;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-154\">\n   forming integrated circuitry on the substantially planar surface; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n   coupling an electrical transfer element to the semiconductor substrate such that the electrical transfer element is operable to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   ( '591 patent, col. 19 ll. 16-29). Therefore, all of the asserted claims contain the limitation that the \"electrical transfer element\" be \"operable to transfer an electrical signal from the at least one junction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   In its claim-construction opinion, the Court construed the term \"electrical transfer element\" to mean \"an element used to transfer charge or signal from a photosensitive pixel.\" (ECF 251 at 36). The Court explained that the specification explicitly provides that the invention \"can be incorporated into complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imager architectures or charge-coupled device (CCD) imager architectures.\" ( '591 patent col. 6 ll. 45-49). The Court further explained that the language \"operable to transfer an electrical signal\" \"requires that the transfer element must be able to transfer a signal, it does not exclude the ability to transfer a charge.\" (ECF 251 at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   All of the devices SiOnyx accuses of infringement are CCDs or devices that incorporate CCDs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   SiOnyx does not dispute that the pixels of a CCD transfer a charge, which is converted to a voltage by an amplifier outside the pixel array (in contrast to a CMOS detector, in which the charge is converted to a voltage at each pixel). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 175-1 \u00b6\u00b6 17-21; ECF 481-5 at 56:8-13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Defendants contend that they are entitled to summary judgment of noninfringement because the CCDs only transfer a charge, not a signal, and the claims specifically require that the \"electrical\n   transfer element\" be \"operable to transfer an electrical\n   <em>\n    signal.\n   </em>\n   \" They contend that by taking the position that both \"charge\" and \"signal\" must be included in the construction of \"transfer element,\" SiOnyx has conceded that the two are different. In support, defendants point to the testimony of SiOnyx's expert, Michael Guidash, who stated, \"To the extent Defendants' proposed construction [of electrical transfer element] only applies to 'transferring an electrical signal' it would rule out CCDs, which are explicitly defined as within the scope of the invention by the specification.\" (ECF 175-1 \u00b6 55).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Defendants' argument, however, mischaracterizes Guidash's testimony. Guidash has consistently opined that the claims of the '591 patent cover both CMOS and CCD detectors, and that it would be erroneous to read the claims to exclude CCD detectors when the specification clearly contemplates that its teachings could be applied to CCD detectors, which were previously well-known in the art. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   '591 patent, col. 1 ll. 18-22;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 6 ll. 45-49;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6206897\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/477/242/#p250\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , col. 11 ll. 11-13). Guidash opined that \"[t]o those of ordinary skill of the art, particularly in view of the specification, the terms 'electrical transfer element' or 'transfer element' ... refers [sic] to the circuitry or electrical components used in the pixels,\" which, as to a CCD pixel, would be \"a MOS capacitor, which transfers the charge from the pixel to a shift register and ultimately to read-out circuitry where it is converted into a voltage.\" (ECF 175-1 \u00b6 53). The Court acknowledged that in its claim-construction opinion, in which it explicitly relied on Guidash's unrebutted opinion as to how a skilled artisan would interpret the claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 251 at 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Claim construction is an exercise in clarification. As part of that process, SiOnyx (through Guidash) requested that the Court clarify that the \"electronic transfer element\" includes the transfer of charges. The Court can understand how defendants now view the inclusion of two words in the claim-construction opinion-signal and charge-to suggest a distinction between the two. Nonetheless, it is clear that \"charges\" are a kind of \"signal\" encompassed by the claim. Indeed, the patent does not distinguish between \"signal\" and \"charge\"-in fact, it does not use the word \"charge\" except to name \"charge-coupled devices (CCDs).\" But it does say that its teachings are applicable to CCDs, and Guidash explained that a person of ordinary skill would view the claims as covering them, despite the patent's use of the word \"signal.\" (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF 175-1 \u00b6 20 (explaining that CCDs transfer \"signal charge packets\") ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   To be clear, this is not a back-door, after-the-fact construction of the word \"signal.\" Neither party requested a construction of that term, and its application to the accused devices will therefore be a question of fact for the jury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Mustek Sys., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9103004\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/340/1314/#p1320\">\n    340 F.3d 1314\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1320-21 (Fed.

Cir. 2003). The Court only holds that SiOnyx has not conceded, and the Court's claim-construction opinion does not require, that \"signal\" and \"charge\" are mutually exclusive categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Defendant's motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the '591 patent will therefore be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     Motion of Ocean Optics for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Plaintiffs allege that Ocean Optics is liable for infringing the '467 and '591 patents through its Maya2000 Pro-NIR spectrometer. That theory of infringement depends entirely on the spectrometer's incorporation of an HPK sensor as a component part. Ocean Optics contends that summary judgment should be granted in its favor\n   because (1) plaintiffs have not requested damages from Ocean Optics; (2) even if they had requested damages, the record is bereft of evidence to actually prove those damages; and (3) an injunction would never be available against Ocean Optics. It contends that because plaintiffs thus would have no remedy against it separate from their remedies against HPK and HC, it should be dismissed from the case. The motion will be denied for multiple reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   First, the fact that plaintiffs did not specifically identify damages as a form of relief against Ocean Optics in their complaint is inconsequential. If Ocean Optics is judged to have infringed the patents, plaintiffs are entitled to damages. Section 281 provides: \"A patentee shall have remedy by civil action for infringement of his patent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20281\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Section 283 further provides: \"The several courts having jurisdiction of cases under this title\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   grant injunctions in accordance with the principles of equity to prevent the violation of any right secured by patent, on such terms as the court deems reasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20281\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 283 (emphasis added). And Section 284 provides: \"Upon finding for the claimant the court\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer, together with interest and costs as fixed by the court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20281\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 284 (emphasis added).

There are three types of relevant claims and grounds: those as to which the PTAB actually instituted review; those as to which it declined review; and those that were not raised before the PTAB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <strong>\n    a.\n    <em>\n     Claims and Grounds Actually Addressed in the PTAB's Final Written Decision\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   Defendants are clearly estopped from asserting any claims and grounds in this lawsuit as to which the PTAB actually instituted review and issued a final written decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   Defendants contend that they should not be estopped from raising grounds that were successful, because the appeal of the PTAB's decision is still pending and the estoppel provisions are meant to prevent only duplicative\n   <em>\n    abusive\n   </em>\n   challenges. But the statute makes no distinction between successful and unsuccessful grounds. Indeed, there appears to be no practical effect of holding that defendants can assert their successful grounds because the appeal is pending-either (1) the Federal Circuit will affirm the PTAB's decision, in which case the claims will remain unpatentable (as they are now) and there will be no reason for this Court to address their validity (or infringement), or (2) it will reverse the PTAB's decision, in which case the grounds defendants asserted will no longer be \"successful\" grounds and defendants will be estopped from raising them in this lawsuit. To the extent\n   defendants are concerned that SiOnyx may be awarded damages in the interim for claims that are unpatentable, the Court will entertain further briefing and argument as to how to handle the situation should it arise.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    XY, LLC v.

First, to the extent that HPK bases its argument on the fact that the patents cover textures not formed by a laser, the method of formation is immaterial. The patent claims that do not specifically recite laser irradiation cover devices, not methods; they claim photodiodes that have an \"irregular asperity,\" not a method for making that irregular asperity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Baldwin Graphic Sys., Inc. v.

This is so even where the patent clearly covers devices with an irregular asperity made in other ways (such as in the '551 patent, which contains an independent claim that only requires an \"irregular asperity\" and a dependent claim that requires an \"irregular asperity ... formed by applying a pulsed laser beam,\" ( '551 patent, col. 18 l. 50;\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4070603\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/512/1338/#p1344\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   col. 19 ll. 5-6) ), and where the actual texture achieved by other methods cannot be obtained with laser processing. In other words, conception is tied to the claims; where the claims are to an apparatus, what matters for conception is whether the inventor has conceived of the apparatus; and one way of making the apparatus is sufficient to put the inventor in possession of the apparatus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-221\">\n   To the extent HPK bases its argument on the fact that the patents cover placing the texture on the light-incident surface, there appears to be a genuine issue of material fact as to whether that placement was in the prior art or whether Carey alone conceived of that placement. HPK points to a November 2006 presentation as evidence that it had considered texturing at least the light-incident surface prior to receiving the confidential architectures from Carey. (ECF 482-5 at HPK0068533).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   But that evidence is not sufficient to grant summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   First, the mere fact that the claimed inventions may cover more than just laser texturing opposite the light-incident surface does not mean that contribution to those elements makes one a co-inventor. Rather, the contribution must be \"not insignificant in quality, when that contribution is measured against the dimension of the full invention,\" and must be more than \"well-known concepts and/or the current state of the art.' \"\n   <em>\n    Acromed Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1269224\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/253/1371/#p1379\">\n    253 F.3d at 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Pannu\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11708313\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/155/1344/#p1351\">\n    155 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1351 ). The November 2006 presentation includes many slides showing images and results from Carey and Mazur's prior, publicly available work.

At least one slide shows a figure from a 2004 Applied Physics article (authored by Carey and Mazur, among others) depicting an experiment where the authors laser textured the light-incident surface of a photodiode.

Therefore, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to what was in the prior art and whether Carey conceived of the \"full and operative invention[s]\" claimed by the HPK patents on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   Second, the November 2006 presentation specifically states that the texturing was made by a silicon-dry-etching technique, and further states that silicon etching was \"a failure.\" (ECF 482-5 at HPK0068525). \"[A]n inventor need not know that his invention will work for conception to be complete,\" but conception requires that the \"inventor has a specific, settled idea, a particular solution to the problem at hand, not just a general goal or research plan he hopes to pursue.\"\n   <em>\n    Burroughs Wellcome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531092\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/40/1223/#p1227\">\n    40 F.3d at 1228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . HPK argues that the incorporation of Harvard's laser-texturing data in the presentation shows that HPK was considering using laser texturing at least on the light-incident surface at that time. But in the absence of any explicit statements in the presentation, the mere juxtaposition of Harvard's laser-texturing results with architectures showing silicon-dry-etch texturing does not conclusively show that HPK had a specific plan to laser-texture any particular photodiode; rather, a reasonable juror could find that the presentation showed no more than a general research plan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   Defendants' motion for summary judgment that Carey cannot be the sole inventor of the disputed patents will accordingly be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   <strong>\n    E.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Strike Kruglick Declarations\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   During the briefing of defendants' motions for summary judgment concerning willful and indirect infringement, it became clear that the parties disputed the meaning of the metadata associated with the copy of the '467 patent produced by HPK.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   It appears that the first time plaintiffs informed defendants that they were relying on the metadata in connection with their claims of willful and indirect infringement was in their oppositions to defendants' motions for partial summary judgment. Defendants responded with declarations from Akifumi Takeda, the Deputy General Manager of the Intellectual Property Department at HPK, in whose custody the '467 patent was found. Takeda attested that he first downloaded the '467 patent on October 2, 2015, which is the day after the lawsuit was filed. (ECF 537-6; ECF 535-3).

But it is plaintiffs who ultimately have the burden of proof to show that defendants had knowledge of their patents. Plaintiffs presumably intended to use the metadata associated with the '467 patent to show that HPK knew of the patent as of the \"date created\"-as defendants point out in their motions, merely pointing to HPK's copy of the patent does not show when HPK learned of it. Plaintiffs took the risk that the meaning of the date in the \"date created\" field would not be self-explanatory. The proffer of the expert opinion is therefore untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   It is also not \"harmless\" within the meaning of Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(c). First, Kruglick was not designated as an expert on metadata. Second, defendants have shown (at the hearing on the summary judgment motions, which was their first opportunity) that there are two \"date created\" fields associated with a pdf file-one stored in the database the pdf is saved in, and one stored within the pdf itself. Defendants have proffered evidence that these fields can differ, and that the \"date created\" field within the pdf file can pre-date the download of the document onto a particular\n   file system. All these are holes that defendants might have poked in Kruglick's opinion, but they had no opportunity to cross-examine him about these topics or to respond with their own expert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   The motion to strike will therefore be granted. For the purposes of the summary judgment motions that follow, the Court will assume that the fact of the date in the \"date created\" field could be evidence that the document was in HPK's possession as of that time, and construe it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. The Court takes no position as to whether Kruglick's testimony would be admissible at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   <strong>\n    F.\n    <em>\n     Willful Infringement\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Defendants have moved for summary judgment as to plaintiffs' claims that all three defendants willfully infringed the '467 and '591 patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   A court may award treble damages \" 'in a case of willful or bad-faith infringement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Halo Elecs., Inc. v.

They point to the following pieces of evidence to support that theory: (1) a January 2006 report from HC to HPK summarizing Harvard's work, which includes citations to two pending patent applications that name Carey and Mazur as inventors and that are great-grandparent and great-great-grandparent applications of the asserted '467 patent (ECF 474-3); (2) an updated version of that report from October 2006, explaining that Carey had left Mazur's lab to found SiOnyx and that SiOnyx had received seed funding; (ECF 474-9); (2) Nagano's November 2006 presentation, which looks like it was based on the same information as the October 2006 report and cites to the same figures (ECF 377-14); (3) the fact of the collaboration back in 2007, in which SiOnyx shared information pursuant to a confidentiality agreement; (4) a June 21, 2007 email between HPK and HC employees forwarding a news report about Harvard's failure to patent certain aspects of its technology (ECF 474-11); (5) the fact that in the \"prior art\" section of seven of HPK's patents (the '087, '528, '945, '485, '135, '551, and '109 patents ), HPK cited to patents and patent applications in the same family as the '467 patent ; (6) the copy of a child of the '591 patent that HPK does not dispute was in its possession as of July 2013; and (7) the copy of the '467 patent itself, which, taking the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, the Court must assume was in HPK's possession in August 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   The Court cannot conclude, as a matter of law, that the evidence is insufficient to establish that HPK knew of the asserted patents. This is not a case where, in the course of its ordinary business of research and development, HPK happened upon some patents that turned out to be related to the patents later asserted against it. HPK had a confidential business relationship with SiOnyx; it was studying the work coming out of Mazur's laboratory to try to replicate the reported NIR photosensitivies; it reached out to SiOnyx in 2009 because it was concerned about Harvard's patents and represented that it did not think its products infringed any of those patents, suggesting that it was paying attention to plaintiffs' patent activity at least as of that time; and it cited to some of Harvard's patents in the process of obtaining its own. In circumstances such as these, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that HPK's knowledge of related patent bears on its knowledge of the asserted patents. And the Court is assuming, for the purposes of this motion, that a reasonable jury could conclude from the \"date created\" metadata that HPK had a copy of the '467 patent as of August 2013. Therefore, there is a genuine issue of material\n   fact as to whether HPK in fact knew of the asserted patents prior to this lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Culpability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   HPK argues that even if plaintiffs can show that it had knowledge of the patents, they cannot show that HPK's behavior was egregious or culpable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   To show culpable behavior, plaintiffs point to the evidence supporting their claim that HPK violated the nondisclosure agreement and used SiOnyx's confidential information to develop the accused products. HPK contends that its behavior in 2008-2009 cannot amount to culpable behavior because the patents asserted in this suit were not even filed until May 10, 2010 (the '467 patent ) and September 17, 2010 (the '591 patent ); were not published until September 23, 2010 (the '467 patent ); and September 22, 2011 (the '591 patent ); and did not issue until December 20, 2011 (the '467 patent ), and March 25, 2014 (the '591 patent ). It contends that, at most, it continued to sell products that might be infringing, which is not alone egregious conduct.\n   <em>\n    Intellectual Ventures I, LLC v. Symantec Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268369\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/601/#p612\">\n    234 F.Supp.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 612 (D. Del. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   As an initial matter, there appears to be a genuine issue of material fact as to when exactly the accused products were first sold in the United States. Defendants, in their statement of material facts, assert that \"HPK and HC began selling the Accused Products into the United States in 2010,\" but they do not cite to any record evidence to support that fact. (ECF 474-2 \u00b6 31). Plaintiffs, in their response, state that they \"lack knowledge to admit or deny this paragraph.\" (ECF 526-1 \u00b6 31). In their opposition to the motion, they contend that HPK introduced new allegedly infringing products after October 2015, when the lawsuit was filed and HPK indisputably had knowledge of the patents. (ECF 526 at 15). Therefore, HPK may well have done more than simply continued to sell products it had been making since before the patents issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   Second, the facts of this case may be sufficient to establish that HPK knowingly or recklessly infringed SiOnyx's patents, even if the products were developed and first sold prior to the asserted patents' issuance. Again, the facts must be interpreted in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. If HPK indeed knew that SiOnyx had shared confidential technology; knew that SiOnyx planned to patent that technology; secretly copied that technology, falsely led SiOnyx to believe that it had developed the technology on its own; and then commercialized it, that behavior would not be excused simply because HPK managed to get its products on the market before SiOnyx's patents issued. While HPK certainly cannot infringe a patent that does not exist, once the patents do issue, its prior conduct does not disappear-as of the date the patents issued, HPK could have been purposely selling products based on technology it allegedly stole. And its decision to copy confidential technology would surely factor into the question of whether it had reason to know that its actions would constitute patent infringement. Again, the question is not whether those facts have been proved, but whether a material factual dispute exists.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   Plaintiffs have therefore put forth sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether HPK willfully infringed the asserted patents, and summary judgment on that issue as to HPK will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     HC\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   Plaintiffs further allege that HC is a willful infringer. The allegations of knowledge as to HC, however, are extremely weak. Indeed, plaintiffs make no effort in their opposition to separately cite evidence\n   supporting HC's willful infringement-they only refer collectively to \"Hamamatsu\" and \"defendants.\" (ECF 526 at 10-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Of the evidence that plaintiffs cite to support their contention that HPK was actively monitoring SiOnyx's patent portfolio, the only things that point to knowledge by HC are (1) the January 2006 report from HC to HPK summarizing Harvard's work, which includes citations to two pending patent applications that name Carey and Mazur as inventors and that are great-grandparent and great-great-grandparent applications of the asserted '467 patent (ECF 474-3); and (2) an updated version of that report from October 2006, explaining that Carey had left Mazur's lab to found SiOnyx and that SiOnyx had received seed funding, (ECF 474-9); and (3) the June 21, 2007 email between HPK and HC employees forwarding a news article about Harvard's failure to patent certain aspects of its technology (ECF 474-11). The 2006 report was written long before the patents-in-suit were filed by someone in the \"University Sales/Marketing\" department, not an intellectual-property person. The 2007 article generally discusses Harvard's technology transfer office, with only a few paragraphs about Mazur, one mention of SiOnyx, and no citation to any specific patents. There is no evidence that HPK and HC regularly communicated about intellectual property matters. Although HC knew about the collaboration between HPK and SiOnyx-its secretary signed the non-disclosure agreement on behalf of HPK-there is no evidence that HC knew what happened during or after the collaboration, or knew that HPK kept the wafers and possibly copied the technology. HC's corporate representative testified at its deposition that it first learned of the patents-in-suit when the lawsuit was filed. (ECF 474-4 at 41:7-11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   Even taken together, that evidence is insufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that HC knew of the patents-in-suit. At most, it shows that HC's University Sales department was interested in Mazur's work at Harvard in in 2006 and 2007, and knew of two published patent applications many generations away from the asserted patents here. There is no allegation that HC conducts research and development in this area or regularly researches patent applications; it only sells products HPK develops. Nor is the evidence sufficient to show any culpable behavior by HC-all of the evidence tending to show copying and allegedly misleading statements about HPK's development of the accused products implicates HPK. Again, plaintiffs do not even attempt to separate what it alleges to be HC's culpable conduct from HPK's, which does not bolster their claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Plaintiffs contend that even if HC did not actually know of the asserted patents, the evidence establishes that it was willfully blind to them.\n   <em>\n    Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v.

Thus, plaintiffs have failed to show that HC was willfully blind to the asserted patents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Plaintiffs further contend that subjective recklessness is enough to support a finding of willful infringement under\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   , and, therefore, they need only establish that \"Hamamatsu and Ocean knew\n   <em>\n    or should\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    have known\n   </em>\n   of Plaintiffs' Patents and, thus, that developing the Accused Products unreasonably risked infringement thereof.\" (ECF 526 at 9 (emphasis added) ). To the extent plaintiffs are arguing that enhanced damages can be warranted where an accused infringer \"acts '\n   <em>\n    knowing\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    having reason to know\n   </em>\n   of facts which would lead a reasonable man to realize' his actions\" create an unreasonable risk of infringement, that appears to be correct.\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597516\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1923/#p1930\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1933\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court need not decide that question at this time, because it concludes that the evidence is not strong enough to support a finding that HC should have known about the asserted patents in this case. But it is at least doubtful, in light of\n   <em>\n    Halo\n   </em>\n   , whether evidence establishing that an infringer should have known of the existence of certain patents (but did not know their exact contents) can suffice to establish that it should have known that its particular actions were infringing and therefore that its behavior was \"egregious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Accordingly, summary judgment will be granted to HC as to plaintiffs' claims of willful infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     Ocean Optics\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   The complaint does not allege willful infringement by Ocean Optics.

To the extent plaintiffs now wish to advance that claim, the only evidence they have put forward to show that Ocean Optics knew of the patents is (1) that Ocean Optics approached SiOnyx to purchase black silicon; (2) that SiOnyx and HPK/HC were the only competitors in the market for laser-processed silicon, NIR-enhanced photodiodes; and (3) that Ocean Optics was aware that SiOnyx's products were \"unique.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   Those facts, alone, are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact as to willfulness. There is no evidence that Ocean Optics knew of any of Harvard's or SiOnyx's patents. The corporate representative of Ocean Optics testified that it did not learn of the asserted patents until it was named as a defendant in the first amended complaint in early 2016. (ECF 474-5). There is no evidence to the contrary-for example, to show that Ocean Optics even knew about the 2007 SiOnyx-HPK collaboration or that HPK could possibly have copied SiOnyx's technology.
