Specifically, affirmatively furthering fair housing means taking meaningful actions that, taken together, address significant disparities in housing needs and in access to opportunity, replacing segregated living patterns with truly integrated and balanced living patterns, transforming racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty into areas of opportunity, and fostering and maintaining compliance with civil rights and fair housing laws.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.152\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7 5.152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Rule also defines other key terms, adding a \"definition of 'data' to collectively refer to 'HUD-provided data' and 'local data,' both of which terms are also defined,\" AFFH Rule, 80 Fed.

The plaintiffs claim that, \"[b]y removing the procedural protections and clear accountability structure of the AFFH Rule, HUD has compelled Plaintiffs to divert significant resources to efforts to counteract the effects of suspension.\" Pls.' Opp'n MTD at 12. This claim falls for two main reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   First, as explained above, the plaintiffs are largely engaged in the same kinds of activities now that they were undertaking before the withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool and even before promulgation of the AFFH Rule, namely, education, research, advocacy, and counseling. For example, the plaintiffs allege that HUD's withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool has forced them to \"put[ ] greater resources into community education efforts, without the benefit of the focused AFH process to do it more efficiently.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13. The plaintiffs' argument admits, however, that even without the withdrawal of the Tool, they would be engaged in the same activity-withdrawal of the Tool merely makes their efforts less \"efficient[ ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The plaintiffs' declarations further reveal that withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool has not required that they spend more on operational costs. For example, before withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool, Texas Housers \"hired researchers, consultants and contractors to develop information and policy solutions around locally specific fair housing issues that could be addressed through the AFH process,\" \"organized and conducted many small and large community meetings,\" and \"trained local residents on the requirements of the AFH rules.\" Texas Housers Decl. \u00b6 7. In these efforts, Texas Housers spent at least $60,000, which represents only part of its work.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (providing amounts of money spent on AFH efforts in Fort Worth (\"at least $7,000\"), Amarillo and Lubbock (\"at least $13,000\"), and Hidalgo County (\"at least $40,000\") ). After HUD's withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool, Texas Housers continues to \"participate[ ] in a number of conference calls with national partners,\" \"provide[ ] an\n   on line webinar,\" \"communicate with[ ] many jurisdictions in Texas,\" and \"invest resources in educating local groups.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 22. Now, rather than expend money and resources helping local groups understand and participate in the AFH process, Texas Housers is expending resources encouraging local jurisdictions to continue following the AFH process. In fact, although Texas Housers contends that it will, for instance, \"be required to expend additional resources\" in Hidalgo County \"to secure compliance by HUD,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14, Texas Housers provides no dollar figure to show an increase in its operational costs over those costs associated with ensuring this jurisdiction fully complied with the AFH process. The other plaintiffs have similarly failed to demonstrate that withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool has caused them to modify the general nature of their daily activities or to increase the amount of money they spend on their operational costs.\n   <em>\n    Compare, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , NFHA Decl. \u00b6 6 (explaining that, after the AFFH Rule was promulgated, NFHA \"provided training, technical assistance, and support to NFHA members that were engaging in the community participation process\" for AFHs)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10 (noting that, after withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool, NFHA is \"developing written materials to help members continue advocating for effective AFFH activities in their communities and counseling and providing technical support to individual members\").

For instance, several local government agencies in Hidalgo County, Corpus Christi, and Fort Worth prepared deficient AFHs and, without the LG2017 Tool in place and the HUD submission requirement, these jurisdictions have no incentive to work on improving their AFHs and thus will submit equally deficient AIs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Texas Housers Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 14-16; Texas Appleseed Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 15-21. The same evidence of the deficient AFHs, however, demonstrates that, even\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   the LG2017 Tool in place, these jurisdictions fell short of complying with HUD guidance and requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Texas Appleseed Decl. \u00b6 16 (discussing Hidalgo County Consortium's failure to \"consider and accept or reject any of the comments [the plaintiffs] submitted\" on its AFH);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3608883,1587251\" index=\"337\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/793/1303/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining Hidalgo county's failure to \"examine neighborhood level segregation and disparities in access to opportunity\" in its AFH); Texas Housers Decl. \u00b6 15 (noting Fort Worth's failure to \"address important civil rights issues\" in its AFH);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16 (providing that Corpus Christi's AFH \"barely acknowledged massive housing loss, extended displacement, and infrastructure impacts caused by Hurricane Harvey just a few months earlier\").

Essentially, the plaintiffs in this case have asked this Court to undo HUD's choice among alternative mechanisms for overseeing local government agencies' compliance with a particular component of agency-administered grant programs, while the statutory requirement remains intact, the agency rule remains at least in part effective, and the plaintiffs' mission-driven activities, though more challenging, continue unimpeded. The Court is without jurisdiction to micromanage agency choices on program implementation when the plaintiffs bringing suit lack a cognizable injury to their mission of having program participants fulfill an important statutory requirement more effectively and also do not have a cognizable injury that is caused by the challenged agency action or fully redressable, even if that agency action were ordered reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This premise is incorrect-withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool did not suspend the AFFH Rule. Although the AFFH Rule and the Assessment Tool are related, the AFFH Rule remains in effect despite the withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool. For example, as discussed above, the new definitions promulgated in the AFFH Rule remain active, as do the new provisions requiring recordkeeping, community participation, and certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"368\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%205.152\">\n    24 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 5.152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 5.158, 5.166, 5.168.

Although the provisions specifically relating to development, submission, and revision of AFHs are dormant until a new Assessment Tool is published, other provisions in the AFFH Rule remain active and binding on program participants.

Thus, withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool merely placed local government program participants on the same footing as the other types of program participants, for which HUD had never issued an applicable Assessment Tool.

HUD correctly asserts, as explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   Part III.A, that the AFFH Rule remains operative and responds that it acted reasonably in withdrawing LG2017 given the high AFH failure rate and the costs HUD would have been required to expend to assist program participants in submitting compliant AFHs.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

The plaintiffs' critical appraisal of HUD's reasons for withdrawing the LG2017 Tool raises legitimate concerns but, ultimately, falls short of establishing that the reasons HUD provided are arbitrary or capricious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   The plaintiffs first contend that HUD failed to adequately explain its decision to withdraw the LG2017 Tool because it did not explain why the low acceptance rate of initial AFH submissions was problematic,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 22, why HUD's expenditure of resources made the LG2017 Tool unworkable,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 24, how purported deficiencies in the Tool caused these problems,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 26, and why these problems could not be fixed by a measure short of withdrawing the Tool,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27. Many of these concerns speak for themselves. In withdrawing the LG2017 Tool, HUD explained that, between October 2016 and December 2017, HUD had \"received, reviewed, and issued initial decisions on 49 AFHs submitted by local government program participants,\" but that, of these submissions, \"a significant proportion of program participants had difficulty completing or understanding how to use the Tool to complete acceptable AFHs.\" LG2017 Withdrawal Notice, 83 Fed. Reg. at 23,923. Only 37 percent of the initial submissions were \"determined to be acceptable on initial submission,\" and another\n   28 percent of the submissions \"were accepted only after the program participants submitted revisions and additional information in the form of addendums in response to HUD's technical assistance.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23,923 -24. HUD explained that \"[t]he high failure rate from the initial round of submissions\" and \"the level of technical assistance HUD provided to this initial round of 49 AFHs\" impacted its decision because that assistance \"cannot be scaled up to accommodate the increase in the number of local government program participants with AFH submission deadlines in 2018 and 2019.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23,923. The low acceptance rate was especially problematic because HUD had issued the LG2017 Tool in an attempt to \"clearly convey[ ] the analysis of fair housing issues and contributing factors that program participants must undertake\" to submit a compliant AFH, LG2017 Announcement,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=82%20Fed.%20Reg.%204%2C388\">\n    82 Fed.

Given that this Tool was expected to \"guid[e] program participants to produce meaningful AFHs,\" LG2017 Withdrawal Notice, 83 Fed. Reg. at 23,922, the fact that HUD was required to expend considerable resources to assist participants was in direct conflict with the goal of simplifying the AFH process.

Moreover, as explained above, although the plaintiffs characterize the withdrawal of the LG2017 Tool as \"an unexplained 180 degree turn away from precedent,\" Pls.' Mem. PI at 30 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted), the AFFH Rule remains in effect, albeit in a diminished form, and HUD has not indicated abandonment of Assessment Tools altogether. Rather, HUD concluded that withdrawing the LG2017 Tool and soliciting comments for further improvements to \"make it more effective in assisting program participants\" was the best way to affirmatively further fair housing. LG2017 Withdrawal Notice, 83 Fed. Reg. at 23,926. Indeed, the LG2017 Withdrawal Notice explains that the participants' AFH deadlines will be triggered once a replacement Tool is published, and that the participants are required to \"continue to comply with existing, ongoing legal obligations to affirmatively further fair housing (legal obligations which AFHs were merely intended to help participants plan to fulfill).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   HUD thus was not reversing its position but rather taking an action that it perceived would better further the AFFH Rule in the long term.

The FHA does not define, however, the precise methods by which HUD is obligated to affirmatively further fair housing and does not require HUD to adopt certain procedures over others.
