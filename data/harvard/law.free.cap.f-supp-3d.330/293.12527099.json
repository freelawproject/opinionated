During the briefing, held in December 2013, Fox News correspondent James Rosen asked State Spokesperson Jennifer Psaki whether the Obama Administration had held secret direct bilateral talks with Iran in 2011, and whether Psaki's predecessor had lied to him by denying that such talks had occurred. During the exchange, Psaki implied that her predecessor had lied to Rosen. That same day, the State Department uploaded a video of the briefing to its website. Nearly three years later, in May 2016, Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes reportedly admitted that secret talks with Iran\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   in fact occurred in 2011. And within days, Rosen reported that State had omitted approximately eight minutes of the December 2013 briefing-including Psaki's responses to his questions about the Administration's secret talks with Iran-from the online version of the video, without explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Plaintiff American Center for Law and Justice (\"ACLJ\") submitted a FOIA request to the State Department for records relating to the portion of the video that was allegedly deleted or otherwise manipulated. On June 28, 2016, ACLJ filed the instant action to compel State to produce the relevant records. The parties cross-moved for summary judgment, with their dispute focused on (1) whether State's redactions pursuant to the attorney-client, deliberative process, and presidential communications privileges under FOIA's Exemption 5 were proper, and (2) whether State withheld factual information in those documents that was reasonably segregable. For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant in part and deny in part State's motion and deny ACLJ's cross-motion. The Court will grant summary judgment for State, and deny summary judgment for ACLJ, with respect to two documents redacted for the attorney-client privilege and 14 documents redacted for the deliberative process privilege. The Court will otherwise deny both the motions without prejudice and will give State the opportunity to provide further justification for redacting the remaining three documents at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In support of these redactions, State has submitted an amended\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, and two supporting affidavits from the State official charged with responding to FOIA requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entries 1, 3-4, 6-10; ECF No. 26-2 (\"Stein Decl.\") \u00b6 16; ECF No. 32-1 (\"2d Stein Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 5-9.

With respect to the remaining two-documents C06206248 and C06189797-the Court does not have sufficient information to determine whether the privilege applies. The 16 documents fall into six categories, and are discussed in more detail below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    1. December 3, 2013 Emails Preparing for State's Daily Press Briefing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   State redacted a December 3, 2013 email thread containing a discussion of press strategy on Iran-related topics in preparation for its press briefing held later that day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 6 (citing\n   C06197841). Psaki, who ran the briefing, was copied on the thread.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06197841. Psaki's office, the Bureau of Public Affairs (\"PA\"), was ultimately \"responsible for communicating timely and accurate information\" to the media. Stein Decl. \u00b6 16. According to State, the withheld material contains \"deliberations about press strategy and points to be made on topics related to Iran\" involving both State's Deputy Spokesperson Marie Harf and Rhodes. 2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 8. This material is predecisional, in that the recommendations were sent prior to the press briefing. It is also deliberative because it contains recommendations that appear, in context, to be part of the \"give-and-take of the consultative process\" leading up to a press briefing.\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . State's assertion that these are recommendations, and not final decisions, is further confirmed by the fact that neither Harf nor Rhodes was clearly \"senior\" to Psaki-Harf was Psaki's subordinate in the PA, and Rhodes worked in a separate executive branch entity.\n   <em>\n    Access Reports v. DOJ\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3488530,10546660\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/926/1192/\">\n    926 F.2d 1192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1195 (D.C.

May 9, 2016 Emails Discussing State's Response to Rosen's Inquiry\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Before publishing his story on the edits to the video, Rosen reached out to State for comment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06206248 at 8. State redacted seven email threads containing discussions about how to respond to Rosen's inquiry. 2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entries 3, 4, 7. Rosen sent his inquiry at 5:10 p.m. on May 9, 2016 to Office of Press Relations Director Elizabeth Trudeau and others, stating that he expected a reply within the next 30 minutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06201418. What ensued, State asserts, were \"time-sensitive, back-and-forth discussions about how to respond\" to Rosen. 2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 6. At 6:01 p.m. that same day, Trudeau confirmed that she had spoken to Rosen.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06206248 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   With respect to six of these seven email threads, State has shown that the withheld material is both predecisional and deliberative.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06224640; C06201418; C06197855; C06219552; C06193231; C06197857. First, the emails sent in these six threads were all sent\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   Trudeau's confirmation that she had spoken to Rosen, and thus were predecisional. Second, State asserts that the withheld material consists of \"proposals, recommendations, opinions, and questions\" to assist Trudeau, who was \"ultimately responsible\" for responding to Rosen. 2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 6. This assertion is corroborated by the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and the unredacted content of the documents themselves. In the first email thread, two State officials discussed the appropriate response to Rosen's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 7; C06224640. In the second and third email threads, State officials asked each other for insight into this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06201418; C06197855. In the fourth email thread, a State official asked a National Security Council (\"NSC') official for background information.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 4; C06219552. In the fifth and sixth email threads, a group of State officials discussed, and suggested revisions to, talking points on how to respond to Rosen's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 3; C06193231; C06197857. Therefore, the Court finds that State has adequately established that the withheld material is deliberative, as it shows the \"give-and-take of the consultative process\" in crafting the appropriate response to Rosen's inquiry.\n   <em>\n    Coastal States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n    617 F.2d at 866\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because\n   the redacted material in these six email threads is both predecisional and deliberative, the Court concludes that the deliberative process privilege applies to it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The seventh email thread, document C06206248, contains a redacted email in which Trudeau confirmed to her colleagues that she had spoken to Rosen. Emails both\n   <em>\n    prior to\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   this confirmation email are redacted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06206248. The Court cannot tell whether the privilege applies to the confirmation email, and the emails sent afterwards; obviously, these documents are not predecisional with respect to State's response to Rosen's inquiry. It is possible that the privilege does apply here- if, for example, the emails contain discussions about a follow-up response to Rosen, or about how to handle press inquiries on this topic in general. But State has not made this clear in its filings. Thus, before making its privilege determination, the Court will allow State to provide further context on document C06206248, as described below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    3. May 10, 2016 Emails Discussing Draft Talking Points Authored by State's Bureau of Iranian Affairs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   State redacted three May 10, 2016 email threads containing a discussion of draft talking points for use in addressing news stories about the video.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 10 (citing C06219467; C06219548; C06219550). According to State, these talking points contain \"anticipated questions and draft answers\" originally authored by State's Office of Iranian Affairs (\"OIA\") for use by State's PA.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3787061,1386646\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/854/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As stated earlier, the PA was the office ultimately \"responsible for communicating timely and accurate information\" to the media. Stein Decl. \u00b6 16. In the first email thread, an OIA official asked an NSC official to clear a press-guidance document.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06219548. The two continued this discussion in the second email thread, in which the NSC official suggested edits. C06219550;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 7. In the third email thread, the OIA official consulted with Harf for suggested additions to the talking points.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   C06219467.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court finds that the redacted discussion in these three email threads is predecisional and deliberative. The \"decision\" in this instance is not a press briefing, or how to respond to a particular press inquiry, but rather the development of a set of talking points to address future press inquiries. This activity is protected by the deliberative process privilege.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Citizens for Responsibility &amp; Ethics in Wash. (\"CREW\") v.

State asserts that the redacted discussion is deliberative because the withheld material does not include \"directives flowing from a superior to a subordinate in his or her chain of command.\" 2d Stein Decl. \u00b6 7. The unredacted portions of the documents support this claim-they show a back-and-forth discussion about how to revise these talking points. Also, the withheld material is predecisional in that there is no indication that the talking points were ultimately finalized, or even used. Thus, the Court concludes that the redacted material in these three email threads is covered by the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    4.

Again, as State asserts, the PA was \"responsible for communicating timely and accurate information\" to the media. Stein Decl. \u00b6 16. The redacted talking points here are predecisional, in that they were prepared \"in advance of\" the press briefings. Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 8.

Upon review of a redacted copy of the document, as well as the State Department's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index and affidavits, the Court finds that it is unable to determine whether the withheld material is covered by the presidential communications privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Document C06190112 is a December 2013 email thread that begins with an exchange between a reporter and Meehan.

State further explains that, \"[i]n the course of developing advice for the President on matters that concern national security and topical issues related to foreign policy, NSC and White House officials regularly consult subject matter experts in the Department.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20758267\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In State's view, \"[d]isclosure of the withheld information would reveal the process by which the President receives national security advice from close advisors, and would reveal details about the advice generated in that process.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to State's\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, \"the withheld information includes information about the subject and timing of a meeting, and the decision reached in that meeting.\" Am.\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index, Entry 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Here, the redacted communication was authored by Meehan, an NSC official who appears to qualify as an immediate White House adviser.

Although the email thread includes a reporter's inquiry about an alleged \"face-to-face meeting\" between U.S. and Iranian officials in Oman in July 2012, C06190112, there is no indication that this is the same \"meeting\" to which State refers. Indeed, as for the meeting State has invoked, it has not described its timing, attendees or even its subject matter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU v.
