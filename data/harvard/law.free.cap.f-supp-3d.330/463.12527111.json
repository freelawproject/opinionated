INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On September 18, 2015, Plaintiff Wanda J. Wright, appearing\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , filed suit in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia against her former employer, the National Railroad Passenger Corporation (\"Amtrak\"), and her union, Amtrak Police Fraternal Order of Police New Jersey Lodge 189 (\"FOP\"). Plaintiff claimed that she was wrongfully terminated after sustaining work-related injuries and that FOP breached its duty of fair representation. Defendants properly removed the case to this Court,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Aug. 15, 2016 Order, ECF No. 19, and separately moved to dismiss. On March 27, 2017, the Court granted leave for Plaintiff to file an Amended Complaint invoking the Railway Labor Act (\"RLA\"), ECF No. 42, which was considered together with the original complaint.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Mar. 27, 2017 Mem. Op. (\"Mem. Op. I\"), ECF No. 41. The Court could not resolve on the sparse record (1) whether, as FOP argued, Plaintiff's breach-of-duty claim is time-barred, and (2) whether, as Amtrak argued, Plaintiff's admitted failure to exhaust her administrative remedies should be excused. Therefore, it denied both motions.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court, following a period of discovery, are Amtrak's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 57, and FOP's Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 58. Plaintiff has filed an opposition that addresses both motions, ECF Nos. 64, 65 (exhibits), and FOP and Amtrak have each filed a reply, ECF Nos. 67 and 68, respectively. The Court finds from the evidence in the record that Plaintiff's claim is timely but that no reasonable jury could find that FOP breached its duty of fair representation, which Plaintiff also must prove to succeed against Amtrak. Therefore, Defendants' motions will be granted for the reasons explained more fully below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's Request for FOP Assistance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Meanwhile, on December 13, 2013, Plaintiff requested assistance from FOP President Valerie Sousa with appealing Amtrak's \"denial of restricted duty.\" FOP Ex. 23 at 406. In a response dated December 30, 2013, Sousa, citing prior correspondence with Plaintiff, stressed that \"the only appeal we can work on is the ADA denial if you were denied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   FOP Facts \u00b6\u00b6 20-21 (recounting Sousa's request to Plaintiff to provide any application \"to the ADA panel as well as the denial\"). Sousa added: \"As far as other complaint and grievance appeals - yes the Labor Committee prepares appeals. That is a big part of what we do.\" FOP Ex. 23 at 406. Plaintiff replied on Friday, January 3, 2014, that she had \"called human resources several times to request a Request for Reasonable Accommodations form, but no one has returned my call.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , FOP Ex. 24 at 408.

In an update to union members dated October 6, 2014, First Vice President Sharon Patterson informed that Sousa's resignation was unexpected, the Executive Board had called an emergency meeting to convene three days later, and \"any member [who] was talking directly with President Sousa regarding a union issue that she was handling on your behalf\" should contact her Regional Vice President by e-mail.

Expiration of Plaintiff's IOD Status and Medical Disqualification\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On October 3, 2014, Amtrak notified Plaintiff that her IOD status (since December 16, 2013) would expire on October 10, 2014, and provided an ADA Accommodation Request form \"should you wish to request some other accommodation.\" FOP Ex. 31 at 500. Amtrak followed up with a letter to Plaintiff dated October 14, 2014, confirming that her IOD leave had expired on October 10\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   \"in accordance with Rule 27 of the collective bargaining agreement\" and that her \"final pay for this covered time period will be issued on October 24, 2014.\" FOP Ex. 37 at 515. The letter further conveyed that \"Amtrak Medical Services has been notified of the expiration of your IOD time [and] will provide further information on your employment status.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In a letter to Plaintiff dated October 16, 2014, Medical Services referenced the Medical Director's determination \"that you are medically disqualified from your job as a Police Officer\" and set out \"several options\" for Plaintiff, which included applying for permanent disability through the Railroad Retirement Board; seeking other positions within Amtrak for which Plaintiff may be medically qualified to perform; applying for an accommodation through the ADA Panel; or submitting medical documentation that \"your medical condition has sufficiently improved to allow you to perform this job safely.\" FOP Ex. 38 at 517.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    E. FOP's Assistance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In \"early November 2014,\" Plaintiff contacted FOP Vice President Patterson \"about the October 14 letter from Amtrak,\" FOP Facts \u00b6 38 (citing Ex. 16), and an investigation ensued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patterson emailed Deputy Chief Lisa Ann Shahade on November 6, 2014, contesting the expiration date of Plaintiff's IOD status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shahade responded with an e-mail on November 13, 2014, listing the time periods that Plaintiff \"was on paid IOD leave for a reported injury\" and concluding that \"the APD fulfilled its obligation to this officer under Rule 27.\" FOP Ex. 17 at 201. Shahade added: \"As information, during the interim period of 1/31/12 to 12/16/13, the officer was assigned to a paid restrictive duty assignment (roughly 23 months).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   In an e-mail to Plaintiff also dated November\n   13, 2014, Patterson wrote: \"We will definitely have to file a grievance on your behalf. Injury On Duty and Restricted Duty (Light Duty) are two different things.\" FOP Ex. 17 at 201. Noting that Plaintiff was \"out on two [ ] injuries,\" Patterson asked Plaintiff \"to meticulously outline for both injuries dates that you were out (not working) and dates you were working Light Duty\" and to provide \"supporting documentation[,] ... a must to dispute management.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response to Plaintiff's inquiry on November 20, 2014, about her appeal and employment status, Patterson replied the next day: \"We as the union don't start out with appeals. We are still looking into your case. The only recourse for the Union on your behalf is to file a grievance and request that you receive the remaining Line of Duty pay.\" FOP Ex. 40 at 519-20. Patterson summarized the discussion she and Pearlson had with Labor Relations, including that Plaintiff was \"medically disqualified as a Police Officer in October 2014.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 519. Patterson asked if Plaintiff had received the disqualification letter and concluded: \"We need to speak to you face to face,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , which occurred on December 1, 2014, FOP Facts \u00b6 47. The next day, on December 2, 2014, Plaintiff provided the union representatives \"a more recent\" report from her treating physician concluding that Plaintiff \"could perform her duties with restrictions, 'no running, no [heavy] lifting.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48 (quoting Ex. 44 at 534, Oct. 22, 2014 Treating Physician Medical Status Report, Statement of Disability).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On December 8, 2014, Pearlson sent Plaintiff a detailed \"outline of a proposed grievance and evaluation of [the] merits of her case[,]\" FOP's Facts \u00b6 49, stating his intent to present his conclusions \"to our labor attorney so I can file a grievance on your behalf[,]\" Ex. 43 at 529. The gravamen of the proposal challenged Amtrak's removal of Plaintiff from approved restricted duty on December 13, 2013, its termination of Plaintiff's pay under CBA Rule 27 on October 24, 2014, and its calculation of Plaintiff's IOD time as running continuously from 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pearlson posited that each time Plaintiff \"returned to work on a restricted duty capacity ... caus[ed] a break in [her] IOD time\" and thus \"should have reset the clock [to] a full 18 months.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, Plaintiff \"should have 18 months of IOD from 12/16/13 when [she] was forced to return to IOD.\" Pearlson proposed to seek as a remedy Plaintiff's return to \"IOD pay effective immediately\" and \"back pay from 10/14/14 until present.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Pearlson offered also that Plaintiff's reasonable accommodation request \"was misplaced, as you were seeking a temporary accommodation, not a permanent one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Therefore, he advised Plaintiff, among other things, to \"recall\" the accommodation request by writing to Amtrak Medical Services and asserting the error.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following Plaintiff's comments about the proposal on December 9, 2014, FOP Ex. 45, but before replying to her,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ex. 47, FOP submitted Plaintiff's grievance on December 12, 2014, asserting violations of Rule 27 of the CBA. Ex. 46 at 540-49. The next day, Pearlson forwarded the grievance to Plaintiff and explained that the \"initial grievance\" was submitted to \"ensure our argument is not time barred,\" since the \"time limit expires tomorrow.\" FOP Facts \u00b6 52 (quoting Ex. 47). Pearlson had calculated the time \"based on the date\n   of Assistant Chief Shahade's response to the FOP dated November 13, 2014.\" FOP Ex. 51 at 570.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Notwithstanding FOP's intent, Plaintiff's grievance was denied as time-barred. By letter dated January 8, 2015, Amtrak Police Department Inspector Kathleen Harasek found: (1) that Plaintiff's claim predicated on being \"forced\" from a restricted duty assignment on December 16, 2013, \"should have been filed within 30 days from the date of occurrence, or December 16, 2013. It was not\"; and (2) that Plaintiff \"was advised that her IOD time expired in written correspondence dated October 14, 2014 to her listed address. Any claim about additional IOD time should have been filed by mid to late November, 2014. It was not.\" FOP Ex. 48 at 554. Harasek explained that \"[t]he FOP's request for information concerning the Department's actions does not alter contractually set time limits or 'restart' a filing time period. Rule 5 requires a claim or grievance to be filed within 30 days from the date of occurrence on which the claim or grievance is based.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As for the merits of the grievance, Harasek found that \"no violation of Rule 27 in any manner, shape or form\" had occurred, reasoning that Plaintiff \"was paid, in accordance with parameters set by the Rule, for over 580 calendar days in addition to any approved restricted duty assignments. The FOP's assertion that another IOD time period is required is simply without Rule support.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Harasek further found that the CBA confers no right to restricted duty work, that such assignments are \"designed as a transition to help police officers who expect to return to full duty within a period of 60 days,\" and yet Plaintiff \"was on IOD time and restricted duty assignments for over 3.75 years.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 555.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 13, 2015, FOP, having yet to receive Haresek's decision, appealed Plaintiff's grievance to Labor Relations in \"accordance with the timelines outlined under Rule 5 of [the] CBA,\" Amtrak Ex. 35 at 233, and it met with Labor Relations on January 26, 2015, FOP Facts \u00b6\u00b6 56-57. \"Amtrak maintained its position on the expired IOD,\" with which FOP's attorney eventually agreed was correct, FOP Facts \u00b6 58, but \"offered to allow [Plaintiff] to return to full duty or accept another position with Amtrak ... outside the police department.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In a letter to Plaintiff dated April 24, 2015, Pearlson set out the actions FOP had taken on her behalf from December 1, 2014, when they first met to discuss Plaintiff's \"work related injury,\" to March 20, 2015, when Plaintiff advised of her intent \"to return to work full duty with the Amtrak Police Department\" but had yet \"to provide the Amtrak Medical Department with the necessary documentation.\" FOP Ex. 51 at 570-71. Pearlson concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   Currently, your grievance remains 'tabled' with labor relations, in essence Amtrak and the FOP agree to hold off on the issue. Based on your last statement to me, I am requesting you provide the Amtrak Medical Department with medical documentation that would return you to work.

While admitting to having received \"more discovery\" since previous inquiries about her bad faith claim,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3970170\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/82/#p86\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3970170\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/825/82/#p86\">\n    at 161:11-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Plaintiff implied that she had not received proper responses to her \"requests\" and repeatedly \"apologize[d]\" for being unable to \"honestly\" state her bases of bad faith and discrimination. Dep. at 163:3-5. In her opposition under the section addressing exhaustion, however, Plaintiff asserts that Amtrak \"refused to Answer [her]interrogatory No. 15, ... asking if [Amtrak] has [a]written policy on medical disqualification as it relates to APD police officers\" and surmises that if it had, Amtrak \"would have not objected to this question\" as irrelevant \" 'to this action.' \" Pl.'s Opp'n at 12 (citing Amtrak's Supp. Answers &amp; Objections to Wanda Wright's Interrogatories). Plaintiff does not tie that question to her inability to provide a factual basis in support of her claims of bad faith and discrimination against FOP, and the Court discerns no such connection. Moreover, Plaintiff has not cited any testimony in her deposition that identifies what other discovery she needed to support such allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   By contrast, the record is replete with evidence of FOP's prompt and diligent efforts to obtain a remedy for Plaintiff. As set out above in Part II, shortly after Plaintiff contacted FOP in early November 2014, Patterson emailed Deputy Chief Shahade to contest the expiration date of Plaintiff's IOD status, asserting: \"If Officer Wright was returned to IOD\" on December 16, 2013, \"then she should continue to receive payment until June 2015\" at 100 percent from \"December 16, 2013 to March 2014\" and at 80 percent for fifteen months, \"April 2014 to June 2015.\" Amtrak Ex. 8 at 117. After Shahade provided the dates from APD's records that Plaintiff \"was on paid IOD leave for a reported injury\" and otherwise \"assigned to a paid restrictive duty assignment (roughly 23 months),\" FOP's Ex. 46 at 543, Patterson promptly informed Plaintiff that IOD and restricted duty \"are two different things\" and that FOP \"will definitely have to file a grievance on your behalf.\" FOP Ex. 17 at 201.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In addition, Patterson and Union Secretary David Pearlson met with Amtrak's Labor Relations Department on November 17, 2014, to discuss Plaintiff's case, FOP Facts \u00b6 42, provided Plaintiff a detailed written analysis of the merits of her case and a proposed grievance on December 8, 2014, FOP Facts \u00b6 49 (quoting Ex. 43), and filed the grievance on December 12, 2014, in what it had calculated in good-faith to be a timely manner. The grievance sought as remedies (1) Plaintiff's \"immediate return to IOD pay,\" (2) back pay from December 16, 2013 \"to make her whole in accordance with Rule 27,\" and (3) Plaintiff's \"return to restricted duty and payment of medical bills among other relief.\" FOP Ex. 48 at 554. Before receiving Haresek's adverse decision, FOP sought to preserve\n   the grievance by appealing it to Labor Relations in \"accordance with the timelines outlined\" in CBA Rule 5, and then continued to press Plaintiff's concerns with Labor Relations. FOP urged Plaintiff to provide the necessary medical documentation to Labor Relations to enable her return to work as she desired.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FOP Ex. 51 and Facts \u00b6\u00b6 56-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   No reasonable jury presented with the foregoing evidence could find for Plaintiff on the breach of duty claim. Nor is there any evidence of a breach of the CBA.
