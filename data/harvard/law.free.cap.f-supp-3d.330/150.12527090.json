This Court has already determined the fate of most of the defendant assets and purported claims in prior opinions. The question now before the Court is whether to grant [226] the government's motion for entry of default and final judgment against two of the remaining defendant properties. For the reasons described below, the Court will enter default judgment against these two properties but will not certify this judgment as final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On November 18, 2013, the United States filed a verified complaint seeking civil forfeiture of assets totaling more than $500 million in value.

Although he is a claimant in this proceeding, his participation in the litigation does not allow him to challenge the forfeiture of defendant assets to which he has no claim.

That outcome \"would effectively invert the purpose of Rule 54(b) from one of enhancing the appellate rights of a losing party in circumstances when delay of an appeal would cause undue hardship or possible injustice, to one in which a prevailing party could prematurely force an appeal of part of a case by a losing party, who must comply with timeliness requirements for exercising appellate rights.\"\n   <em>\n    Stewart v. Gates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4278352\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/frd/277/33/#p36\">\n    277 F.R.D. 33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 36 (D.D.C. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Moreover, even assuming the asserted interests of the government outweigh the interests of Ibrahim Bagudu, the risk of piecemeal appellate review tips the scale against entry of final judgment. As the government rightly notes,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Gov't's Reply at 2-3, Ibrahim Bagudu and the other litigants whose claims were struck do not\n   have standing to contest or appeal the forfeiture of assets to which they have no claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. All Assets Held\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=712%20Fed.%20Appx.%2013\">\n    712 Fed. Appx. 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 15 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per curiam). Hence, any challenge to the default judgment would necessarily require the litigants first to challenge this Court's March 5, 2018 Order striking their claims to the Blue Holdings (1) Assets.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   But the Court's decision to strike the Bagudu litigants' claims is inextricably bound up in the ongoing litigation concerning the Blue Holdings (2) Assets. The litigants' theory of standing, which this Court rejected, was based on their status as beneficiaries of the discretionary trusts and applied equally to both the Blue Holdings (1) and Blue Holdings (2) Assets. Accordingly, while the claims to Blue Holdings (1) Assets may be separable from the remaining claim to the Blue Holdings (2) Assets, the predicate issue of whether the litigants have standing to assert claims to each of these defendants is not. If the Bagudu litigants were to challenge on appeal this Court's order striking their claims to the Blue Holdings (1) Assets, the D.C. Circuit necessarily would need to evaluate the validity of the litigants' standing theory as to\n   <em>\n    both\n   </em>\n   the Blue Holdings (1) and Blue Holdings (2) Assets. Even if the D.C. Circuit were able to partition its review of the March 5 decision such that it only considered this Court's conclusion to strike the litigants' claims to the Blue Holdings (1) Assets, the D.C. Circuit would then have to determine the validity of the litigants' standing theory twice: once as to the Blue Holdings (1) Assets on appeal now from the default judgment and then again later as to the Blue Holdings (2) Assets after all litigation has concluded. This is precisely the type of \"piecemeal\" appellate review that district courts have been instructed to avoid. Hence, this Court finds there is good reason to delay certification of the default judgment against the Blue Holdings (1) Assets as final.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Court is satisfied that it has the power to enter default judgment against the Blue Holdings (1) Assets and that the entry of a default judgment and order of forfeiture is warranted. However, because this Court's predicate determination that the Bagudu litigants do not have standing is not separable from ongoing proceedings, the Court finds that certification of the default judgment as final is not appropriate. The government's motion therefore will be granted in part and denied in part. A separate order will issue on this date.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    There were initially ten claimants, but two withdrew their claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Unopposed Mot. to Withdraw Verified Claims of Zainab Shinkafi Bagudu and R.A.B.
