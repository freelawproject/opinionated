CROTTY, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This action is about an undocumented immigrant who has been detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") pending deportation, Petitioner, Pablo Antonio Villavicencio Calderon, unlawfully entered the United States in 2008. Subsequently, at an immigration proceeding in March 2010, he agreed to voluntarily depart the country by July 15, 2010. But Petitioner overstayed his welcome. Petitioner has continued to reside in this country, and as a result, the order of voluntary departure has been converted into a final order of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Although he stayed in the United States unlawfully and is currently subject to a\n   final order of removal, he has otherwise been a model citizen. Petitioner married Ms. Sandra Milena Carmona Chica, a United States citizen. He now has two children, both of whom are United States citizens. He has no criminal history. He has paid his taxes. And he has worked diligently to provide for his family.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Petitioner seeks to continue contributing to his family and community, and to that end, he commenced the process of regularizing his immigration status to become a lawful permanent resident. Specifically, he commenced the process of obtaining a provisional unlawful presence waiver, which is an initial step toward immigration status adjustment. In February 2018, Ms. Chica filed, on Petitioner's behalf, with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\"), a petition for alien relative (\"Form I-130\"). requesting that USCIS recognize Petitioner as Ms. Chica's spouse. USCIS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (the \"DHS\"), is currently processing the I-130 petition, and has scheduled an interview for Petitioner. Once Form I-130 is approved, Petitioner plans to apply for permission to reapply for admission into the United States (\"Form I-212\") and, subsequently, for a provisional unlawful presence waiver (\"Form I-601A\"), as outlined in regulations promulgated by the DHS.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , pp. 956-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The prospect of regularizing his immigration status was set back when, on June 1, 2018, while making a pizza delivery at Fort Hamilton in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, base security found that Petitioner had an outstanding warrant of deportation. He was held by base security until he was turned over to ICE, a law enforcement agency within the DHS, and since then, he has been detained by ICE at the Hudson County Correctional Facility in Kearny, New Jersey. ICE seeks to remove Petitioner to his country of origin, Ecuador.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On Saturday, June 9, 2018, Petitioner filed this petition for a writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , requesting the Court to order Jefferson B. Sessions III, Kirstjen Nielsen, Thomas Decker, and the DHS (\"Respondents\")\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to: (1) release him from custody; (2) enjoin Respondents from removing him from the New York City area; and (3) stay his removal from the United States pending resolution of this petition. ECF 1. Petitioner asserts five claims, including that his present detention and impending removal violate the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\") and the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Judge Nathan, sitting as the Part I judge, enjoined Respondents from transferring Petitioner from the New York City area and from transferring the Petitioner from the jurisdiction of the New York Field Office of the Office of Enforcement and Removal operations. She set July 20, 2018 as the hearing date, which was later adjourned to July 24, 2018. On that day, the Court heard oral argument from both parties and considered their arguments and submissions. The Court granted the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and Petitioner was immediately released.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   This\n   opinion explains why the petition was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   It should not be difficult to discern that families should be kept together rather than be separated by the thoughtless and cruel application of a so called \"zero tolerance\" policy. This is especially so where the organization seeking removal has also provided a pathway for a person in Petitioner's position to regularize his immigration status with minimal disruption to his family life. Petitioner should be allowed to pursue the pathway. He deserves it due to his hard work, his dedication to the family, and his clean criminal record, Rather than provide him with this opportunity, however, Respondents inexplicably want to remove him. There is no justification for this mercurial exercise of executive power. Justice demands that Petitioner be accorded an opportunity to pursue the relief the law allows. Anything less would violate the APA and the U.S. Constitution. So long as Petitioner is pursuing the relief the law allows, he may not be removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner seeks an order releasing him from custody and staying his removal until he exhausts his right to pursue a provisional unlawful presence waiver, an initial step towards his immigrant status regularization. Petitioner contends that his detention and impending removal violate his due process right and the APA because the detention and the impending removal interfere with his opportunity to seek the waiver. Petitioner seeks a fair opportunity to engage in the immigration process that the DHS itself has promulgated for someone in his precise position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Respondents oppose this sensible request for relief. Respondents contend that the Southern District of New York is not proper venue for the instant petition; and even if it were, the Court lacks jurisdiction to review the Petitioner's claims. Respondents also challenge the merits of the claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   For the reasons set forth below, the Respondents' arguments are rejected, and the petition is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

In the immigration context, it may be said that the \"immediate custodian\" rule does not control, and its applicability depends on whether the petitioner challenges the present physical detention (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a \"core\" habeas challenge) or other statutory or constitutional violations (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a \"non-core\" habeas challenge).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   For a non-core habeas challenge, courts in this circuit have consistently held that the proper respondent is a person or entity that has\n   <em>\n    legal custody\n   </em>\n   of the petitioner, also known as a \"legal custodian.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garcia-Rivas v.

Petitioner, in effect, asks the Court to depart from the clear majority rule for core challenges and conclude that the proper respondents here are the legal custodians regardless of the type of challenge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Court agrees with Petitioner. \"[T]he appropriate respondent in a habeas suit[ ] depends primarily on who has power over the petitioner and ... on the convenience of the parties and the court.\"\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   , 157 F.3d at 122, \"[T]he convenience of the parties and the court\" disfavors selectively applying the immediate custodian rule for core challenges.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Since the non-core challenges predominate, it simply makes no sense to apply the legal custodian rule to the non-core challenges and the immediate custodian rule to the core challenges, and then litigate in separate venues. In these circumstances, \"the convenience of the parties and the court\" favors applying the same custodian rule to both the core challenges and non-core challenges,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   , and because the predominant non-core challenges clearly belong to legal custodians, the core challenges go along, as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   It is also clear that the power over Petitioner is vested in legal custodians, which, again, favors application of the legal custodian rule.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the detention facility here is merely providing service to ICE, pursuant to an Inter-Governmental Service Agreement (\"IGSA\"). That agreement provides that detainees can be released and discharged only from and to properly identified ICE personnel. Detainees cannot be released without the express authorization of ICE; ICE, and only ICE, may authorize release of any detainee. ICE is in complete control of detainees' admission and release. With due respect to the warden of the Hudson County Correctional Facility, the IGSA places the warden in the role of a mere functionary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the warden cannot respond to merits of the claims underlying the habeas petition. The warden simply does not have any information to answer for federal authorities, nor does the warden have any reason to litigate these claims here. \"[F]or the great majority of habeas cases, which involve prisoners held in penal institutions, the [immediate custodian] rule made sense, and still does.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122. But when the warden of the detention facility has no literal power to produce the petitioner, and cannot provide meaningful answers to important factual and legal questions, there is no reason to apply the immediate custodian rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , the Court notes ICE's tendency to detain aliens in remote custodial facilities and then insist on applying the immediate custodian rule.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125. For example, children separated from their parents at the Mexican border are transported to New York where they are held. The Court does not believe that this is accidental or random.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the Court believes ICE may be attempting to take advantage of the immediate custodian rule to frustrate detainees' connections to their support system of families and friends; retention of competent immigration counsel; and effective participation in the proceedings. This is not an appropriate for application of the immediate custodian rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   This Court is not the first to conclude that legal custodians are proper respondents under appropriate circumstances. As\n   <em>\n    Henderson\n   </em>\n   noted, \"the rules treating the immediate custodian as the only proper respondent and that person's situs as the sole correct venue have not been applied consistently or in a rigid fashion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 124. The Supreme Court took a \"flexible approach\" in several habeas cases to hold that a legal custodian was a proper respondent \"for the limited purposes of habeas corpus jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 125 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Strait v.

Petitioner merely asks the Court to review whether ICE has the legal authority to remove Petitioner pursuant to an admittedly valid order of removal without affording him the opportunity to first engage in an immigration process that the DHS itself made available to people like him. That is not a challenge to the removal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court's conclusion is not inconsistent with\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   . The plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   sought \"to force an adjudication on the merits of\" an I-212 application that had been previously denied on a procedural ground, and the Second Circuit held that\n   such a claim was an indirect challenge to an order of removal.\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5645393\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/643/52/#p55\">\n    643 F.3d at 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But the plaintiff's claim in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   was fundamentally different from the Petitioner's claim here. The plaintiff's claim in\n   <em>\n    Delgado\n   </em>\n   was premised on more than a right to seek access to a lawful regulatory process; it was premised on a right to remain in the United States, that if USCIS were to reach the merits of her I-212 application, she would be granted the right to remain in the United States. That is not what Petitioner claims here. Petitioner claims only that he has a\n   <em>\n    right to seek access\n   </em>\n   to a lawful regulatory process that the DHS makes available to people in his precise position, and seeks review of ICE's legal authority in executing an order of removal notwithstanding his right. Looked at another way, Petitioner seeks consideration of his legitimate and authorized pursuit of an existing process\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the government exercises its right to remove. That is not a claim of a right to remain in the United States. That is neither a direct nor indirect challenge to his removal order.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Accordingly, the Court holds that Sections 1252(a)(5) and (b)(9) do not strip the Court's jurisdiction over the Petitioner's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Violation of APA and Fifth Amendment of U.S. Constitution\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Both the APA and the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protect persons from an arbitrary governmental interference with the persons' rights and liberty. When a government agency makes available an immigration process to a class of persons but then deprive a member of the class a fair opportunity to engage in the process, with no explanation or justification, that is an arbitrary governmental interference. It is not unlike giving a person a job, and then taking away the tools necessary to perform the job. It is simply not right.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court concludes that Petitioner has a right to engage in DHS's process for obtaining a provisional unlawful presence waiver. That process completely covers the situation in which Petitioner finds himself. The Court further concludes that the execution of an outstanding removal order without any explanation or justification, in preference to Petitioner's right to seek a provisional unlawful presence waiver, is arbitrary and unjustified, in violation of the APA and the Fifth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Petitioner has Right to Engage in Immigration Process Made Available to Him.\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     i.\n    </strong>\n    <em>\n     Process for Obtaining Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   An alien who is not eligible to adjust his or her status in the United States must obtain an immigrant visa abroad, But if an alien travels abroad to obtain an immigrant visa while a final order of removal is pending against the alien, the alien may not return to the United States for up to 10 years even with a subsequently-issued valid immigrant visa\n   <em>\n    unless\n   </em>\n   the alien was previously granted an\n   unlawful presence waiver of inadmissibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Typically, an alien cannot apply for a waiver of inadmissibility until after immigrant visa interviews are held abroad.

Specifically, the Court orders Respondents to stay removal of Petitioner until the occurrence of one of the following events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) Denial of Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf (\"Form I-130\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (2) Denial of his Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission (\"Form I-212\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (3) Denial of his Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (\"Form I-601A\");\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     or\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (4) Approval of Forms I-130, I-212,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     and\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   I-601A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The Court further\n   <strong>\n    ORDERS\n   </strong>\n   Respondents to release Petitioner from custody while the stay of removal is in force. The Supreme Court has made it clear that, although the INA permits detention for a \"period reasonably necessary to secure removal\" beyond the statutorily authorized 90 days, \"if removal is not reasonably foreseeable,\" the continued detention is unreasonable and no longer authorized by the INA.\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. at 699-700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   To be clear, Respondents cannot subject Petitioner to an Order of Supervised Release while the release order is in force. Respondents contend that ICE's supervision would not contravene the Court's order and that the supervision is authorized by the INA. ECF 25. The Court disagrees.\n   <em>\n    First\n   </em>\n   , the Order of Supervised Release by ICE would be in conflict with the Court's order to release Petitioner from custody. \"Custody\" in the context of a federal habeas statute includes supervised release.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scanio v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1848611\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/37/858/#p860\">\n    37 F.3d 858\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 860 (2d Cir. 1994). Accordingly, ICE's Order of Supervised Release would be in conflict with the Court's release order. Respondents do not have any authority to modify this Court's order.\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , contrary to the Respondents' claim, the INA does not authorized supervision here. The INA authorizes supervision only when the alien subject to a final order of removal is \"pending removal.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201231\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(3) (\"the alien,\n   <em>\n    pending removal\n   </em>\n   , shall be subject to supervision under regulations prescribed by the Attorney General.\" (emphasis added) ). Here, the removal of Petitioner has been stayed,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   p. 959, and thus the removal is no longer \"pending.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, Respondents do not have any supervision authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants the petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The Court concludes that Respondents have attempted to strip the Petitioner's right to seek a provisional waiver with no explanation or justification. That is a violation of the APA and the Petitioner's due process right. Accordingly, the Court orders Respondents to stay removal of Petitioner from the United States until Petitioner exhausts his right to seek a Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver. Specifically, the Court orders Respondents to stay removal of Petitioner until the occurrence of one of the following events:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (1) Denial of Petition for Alien Relative on his behalf (\"Form I-130\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   (2) Denial of his Application for Permission to Reapply for Admission (\"Form I-212\");\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   (3) Denial of his Application for Provisional Unlawful Presence Waiver (\"Form I-601A\");\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   (4) Approval of Forms I-130, I-212,\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   I-601A.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The Court further orders Respondents to immediately release Petitioner from custody while the stay of removal is in force because removal is no longer reasonably foreseeable.
