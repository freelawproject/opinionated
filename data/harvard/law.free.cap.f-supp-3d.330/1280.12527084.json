BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on: (i) the Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint (R. Doc. 3) and Compel Arbitration, filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 5)(\"Motion\"); and (ii) the Surreply in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Class Action Complaint and Serve [sic], filed January 10, 2018 (Doc. 16)(\"Surreply Motion\"). The Court held a hearing on June 27, 2018. The primary issues are: (i) whether the Court has diversity jurisdiction to adjudicate this case when the citizenship of one of the parties is unclear; (ii) whether the arbitration agreement into which Plaintiff Ryan Patterson and Defendant Nine Energy Service, LLC (\"Nine Energy\") entered contains adequate consideration; (iii) whether the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable, because it contains a unilateral carve-out allowing Nine Energy to request injunctive relief in court to protect its confidential information; and (iv) whether the arbitration agreement is substantively unconscionable, because it provides only sixty days after a dispute arises in which to file a demand for arbitration. The Court concludes that the parties have not established diversity jurisdiction, so the Court will order the parties to show cause why the Court should not dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On the merits, if the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court is inclined to conclude that the Arbitration Agreement contains adequate consideration, and, although the injunctive relief provision is substantively unconscionable, it is also severable. Further, the Court is not inclined to hold the Arbitration Agreement's sixty-day limitations period unconscionable. Finally, if the Court has subject-matter jurisdiction, the Court is inclined to stay proceedings in this case, rather than dismissing it. Accordingly, the Court is inclined to grant the Motion in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Patterson worked for Nine Energy, an oilfield services company, from March to October of 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   First Amended Class Action Complaint \u00b6 5, at 2, filed November 13, 2017 (Doc. 3)(\"Amended Complaint\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   His \"primary job duty consisted of operating pressure control equipment and tools.\" Amended Complaint \u00b6 15, at 3. Nine Energy first offered Patterson employment via letter on February 28, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Sally Haynes, Human Resources Manager, to Ryan Patterson at 1-2, (dated February 28, 2017), filed January 3, 2018 (Doc. 14-2)(\"Offer Letter\"). Patterson's Offer Letter states that his employment is contingent upon an enumerated list of items, including drug testing, physical capacity testing, and other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1. The Offer Letter does not mention arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1-2. Patterson accepted the employment offer by signing the Offer Letter on March 1, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 2. Patterson did not begin work at Nine Energy until March 20, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Sharon Warren \u00b6 7, at 2 (dated January 3, 2018), filed January 3, 2018 (Doc. 14-1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 1, 2017 -- the same day that Patterson signed the Offer Letter -- he also signed the Confidentiality and Dispute Resolution Agreement at 6, filed December 6, 2017 (Doc. 5-2)(\"Arbitration Agreement\"). The Arbitration Agreement states that \"the Company and the Employee agree to submit exclusively to final and binding arbitration any and all Disputes as defined herein in accordance with the following understanding and terms.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. The Arbitration Agreement defines the word \"dispute\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   all legal and equitable claims, demands, disputes, controversies, issues, and disagreements, of whatever nature or kind, whether in contract, tort, under statute or regulation, or any other law or source of legal obligation, including but not limited to those relating to, concerning, or arising out of this Agreement; the interpretation or subject matter of this Agreement or program ... wages or other compensation received by or owed to any Employee, including minimum wage and overtime pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 2. The Arbitration Agreement continues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Each Dispute shall be arbitrated on an individual basis. The parties forego and waive any right to join or consolidate their Disputes or claims with those of any other employee ... or to assert any Disputes or claims in arbitration as a representative or as a member of a class.... Neither the Company nor any employee or applicant for employment may pursue any Dispute or claim on a class action, collective action, or consolidated basis or in a representative capacity on behalf of other individuals, or participate as a class or collective action member in such a proceeding.... The Parties waive any right to a jury trial and to pursue or participate in class or collective actions with respect to Disputes that are subject of this Agreement and for which a jury trial, class action, and collective action would otherwise be available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3. The Arbitration Agreement contains several other important provisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 3-4. One states that \"arbitration shall be commenced by either Party filing a demand for arbitration with the AAA\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   within 60 days after such Dispute has arisen.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. Another notes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Notwithstanding the provisions of this Agreement, the Company may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief to enforce the Employee's obligations with respect to the confidentiality and protection of trade secrets and other non-public information belonging to the Company, or with respect to any non-competition,\n   non-solicitation, or any other restrictive covenant provisions in any separate agreement between the Company and the Employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 4. Still another provision states: \"The Parties acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the Parties' employment relationship affect and involve interstate commerce, and that this Agreement is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 5. Finally, the Arbitration Agreement contains an integration clause, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either Party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.... This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter herein, in particular the Parties' agreement regarding the protection of Confidential Information and the procedural mechanism for the final resolution of Disputes and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, clauses, provisions, representations, or promises, whether oral or written, of the Parties to the extent they relate to or concern the subject matter herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 5. Patterson now alleges in this class action that Nine Energy failed to pay him and other employees overtime wages in violation of the New Mexico Minimum Wage Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.M.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2050-4-22\">\n    N.M.

Patterson subsequently filed the Amended Complaint on November 13, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint at 1. Nine Energy filed the Motion on December 6, 2017.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Nine Energy moves the Court to dismiss this case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and to compel arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. Nine Energy first contends that Patterson's claims fall within the Arbitration Agreement's scope, because the Arbitration Agreement's provisions \"cover all disputes, claims, or disagreements relating to Plaintiff's employment.\" Motion at 5. Nine Energy then argues that the Arbitration Agreement contains adequate consideration, asserting that \"the bargained for exchange in this case was Plaintiff's offer of employment with Nine Energy in exchange for signing the Confidentiality and Dispute Resolution Agreement as well as the Parties' mutual agreement to submit all employment disputes to arbitration.\" Motion at 6. Turning to the class action allegations, Nine Energy avers that the Arbitration Agreement expressly states that the parties waive any right to participate in a class or collective action regarding any disputes subject to the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7-8. Nine Energy concludes that the Court should grant the Motion and compel Patterson to arbitrate his claims on an individual basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Patterson responds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint and Compel Arbitration, filed January 2, 2018 (Doc. 13-1)(\"Response\"). Patterson first asserts that the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4. According to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement section allowing Nine Energy to bring an action for injunctive\n   relief in court to enforce an employee's confidentiality obligations, such as the protection of trade secrets, represents a unilateral carve-out favoring Nine Energy and is therefore unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 4-5. Second, Patterson avers that the Arbitration Agreement contains no consideration and is thus illusory.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5. According to Patterson \"continued at-will employment cannot serve as consideration for an agreement to arbitrate,\" which Patterson asserts is the Arbitration Agreement's purported consideration. Response at 6-7.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nine Energy replies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant's Reply in Support of Motion to Dismiss the First Amended Class Action Complaint and Compel Arbitration, filed January 3, 2018 (Doc. 14)(\"Reply\"). Nine Energy first asserts that the Arbitration Agreement's consideration is Patterson's initial offer of employment and not continued at-will employment, because Patterson signed the Arbitration Agreement on the same day he accepted his employment offer and did not begin working for Nine Energy until twenty days later.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 5. Additionally, Nine Energy contends that \"there was separate, valid consideration for the Agreement. In exchange for Plaintiff agreeing to arbitrate his employment-related disputes, Nine Energy promised not only to hire Plaintiff, but also to provide him access to its confidential information and trade secrets.\" Reply at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, Nine Energy argues that, while part of the Arbitration Agreement may exempt Nine Energy from arbitration, other parts of the agreement contain \"exclusions for numerous types of employment-related claims that Plaintiff alone would be able to pursue.\" Reply at 9. Nine Energy continues that \"the exclusion of which Plaintiff complains relates to one limited form of relief -- injunctive relief -- that only the employer might be able to pursue to protect its confidential information and trade secrets.\" Reply at 9. According to Nine Energy, \"[i]t is impossible that the Plaintiff would be able to bring such a claim, just as it is impossible that Nine Energy would be able to bring any of the claims excluded for Plaintiff (i.e. EEOC charges, NLRB charges, unemployment claims).\" Reply at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Finally, Nine Energy contends that, \"[e]ven if the Court were to find this provision unconscionable, the Court can and should modify or sever the provision rather than invalidating the entire Agreement.\" Reply at 11. According to Nine Energy, the provision allowing it to bring an action for injunctive relief to protect confidential information \"is not relevant or intertwined with the agreement to arbitrate compensation disputes, and severability is in line with the strong federal policy underlying the FAA favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements.\" Reply at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n    <em>\n     The Surreply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Patterson filed a surreply.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply in Opposition to Defendant's Motion to Dismiss the Class Action Complaint and Compel Arbitration, filed January 10, 2018 (Doc. 16-1)(\"Surreply\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Patterson first asserts that Nine Energy's employment offer was not contingent on signing the Arbitration Agreement, so the employment offer is not consideration for the agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 4. According to Patterson, Nine Energy's employment offer cannot be consideration for Patterson agreeing to arbitration, because the Offer Letter provides a list of contingencies, none of which include signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 6. Further, according to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement \"contains an explicit merger clause that prevents the Offer Letter -- or any other oral/written agreement -- from being incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement or for serving as the consideration for the Agreement.\" Surreply at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Second, Patterson takes issue with Nine Energy's assertion that it promised to provide confidential information and trade secrets to Patterson as consideration for him signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 6-7. According to Patterson, the Arbitration Agreement \"does not require Defendant to disclose any specific confidential information or trade secrets.\" Surreply at 7. Patterson adds that \"no New Mexico court has reached the conclusion that an agreement to provide confidential information is adequate consideration for an agreement to arbitrate.\" Surreply at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Third, Patterson argues for the first time that the Arbitration Agreement is unconscionable, because \"the terms of the agreement prevent Plaintiff from vindicating his statutory rights under the FLSA.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Surreply at 7. Specifically, Patterson contends that the Arbitration Agreement's provision requiring arbitration to commence within 60 days after a dispute arises is unconscionable, because \"the FLSA's limitations period may not be shortened by contract.\" Surreply at 8. Finally, Patterson avers that the Court should not sever any allegedly unconscionable provisions of the Arbitration Agreement, because the agreement contains no severance clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 9-10. Patterson instead concludes that the Court should refuse to enforce the entire Arbitration Agreement and deny the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Surreply at 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    5.\n    <em>\n     The Hearing\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court held a hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Draft Transcript of Motion Hearing at 1:10-11 (taken June 27, 2018)(Court)(\"Tr.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nine Energy began by asserting that \"Mr. Patterson in the briefing concedes that this Court has recognized ... that an offer of at will employment is sufficient consideration for an arbitration agreement. And that's exactly what we have here.\" Tr. at 4:19-24 (Mann). Patterson responded that the Arbitration Agreement's integration clause precludes any outside oral or written agreement -- including Patterson's employment offer -- from being incorporated into the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 10:1-9 (Siegel). Patterson added that the Offer Letter lists several contingencies that Patterson had to meet to accept his employment offer, none of which includes signing the Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 13:2-9 (Siegel).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The parties then discussed unconscionability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 17:1-5 (Mann). Nine Energy asserted that Patterson \"latches onto a portion of the agreement ... that reserves to Nine the right to seek injunctive relief to enforce certain aspects of the agreement pertaining to confidential information.... What Mr. Patterson chooses to ignore [is] that the same paragraph on which he bases this argument contains multiple carve-outs solely for the ... plaintiff here.\" Tr. at 17:1-14 (Mann). Nine Energy thus contended that the carve-outs in the Arbitration Agreement are bilateral and not unilateral.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 18:3-6 (Mann).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Patterson then returned to the podium and asserted that the Arbitration Agreement is substantively unconscionable for the separate reason that it \"has effectively shortened the statute of limitations period.\" Tr. at 22:15-16 (Siegel). Specifically, Patterson argued that the Arbitration Agreement shortens the limitations period from three years to sixty days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 22:21-24 (Siegel). Nine Energy responded that \"the parties cannot limit statute[s] of limitations by contract. So even if that language is contained in the agreement [, were] it be attempted to be enforced it could not.\" Tr. at 25:9-13 (Mann).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Court then asked if Nine Energy contended that, if the Court were to find any provision unconscionable, it should sever the provision rather than not enforcing the entire agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 28:25-29:7 (Court, Mann). Nine Energy responded that, if the Court concluded that a provision is unconscionable, then Nine Energy would prefer the rest of the agreement enforced.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 29:8-16 (Mann). At the hearing's conclusion, the Court stated that it was inclined to grant the Motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 35:2 (Court).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   An arbitration agreement is a contract or a provision in a contract whereby parties agree to \"settle by arbitration a controversy ... arising out of such contract or transaction.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202\">\n    9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, however, Patterson's employment offer was not consideration for him signing the Arbitration Agreement. By its own terms, the Arbitration Agreement never mentions Patterson's employment offer or acceptance. Further, the Arbitration Agreement states: \"This Agreement, which sets forth the terms of the dispute resolution program, is a contract but it does not modify any 'at-will' employment relationship between the Company and Employee.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. More importantly, the Arbitration Agreement contains an integration clause, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either Party that are not set forth expressly in this Agreement.... This Agreement sets forth the entire agreement of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter herein,\n   in particular the Parties' agreement regarding the protection of Confidential Information and the procedural mechanism for the final resolution of Disputes and supersedes all prior understandings, agreements, clauses, provisions, representations, or promises, whether oral or written, of the Parties to the extent they relate to or concern the subject matter herein.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 5. This language precludes Patterson's employment offer -- which is in the Offer Letter and not in the Arbitration Agreement -- from providing consideration for the Arbitration Agreement. Further, Patterson's Offer Letter states that his employment was contingent upon an enumerated list of items, including drug testing, physical capacity testing, and other things.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1. The Offer Letter, however, does not mention arbitration.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Offer Letter at 1-2. In short, the Arbitration Agreement says that it does not modify any at-will employment relationship, never mentions Patterson's employment offer, and contains a broad integration clause. On top of that reality, the Offer Letter does not mention arbitration. On these facts, the Court cannot properly conclude that Patterson's employment offer served as consideration for the Arbitration Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Despite this ruling, however, both parties' arguments miss the point. The Arbitration Agreement itself contains adequate consideration on its face, independent of any employment offer.

The Arbitration Agreement states that \"the Company and the Employee agree to submit exclusively to final and binding arbitration any and all Disputes as defined herein in accordance with the following understanding and terms.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. The Arbitration Agreement defines the word \"dispute\" as\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   all legal and equitable claims, demands, disputes, controversies, issues, and disagreements, of whatever nature or kind, whether in contract, tort, under statute or regulation, or any other law or source of legal obligation, including but not limited to those relating to, concerning, or arising out of this Agreement; the interpretation or subject matter of this Agreement or program ... wages or other compensation received by or owed to any Employee, including minimum wage and overtime pay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Arbitration Agreement at 2. The Arbitration Agreement continues: \"The Parties waive any right to a jury trial ... with respect to Disputes that are subject of this Agreement and for which a jury trial ... would otherwise be available.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. Thus, both parties exchanged sought-after promises to forfeit their respective rights to a jury trial and to arbitrate any claim defined as a \"dispute.\" Arbitration Agreement at 3. For example, Nine Energy surrendered the right to bring tort claims against Patterson for negligently damaging its expensive oilfield equipment or stealing it,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   the\n   torts of negligence or conversion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Arbitration Agreement at 2 (defining the word \"dispute\" to include torts). Conversely, Patterson exchanged away the right to bring claims for \"minimum wage and overtime pay\" in court. Arbitration Agreement at 2. Both parties therefore mutually exchanged sought-after promises to arbitrate, rather than litigate, a multitude of potential claims.

Thus, although Patterson has pled that Nine Energy is a Delaware LLC, he has not pled the location of Nine Energy's principal place of business. Accordingly, the Court will still enter an order to show cause why this case should not be dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    The Court notes that\n    <em>\n     Mark V\n    </em>\n    does not apply to this case.\n    <em>\n     Mark V\n    </em>\n    announced that \"we discuss the appropriate methods for a trial court to use in determining whether a contract contains ambiguous terms and in resolving any ambiguities thus discovered.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"583\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1993-NMSC-001\">\n     1993-NMSC-001\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , \u00b6 1,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"731537\" index=\"584\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nm/114/778/\">\n     114 N.M. 778\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 845 P.2d at 1233.
