This matter is presently before the Court on \"Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment\" (Docket No. 23) (the \"Motion\"). The Agency argues that summary judgment is appropriate because it has conducted a reasonable search for the requested documents and has properly withheld certain information under the FOIA exemptions provided by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(3), (b)(5) and (b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Johnson opposes the Motion, arguing that the search was inadequate and that the alleged exemptions do not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After careful consideration of the parties' written and oral arguments, the Motion is hereby DENIED. First, while the search was reasonable in some respects, the Agency was unreasonable in limiting its search related to the second request to one Agency department and in failing to search for the document sought in the third request. Next, while the Agency correctly applied Exemption (b)(3), it improperly asserted Exemption (b)(5) and Exemption (b)(6). The parties are ordered to meet and confer regarding additional productions in accordance with this Order. The parties shall file a joint status report within 21 days of the date of this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     STATEMENT OF FACTS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     The FOIA Requests\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Plaintiff in this case is Dr. Amanda Johnson, who, at the time she filed the\n   relevant FOIA request, was a PhD candidate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Research Affiliate at Harvard University. FOIA Request at 1. On December 19, 2014, Dr. Johnson submitted a FOIA request seeking three sets of records related to the Agency's use of the social media platform Twitter. DF \u00b6 1; PF \u00b6 1. Dr. Johnson studies the government's use of social media and submitted the FOIA request for the purpose of using Agency documents in a research article. FOIA Request at 1. The requests were as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   1. A copy of any electronic or written communication, including emails and email attachments, discussing the CIA's public-facing Twitter account,\n   <em>\n    @CIA\n   </em>\n   , sent between Twitter, Inc. or a representative thereof, and any employee in the CIA's Office of Public Affairs. The request is meant to include both records sent from Twitter to CIA personnel as well as records sent from CIA personnel to Twitter. This correspondence would exist, as it is a necessary component of the process by which Twitter certifies certain accounts as \"verified,\" and the CIA has a verified Twitter account. CIA Director of Public Affairs Dean Boyd discussed the CIA's use of this verified, public-facing Twitter account on the CBS News story available at http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cia-twitter-account-an-inside-look-cia/.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   2.

This request includes any documents that speak to the style or tone that agency personnel are directed to adopt in their use of this account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   3.

Docket No. 1. During the course of pretrial proceedings, the parties met and conferred in an attempt to resolve, or narrow, their dispute. The Agency eventually responded to the FOIA request with the production of eighteen documents, a substantial portion of which were redacted. Joint Status Report at 2. Dr. Johnson, through counsel, responded to the production raising various concerns about the sufficiency of the search and of the production. PF \u00b6 3. The Agency declined to conduct any additional searches and elected to proceed with its motion for summary judgment.

Shiner, the Agency's Litigation Information Review Officer. Shiner Decl. \u00b6 2. Therein, Ms. Shiner explains that in processing Dr. Johnson's three requests, officials from the Agency's Information Management Services (\"IMS\") office, the department that receives FOIA requests, worked with the Office of the General Counsel (\"OGC\") to develop a search strategy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

First, it explained that the search did not produce a \"verification email\" or similar communication, as referenced in Dr. Johnson's first request, because verification of the Twitter account was completed via telephone. Shiner Decl. \u00b6 13. Second, in response to Dr. Johnson's contention that documents responsive to the second request would exist in the records of the Publications Review Board (\"PRB\"), among other places, the Agency explained its position that the PRB is only responsible for ensuring that classified information is not improperly disclosed and, as such, the Agency contends that it would not be the correct location to search for the training materials sought.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The search was completed on June 26, 2017, and the Agency produced eighteen records in response to Dr. Johnson's first and second requests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 8, 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . No records were produced in response to the third request. Supp. Shiner Decl. \u00b6 5. After the Plaintiff challenged the cut-off date the Agency had used for the production, the Agency acknowledged its error and produced a few more documents.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In support of her contention, Dr. Johnson points to a statement in a newspaper article where, in response to the question \"[h]ow did the CIA get control of the @CIA handle?,\" a department spokesman is quoted as saying \"CIA filed an impersonation complaint with Twitter and they secured the @CIA account for us, which is routine for government agencies.\" Sellars Decl.

As cited above, the second request reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   A copy of any documents or materials, including but not limited to, guides, manuals, handbooks, policies, or presentations used to instruct or train agency personnel in the use of the agency's public-facing Twitter account,\n   <em>\n    @CIA\n   </em>\n   . This request includes any documents that speak to the style or tone that agency personnel are directed to adopt in their use of this account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   FOIA Request No. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Dr. Johnson argues first that the Agency failed to search for documents outside of OPA and second that the Agency failed to search for communications and drafts of documents responsive to this request. The Court agrees in part. The Agency was unreasonable to limit its search to OPA but was reasonable in not searching for communications and drafts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <em>\n    Need to Search Other Departments\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The fact that the Agency limited its search for the second request to only one Agency department, OPA, is unreasonable. Unlike the first request, Dr. Johnson did not limit the second request to records within OPA. The Agency defended its narrow search by explaining that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   CIA personnel determined that the [OPA] would be the only Agency office reasonably likely to possess records responsive to Plaintiff's request. The OPA is the office within CIA responsible for communicating CIA's mission to external audiences, and enhancing public understanding of the Agency by managing its web and social media presence. Not only is it the responsibility of the OPA to manage CIA's social media presence, it is the only office within CIA authorized to access the @CIA Twitter account. The OPA Web Team maintains control over content shared via the Agency's social media, and communications with social media platforms for the purposes of account maintenance and verification.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Shiner Decl. \u00b6 9. While this explanation is sufficiently detailed to create a presumption of good faith, contrary indications in\n   the produced documents that responsive documents existed else-where rebut that presumption and preclude summary judgment for the Agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Dr. Johnson argues that Defendant's search should have included records held by the OGC, Chief Information Officer (\"CIO\"), the Web Council and the PRB. Pl. Opp. at 8. In making this argument, Dr. Johnson points to the produced documents, which expressly mention the involvement of other offices in Twitter policies and procedures. First, the OPA Standard Operating Procedures explain that the OGC has significant responsibilities in reviewing the policies of social media sites used by the Agency and in ensuring compliance with regulations related thereto. Sellars Decl. Ex. A (Docket No. 28-2) at 8. It also states that OPA will \"[f]ollow legal guidance provided by OGC[,]\" that \"[o]ther Directorates and Offices and the CIA Web Council may provide or suggest appropriate content[,]\" and that content posted on Twitter will have to go through pre-publication review (conducted by the PRB) before being posted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9, 13. Another produced document states that \"[p]er OPA's Twitter Guidance approved by OGC and CIO, CIA will ONLY follow organizations and other government entities, CIA will NOT follow personal individual accounts.\" Sellars Decl. Ex. B (Docket No. 28-3) at Page 2 of 3. Citing these references, Dr. Johnson argues that the search could not have been adequate if these other departments were not searched. This Court agrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"While the adequacy of a FOIA search is generally determined not by the fruits of the search, but by the appropriateness of the methods used to carry out the search ... if a review of the record raises substantial doubt, particularly in view of well defined requests and positive indications of overlooked materials, summary judgment is inappropriate.\"\n   <em>\n    Public Citizen v.

In light of those references, it was unreasonable for the Agency to draw the conclusion, without providing more of an explanation, that OPA would be \"the only Agency office reasonably likely to possess records responsive to Plaintiff's request.\" Shiner Decl. \u00b6 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The only one of the unsearched offices to be directly addressed in the Agency's Affidavit was the PRB. In support of its position that PRB records did not have to be searched, the Agency declared that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   the [PRB] is the CIA's office charged with reviewing materials produced by CIA personnel ... intended for publication in any form in order to determine whether the proposed materials contain classified information. The purpose of prepublication review is to ensure that classified information, damaging to the national security[,] is not inadvertently disclosed. The PRB is not charged with providing guidance to CIA personnel regarding the use of any particular media.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. Even given these facts, however, if the PRB is tasked with reviewing Twitter content, whether for classification or other purposes, it is likely that the PRB has \"documents or materials ... used to instruct or train agency personnel in the use of the agency's public-facing Twitter account,\n   <em>\n    @CIA\n   </em>\n   .\" FOIA Request No. 2. There is at least enough of a possibility so that the Agency had the duty to expand its\n   search once its search team realized PRB's involvement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In sum, the mention of PRB and other offices in the produced documents are leads sufficient to require the Agency to expand the scope of its search. The Agency was unreasonable in declining to look for documents related to the second request in the OGC, the CIO, the Web Council, and the PRB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Exclusion of Communications and Drafts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Dr. Johnson also objects to the scope of the search for documents responsive to the second request on the grounds that the Agency was unreasonable in not producing communications and previous drafts of documents regarding the Twitter account. Specifically, Dr. Johnson points to the fact that communications between the OPA and ex-CIA Director John Brennan relating to the first post to the Twitter account were not produced, and that messages and responses from listservs discussing social media use, intra-agency communications between personnel responsible for social media, and earlier drafts of produced documents were not produced either. Pl. Opp. at 9-11.

The court differentiated document searches from the creation of documents by ruling that \"a FOIA request for a listing or index of a database's contents that does not seek the contents of the database, but instead essentially seeks information about those contents, is a request that requires the creation of a new record, insofar as the agency has not previously created and retained such a listing or index.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286049\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/233/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4286049\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/898/233/#p271\">\n    at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, while an agency is not compelled to create a new list for a requester, searching for a list that already exists is discoverable through FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The list sought by Dr. Johnson in the third request already exists and must be produced. She is not asking the Agency to create a list of user applications, but rather seeks the currently existing list of user applications available on Twitter's website.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As evidenced by Exhibit O to the Sellars Declaration (Docket No. 28-16), the record sought is a list, accessible to the Agency, already maintained on the Agency's Twitter account. The record exists with regard to all Twitter accounts and would not be created specifically for purposes of the Agency's FOIA response.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Agency is required to search for and produce the record even though it is hosted on Twitter's website because the Agency has sufficient control over the document. \"In order to be considered agency records, the requested materials must be under agency control at the time the FOIA request is made.\"\n   <em>\n    Reich v.

Mass. 2011). \"Federal Courts have looked at four factors to assess whether an agency exercises sufficient control over records: (1) the intent of the document's creator to retain or relinquish control over the records; (2) the ability of the agency to use and dispose of the record as it sees fit; (3) the extent to which agency personnel have read or relied upon the document; and (4) the degree to which the document was integrated into the agency's record system or files.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4181003\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/811/542/#p545\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The balance of the factors leads to the conclusion that the Agency has sufficient control over the applications page sought. As evidenced by Exhibit O to the Sellars Declaration, the Agency can manipulate its applications list by revoking access to certain applications and connecting to others. The makeup of this list is controlled by the Agency's own decisions with regard to its Twitter account. This shows that Twitter has significantly relinquished control over this page to the Agency.

This completes the analysis for step one of the\n   <em>\n    Maynard\n   </em>\n   test. For step two, in determining whether the information falls within the statute, the Agency has provided the Court with insight into its rationale for withholding certain information. It states that \"the information would reveal specific sources and methods of the Agency, including techniques used to protect information systems, guidance regarding counter intelligence threats, and the Agency's agreements with social media providers.\" Shiner Decl. \u00b6 17. The Court has no basis to doubt the Agency's declaration which, if true, would place the redacted information squarely within the protections offered by the CIA Act and the National Security Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Dr. Johnson argues that the exemptions should be waived with regard to employee information that has previously been disclosed to the public. Dr. Johnson cites to\n   <em>\n    N.Y. Times Co. v.

However, in order for the Court to establish waiver of Exemption (b)(3) protection, the requester must point to a disclosure which \"precisely track[s] the records sought to be released.\"\n   <em>\n    Assassination Archives &amp; Research Ctr. v. CIA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3702331,1530069\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/55/\">\n    334 F.3d 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 60 (D.C. Cir. 2003). Dr. Johnson fails to meet that burden here. She argues that the withholdings \"are inappropriate to the extent that they withhold the names of Web Content Manager Carolyn Reams and other publicly-known OPA staff, as the agency has voluntarily identified those persons in public events and presentations, and thus waived their ability to now claim protection from re-revealing their identities.\" Pl. Opp. at 16. It is not the Agency's burden to establish which identities have or have not been disclosed elsewhere. It is only where the requester can show that the precise information released in another context duplicates what is being withheld, that Exemption (b)(3) has been waived. Dr. Johnson's speculation that there are names generally withheld here that have been disclosed in other venues is insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The Agency's redactions under Exemption (b)(3) reflect strategic security decisions made by the Agency that it has supported through the Shiner Declaration and the Vaughn Index.
