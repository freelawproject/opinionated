INTRODUCTION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This case concerns three Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") requests submitted by Plaintiff King &amp; Spalding LLP to Defendants U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (\"HHS\") and U.S. Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") (collectively \"Defendants\"). The court already has ruled on one round of summary judgment motions and, at this stage in the litigation, the only remaining issues pertain to the FOIA requests directed to DOJ. Specifically, Plaintiff challenges DOJ's search for responsive records, as well as its withholding of certain documents under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before the court are the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment. Upon review of the parties' briefs and the present record, the court grants in part and denies in part Defendants' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment and Plaintiff's Renewed Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Plaintiff's FOIA Requests\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2012, the United States Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia (\"USAO-DC\") initiated a criminal and civil investigation of Abiomed, Inc., a medical device company.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 21 [hereinafter Pl.'s Cross-Mot.], Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [hereinafter Pl.'s Stmt.], \u00b6\u00b6 36-37. The investigation centered on marketing and labeling practices for a particular medical device, Impella? 2.5, and ended three years later without any enforcement action.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   The investigation may have commenced when an anonymous\n   source, acting through a private lawyer, disclosed records pertaining to Abiomed to the USAO-DC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 17;\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

On April 14, 2016, counsel for Abiomed, Plaintiff King &amp; Spalding LLP, filed three separate FOIA requests with HHS and two subcomponents of DOJ: the Civil Division and the Executive Office for United States Attorneys (\"EOUSA\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 9-11; Defs.' Mot., Defs.' Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute [hereinafter Defs.' Stmt.], \u00b6 1; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 1. In each request, Plaintiff sought documents concerning Abiomed.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10, 14; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 10, 14. Plaintiff asked for \"[a]ll documents between January 1, 2012 and October 31, 2012, provided to any [federal agency] from any individual, corporation, partnership, or other private party other than Abiomed, Inc.\" that \"concern[ed], discuss[ed], or refer[red] to Abiomed\" or \"related ... to the issuance of a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act subpoena issued by the [USAO-DC] to Abiomed.\" Defs.'

Civil Division Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Civil Division responded to Plaintiff's FOIA request by letter dated June 17, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 11. The letter explained that the Civil Division had located 49 pages of potentially responsive documents and had referred those documents to the EOUSA for direct response, but that a portion of the documents were protected from disclosure by court seal. Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 11; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 11. The letter also advised Plaintiff that it could administratively appeal the Civil Division's response within 60 days. Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 12; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff took no action in response to the June 17, 2016, letter that it received from the Civil Division. Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 13; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 13. According to Plaintiff, it could not have \"appealed\" the letter because the letter \"did not state any determination that the Civil Division was not complying with the FOIA request or any reasons for a decision not to comply\" and therefore did not constitute a \"final response\" from the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 23, 2016, from the records it received from the Civil Division, EOUSA released 27 pages in full and withheld 16 pages in full.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 16; Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6\u00b6 16, 35. According to Defendants, the 16 pages withheld in full are duplicates of documents that EOUSA withheld in full in response to the FOIA request that Plaintiff submitted directly to EOUSA. Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 16;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6 11; Francis Decl., Attach. E. Thus, EOUSA withheld those pages on identical grounds as those discussed below.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    2. EOUSA Request\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Simultaneous with the release of the Civil Division's records, EOUSA responded to the FOIA request directed to it, releasing 344 pages in full and withholding 51 pages in full pursuant to FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D). Defs.' Stmt. \u00b6 15;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 15.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, all told, EOUSA withheld in full 67 pages of responsive material (51 pages responsive to the EOUSA request and 16 pages responsive to the Civil Division request).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl., Attachs. D-E. The undisclosed information generally falls into two categories: \"(1) the names of government personnel, the name of an attorney representing the unnamed source and the names of third parties who appear in the documents provided by the unnamed source under Exemption[s] [6 and] 7(C), and (2) certain material that could reveal the identity of the Government's unnamed source under Exemption 7(D).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King &amp; Spalding, LLP v.

Initial Reply at 7, 20; Second Francis Decl. \u00b6 3; EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 23-26 (documents 13-16). As part of this supplemental release, EOUSA released 46 pages in full and 33 pages in part, withholding any information that fell within the two aforementioned categories pursuant to Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Francis Decl., April 5, 2017 EOUSA Letter, ECF No. 25-2, at 9-11; EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 23-26.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff does not appear to challenge any of these redactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Cross-Mot. for Summ.

Initial Reply at 21 (noting the withholding of attachments to an email labeled document 13, which included the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (\"FDA\") internal draft minutes of a meeting between Abiomed and FDA's Office of Compliance and proposed edits to those minutes, as well as an inspection report of Abiomed);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Second Francis Decl. \u00b6 10; Second Francis Decl., Decl. of Sarah Kotler, ECF No. 25-2, at 12-16 [hereinafter Kotler Decl.], \u00b6\u00b6 6-9; EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 23-24 (document 13). In its first cross-motion for summary judgment, Plaintiff explained that it did not challenge the applicability of Exemptions 4 and 5, provided that Plaintiff was correct in its understanding that \"the government is asserting Exemption 4 to protect confidential commercial information supplied by Abiomed to the government, and Exemption 5 to protect internal notes made by government lawyers that memorialize meetings held between Abiomed and the government.\" Pl.'s Initial Reply at 17. Plaintiff reiterated this point in a Joint Status Report filed after the court denied both sides' initial cross-motions for summary judgment and asked Defendants to define the scope of the material withheld.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JSR \u00b6 18. Defendants did not provide the requested clarification in their present motion for summary judgment,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mot. for Summ. J., ECF No. 32, Mem. in Supp. [hereinafter Defs.' Renewed Mot.], at 4, but Plaintiff did not press the issue further in its renewed cross-motion,\n   <em>\n    see generally\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. (incorporating by reference all previous arguments raised in initial briefing filed in support of summary judgment but failing to mention Exemptions 4 and 5). As the parties have not fully briefed the Exemption 4 and 5 withholdings, the court does not address them here. Instead, as directed below, the parties shall meet and confer regarding the scope of information withheld pursuant to Exemptions 4 and 5 and clarify whether Plaintiff intends to challenge those withholdings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff brought this FOIA action on August 9, 2016,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl., and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on February 7, 2017, and February 28, 2017, respectively,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot.; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. In their initial cross-motions, the parties disputed, among other things: (1) Plaintiff's exhaustion of administrative remedies with respect to the Civil Division request, (2) the adequacy of EOUSA's search, (3) the applicability of FOIA Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D) to the information withheld in response to both the Civil Division and EOUSA requests, and (4) EOUSA's segregability determination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Mot. at 15-28; Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 24-44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 6, 2017, the court denied the parties' motions without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    King &amp; Spalding, LLP\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n    270 F.Supp.3d at 47-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the court only addressed a threshold question raised by the parties' dispute over the applicability of Exemptions 7(C) and 7(D): whether the source of the withheld records is an entity or an individual.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court observed that, as to Exemption 7(C), if the source is an entity, \"then the materials the entity supplied [could not] be withheld ... based solely on the company's interest in nondisclosure,\" because \"the protection of personal privacy under Exemption 7(C) does not extend to corporations.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n    at 48\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly,\n   the court noted that the identity of the source impacted the Exemption 7(D) calculus, which requires the Government \"to present probative evidence that the source provided information ... under either an express or implied assurance that its identity would remain confidential,\" because an implied assurance of confidentiality may be more difficult to establish where the source is entity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n    at 48-49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the court denied the parties' initial cross-motions for summary judgment without prejudice, allowing Defendants to submit additional information concerning the source's identity.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273284\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/270/46/#p47\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On September 22, 2017, Defendants advised the court that they had no more information to offer about the identity of the confidential source.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   JSR. Defendants reported that, \"[b]ecause the source was not identified by the attorney who provided the material on the source's behalf, EOUSA does not know whether the source was an entity or an individual.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Nevertheless, Defendants indicated that they intended to renew their motion for summary judgment with respect to their withholdings under Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D), subject to one exception discussed below.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The parties renewed their cross-motions for summary judgment on November 2, 2017, and November 17, 2017, respectively.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mot.; Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. In their renewed motions, both parties incorporate their previous arguments with respect to segregability, adequacy of the search, and exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mot. at 4; Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. at 19-21. The parties also advance similar arguments concerning the applicability of Exemptions 6, 7(C), and 7(D).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mot. at 5-15; Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. at 9-19. Defendants qualify their earlier position in one respect, however. Because EOUSA does not know whether the source was an entity or an individual-and, correspondingly, does not know whether the source has a legally cognizable privacy interest-Defendants no longer rely on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) as independent bases to justify the complete withholding of records to protect the source's identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Renewed Mot. at 13. But Defendants do continue to rely on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to withhold the names and other identifying information of government personnel and third parties, including the private attorney who communicated with the Government on the source's behalf.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiff, for its part, contends that Defendants cannot meet their burden to justify application of Exemption 7(D) in this case, largely for the same reasons stated in Plaintiff's initial motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Renewed Cross-Mot. at 7-8, 10-18. Plaintiff also takes issue with Defendants' continued reliance on Exemptions 6 and 7(C) to withhold the name of the private attorney who represented the source, as well as the name of his or her law firm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19. Plaintiff is silent, however, as to Defendants' continued reliance on those exemptions to withhold the names of government personnel and third parties whose names may appear in the responsive records.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   ; Pl.'s Reply in Supp. of Renewed Cross-Mot. for Summ.

Following\n   <em>\n    Landano\n   </em>\n   , the D.C. Circuit has identified four factors, originating in the case of\n   <em>\n    Roth v. U.S. Department of Justice\n   </em>\n   , that courts should consider when deciding whether a source received an implied assurance of confidentiality: \"[1] the character of the crime at issue, [2] the source's relation to the crime, [3] whether the source received payment, and [4] whether the source has an ongoing relationship with the law enforcement agency and typically communicates with the agency only at locations and under conditions which assure the contact will not be noticed.\"\n   <em>\n    Labow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055779\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/523/#p530\">\n    831 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383192,3555731\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/1161/\">\n    642 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1184 ). No single factor is dispositive.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 531-32.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Before turning to the individual factors, the court notes the general lack of evidence offered by Defendants to support their invocation of Exemption 7(D)-even after the court gave Defendants a second bite at the apple. Defendants' declarant Tricia Francis, an Attorney Advisor with the EOUSA, provides little context for the anonymous source's disclosure. She does not say, for instance, how the lawyer first contacted the USAO-DC; what the lawyer told the assigned AUSA about his or her client; or what words passed between the lawyer and the AUSA about the document disclosure.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl.; Second Francis Decl. Nor can the court tell much about the withheld records from the limited descriptions contained in the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. The court does not know, for example, whether the records contain trade secrets, proprietary information, or other sensitive data; whether the documents refer to individuals obviously associated with the source; or whether the documents bear any kind of confidentiality markings.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index. Notably, Defendants did not submit any evidence or the documents themselves for in camera consideration. Thus, in terms of details, the court is left wanting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In large part, Francis's declaration contains unhelpful generalities. Francis reports that it is her \"\n   <em>\n    understanding\n   </em>\n   ... that the AUSA did not know the identity of the source on whose behalf private counsel provided information that supported the Government's investigation of Abiomed.\" Second Francis Decl. \u00b6 9 (emphasis added). She also submits that the information provided \"could reasonably reveal the identity of the source\" if released, given that it \"\n   <em>\n    appears to be\n   </em>\n   of a type accessible to a finite group of people and/or attributable to a specific person or group of people.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Francis adds that \"the fact that the source's identity remained anonymous supports the notion that the source wished to provide the government with information in support of its investigation in a confidential manner.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Francis's statements are more notable for what they do\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   say, than what they do say. Francis does not specify whether her \"understanding\" is based on communications with the AUSA who received the records or some other source; explain why the records \"appear[ ] to be\" of a type to which only a small group would have access; nor discuss in what other ways the release of the information might reveal the source. Moreover, while the source's anonymity and the decision to speak through counsel bear some weight, \"anonymity primarily\n   shows that a source wants to remain confidential rather than that there was any assurance that the source would be treated as confidential.\"\n   <em>\n    Ortiz v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n    70 F.3d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734 (2d Cir. 1995) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sea Shepherd I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4309178\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/89/81/#p89\">\n    89 F.Supp.3d at 98\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting confidential-source treatment based merely on a request for anonymity). Finally, the court is perplexed by Francis's assertion that although \"the AUSA did not know the identity of the source,\" disclosing the records still \"could reasonably reveal\" the source's identity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Francis Decl. \u00b6 9. If the AUSA could not decipher the source despite the benefit of compulsory process and access to nonpublic information, then why should the court believe that Plaintiff, who lacks those advantages, is more capable of ferreting out the source?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In any event, the court now turns to the four\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    Character of the crime\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The first factor-the nature of the crime investigated-\"contemplates that sources likely expect confidentiality when they report on serious or violent crimes, risking retaliation.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Labow\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055779\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/523/#p530\">\n    831 F.3d at 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As discussed, EOUSA does not know the identity of the source who provided information to the USAO-DC in support of its investigation of Abiomed.

But absent more facts, the court is in no position to evaluate the validity of that claim or the proximity of the source to the crime. Most obviously, the court cannot make the assessment because Defendants do not know the character of the source.

The lack of identifying information about the author of the markings and the note means that the court cannot draw any inference at all from these documents about the source's proximity to the alleged unlawful activity.

But on this record, the utter lack of specific evidence makes that inference a relatively weak one. The declarant, Francis, tells the court no more than that an unidentified source, acting through a private lawyer, provided the documents to law enforcement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6 18. The EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index provides a bit more color. It suggests that some communication took place by email in February 2012.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EOUSA\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   Index at 22 (document 11). The next dated entries are from May 2012 and are contained in a letter from the lawyer to an AUSA, which encloses documents,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 17 (document 1), and two additional email communications,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22 (documents 9-10). These limited communications, seemingly occurring over a short period of time at the start of the investigation, do not support an \"ongoing relationship\" with the law enforcement agency. Notably, there appear to be no communications in the later part of the three-year investigation. Nor do the communications themselves give rise to a particularly strong inference of confidentiality, as Defendants claim. True the source remained anonymous, but its lawyer did not; instead, the lawyer chose to communicate via traditional methods of letter and email, not in a manner suggesting a need for greater secrecy (such as an in-person meeting). Thus, the fourth\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   factor does not tilt the scales in favor of nondisclosure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The two primary cases on which Defendants rely-\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   , both involving anonymous sources-do not compel a different result.\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   involved an unsolicited, anonymous letter sent to a field office of the Social Security Administration, which triggered a criminal investigation of the plaintiff.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n    70 F.3d at 733-34\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After reviewing the letter in camera, the Second Circuit concluded that the letter, even though unsolicited, was sent with an assurance of confidentiality that reasonably could be inferred from the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Specifically, the court found it \"evident from the nature of the allegations and the contents of the letter that the author was aware of personal details of [the plaintiff's] life.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n    at 734\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   It is reasonable to assume that knowledge of such details places the source of that information in close relationship with, or proximity to, [the plaintiff].... The possibility of retaliation or harassment is reasonable and genuine in a case such as this one where serious allegations are made by someone who may be quite close to the object of those allegations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11928745\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/70/729/#p734\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   is factually similar to\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   . There, the Inspector General of the Army received four anonymous letters accusing officers of the Rhode Island National Guard of serious misconduct punishable either by disciplinary action or court-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p566\">\n    981 F.2d at 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court found the authors of the letters to be anonymous sources who had sent the letters in confidence, in part because of the consequential nature of the allegations and because two of the letters contained \"explicit representations that the writers feared 'reprisal' or 'retribution' (\n   <em>\n    e.g.,\n   </em>\n   loss of employment) in the event their statements were disclosed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p566\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1875104\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/981/552/#p566\">\n    at 565-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To state the obvious, other than the anonymity of the source, this case bears little resemblance to\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   . As discussed, because Defendants have not identified the source as an entity or an individual, the court cannot assess the risks that disclosure would pose. Moreover, the court does not know enough about the documents' contents to find that they contain the type of intimate or closely-held information that might reveal the source. And, finally, the fact the source used a private lawyer to convey the records means the source is likely more sophisticated than the letter writers in\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   and thus less likely to believe that mere anonymity equates to confidentiality. Indeed, by using private counsel, it is fair to assume that the source was on notice of the \"boundaries of the FOIA exemptions,\"\n   <em>\n    Brant Constr. Co. v. EPA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1526920\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/778/1258/#p1262\">\n    778 F.2d 1258\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1262-63 (7th Cir. 1985), and therefore capable of taking the proper steps to ensure confidentiality, if so desired. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Ortiz\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal\n   </em>\n   do not aid Defendants' cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In summary, weighing the four\n   <em>\n    Roth\n   </em>\n   factors together, the court cannot conclude that the unidentified source provided the information in question to the USAO-DC under an implied assurance of confidentiality. Although the source remained anonymous and provided some potentially nonpublic and identifying information through counsel,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, the lack of other information about the source, including its proximity to the alleged misconduct, neutralizes those factors. Moreover, because the misconduct in question concerns off-label marketing practices, not more serious or violent crimes, it is less likely that the source feared retaliation and thus expected confidentiality, as opposed to simply wanting to remain anonymous. Thus, under these circumstances, the court finds that Defendants have failed to justify their invocation of Exemption 7(D) to withhold the 67 pages of responsive information in full.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Plaintiff cites an April 2, 2014, letter from Abiomed to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, copying the USAO-DC, which \"raised concerns about suspected leaks of information about the investigation, potential collusion between analysts and hedge funds who may have been 'front running' Abiomed stock[,] and requested that the government open an investigation into potential securities law violations.\" Pl.'s Cross-Mot. at 32 (citing Pl.'s Stmt. \u00b6 42);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Richter Decl. \u00b6 28. Although Plaintiff does not attach the letter, Plaintiff asserts the letter also stated that Abiomed had evidence indicating that \"analysts may have obtained the information about the impending subpoenas from Maquet,\" which, in turn, suggested that \"Maquet ... may have gotten its inside information about the investigation from a government attorney who was handling the investigation.\" Richter Decl. \u00b6 29.

Like the requester's efforts in\n   <em>\n    Blackwell v.

Absent any hard evidence substantiating its \"if not the government then who?\" theory, Plaintiff cannot establish that a reasonable person would have more than a suspicion of impropriety. As a result, \"there is no 'counterweight on the FOIA scale for the court to balance against the cognizable privacy interest in the requested records.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyd v.

Plaintiff's challenge to Defendants' invocation of Exemption 7(C) as to the lawyer's name therefore must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   b.\n   <em>\n    The name of the law firm\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   That leaves the question whether Defendants also may withhold the identity of the private law firm with which the attorney was affiliated. Defendants urge the court to answer that question in the affirmative, claiming that \"employment information\" is properly withheld under Exemption 7(C) \"when its disclosure would\n   risk identifying the individual whose privacy rights are implicated.\" Defs.' Combined Opp'n &amp; Reply Mem., ECF No. 35, at 7. Notably, Defendants do not contend that the law firm itself has a privacy interest. Plaintiff, on the other hand, asserts that Defendants have \"produced no evidence to support [their] assertion that the name of the law firm would identify the individual attorney.\" Pl.'s Reply at 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   The court agrees with Plaintiff. The declarations offered by Defendants largely focus on EOUSA's justification for withholding certain responsive records in full to protect the identity of the\n   <em>\n    source. See generally\n   </em>\n   Francis Decl.; Second Francis Decl. They are silent, however, on the question whether disclosing the name of the law firm could reasonably be expected to lead to the disclosure of the identity of the\n   <em>\n    lawyer\n   </em>\n   , whose privacy interests are directly at stake. If the law firm is a sole proprietorship, for example, then the court could easily conclude that Defendants properly withheld the name of the firm under Exemption 7(C); in that case, disclosure of the name of the law firm would effectively disclose the identity of the lawyer. If, on the other hand, the law firm is much larger-for example, comprised of hundreds of attorneys-then the court may be less likely to uphold the withholding of the firm name under Exemption 7(C). The record in its present state does not contain such information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Accordingly, the court will allow Defendants an opportunity to supplement the Francis Declarations with facts that support their assertion that disclosure of the law firm's name could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of the lawyer's personal privacy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Segregability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Because \"[t]he focus of FOIA is information, not documents, ... an agency cannot justify withholding an entire document simply by showing that it contains some exempt material.\"\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

Furthermore, there is no separate segregability analysis for the court to undertake with respect to these 67 pages because the only material Defendants seek to redact are names and identifying information, as described above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Finally, although Plaintiff does not challenge EOUSA's segregability determination with respect to the 33 partially redacted pages produced as part of the agency's\n   <em>\n    supplemental\n   </em>\n   release,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Initial Reply at 13, the court still must determine whether EOUSA has carried out its duty to disclose reasonably segregable material,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Pub.

As Plaintiff correctly points out, this issue may prove to be \"meaningless,\" Pl.'s Initial Reply at 15, because Defendants claim that of the 67 pages withheld in full by EOUSA, the 16 pages responsive to the Civil Division request were duplicative of the other 51 pages responsive to the EOUSA request,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Defs.'

Plaintiff also notes, however, that Defendants may have located and ultimately withheld\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   documents responsive to the Civil Division request \"due to a perceived failure to exhaust.\" Pl.'s Initial Reply at 15.

However, after further inquiry, Jones learned that a convenience copy of the AUSA's email mailbox remained available, \"as it [existed] the day IT removed the AUSA's account from the network.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Jones Decl. \u00b6 13 (explaining that IT removes an employee's network account from the system after an employee resigns). Jones then obtained a convenience copy from IT and personally searched the AUSA's mailbox for responsive documents. Suppl. Jones Decl. \u00b6 7. Jones located four responsive documents as a result of this supplemental search.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   To summarize, as to email searches, \"the identified AUSAs who were still in the office searched their own email for responsive documents and, for AUSAs who no longer were in the office, that email was searched as it existed at the time those AUSAs left the office.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Jones explains that \"[t]he only other potential source for email would be email retained by EOUSA in its USAMail archive.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9. That archive \"is automatically purged on a three-year sliding timeline, meaning that email only can be accessed dated back to three years from the date of the search.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Because the searches were performed in 2016 and 2017, respectively, the relevant time period in Plaintiff's FOIA request (January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2012) fell outside that three-year window.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the USAMail archive \"was not searched because it would not contain responsive documents.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Furthermore, according to Jones, there are not any backup tapes or other archives where responsive records might be housed.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (noting that the only backup tapes used within USAMail are for disaster recovery, which retain only the previous seven days of exchange database data);\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   (\"EOUSA does not maintain archived backup tapes.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Plaintiff's challenge to the adequacy of EOUSA's search focuses on the search of emails. In Plaintiff's view, Jones's description of that search is deficient in three respects. First, Plaintiff contends that although Jones searched a convenience copy of the mailbox of the former AUSA who was previously assigned to Matter Two (i.e., the matter falling within the relevant time period) as part of her supplemental search, Jones's supplemental declaration\n   does not identify the search terms used to search that AUSA's mailbox or explain how the search was conducted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Initial Reply at 15-16. While Jones describes in some detail the search conducted by IT of the\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   former AUSA's email-the one assigned to Matter One-Plaintiff submits that she does not do the same for the email of the departed AUSA assigned to Matter Two.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. Second, Plaintiff asserts that Jones's explanation with respect to the two current AUSAs assigned to Matter Two who searched their own email mailboxes suffers from the same deficiencies-namely, the failure to provide any information about the search terms or methods the AUSAs used.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Third, and relatedly, Plaintiff complains that Jones does not sufficiently describe the\n   <em>\n    scope\n   </em>\n   of the search conducted by the two AUSAs who searched their own emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17. For example, Plaintiff points out that while Jones states that the current AUSA who worked on Matter Two during the relevant time period searched his files, \"including emails,\" Jones does not explain whether this search included the AUSA's current inbox and all relevant folders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Similarly, Plaintiff notes that while Jones clarifies in her supplemental declaration that the AUSA in FPS who was assigned to Matter Two more recently searched a \".pst folder\" as opposed to an \"archive folder,\" Jones still \"does not state whether that AUSA searched any email outside this folder and, if not, whether those other places were likely to contain responsive information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   At least with respect to the methods used and the locations searched, the court is satisfied that Jones has provided a sufficiently detailed description of the agency's search efforts. The court, however, agrees with Plaintiff that Jones's declarations are lacking insofar as they do not include the search terms used to search three of the four AUSAs' email files. For Defendants to carry their burden of demonstrating the adequacy of the search, the declarations they rely upon \"must set forth '\n   <em>\n    the\n   </em>\n   search terms' used in the search, not\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the search terms used.' \"\n   <em>\n    Walston v. U.S. Dep't of Defense\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267749\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/238/57/#p65\">\n    238 F.Supp.3d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 65 (D.D.C. 2017) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Oglesby\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3486337,10542054\" index=\"150\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/920/57/\">\n    920 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   68 ). Here, while Jones sets forth the search terms used by IT in conducting a search of one former AUSA's email, Jones does not state whether similar terms were used when she conducted her own search of another former AUSA's email. Nor does Jones indicate what search terms were used by the current AUSAs who searched their own emails. Thus, the court will deny the parties' renewed cross-motions for summary judgment without prejudice as to the adequacy of the search and allow Defendants an opportunity to either (1) submit an additional declaration from Jones attesting to the search terms used in the original searches described above, or (2) conduct a new search for the requested records and provide a sufficiently detailed declaration, which includes a description of the search terms used, in support of that renewed search effort.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION AND ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   For the reasons stated above, Defendants' Renewed Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 32, and Plaintiff's Renewed Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment, ECF No. 33, are granted in part and denied in part.

Finally, no later than October 22, 2018, the parties shall file a Joint Status Report that addresses (a) whether Plaintiff intends to challenge Defendants' withholdings under Exemptions 4 and 5; (b) whether there are any remaining issues with respect to the Civil Division request; and (c) whether the parties intend to renew their motions for summary judgment with respect to any disputes concerning disclosure of the law firm's name or the adequacy of EOUSA's search.
