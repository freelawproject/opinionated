He had been warned by officers to back down or he would be tazed. He was aggressive toward an officer and was subsequently tazed. Even after this, he continued fighting and kicking at that point. An officer was finally able to get control of his arm, and the patient was given the intramuscualar drugs previously ordered in his thigh. He was then held down and arms secured; he was turned into the prone position and handcuffed, still fighting. Approximately 3-4 minutes into holding him in the prone position, he was rolled over and noted to have agonal respirations. He was placed on a monitor and found to be asystolic. Resuscitative efforts enabled the patient to regain a pulse and he was hypotensive. Dopamine, Levophed, and a fluid bolus of 2 liters were given. An electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response which was then converted to sinus rhythm.

The excited delirium syndrome involves the sudden death of a person during or following an episode of excited delirium, in which the autopsy fails to provide evidence for significant trauma or natural disease to have caused death. In virtually all cases, excited delirium is halted by a struggle with the police or medical personnel, and the use of physical restraints. Usually, within minutes following the struggle, the individual is found to be in cardiorespiratory arrest. Attempts at resuscitation are usually unsuccessful. If resuscitation is accomplished, the individual has usually undergone irreversible hypoxic encephalopathy and death occurs within days following the event.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are considered risk factors for developing excited delirium. Death in excited delirium often results from a fatal cardiac arrhythmia due to a hyperadrenergic state caused by the release of catecholamines and a rapid and steep drop in blood potassium concentrations following cessation of the struggle in association with increasing levels of catecholamines. The hyperadrenergic state is almost invariably aggravated by illegal stimulants which cause increased levels of catecholamines, medications that either have\n   the same actions as the stimulants causing the increased concentration of catecholamines and/or cause a prolongation of the QT interval. Also aggravating the circumstances of a hyperadrenergic state is the presence of natural disease of a degree insufficient in itself to cause death, but when in combination with a hyperadrenergic state can do so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Based on the clinical circumstances surrounding the death of this individual, the best conclusion is that his death was a result of an episode of excited delirium associated with mental illness and therapeutic medications, and was complicated by hypertensive cardiovascular disease, obesity, asthma and the physical struggle. Therefore, the cause and manner of death in this case are best classified as above.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Doc. no. 50 (Medical Examiner's Report), at ECF 4-5.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

For example, Nelson had committed no crime before defendants were summoned to the hospital. Indeed, Officers Lott and Meadows were only told upon their arrival that Nelson was more than hospital staff could \"handle\" or \"hold\" while attempting to inject sedatives, and they needed \"a strong back and a weak mind\" to assist in restraining him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    67\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even so, defendants persuasively contend that Nelson reasonably could have been charged with three state offenses during the interval between their arrival in the emergency room and Officer Lott's deployment of his Taser:\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , (1) the crime of harassment by throwing a vial of medicine at (and striking) Officer Lott;\n   <footnotemark>\n    68\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) the crime of disorderly conduct for fighting with the officers and medical personnel who were attempting to subdue him;\n   <footnotemark>\n    69\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (3) the crime of menacing when several people (including plaintiff) left the room in fear during the incident.\n   <footnotemark>\n    70\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, Nelson was not armed. And, even though he thrust his arms and legs at defendants and hospital employees in a pugilistic manner, his aggressive movements were not rapid, but in slow motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    71\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, given Nelson's large size and the physical strength revealed in the video recording of his prolonged and aggressive resistence to rational behavior, it clear that he was a danger to hospital staff and the officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ultimately, however, it is difficult to apply tests developed for determining the reasonableness of police conduct when effecting the arrest of a criminal to the entirely different context of controlling of an agitated, mentally-ill individual who is aggressively resisting medical therapy. The difficulty is apparent in the Eleventh Circuit's disposition of the issue in\n   <em>\n    Bussey-Morice v. Gomez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314065\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/587/621/\">\n    587 F. App'x 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir. 2014). That case is not on \"all fours\" with the present one, but the facts are\n   closely aligned. Preston Bussey, the plaintiff's decedent in\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   , was not suspected of any crime when he entered a Florida hospital during the early morning hours of December 2, 2009, but medical staff, hospital security guards, and local police officers uniformly described him as belligerent, agitated, psychotic, and hallucinating. His actions posed an obvious threat of harm to himself and others. Like Nelson here, Bussey died after being tased by police. When evaluating the defendants' qualified immunity defense, the Eleventh Circuit chose to side-step the question of whether the police officers' use of Tasers to subdue Bussey violated the Fourth Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314065\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/587/621/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4314065\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/587/621/\">\n    at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because we find that the alleged illegality of Gomez and Hewatt's behavior was not clearly established at the time of their actions, we need not decide whether a constitutional violation took place.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Maddox\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4076418\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/727/1109/#p1120\">\n    727 F.3d at 1120-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , for the proposition that a plaintiff must satisfy both requirements of the qualified immunity test in order to negate the defense). Other Eleventh Circuit opinions have followed a similar course when evaluating police officers' use of Tasers to subdue mentally ill individuals who were not suspected of a crime, but whose behavior threatened their own safety, or the safety of others around them.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Callwood v.

An emergency room physician ordered a urine sample, but Sullivan could not produce one voluntarily, so the physician ordered that the sample be obtained through catheterization.

He later sued the officers, claiming that they violated his rights to due process and to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182246\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/372/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9182246\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/384/372/\">\n    at 373-75\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As the district court correctly noted in its discussion of the qualified immunity defense, a holding to the contrary would place law enforcement officers in the impossible position of having to second-guess the medical judgments of emergency room physicians. Police officers like Bornemann and Whealon should not be at risk of liability under \u00a7 1983 for medical decisions made exclusively by the emergency room physician.

Officer Fiorino turned her police cruiser around and parked in the Eastbound turning lane, blocking the turning lane and stopping any traffic in that lane. According to one bystander, Carl Hughley, the officer pulled up and asked Oliver to approach her vehicle. He complied. Oliver then knocked on the rear driver-side window and unsuccessfully attempted to open the locked rear door of the police cruiser. Fiorino used her loud speaker to instruct Oliver to move to the front of her vehicle; again, he complied. Fiorino then directed Oliver to move further away from the vehicle, which he did. Fiorino then exited her vehicle. At this\n   point, Oliver was standing some twenty-three feet away from Fiorino, who was near her vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   Oliver did not speak before Officer Fiorino pulled out her Taser gun and asked Oliver what the problem was. Oliver responded to Fiorino's questions, saying \"they're shooting at me\" several times, and pointing across the street. Fiorino told Oliver to calm down and tell her what was going on. Oliver attempted to walk away; Fiorino asked him to stay and talk. According to Fiorino, Oliver then began to walk quickly toward her. In response, Fiorino raised her Taser gun and told Oliver to step away from her. Oliver complied.

Burk parked his car so that it, along with Fiorino's car, boxed in the left turning lane where the incident was unfolding. When Burk arrived, Oliver was standing several feet from Fiorino in the median, speaking loudly and \"moving his hands around.\" Fiorino and Burk testified that they considered taking Oliver into custody under Florida's Mental Health Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"155\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20394-463\">\n    Fla.

Nonetheless, Fiorino and Burk never informed Oliver of this fact, and never attempted to either arrest Oliver or \"Baker Act\" Oliver at any time during the entire incident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   Officer Burk approached Oliver, who was still standing in the median, to ask him for his name and identification. Oliver complied, giving Burk his identification card. Burk then decided to coax Oliver across the Eastbound side of the street (across the blocked turning lane and the other lanes) to the sidewalk, so that they could talk when he saw there was \"no traffic at all,\" and once the light turned red. Burk attempted to do so by putting his right hand on Oliver's left shoulder. Oliver responded by trying to back away. Oliver then \"momentarily stopped\" in the blocked turning lane of the street and began to babble incoherently. When the light changed and the traffic (if any) in the other lanes began to move again, Burk tried to force Oliver across the street, but Oliver struggled and pulled away from him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   During the encounter, Burk held on to Oliver's shirt as Oliver attempted to walk away across the street. At this point, Oliver did not try to grab Burk or to swing at him. Fiorino nevertheless, and without warning, tased Oliver for the first time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Fiorino was using a Taser M26 Electronic 10 Control Device, which was \"designed to cause significant, uncontrollable muscle contractions capable of incapacitating even the most focused and aggressive combatants.\" [Doc. 143-8 at 28]. \"The [T]aser gun fires two probes up to a distance of twenty-one feet from a replaceable cartridge.

According to Carl Hughley, this tase brought Oliver to the ground. While the Taser cycled through its five-second shock, Burk tried neither to handcuff Oliver nor to move him. This is so, despite the fact that, according to Hughley, once Oliver was on the pavement after the first tase, he never got back up, and he never hit, kicked, punched, or threatened the officers. Three to four seconds after the first Taser cycle ended, Fiorino tased Oliver once again. Ten seconds after the end of the second cycle, she tased Oliver still again for the third time.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   After Oliver was shocked by the Taser, according to [bystander-witness Carl] Hughley, Oliver was lying on the scorching hot asphalt screaming in pain that it was \"too hot.\" Another bystander, Richandra Nelson, said that Oliver remained on the ground while Burk just stood there and watched Fiorino tase him. Both Nelson and Hughley witnessed Oliver attempting to get up from the ground, but said that they never saw him struggling with, hit, kick, punch, or threaten Burk in any manner. Hughley stated that when Oliver went down, he couldn't roll over. When he tried to sit up, he flopped down like a \"wet cloth\" because he had no control over his body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   After approximately the third or fourth tase, one of the Taser wires became disconnected from the Taser prong and stuck into Oliver's chest. Fiorino loaded a second cartridge into her Taser and began tasing Oliver again. This tase and the next three or four tase cycles caused Oliver to be totally immobilized, leaving him clenched up and lying on his back. After the sixth or seventh tase, Oliver was again seen lying on the hot asphalt. Officer Fiorino said that when she tased Oliver for the last time (the eighth recorded tase), he was lying flat and he did not get up.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   Fiorino said she was not sure how many times she tased Oliver, but that she just kept pulling the trigger until he stayed on the ground. She said that she believed she tased Oliver approximately eleven or twelve times. Fiorino's Taser log shows that she tased Oliver a total of eight times over a two-minute period as follows: (note that each tase lasts five seconds) 1) Tase at 14:18:19 (2:18:19 p.m.); 2) Tase at 14:18:28 (2:18:28 p.m.); 3) Tase at 14:18:43 (2:18:43 p.m.); 4) Tase at 14:19:08 (2:19:08 p.m.); 5) Tase at 14:19:21 (2:19:21 p.m.); 6) Tase at 14:19:31 (2:19:31 p.m.); 7) Tase at 14:19:38 (2:19:38 p.m.); and 8) Tase at 14:20:27 (2:20:27 p.m.).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Nelson observed that once backup arrived at 3:24 p.m., the officers finally handcuffed Oliver. Fiorino stated that after Oliver was handcuffed, he began foaming at the mouth. It appeared as if Oliver's body had gone limp, but he still screamed in pain. After Officer Burk walked Oliver back to the median, Fiorino took some of the Taser prongs out of his body, but was unable to remove them all.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   At 3:35 p.m., paramedics arrived on the scene. At that point, Oliver was handcuffed and seated on the median, awake but not talking. After Oliver was placed on a stretcher, Burk noticed that Oliver had blood in his mouth. As Oliver was placed in the ambulance, he sat straight up and began to have a seizure. His health deteriorated rapidly; his body\n   temperature was measured at 107 degrees.

The plaintiff was not accused of or suspected of any crime, and indeed was not threatened with arrest or apprehension at any time prior to (or after) the use of force. The plaintiff posed no immediate threat of danger to officers beyond the moment of struggle with Officer Burk. He did not act belligerently toward the police officers, and he did not curse or yell at them. In fact, he was largely compliant and cooperative with the officers - moving away from their vehicle when instructed, stopping and talking the first time he was requested to do so (even though not threatened with detainment), stopping when instructed, providing requested identification, and only attempting to disregard the officer and walk away when the officer attempted a \"custodial touch\" on Oliver's shoulder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiff did not pose a grave danger to others. While Oliver did stop in the street and may have attempted to cross the street against the light, viewing the facts in a light most favorable to Oliver, we may infer that Oliver was within the lane that was boxed in by the police cars, and thus not exposed to traffic during the incident. This inference is supported by Officer Burk's statement that the entire incident occurred in \"the safe area,\" that \"none of this incident took place in the middle of the intersection,\" and that he did not recall any traffic passing by, honking, or almost striking him or Oliver during the incident. Finally, Oliver was not actively resisting arrest nor attempting to evade arrest by flight.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485041\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/898/#p905\">\n    586 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   906-07 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Callwood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=727%20F.%20App%27x%20552\">\n    727 F.

When measured against these facts, the officers violated a clearly established right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3485041\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/586/898/#p905\">\n    586 F.3d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration supplied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   The facts of the\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   case are neither exactly, nor even closely, like those of the current case. Both cases involve a tragic death after the repeated use of a Taser on a mentally disturbed individual, but the similarities end there. It is important to note that the first activation of the Taser in\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   was not determined to have been unlawful, even though Oliver had not disregarded any of the officers' directives or behaved in a threatening or belligerent manner toward them. Oliver only resisted when Officer Burk put his hands on him, to direct Oliver across the street and out of the way of traffic. But, even then, Oliver did not grab or swing at Officer Burk. To justify the initial Taser shock, it was enough that Oliver had placed Officer Burk and himself in some danger by resisting Officer Burk's efforts to steer him out of the street and potential oncoming traffic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Here, in contrast, before Officer Lott first deployed his Taser, Nelson had disregarded the officers' repeated directives to calm down and allow medical personnel to administer treatment. He had kicked and swung his arms not only at the officers, but also at hospital staff and his own mother. He lunged toward the officers, grunting and thrusting his chest forward in a defiant manner, and he threw a gown and a vial of medicine toward the officers, actually striking Officer Lott in the face with the medicine. Nelson's size made him an imposing individual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    75\n   </footnotemark>\n   That, together with his aggressive behavior, presented a potential danger to the officers and medical personnel in the room. If anything, there was an even greater need for the initial deployment of a Taser in the present case than there was in\n   <em>\n    Oliver.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   opinion does not clearly establish that Officer Lott's\n   <em>\n    initial use\n   </em>\n   of his Taser on Nelson amounted to excessive force.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The circumstances leading up to the subsequent Taser deployments against Nelson also were more severe in the present case than they were in\n   <em>\n    Oliver.\n   </em>\n   After Oliver was tased for the first time, he attempted to arise from the pavement, but he did not hit, kick, punch, or otherwise threaten the officers. Here, in contrast, after Nelson was tased and fell to the ground, he continued to thrust his arms and legs in an aggressive manner, and he grabbed the cords attached to a piece of medical equipment in an attempt to pull it toward the officers. Only after Officer Lott deployed the Taser a second time was Officer Meadows able to remove the cords from Nelson's grip, and only then were the officers and hospital personnel able to restrain\n   Nelson by injecting sedating medications and applying handcuffs. Thus, Nelson's behavior remained a potential danger to himself and others until\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the subsequent tasings. Furthermore, even though it is not clear from the video exactly how many times Officer Lott activated his Taser, it would be inconsistent with any reasonable interpretation of the bodycam video to say that it was eight or more times as in\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   , and, Lott did not discharge his Taser at all after Nelson had been fully immobilized with handcuffs and medications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   For all of the reasons discussed above, the conduct of Officers Lott and Meadows was not as extreme and disproportionate as the conduct by the officers in the\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   case. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Oliver\n   </em>\n   did not provide fair notice that the use of force employed by Lott and Meadows was unlawful.

The signs and symptoms typically ascribed to \"excited delirium\" include bizarre or violent behavior, hyperactivity, hyperthermia, confusion, great strength, sweating and removal of clothing, and imperviousness to pain. Speculation about triggering factors include sudden and intense activation of the sympathetic nervous system, with hyperthermia, and/or acidosis, which could trigger life-threatening arrhythmia in susceptible individuals.
