(Docs. 13, 21, 22 and 25). The Court now rules as follows.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. First Superior Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2008, 757BD commenced a lawsuit in the Superior Court for the State of Arizona\n   in Maricopa County (\"Superior Court\") against Aero Jet Service, LLC (\"Aero Jet\") and others (the \"underlying action\"). (Doc. 1-1 at 2\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , \u00b6 3) The underlying action related to the sale and maintenance of a jet aircraft which 57BD had purchased in January 2005. (Doc. 13 at 1:26). In that underlying action, 757BD alleged numerous causes of action against Aero Jet.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 1-1 at 3, \u00b6 4). Ultimately, in February 2012, the parties entered into a stipulated judgment on two causes of action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That judgment was in favor of 757BD and against Aero Jet in the amount of $591,496.61, plus interest. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   National Union insured Aero Jet under two polices, but for a host of reasons it refused to defend Aero Jet in the underlying action and refused to indemnify it for the judgment therein. (Doc. 1-1 at 3-4, \u00b6\u00b6 5-7). These reasons include National Union's determinations that: (1) 757BD's claims did not involve \"property damage\" within the meaning of the policies; (2) the underlying lawsuit did not allege \"an occurrence\" or \"property damage\" during the policy period. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 7). 757BD disputed National Union's reasons for denying coverage under the policies and for refusing to defend and indemnify it in the underlying action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3, \u00b6 8). Subsequently, Aero Jet assigned to 757BD all of \"Aero Jet's rights, claims and causes of action against National Union relating to National Union's failure to defend and indemnify Aero Jet in connection\" with the underlying action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5, \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. First Federal Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   During the pendency of the underlying action, in 2011, National Union filed an action in this District Court under the Federal Declaratory Judgment Act (\"FDJA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   National Union sued Aero Jet and 757BD and sought a \"declaratory judgment that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify its insured, Aero Jet[,]\" in the then pending underlying state court action.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Pittsburgh v. Aero Jet Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204708857\">\n    2011 WL 4708857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 (D.Ariz. Oct. 7, 2011) (\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   \"). In moving to dismiss, 757BD and Aero Jet argued that the Court \"should abstain from exercising its jurisdiction over the FDJA claim because Plaintiff could bring its request for declaratory judgment in state court.\" (\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204708857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ) (citation omitted). Agreeing, the Court dismissed on abstention grounds reasoning,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that National Union \"could have filed its action in state court under the Arizona Declaratory Judgment statute, A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1831 [ (the \"Arizona DJA\") ].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After prevailing on its motion to dismiss in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   , 757BD sought and was awarded its attorneys' fees relating thereto.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union Fire Ins.

Aero Jet Servs., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%20510490\">\n    2012 WL 510490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.Ariz. 2012).

Although National Union could have, as the Court observed in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   , it did not file an action in Superior Court under the Arizona DJA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Second Superior Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 19, 2014, while National Union's appeal was pending in the Ninth Circuit, 757BD filed a complaint entitled \"Declaratory Judgment\" in Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   By this time, the underlying action\n   had been resolved through the February 2012 stipulated judgment. The crux of this most recent lawsuit by 757BD is that National Union improperly \"refused to defend Aero Jet and has refused to pay the judgment against Aero Jet in connection with the [u]nderlying [l]awsuit[.]\" (Doc. 1-1 at 3, \u00b6 7). 757BD alleges that it is \"entitled to have determined the construction of [National Union's] Policies\" and \"to obtain a declaration of its rights, status and legal obligations thereunder pursuant to\" the Arizona DJA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its prayer for relief, 757BD seeks three closely related declarations. First, it seeks a declaration that National Union's policies required it to defend Aero Jet in the underlying action. Second, 757BD seeks a declaration that National Union's policies required it to indemnify Aero Jet for the judgment entered against Aero Jet in the underlying action. Third, 757BD seeks a declaration that \"National Union must pay the judgment entered in favor of 757BD and against Aero Jet in the underlying\" action. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 3). In addition to this purported declaratory relief, 757BD is seeking its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs and \"such other and further relief including a monetary judgment as the Court deems just and proper pursuant to A.R.S. \u00a7 12-1838 or principles of law or equity.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5, \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Second Federal Court Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1446, National Union timely removed that second Superior Court action to this Court purportedly on the basis of diversity jurisdiction,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, Plaintiff timely filed a motion to remand pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). As alluded to at the outset, the Notice of Removal was defective in that it did not properly allege diversity jurisdiction under section 1332. After pointing out this defect, the Court allowed National Union to file a supplemental notice of removal, which it did. Based upon this supplementation, this Court explicitly found \"that complete diversity of citizenship exists between Plaintiff and Defendant for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . (Doc. 20 at 1:20-21). 757BD then timely renewed its motion to remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary of Arguments\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Moving for remand, 757BD argues that this Court has \"broad discretion to refuse to exercise jurisdiction under the [FDJA].\" (Doc. 13 at 3:10) (emphasis omitted). Framing its analysis based upon the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hoelbl v. GEICO\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%205463389\">\n    2010 WL 5463389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.Ariz. Dec. 29, 2010), and heavily relying upon that Court's analysis, 757BD argues that, as did the\n   <em>\n    Hoelbl\n   </em>\n   Court, this Court should remand this action to Superior Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   National Union takes the antithetical view: this Court has \"no discretion to remand\" because 757BD's complaint is, \"in reality, one for breach of contract, not declaratory judgment[.]\" (Doc. 22 at 10:10-13) (emphasis omitted). Or, minimally, National Union contends that this action \"includes an independent claim for damages for breach of contract.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24:8-9) (emphasis omitted). Either way, National Union asserts that it has an \"unconditional right to remain in this Court.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9:9) (emphasis omitted). Accordingly, this Court must deny 757BD's remand motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Alternatively, even if this Court deems the present action to be \"one for pure declaratory judgment,\" in exercising its discretion, National Union urges this Court to find that \"the relevant factors ... overwhelmingly favor retention[.]\" (Doc. 22\n   at 15:1-2) (emphasis omitted). From National Union's standpoint, the \"relevant factors\" are not those set forth in\n   <em>\n    Hoelbl\n   </em>\n   , but rather those set forth in\n   <em>\n    Brillhart v. Excess Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368164\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/491/#p494\">\n    316 U.S. 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 494-95,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368164\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/491/#p494\">\n    62 S.Ct. 1173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"368164\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/316/491/#p494\">\n    86 L.Ed. 1620\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1942) ; and\n   <em>\n    Gov't Employees Ins.

Nonetheless, 757BD counters that in its discretion this Court should remand because that relief \"is wholly dependent on a favorable declaratory judgment[.]\" Reply (Doc. 15) at 2:4-5 (emphasis omitted). Then, whether the Court relies upon\n   <em>\n    Hoelbl\n   </em>\n   or the so-called\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors, 757BD steadfastly maintains that remand is \"appropriate[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4:17) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before addressing these arguments, the Court must consider the effect of removal upon 757BD's claim brought pursuant to the Arizona DJA. Upon removal, this \"state law claim must be converted to a claim brought under the [FDJA],\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Mardian Equip.

Nature of Complaint?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   According to National Union, the complaint is \"in reality, one for breach of contract, not declaratory judgment[.]\" (Doc. 22 at 10:12-13) (emphasis omitted). National Union posits that the complaint does not allege a viable FDJA claim because all of the allegations pertain to past conduct. National Union further posits that the complaint \"clearly allege[s] ... [\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   ]\n   <em>\n    ll three\n   </em>\n   \" elements of a breach of contract claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13:7-8) (emphasis in original). Thus, National Union reasons, because the complaint is one for breach of contract only, this Court does not have the discretion to remand; it must retain this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Even if the complaint does allege a viable FDJA claim, National Union contends that it \"concurrently\" alleges a \"breach of contract damages claim[.]\" (Doc. 22 at 13:16-17) (emphasis omitted). Based upon this alternative reading, National Union further argues that this Court has \"no discretion to remand[ ]\" because \"at a bare minimum,\" the complaint alleges an \"\n   <em>\n    additional\n   </em>\n   \" breach of contract claim with respect to which a 'monetary judgment' is sought that is \"unquestionably 'independent' of the purported declaratory judgment claim.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14:18-22) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Disagreeing with National Union's characterization, 757BD asserts that its complaint does not include an \"independent breach of contract claim[.]\" (Doc. 25 at 3:22-23). Rather, 757BD contends that it is within this Court's discretion to remand because 757BD's \"claim for monetary relief is wholly dependent on a favorable declaratory judgment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2:3-4) (emphasis omitted). 757BD did not reply to National Union's argument that 757BD cannot be seeking declaratory relief because this lawsuit pertains to past conduct only.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Whether by design or not, the complaint is not a model of clarity. In fact, the Court has some reservations as to whether the complaint sufficiently and properly alleges either a FDJA claim or a breach of contract claim. At this juncture, the Court declines to become mired down in the legal sufficiency of 757BD's complaint. This issue must await another day. Instead, the Court will assume for the sake of this motion only, that 757BD has sufficiently alleged a FJDA claim.

Discouraging forum shopping\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   757BD is relying upon National Union's prior conduct to argue that by\n   removing the latter engaged in impermissible forum shopping. In particular, 775B stresses that the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   Court dismissed National Union's earlier federal court lawsuit because,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , National Union could have brought an equivalent action under Arizona's DJA, but it did not. Further, 757BD points out that National Union also could have resolved the coverage issues in 757BD's Superior Court action, but decided to remove instead. According to 757BD, the foregoing is indicative of forum shopping as National Union is trying to \"gain[ ] some perceived tactical advantage in federal court or avoid[ ] some perceived disadvantage in state court.\" (Doc. 13 at 7:20-22). If this Court were to retain the present action, 757BD asserts that it \"would simply encourage the type of forum shopping that the ... court [in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   ] [wa]s endeavoring to discourage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:24-25). Thus, 757BD argues that the second\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factor favors remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   National Union's response is two-fold. First, properly invoking federal jurisdiction does not constitute forum shopping. Second, National Union contends that its removal of this action is not the sort of \" 'reactive' lawsuit[,]\" which the Ninth Circuit has deemed to be forum shopping. (Doc. 22 at 21:20) (quoting\n   <em>\n    R.R. Street\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3830471\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/656/966/#p975\">\n    656 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   976 ) (other citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Tellingly, in its reply 757BD did not mention these arguments at all. Instead, 757BD contends that National Union is \"is now seeking to accomplish through removal what\" the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   Court \"previously disapproved [of] in its dismissal order.\" (Doc. 25 at 7:8-10). From 757BD's standpoint, this Court \"should not ... countenance[ ]\" such \"gamesmanship[ ].\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7:10) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   757BD's argument misses the mark and misapprehends the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   decision at least with respect to forum shopping. Despite what 757BD contends, the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   Court was not \"endeavoring to discourage[ ]\" forum shopping in its dismissal order. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 13 at 7:25). Indeed, the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   Court was explicit. It \"d[id]\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find that [National Union's] FDJA complaint [wa]s 'reactive' in the sense that [National Union] [wa]s attempting to undermine or preempt an established or pending state court ruling.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204708857\">\n    2011 WL 4708857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4 (emphasis added). That Court also did \"\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   find that [National Union']s choice to file an FDJA action constitute[d] impermissible forum shopping.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204708857\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Thus, there is no merit to 775BD's assertion that if this Court retains this action, it would amount to an end-run around the\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   dismissal order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Further undermining 757BD's position is that nothing in\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%204708857\">\n    2011 WL 4708857\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , required National Union to file a state court action under the Arizona DJA, as 757BD implies. How National Union proceeded after the dismissal of\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   was its prerogative - just as it was 757BD's prerogative to originally file this action in Superior Court. Likewise, 757BD is overlooking the fact that\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Union I\n   </em>\n   case was in very different procedural posture than is the present case. There, at the time of dismissal, the underlying state court action was still pending. As a result, even though the forum shopping factor did not favor dismissal the other two\n   <em>\n    Brillhart\n   </em>\n   factors did. Obviously, the same it not true here. There is no pending state court action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Moreover, as discussed below, National Union persuasively argues that it properly invoked this Court's jurisdiction and that its removal cannot be deemed a reactive or defensive lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    a.
