The D.C. Circuit Court found that public statements made by the President of the United States (in a live internet forum), the President's counter-terrorism advisor (in a public speech), and the Director of the CIA (in a public speech) officially disclosed the existence of the CIA's interest in drones, making the CIA's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response illogical.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 429-31. Because the statements made by the President, the counterterrorism advisor, and, especially, the CIA Director were so specific,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court found that they were \"tantamount to an acknowledgment that the CIA has documents\" matching the plaintiffs' request, making it \"neither logical nor plausible to maintain that the Agency does not have any documents relating to drones.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 431 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Here, both the substance of the President's official statement and the context is distinguishable. First, the statements that formed the basis for the finding in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   were lengthy and highly specific. Second,\n   in this case, the government's justification for withholding information is not merely based on a desire to keep its \"interest\" in the subject matter confidential; the agency has identified the particular harms that could flow from revealing the specific information sought - the \"identities of subjects or witnesses, or the scope\" of the ongoing Russia investigation. Hardy Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 23-25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Castellano Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. Third, the Court in\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   relied on a combination of statements, including those made by the President, but it placed a particular emphasis on the public statements made by the CIA itself.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   , 710 F.3d at 431. Here, plaintiffs rely solely on statements made by the President, and none from the DOJ or the FBI. This difference bears upon the resolution of the official acknowledgment question in this case because in several of the statements, the President appears to be speaking in opposition to, rather than on behalf of, the investigation itself and the agencies involved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   So while a President may be included among the executive branch officials who can waive the confidentiality needed to sustain an agency's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response, it is still necessary that any statement proffered meet the matching and specificity requirements. When a plaintiff asks a court to take the extraordinary step of looking past the fact that an official statement does not on its face reveal whether responsive records exist, then it is imperative that both the context and substance of the official disclosures \"leave no doubt\" as to that fact,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU,\n   </em>\n   710 F.3d at 429, and that the public statements are \"tantamount to an acknowledgment that the [agency] had documents on the subject.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 431. The President's summary reference to what he may have been told by Director Comey does not meet that high bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

He asserts that Comey told him he was not \"under investigation\" once at a dinner and during two phone calls. But again, none of these statements summarizing conversations with the FBI official explicitly refer to the existence of any record within the agency, or necessarily imply the existence of such records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   And the President's vague references to what he had heard from \"others\" and what was said at \"some committee level\" as part of the basis for his belief that he is not under investigation muddy the waters and do not point to the existence of responsive records within the FBI or DOJ. NBC Interview Transcript.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Because plaintiffs did not \"pinpoint an agency record that both matches the plaintiff's request and has been publicly and\n   officially acknowledged by the agency\" the Court finds that the President did not waive defendant's\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response during the televised interview.\n   <em>\n    Moore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6051488,3769723\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/666/1330/\">\n    666 F.3d at 1333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court also finds that\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   is inapplicable here for the reasons stated above and declines to draw inferences from this insubstantial record on whether responsive records exist.

The article reports that when a reporter asked the President if he would do an interview with the Special Counsel, he responded, \"I don't know. I mean - nobody's asked me to do that.\" The Hill Article. This vague statement asserting a lack of personal knowledge, which concerns a request to be interviewed and not a formal designation as a target, subject, or witness, and makes no reference to a specific record that might match the FOIA request, does not begin to meet the \"stringent test required\" to establish a waiver.\n   <em>\n    Pub.

There is obviously no \"match\" between this statement and the information sought; at best, the statement recognizes that the conversations with Comey may be a subject of an inquiry.

Since the President's statement does not explicitly mention any records, and plaintiffs ruled out the possibility that it was even premised on government information, let alone DOJ or FBI records, the statement cannot be read as disclosing the existence of responsive records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   The law is clear that \"an agency's official acknowledgement of information by prior disclosure ... cannot be based on mere public speculation, no matter how widespread.\"\n   <em>\n    Wolf\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3561064,2540517\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/473/370/\">\n    473 F.3d at 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , citing\n   <em>\n    Afshar v.

By acknowledging that the President was responding to the\n   <em>\n    Washington Post\n   </em>\n   article when he expressed his shock and disbelief, and that he was not broadcasting government information, plaintiffs have conceded that the President's statement cannot be deemed to be an official waiver.

Furthermore, President\n   Trump's unremarkable statement that the setting of a date for any meeting with the Special Counsel would be \"subject to [his] lawyers\" does not expressly acknowledge the existence of records memorializing disclosures from the DOJ to the President's legal team about his status.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Furthermore, the statements are too vague and ambiguous to warrant an\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   type of analysis.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ACLU\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3661511,3552023\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/710/422/\">\n    710 F.3d 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
