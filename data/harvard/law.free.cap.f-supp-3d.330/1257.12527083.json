BROWNING, UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    THIS MATTER\n   </strong>\n   comes before the Court on Defendant Gaspar Leal's Motion\n   to Dismiss Count 1-Conspiracy for Violation of Double Jeopardy Clause, filed March 6, 2018 (Doc. 119) (\"Motion\"). The primary issues are: (i) whether Defendant Gaspar Leal's Double Jeopardy challenge under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States of America to his conspiracy charge in Count I of the Superseding Indictment at 1, filed December 20, 2017 (Doc. 95)(\"Superseding 3308 Indictment\"), is ripe for the Court's pretrial consideration; (ii) whether, if Leal's claim is ripe, the conspiracy for which Leal was previously convicted, in\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leal\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 16-3069 JB (D.N.M.), is the same conspiracy for which Plaintiff United States of America now charges Leal in Count 1; and (iii) whether, if the Court dismisses the Superseding 3308 Indictment's Count 1 for violating the Double Jeopardy Clause, the Court must dismiss the Superseding 3308 Indictment's other Counts without prejudice so that the United States can present the Grand Jury with evidence that does not relate to Leal's conspiracy conviction. The Court concludes: (i) the Motion is ripe, because the Double Jeopardy Clause guarantees the right to not stand trial for an offense for which a defendant has already been convicted; (ii) the Superseding 3308 Indictment does not charge Leal with a conspiracy for which he has already been convicted, because the Superseding 3308 Indictment and the\n   <em>\n    United States v. Leal\n   </em>\n   , No. CR 16-3069 JB (D.N.M.)'s indictment charge conspiracies with different sets of co-conspirators whose actions are not interdependent; and (iii) even if the Court dismisses Count 1 for violating the Double Jeopardy Clause, it would not dismiss the Superseding 3308 Indictment's remaining Counts without prejudice, because Leal has not shown that presenting the Grand Jury with Count 1 evidence is sufficient reason to dismiss the entire Superseding 3308 Indictment. Accordingly, the Court denies the Motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rule 12(d) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the Court to state its essential findings on the record when deciding a motion that involves factual issues.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Count III charges Leal with distributing 50 grams and more of methamphetamine \"[o]n or about August 3, 2016.\" Superseding 3308 Indictment at 2. The trial is set for June 11, 2018.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order Continuing Trial Setting at 1, filed April 5, 2018 (Doc. 129).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n    <em>\n     The Motion\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In the Motion, Leal asks the Court to dismiss the Superseding Indictment's conspiracy charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 1. According to Leal, the conspiracy charge violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, because Superseding 3308 Indictment's conspiracy\n   charge alleges a time frame that overlaps with the conspiracy charge timeframe for which he was previously convicted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 2-3. Leal also asks that the Court dismiss the Superseding 3308 Indictment's other charges without prejudice, so that the United States can make a \"fresh presentation of those charges to a new grand jury\" that excludes the proof supporting the conspiracy charge. Motion at 3. Leal asserts that the conspiracy charges both refer to the same criminal agreement during the same time frame.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7. According to Leal, the United States now \"seeks to use the same overlapping proof, utilize the same CI testimony, and elicit much of the same underlying evidence to convict Mr. Leal\" of the Superseding Indictment's conspiracy charge. Motion at 7. Leal asks the Court for an evidentiary hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The Response\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The United States asserts three main arguments in its Response. First, the United States argues that Leal's claim is not ripe, because the trial has not yet happened, and Leal is only speculating about what evidence the United States will bring.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 7-8. According to the United States, the appropriate procedure for Leal's Double Jeopardy claims would be as a motion for a judgment of acquittal sometime after the United States presents its case pursuant to rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Second, the United States argues that the charged conspiracies refer to different agreements with different people with different goals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 8. The United States asserts that there are \"no overlapping overt acts in support of both conspiracies.\" Response at 10. According to the United States, Leal was convicted of a conspiracy he formed in the summer of 2016 with a CI and two women-C. Tapia and B. Tapia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 2-3. The United States asserts that Leal, pursuant to this conspiracy, arranged in May, 2016, for the CI to purchase methamphetamine from a drug dealer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. The United States also asserts that Leal, while in jail, acted pursuant to this conspiracy again in June, 2016, by arranging for the CI and an ATF undercover agent to purchase methamphetamine from C. Tapia and A. Tapia.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 3. As for this trial's conspiracy charge, the United States asserts that, in July, 2016, Leal entered into a different conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine by arranging, from prison-a different facility than the one in which he was detained the prior month-a deal where the CI and an undercover ATF agent purchased methamphetamine from Carmona.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 5-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Third, the United States contends that, to the extent it plans to introduce evidence that it introduced at Leal's December, 2017, trial, it plans to do so not as proof of Leal's guilt on his present charges, but instead to show motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identify or absence of mistake or accident pursuant to rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n    <em>\n     The Reply\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Leal replies to the United States' Response.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Defendant Gasper Leal's Reply to United States' Response to Motion to Dismiss Count 1-Conspiracy for violation of Double Jeopardy Clause, filed April 4, 2018 (Doc. 127)(\"Reply\"). Leal argues that his claim is ripe, because \"the whole point of the Double Jeopardy Clause is to prevent a defendant from having to 'run the gamut twice.' \" Reply at 1. Leal contends that there is \"ample evidence and a record before the Court\" indicating that the two conspiracies are essentially the\n   same agreement that overlap in time, and that the only distinction is that \"there are different overt acts and different 'players' in the two indictments.\" Reply at 1. Specifically, Leal contends that, in both the 3069 Indictment and the Superseding 3308 Indictment, the United States charges that Leal agreed with the same CI to arrange drug transactions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply at 1-2. Leal also contends that he is \"permitted under settled Tenth Circuit case law\" to appeal an adverse pretrial ruling on this matter, \"which further supports the idea that a pretrial ruling should be made on the motion.\" Reply at 2. Finally, Leal argues that the United States seeks to avoid Double Jeopardy problems by \"labeling evidence of the same prior conspiracy 404(b), as opposed to what it actually is-evidence of the exact same conspiracy that Mr. Leal is sought to be tried on now.\" Reply at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     LAW REGARDING CONSPIRACY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To prove a conspiracy, the government must show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   (1) that two or more people agreed to violate the law[,] (2) that the defendant knew at least the essential objectives of the conspiracy, (3) that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily became a part of it, and (4) that the alleged co-conspirators were interdependent....

Tapia, C. Tapia, Arreola-Palma, and Carmona. If Leal was part of only one conspiracy, then the Superseding 3308 Indictment violates the Double Jeopardy Clause, because Leal has already been convicted on a conspiracy charge. The Double Jeopardy Clause permits a second Leal conspiracy prosecution, however, if Leal was part of two distinct conspiracies to distribute methamphetamine,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , one conspiracy between Leal, B.

Although they involve similarly situated individuals-methamphetamine sellers and buyers-pursuing similar objectives-distribution of methamphetamine-the evidence indicates that the success of one deal does not depend on the success of the other. Given that there is no interdependence between the Tapia Deal and the Carmona Deal, the Court concludes that the United States, in its Superseding 3308 Indictment, charges Leal with a different conspiracy than the one for which Leal was previously convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   <strong>\n    III.\n    <em>\n     EVEN IF THE SUPERSEDING 3308 INDICTMENT'S CONSPIRACY CHARGE VIOLATED THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY CLAUSE, THE COURT WOULD NOT DISMISS THE OTHER CHARGES AGAINST LEAL\n    </em>\n    .\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   Leal argues that, if the Court dismisses the conspiracy charge, the Court should also dismiss the Superseding 3308 Indictment's other charges without prejudice, so that the United States can make a \"fresh presentation of those charges to a new grand jury\" that excludes the proof supporting the conspiracy charge. Motion at 3. Leal does not articulate a particular legal theory why a Grand Jury would need a fresh presentation, and the Court cannot\n   come up with a sound one on its own. Generally speaking, the United States enjoys considerable freedom regarding the evidence it can present to a Grand Jury, and courts will generally \"not sustain a defendant's challenge to a facially valid indictment on grounds of insufficient evidence, hearsay, incompetent evidence, or illegally obtained evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Indictments\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=91%20Geo.%20L.J.%20236\">\n    91 Geo.

The Superseding 3308 Indictment charges Leal with being a part of a conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine between July 21, 2016 and August 3, 2016, and with distributing methamphetamine on July 24, 2016 and again on August 3, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Superseding 3308 Indictment at 1-2. The Court imagines that a fresh presentation to a Grand Jury of only the methamphetamine distribution charges would not look much different, because any evidence needed to show probable cause for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine would presumably also be needed to show probable cause for the conspiracy's overt acts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   that Defendant Gaspar Leal's Motion to Dismiss Count 1-Conspiracy for Violation of Double Jeopardy Clause, filed March 6, 2018 (Doc. 119), is denied.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    Many of the following findings relating to the charges in this case-\n    <em>\n     United States v.

In other words, the Court's findings based on those pleadings do not relate to facts in the record, but to the United States' assertions of what the record will show, and indeed what facts the United States expressly seeks to admit in its Motion In Limine. Leal does not challenge the United States' facts and has withdrawn a request for an evidentiary hearing, so his Double Jeopardy theory apparently does not depend on Leal disproving any of the United States' anticipated evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    As the Court concludes,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 I, at 1274, Leal's Motion is ripe at this pretrial stage, and so the Court works with what it has at the moment. The Court also concludes,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    \u00a7 II, at 1276, that, based on the record and what the United States intends to prove at trial, the United States charges Leal with a different conspiracy than the one for which he was previously convicted. Although the Court denies the Motion, Leal may have another shot at his Double Jeopardy theory down the road if, for example, the trial brings to light new facts indicating that the two conspiracies are one in the same.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    The United States' Proposed Opening Statement PowerPoint Presentation in No. CR 16-3308 asserts that Leal and Arreola-Palma called the CI on June 24, 2016, to tell him to contact Carmona about buying methamphetamine.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Proposed 3308 Opening PowerPoint at 6, filed March 6, 2018 (Doc. 119-1). The Court concludes that the Proposed Opening PowerPoint's June 24, 2016, date is a typographical error, because the United States, in the Response and its Motion In Limine, consistently refers to the Leal/Arreola-Palma/Carmona deal as happening in July, 2016, and the 3069 Indictment charges that Leal, Arreola-Palma, and Carmona entered into a methamphetamine distribution conspiracy that began \"on or about July 21, 2016,\" and concluded \"on or about July 25, 2016.\" 3069 Indictment at 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-129\">\n    Again, the Proposed 3308 Opening PowerPoint identifies this meeting as happening on June 25, 2016, but the Court concludes, for the same reasons identified\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    n.2, that the June 25 date is a typographical error.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    It may also be the case that a Congressional intent\n    <em>\n     not\n    </em>\n    to allow prosecution for the same transaction under different statutes will trump the elements test.

The Supreme Court buttressed this position with the congressional intent expressed in legislative history, however, and also indicated that the\n    <em>\n     Blockburger v.

The\n    <em>\n     Blockburger v.
