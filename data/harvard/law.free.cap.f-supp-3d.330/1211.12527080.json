He is also awaiting a final decision-which could still be years away-from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on his application for U nonimmigrant status, also called a U-visa. A U-visa grants temporary legal status for victims of certain specified crimes who help law enforcement investigate or prosecute criminal activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(15)(U), 1184(p) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). Claiming eligibility for that\n   status, Plaintiff requested at least three times that ICE stay his removal until USCIS decided his application. But the agency granted only his first request. Even after USCIS notified ICE and Plaintiff that his application was prima facie eligible for relief, ICE refused another stay request. So Plaintiff filed this lawsuit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202241\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , seeking to prevent ICE from executing his removal while he awaits a final U-visa decision. (Complaint (\"Compl.\"), ECF No. 1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff does not contest either the validity of his removal order or the legality of his detention. Nor does he dispute that, under the relevant immigration laws, ICE retains the discretionary authority-but not any legal obligation-to stay Plaintiff's removal pending a U-visa decision by USCIS. Plaintiff also does not dispute that USCIS can grant him a U-visa even after ICE removes him and while he is outside the United States. Instead, Plaintiff maintains that in deciding not to stay his removal, ICE failed to follow its own internal agency guidance that favors postponing removal for noncitizens with prima facie-eligible U-visa applications. The failure to follow that guidance was, according to Plaintiff, arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of the agency's discretion. (Compl. at 4-6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendants counter that the Court cannot evaluate whether or how ICE followed its internal guidelines in refusing to stay Plaintiff's removal because section 1252(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) eliminates federal court jurisdiction to review such discretionary decisions. This provision provides that \"no court shall have jurisdiction to hear any cause or claim ... arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g). While the Supreme Court has narrowly construed this jurisdiction-stripping statute to apply only to \"a limited subset of deportation claims\" arising directly from the \"specified decisions and actions,\"\n   <em>\n    Reno v. American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p483\">\n    525 U.S. 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 483, 487,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p483\">\n    119 S.Ct. 936\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11076671\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/525/471/#p483\">\n    142 L.Ed.2d 940\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (\"\n   <em>\n    AADC\n   </em>\n   \"), Plaintiff's action is one of those cases that falls categorically under section 1252(g), even as narrowly construed in\n   <em>\n    AADC\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, to state Plaintiff's argument is to refute it, for Plaintiff challenges the exercise of ICE's discretion to decide whether and when to carry out his removal order. If ICE had made the opposite choice and stayed Plaintiff's removal, he would have no \"cause or claim\" to pursue. No matter how Plaintiff describes his claim, then, it necessarily \"aris[es] from\" ICE's \"decision\" to \"execute [his] removal order.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201252\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

(Compl. at 22). In 2013, ICE began removal proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). That same year, an immigration judge (IJ) denied Plaintiff's requests for asylum and withholding of removal and ordered him removed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23). In 2014, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed the IJ's removal order, and the Ninth Circuit denied Plaintiff's petition for review in 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23-24). Then, in February 2017, Plaintiff filed a U-visa application with USCIS, claiming that he was eligible for that visa as the victim of a 2007 felony assault in Los Angeles, California. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). Why Plaintiff did not apply for the U-visa sooner while his removal proceedings were underway is unexplained.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When he filed his U-visa application with USCIS, Plaintiff had to file a separate application for a stay of removal with ICE. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24-25). While USCIS has sole authority to grant U-visas,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1), \"the filing of a [U-visa application] has no effect on ICE's authority to execute a final order.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.14\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 214.14(c)(1)(ii). That is why noncitizens with pending U-visa applications who are subject to a final order of removal must separately ask ICE to issue a stay of removal, which the agency has the discretion to grant or deny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.6\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). In September 2009, ICE issued internal guidance detailing \"factors to consider\" in deciding such stay requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memo. from David J. Venturella, Acting Director, U.S. Immigration &amp; Customs Enforcement,\n   <em>\n    Guidance: Adjudicating Stay Requests Filed by U Nonimmigrant Status (U-visa) Applicants\n   </em>\n   , at 1 (Sept. 24, 2009) (the \"Venturella Memo\"). This guidance-which remains in effect according to Defendants-states that ICE \"should favorably view\" stay requests by applicants found to be prima facie eligible for a U-visa, unless \"serious adverse factors\" are present.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.6\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.6\">\n    at 2-3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such factors include national security or public safety concerns, significant criminal history, and evidence of human rights violations or immigration fraud.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20241.6\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   ICE at first granted Plaintiff a three-month stay of removal in March 2017. (Compl. at 25-26). But it later denied two more stay requests and arrested Plaintiff in January 2018 to carry out his removal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Meanwhile, in February 2018, USCIS notified ICE and Plaintiff that his U-visa application met the prima facie eligibility requirements under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). That prima facie determination, while important, is not too difficult to obtain. (Grismore Decl. at 4-5). Still, this news prompted Plaintiff to ask about another potential stay, but ICE indicated it would deny that too, apparently citing \"the absence of evidence that [Plaintiff]'s presence in the country was necessary for the investigation or the prosecution of qualifying criminal activity underlying his [U-visa] petition.\" (Compl. at 26-27). In fact, a U-visa applicant does not have to be in the United States to obtain the visa, although the procedures are different for U-visa grantees living abroad.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20214.14\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 214.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(5)(i)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In denying Plaintiff's stay requests, ICE never shared its reasons or disclosed what considerations influenced its decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   But as a matter of procedure, if an ICE field office wants to remove a noncitizen whom USCIS has found is prima facie eligible for a U-visa, the field office must obtain approval from ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) headquarters in\n   Washington, DC. (Venturella Memo. at 2-3). The Los Angeles ICE field office did that here, and ERO Headquarters approved Plaintiff's removal in March 2018 despite his pending U-visa application. (ECF No. 39 at 12). Facing imminent removal, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit in April 2018 and obtained a temporary restraining order against his removal until the Court decided his preliminary injunction motion.

That is why, as the Ninth Circuit recently observed, a \"claim that the Attorney General should have exercised discretion to delay [a] removal\" would arise from the \"execution of the removal order\" under section 1252(g).\n   <em>\n    Arce v.
