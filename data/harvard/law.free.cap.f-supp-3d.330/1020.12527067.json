HILLMAN, U.S.D.J.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This matter arises from a Distribution Agreement between Plaintiff Lawmen Supply Company of New Jersey, Inc. and Defendant Glock, Inc. Before the Court is Defendant's Motion to Dismiss. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant in part and deny in part Defendant's motion. The Court will grant Plaintiff leave to file an amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Court takes its facts from Plaintiff's Complaint. Plaintiff is a licensed distributor of law enforcement products from leading manufacturers to law enforcement agencies. Defendant makes pistols and related products. For over twenty-five years, Plaintiff and Defendant have been in business together. Approximately four years prior to the filing of the Complaint, Plaintiff became a \"Glock Only\" distributor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of the filing of the Complaint, Plaintiff held an exclusive state contract with the State of New Jersey for Glock weapons, and thus all law enforcement agencies within the state were required to purchase Glock pistols from Plaintiff. Plaintiff has had similar contracts with the State of Delaware and the State of Maryland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 6, 2016, Plaintiff and Defendant entered into a Distribution Agreement for Plaintiff to distribute \"Glock Only\" pistols to the law enforcement market. This Distribution Agreement is an annual contract that has been renewed every year since 2011. On July 10, 2017, Defendant attempted to unilaterally terminate the Distribution Agreement \"effective immediately.\" Defendant claimed Plaintiff violated the Distribution Agreement by selling 340 Glock products to the commercial market rather than the law enforcement market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff's Complaint brings the following claims: (1) violation of the New Jersey Franchise Practices Act (NJFPA) (unlawful termination); (2) violation of the NJFPA (engagement in prohibited practices); (3) breach of contract; (4) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (5) promissory and equitable estoppel; (6) tortious interference with business relations; (7) tortious interference with contract; (8) breach of fiduciary duty; (9) fraud and negligent misrepresentation; (10) unjust enrichment, (11) violation of the New Jersey Uniform Commercial Code; and (12) violation of the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act (NJCFA).

In Plaintiff's opposition brief, it argues:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Here, Lawmen's New Jersey facility is the hub of its marketing and sales-related activities as it relates to Glock products sold to the New Jersey law enforcement market, which is the largest and most profitable law enforcement market for Lawmen under the Distribution Agreement. (Complaint \u00b6 1, 92.) Indeed, at Lawmen's New Jersey facility-which also serves as its principal place of business-Lawmen employs its sales and support personnel who display, order, and manage all transactions for Glock products for New Jersey law enforcement agencies under the Distribution Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As such, Lawmen's New Jersey facility is the exact type of facility this Court has found to satisfy the \"place of business\" inquiry.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   Second, while Lawmen does not maintain its FFL and, in turn, its Glock pistol inventory at its New Jersey facility, other non-pistol Glock products are kept, offered, and sold from the New Jersey facility to New Jersey law enforcement agencies under the Distribution Agreement. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The problem with this argument is that those facts are not pleaded in the Complaint. Plaintiff relies on paragraphs one and ninety-two of its Complaint in the argument quoted above. These paragraphs simply plead that \"Lawmen is a New Jersey corporation and New Jersey licensed distributor of law enforcement products\" and that \"Lawmen operates its franchise 'within the State of New Jersey.' \" (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 92). In an uncited portion of the Complaint, it relatedly pleads: \"Plaintiff Lawmen is a New Jersey corporation with its principal place of business at 7150 Airport Highway, Pennsauken, New Jersey 08109. From this facility, Lawmen orders and manages the pistols it distributes to its customers.\" (Compl. \u00b6 9).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On a motion to dismiss, the Court assumes only the veracity of those facts actually pleaded. However, because the facts recited in the brief, if pleaded in good faith, would be sufficient to make out a plausible claim that the New Jersey location is the type of sales facility required by the NJFPA and not merely a distribution site, Plaintiff will be granted leave to replead this aspect of the Complaint. Plaintiff will be granted thirty days to amend its Complaint to assert those facts necessary to make out a plausible claim that it maintained an actual sales location in New Jersey at the time the alleged franchise was terminated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds granting leave to amend here comports with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(b), whereby a\n   \"court should freely give leave when justice so requires.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   While the Court assumes that, despite the lack of support in Plaintiff's Complaint, Plaintiff has not been disingenuous in its representations to the Court through its briefing, in repleading, Plaintiff is reminded of the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 -that by filing a pleading with the Court, an attorney is certifying that \"the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Community of Interest Requirement\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The Court finds Plaintiff has set forth a plausible claim that the parties share a community of interest such that the NJFPA applies. \"[A] community of interest exists when the terms of the agreement between the parties or the nature of the franchise business requires the licensee, in the interest of the licensed business's success, to make a substantial investment in goods or skills that will be of minimal utility outside the franchise.\"\n   <em>\n    Cassidy Podell Lynch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527547\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/944/1131/#p1138\">\n    944 F.2d at 1143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Instructional Systems\n   </em>\n   , the New Jersey Supreme Court found the following supported a finding of a community of interest: the prohibition of developing products that would compete with franchisor's products, the required maintenance of sales representatives, the joint representation at conventions, the\n   prohibition from selling competitive products, the requirement to use \"best efforts\" to sell franchisor's products, franchise-specific investments, the goodwill and contacts that came from twenty years of persuading customers to choose the franchisor product, and that ninety-seven percent of revenue came from the sale of the franchisor's products.\n   <em>\n    Instructional Sys.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"329049\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/130/324/\">\n    614 A.2d at 145-46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Court notes that the Complaint pleads that \"[f]or 2016, Lawmen sales that were made pursuant to the Distribution Agreement constituted 21.5% of Lawmen's overall business.\" This is unlike the ninety-seven percent of revenue in\n   <em>\n    Instructional Systems\n   </em>\n   . Despite this difference, however, the Court finds at the motion to dismiss stage it must find Plaintiff is permitted to present the Court with evidence of a community of interest. Plaintiff pleads it has a longstanding association with Defendant of over twenty-five years and has been a \"Glock Only\" pistol distributor for at least four years. Plaintiff has discontinued its relationships with other manufacturers because of its relationship with Defendant. The Distribution Agreement requires the maintenance of at least one Glock Armorer at each location subject to the Distribution Agreement. It further requires Plaintiff \"to use best sales efforts to market GLOCK products.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff has displayed Glock products and promotional materials at least at one trade show with Defendant's support and approval.

Subsection A provides that \"[a]ny party may terminate this Agreement with thirty (30) days written notice.\" Subsection B provides that \"GLOCK may terminate this Agreement at any time due to DISTRIBUTOR's breach of any of the covenants and conditions or any of its obligations under this contract.

At least initially, construction is a matter of law for the court. First, the trial court must decide whether the language is clear and unambiguous. If it is, the court simply enforces the contract according to its clear terms; the contract alone is looked to for its meaning. Next, if the contract is ambiguous in some respect, the court must apply the rules of contract construction to resolve the ambiguity. Finally, if the ambiguity remains after applying the rules of construction, the issue of what the ambiguous language means and what the parties intended must be resolved by a jury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Stonegate Bank v.
