Gardner, </em>Amarillo, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b180-21\"><em>John L. Scott, Jr., </em>County Attorney, Vega, and <em>Leon Douglas, </em>State\u2019s Attorney, Austin, for the state.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b180-22\">WOODLEY, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>The conviction is for driving while intoxicated; the punishment, 3 days in jail and a fine of $350.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">A motion to dismiss the appeal has been filed in this court by the county attorney who prosecuted the case because a copy of the statement of facts has not been filed with the clerk of the trial court as required by law. The failure to file the statement of facts in duplicate as required by Art. 759a, Sec. 4, V.A.C.C.P., does not divest this court of jurisdiction of the appeal. Paulos v. State, 157 Texas Cr. Rep. 341, 248 S.W. 2d 928. The motion is therefore overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It was undisputed that on the date alleged the appellant drove his automobile upon a public highway in Oldham County, and the only conflict in the evidence was on the issue of his intoxication.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">The highway patrolman who stopped and arrested the appellant, after describing his manner of driving and his actions and appearance, testified that in his opinion the appellant was on such occasion under the influence of intoxicating liquor. Another officer who observed appellant after his arrest testified that in his opinion appellant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Appellant, as a witness in his own behalf, testified on direct examination that on the day in question he had been rabbit hunting with his brother and another companion who were riding in the automobile with him; that he only had one drink of whisky that day; that there was nothing wrong with him and that he at all times had the automobile under control.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">On cross examination by state\u2019s counsel, appellant was asked \u201cDid you ever have any trouble with drinking,\u201d to which he replied \u201cNo, sir,\u201d whereupon counsel for appellant objected to the inquiry on the ground that it was going into a matter of an offense not involving moral turpitude and that it had not been shown that appellant had been tried and convicted of such an offense. Upon the objection being overruled, appellant was required by the court to again answer the question, to which he replied <em>\u201cI have been arrested two or three times.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">In overruling appellant\u2019s objection to the question and requiring him to give his answer thereto the court fell into error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">It was not shown that appellant had been convicted of any offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>A witness may not be impeached by proof of mere accusations against him or evidence of particular acts of misconduct. See 1 Branch\u2019s Ann., P.C., 2nd Ed., Sec. 190, page 209, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Under the provision of Art. 732a, V.A.C.C.P., the fact that a witness has been charged with an offense is inadmissible for the purpose of impeaching him unless the charge has resulted in a final conviction. Tomlinson v. State, 163 Texas Cr. Rep. 44, 269 S.W. 2d 267. Furthermore, the convictions must be for a felony offense or one involving moral turpitude. Neill v. State, 158 Texas Cr. Rep. 551, 258 S.W. 2d 328, and Mauldin v. State, 165 Texas Cr. Rep. 405, 308 S.W. 2d 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Drunkenness is not an offense involving moral turpitude. Powell v. State, 60 Texas Cr. Rep. 201, 131 S.W. 590, and Garrison v. State, 94 Texas Cr. Rep. 541, 252 S.W. 511. Also, drunken driving is not an offense involving moral turpitude. Burton v. State,, 149 Texas Cr. Rep. 327, 194 S.W. 2d 398.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The question propounded did not relate to a felony offense or one involving moral turpitude and appellant\u2019s objection thereto should have been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">We.are unable to agree with the state that the question propounded was within the legitimate scope of cross examination because the appellant testified on direct examination that he never drank while hunting with a rifle or that the answer was not responsive to the question and appellant should have therefore moved to strike the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The fine assessed against appellant being in excess of the minimum prescribed by law, we cannot say that the testimony given by appellant over his objection relative to his previous arrests was not harmful to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">For the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Opinion approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b182-11\">WOODLEY, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ALL\">(dissenting)</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">There are these additional facts which are not set out in the majority opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>The arresting officer testified that the automobile driven by appellant was traveling east in the borrow ditch when he met it and turned around to see \u201cwhy he was driving in the borrow ditch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">As he followed it the car \u201cwould go from the borrow ditch back to the highway and across the center line and then go back to the borrow ditch, and was wobbling down the road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">When he began questioning appellant the officer smelled liquor and asked appellant what he had been drinking, and he replied \u201c T drank some beer and liquor over at Glen Rio, Texas, on the New Mexico side * * * over at the bar\u2019 and he said he had been over there rabbit hunting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">There were three whisky bottles in the car which appellant was driving, one was empty and one partly empty. A third bottle, according to the state\u2019s witness, was empty.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Appellant\u2019s brother was a passenger in the car. He testified that the third bottle was full and that the three bottles belonged to Nelson, the third occupant of the car; one he had when the three left Amarillo, one he purchased at San Jon and the unopened bottle he purchased at the bar in Glen Rio.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Appellant and his brother testified that appellant took only one drink all day, and that was a drink of whisky at the bar in Glen Rio.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Asked by his counsel how much liquor his brother drank in his presence that day, appellant answered \u201cNone,\u201d and volunteered the following: \u201cMe and him both had 22 rifles and was hunting and that is something I never done in my life, take a drink of whisky when I was out hunting with a rifle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">On cross-examination appellant, having stated his age and place of residence, was asked: \u201cQ. Did you ever have any trouble with drinking?\u201d To which he answered \u201cNo, sir.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">The following quotation from the statement of facts shows the proceedings which followed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: Now just wait a minute. Your honor, if he wants to ask this witness any questions on any oifense that involves moral turpitude, that is all right. If he is going into something that does not involve moral turpitude it is not ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>missible and if you want to get the jury excused until we thrash that out, that is what I am asking you to do, but if he wants and is going to insist on asking him something about some little misdemeanor, that is not admissible to be brought up against him and we will object to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cMR. SCOTT: Let the record show that the defense counsel has brought out these matters. My question was if he had any trouble with his drinking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: That is not the question before this jury. The question before this jury is whether he was intoxicated on the day and time in question, and what occurred the day before or the week before or the year before is not in issue, and that is not an offense that involves moral turpitude, and we have no right to even make this discussion of it before the jury. He has no right to bring it up before the jury, and we object and except to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\">\u201cMR. SCOTT: Let the record show that I am not going into any prior convictions unless they do involve a felony or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-8\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: Well certainly, whether a man drank or whether he hadn\u2019t drunk does not involve moral turpitude and there is no misdemeanor that involves moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">\u201cThere just isn\u2019t any misdemeanor that involves moral turpitude, and we object to the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-10\">\u201cTHE COURT: I will overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-11\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: Note our exception. (8)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-12\">\u201cQ. (By Mr. Scott) Answer the question, please, Mr. Hunter. A. Will you ask the question again?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">\u201cREPORTER: Did you ever have any trouble with drinking?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-14\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: Now again, I want to renew my objection on that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-15\">\u201cMR. SCOTT: Let me rephrase the question, so the witness understands it. I am not going into any * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>\u201cMR. GARDNER: Your' Honor, may I make a further objection. Whether a person has trouble or not, that is not admissible before the jury in any event. They have got to prove that he has been accused, tried and convicted on some offense involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-4\">\u201cTHE COURT: Overrule the objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">\u201cMR. GARDNER: Note our exception. (9)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">\u201cMR. SCOTT: Will the Court instruct the witness to answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-7\">\u201cTHE COURT: Go ahead and answer the question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">\u201cA. I have been arrested two or three times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-9\">\u201cQ. I am not going into the question of whether or not you have been arrested. That is not responsive to my question. I said, have you ever had trouble with your drinking? A. No, I haven\u2019t.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">As I read the foregoing record, the fact that appellant had been arrested two or three times (for what is not disclosed) was not elicited by the question but was volunteered.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-11\">The majority opinion declares the law to be that a defendant in a prosecution for driving while intoxicated may hot be asked on cross-examination whether he \u201cever had any trouble with drinking,\u201d the theory being that such question would require the defendant in response to testify to arrests, charges and convictions for misdemeanor offenses not involving moral turpitude.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-12\">This holding I believe to be clearly wrong. One may have ever so much \u201ctrouble with drinking\u201d without being arrested or charged with crime. Also, drunkenness alone is not an offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">The harm the majority finds is the \u201ctestimony by appellant over his objection,\u201d in answering the question held to be improper, \u201cI have been arrested two or three times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">There was no further mention of the appellant\u2019s two or three arrests, and at no time was the court requested to withdraw or instruct the jury to disregard appellant\u2019s testimony to that effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
