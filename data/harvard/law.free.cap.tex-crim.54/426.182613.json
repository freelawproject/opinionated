Appellant and Lela May Brotherton were jointly indicted for incest. Appellant -asked for severance and was placed on trial. The case against Lela May Brotherton was dismissed. The facts in substance Show that appellant and Lela May Brotherton were seen to leave the public road and go out into the river bottom, by the prosecuting witness: His statement of the facts is as follows: \u201cAfter they passed me there was some free tops that had fallen and the leaves were still green on the trees, and that put them out of my sight, and when I could see them again they were out of the buggy and she walked up against a sapling, or pretty close to a sapling, and he pulled up her clothes and it looked to me like, the best I could see, that he pulled out his male organ. I don\u2019t know that he had it out, only from the action that he made from that part of his body. After he went through -those actions, as if taMng out Ms organ he went right up against \u2019her, -the best I could tell about it, and placed the lower part of his body against the part of her body Where the female organ would be, and -after he got in that position he was in motion like having intercourse with her. That is all I could say. Her clothes were \u00a9till up at this time. I think I was some fifty or sixty yards from them, could have been closer or further. There was nothing between me .and \u2018them to obstruct my view. Of course, it was heavy timber, but no undergrowth at that place. It was not very long that I saw Mm continue these motions. I think she saw me. It looked like she pushed him away from her, the best I could tell, and then she got in the buggy, and just as quick as he could get himself iu shape, from tire way he was acting, he got in the buggy. His back was to me and he was standing np and \u2018he just bent himself over this way -and it seemed to me that he was working with his organ, and as quick as he could do that he got in the buggy and drove away, not <em>very </em>fast. Heither one of them took off their hats while I saw them,. Frank Harville\u2019s back was to me at the time they were out of the buggy, it was not all the time. When they got out of the buggy, they were going from me and of course his back was to me. I was something like fifty or sixty yards from them. I could not tell whether he had Ms privates out, only just from the actions led me to believe that he did. I never saw them. I never saw his pants unbuttoned, I just saw Mm acting like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>he was unbuttoning his piarais. I could not say hw much taller Frank is than the woman, because I never measured them. The place th'alt I saiw them was supposed to be reasonably level ground. They we:r- both standing up. The woman was some lower than the man, there may be a foot \u2019difference. I have not measured them, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ApPD\">Bill <em>No. 1 </em>shows that after the jury was empaneled and the indictment read to them, but before introducing \u00bfany testimony in the above case, the State, through her district attorney, asked the court to dismiss the case against Leta May Brothenfcon, who was indicted jointly with the defendant and tendered the said Leta May Brofherton to the defendant as a witness in his behalf. Defendant objected to the dismissal of the case against Leta May Brofherton because there was one case already pending before the court and the jury empaneled in the trial of this case, and the court -could not act upon another case at the same time: That there has been a motion to sever and defendant\u2019s motion made before the court to quash the indictment against this party; and'' <em>the </em>-court \"has seen fit to <em>overrule both of </em>those motions, an-d counsel fa-r 'appellant asked a severance in the case, the court having forced them to ask for a severance by refusing to dismiss the -case against her; because it is an indirect allusion to a defendant\u2019s testimony before the jury in the case; because she is a defendant and the counsel says that he fenders her to counsel for appellant as a witness, she being one of the defendants who is -Charged in this case, and because it is an allusion to th-e defendant\u2019s right to- testify or failure to testify. The bill is approved with this explanation: \u201cThat the defendant had filed a motion to sever and it had been granted and he was- placed on trial first on his own motion.\u201d There was no error in the ruling of the court. Where two parties are jointly indicted the district attorney, for proper cause and showing, cam dismiss the case. There being no prosecution it is not -amiss to tender him or her to the appellant as a witness if the appellant desires to- use him.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Bill No. <em>2 </em>shows that the district attorney asked 0. M. Tubbs the foil-owing question, to wit: \u201cWhen you first met Rosson in here on the day of the election day two years ago, I will ask you what 'he then told you as to who it was that he saw in this attitude down there on the creek?\u201d Defendant objected to the question, because they have no right to prove what the witness said to- other peo-ple in the absence <em>of </em>this defendant when that witness is present to- testify in the case. The objection was on the ground of hearsay. The district -attorney then asked: \u201cI will ask you if it is not a fact that he told you about this when <em>he </em>first came into town or soo-n after he got into town?\u201d A. \u201cWell, I do not kno-w that it was soon after 'he got here; it was not very long. I never Saw Mr. Criner until the next day. Mr. Rosson told me that he thought that he Imew this party by sight.\u201d The court .appends this explanation: \u201cThe Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Criminal Appeals will see upon examination of the facts, that the defendant upon cross-examination of Jnio. Criner proved that the witness n'ad made different statements out of the court to what he did on -the trial and for this reason this testimony was admitted.\u201d Under the explanation of the court the ruling is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Bill No. 3 shows that the State\u2019s attorney propounded to J. W. Westemnan the following questions: \u201cNow did you ever hear Frank Harville or any member of his family deny this being the stepdaughter\u2014the daughter of his wife?\u201d Defendant objected on the ground that same is hearsay, immaterial and not pertinent to the issue in this case. This testimony should not have been admitted. It is indirectly forcing the wife to testify against her husband since she certainly was a member of appellant\u2019s family. The State under this statement, is permitted to prove that the wife never denied the fact that her daughter was appellant\u2019s step-daughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">B\u00fcl of exceptions No. 4 shows the State\u2019s counsel proved the following by J. W. Wesferman: \u201cDo you know the general understanding as to where Mrs. Brotherton\u2019s first husband died and when, he died?\u201d Defendant -objected to the question because it would be hearsay. The court overruled the objection. The witness answered that \u201che was understood to be dead. I have heard Mrs. Harville state that he was dead.\u201d The defendant objected to- any statement made by Mrs. Harville, because no statement made by the wife is- admissible against the husband. All -of which objections were overruled. The witness continued to 'answer as follows: \u201cHe died over at Mt. Vernon; some follow killed him. Mr. Harville has been living down in that country about ten years; I did not know Mi's. Brotherton before she married Mr. Harville.\u201d This bill is approved with this explanation: \u201cNo objection was made to the first question in the bill, that is, T have heard Mrs. Harville state that he was1 dead.\u2019\u201d In the case of McGrew v. State, 13 Texas Crim. App., 340, appears the following language: \u201cNowhere, however, is it made to appear that at the time of the second marriage the first had been annulled, either by divorce or by the death of the first 'husband. Upon this point the only evidence in the record is a statement in the testimony of Ann McGrew to the effect that finy first husband died in Grimes County, as I understand.\u2019 From this statement it is extremely uncertain that the first husband is dead; and, if dead, did he die before or after her -second marriage? If after, then the second marriage was a nullity, provided she had not been divorced from him, and She could not become the lawful wife of McGrew by virtue of such illegal marriage. If dhe was not hi-s lawful wife, then the illicit connection of McGrew with her daughter by the previous marriage, however reprehensible in morals, would not constitute the crime of incest in law. Divorce from or the death of the first husband at the time of the second marriage should have been proven affirmatively, because absolutely essential to the establishment of the crime charged', and- to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>validity of a conviction, under the circumstances stated.\u201d Cleanly, under this authority, 'the ruling of the court was erroneous in permitting the witness to \u00a1state that he understood that 'her former husband was dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Bill Ho. 5 complains that the distract attorney commented upon the fact that appellant did not put Beta May Brotherton upon \u2019the stand, she having been indicted conjointly with her step-father, the appellant, for tihe lorime that appellant was 'being tried for, the district attorney having previously dismissed the ease against her, and that the district attorney in1 his speech called! on the jury to consider appellant\u2019s failure to put her on the stand, she being in attendance upon the trial, because it was a strong circumstance to show that he was guilty. The court appends to the hill the statement that no written charge was -requested by 'appellant to be given to the jury, to disregard such remarks. Upon another trial this argument should not be indulged.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">For the errors pointed out the judgment is reversed and the \u00a1cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">Ramsey, Judge, absent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
