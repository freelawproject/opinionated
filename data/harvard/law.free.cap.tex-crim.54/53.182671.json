A. Tucker, the wife of the deceased, on cross-examination by appellant was asked the following question: \u201cDid you not at the place of the homicide, just a few minutes after the killing, say to appellant\u2019s father, \u2018I told Will not to raise any trouble with Marion,\u2019 referring to deceased and appellant, and if your son did not speak up at the same time and say, \u2018Yes, we all begged him not to.\u2019 \u201d This testimony was not admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Appellant insists the court erred in not giving special charge t\u00edo. 7% as shown by bill of exceptions t\u00edo. 15, submitting to the jury the question as to whether the defendant had the right to defend against the appearance of danger from both deceased and his son, Jim Tucker, who was out in the road with a gun when defendant passed the home of deceased, and whom appellant testified followed him down the road with a gun and made a demonstration as if to shoot defendant as he was leaving the scene of the homicide. The evidence in this case does not suggest such a defense, but on the contrary shows that appellant and deceased met in the road, deceased walking and appellant riding a large horse. A difficulty ensued in which appellant killed deceased by stabbing him several times with a knife, from which wounds he immediately died. Then appellant jumped on his horse and as he started off deceased\u2019s son began to approach, with a gun, the scene of the difficulty. Deceased\u2019s son, however, made no effort to shoot appellant. Furthermore, the difficulty at that time was over and the son was some distance away at the time of the difficulty in which deceased lost his life, and we hold that the court did not err in failing to charge on appearance of danger from both deceased and his son since there could not have been any danger from the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The 9th assignment of error complains that the court erred in permitting the State to ask the defendant if he did not on the evening of the homicide tell George and Gibson Dodd that he was going to kill a man with that knife, to which defendant answered that he did not. And it was proved by Gibson Dodd that defendant, while peeling some peaches which witness and his brother had given defendant with the knife introduced in evidence as the one with which the killing was done, was asked by George Dodd what he was going to do with that big knife, to which appellant replied, \u201cKill a man.\u201d Appellant insists this testimony was not admissible since it did not indicate that deceased was the party alluded to. Furthermore, because the witness said he paid no attention to defendant, and thought the defendant was joking. This conversation as the record shows occurred about two hours before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>homicide between the Dodd boys and appellant. The record shows defendant had a very large knife that he had recently bought, and while passing where the Dodd boys were in an orchard, asked them for some peaches, which being given appellant, he took out the knife 'and began to peel the peaches, and one of the Dodd boys asked him what he was going to do with that big knife. He says, \u201cKill a man.\u201d The record further shows that there had been a great deal of bickering and animosity between appellant and deceased. The writer of this opinion thinks the authorities have gone top far in holding that a threat of this character must specifically designate the deceased as the party intended to be injured, and I think the evidence above detailed shows with sufficient certainty that deceased was the party alluded to by appellant when he said, \u201cI am going to kill a man.\u201d But this testimony is not admissible under a long line of authorities of this court. See Hall v. State, 42 Texas Crim. Rep., 444; 64 S. W. Rep., 248; McMahon v. State, 36 Texas Crim. Rep., 540; 81 S. W. Rep., 298; Holly v. State, 39 Texas Crim. Rep., 301; 46 S. W. Rep., 39; Gaines v. State, 38 Texas Crim. Rep., 202; 42 S. W. Rep., 385; Earles v. State, 47 Texas Crim. Rep., 559; 85 S. W. Rep., 1, and Garrett v. State, 52 Texas Crim. Rep., 255; 106 S. W. Rep., 389.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The 10th assignment complains that the court erred in permitting deceased\u2019s daughter to testify that just as defendant rode off after stabbing deceased, he remarked, \u201cGod damn you, I have got shut of you now.\u201d This testimony was clearly part of the res geste, and certainly it was permissible for the deceased\u2019s daughter to tell all she saw of the difficulty, which the bill discloses she did do.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Appellant complains of various other assignments of error; after a careful reading of all of same we do not believe any of them are well taken, but for the error pointed out, the judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
