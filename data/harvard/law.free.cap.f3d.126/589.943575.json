Galley, the Warden of RCI (collectively Appellees). The prisoners complain, <em>inter alia, </em>that Appellees (1) denied them the opportunity to participate in work release and pre-release programs because of their disabilities, resulting in a denial of benefits, training, and rehabilitation, and in longer sentences; (2) denied them equal access to bathrooms, athletic facilities, the \u201chonor tier,\u201d and food services at RCI because of their disabilities; (3) denied them adequate medical attention and hygienic facilities; (4) failed to make reasonable accommodations to ensure the safety of disabled inmates; and (5) assigned them to RCI because of their disabilities, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to serve their sentences at available facilities closer to their homes. The prisoners claim that Appellees\u2019 conduct violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), <em>see </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12165 (West 1995 &amp; Supp.1997); \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794 (West Supp.1997). The prisoners also brought suit under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.1997), claiming that Appellees\u2019 conduct violated the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">The district court granted summary judgment for Appellees. Relying on our decision in <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>57 F.3d 1340 (4th Cir.1995), the district court concluded that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not apply to state correctional facilities. We agree. After painstakingly reexamining our decision in <em>Torcasio, </em>we are convinced that Torcasio\u2019s analysis of the issue is, indeed, compelling, and that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not apply in the state prison context. Nothing in the opinions of those courts holding to the contrary even begins to refute the careful analysis we undertook in <em>Torcasio. </em>In reaching the conclusion that these Acts do not apply, and could not possibly be applied in the context of prison facilities, we are (and we believe that the Supreme Court will ultimately find itself) persuaded in no small measure by the extraordinarily circuitous statutory analyses which those courts reaching the contrary conclusion have undertaken and the considerable extra-interpretive energies that those courts have been forced to expend in order to limit the systemic chaos that would otherwise have followed on their holdings that these statutes apply to the Nation\u2019s myriad state prisons. In addition, the district court determined that the prisoners had failed to raise genuine issues of fact material on the question of whether their keepers were deliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs. Again, we agree. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 statutory and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Although Appellees dispute many of the factual allegations made by the prisoners, we set forth the facts in the light most favorable to the prisoners for purposes of evaluating the appropriateness of summary judgment. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513-14, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986) (holding that in determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, \u201c[t]he evidence of the non-movant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor\u201d); <em>see also </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Because we conclude that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not apply to state prisons, we recite only the facts relevant to the prisoners\u2019 constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">Prisoners at RCI, disabled and non-disabled alike, receive medical attention when necessary from Prison Health Services, Inc. (PHS), a private medical care contractor. PHS provides a broad array of medical services, including general dispensary services, sick-call services, and infirmary services. In addition, PHS uses Washington County Hospital as an adjunct medical care provider for medical services that cannot be performed at the prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">Prisoners may complain about the medical care provided (or not provided) through an Administrative Remedy Procedure (ARP) in place at the prison. Pursuant to this procedure, a prisoner fills out an ARP form to complain about medical care he has received or to request medical attention, which is transmitted to the Warden. The Warden <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>then forwards the complaint or request to his administrative remedy coordinator for investigation and resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Six of the thirteen disabled prisoners in this case \u2014 Granville Amos, William Smith, Michael Smith, Howard Megginson, Gary Ralph, and Boris Prymerman\u2014 contend that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to their serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant Gran-ville Amos, who is partially paralyzed as the result of a 1989 gunshot wound, filed six ARPs with the Warden between June 3, 1991, and November 22, 1991, complaining that he was not receiving in a timely fashion medication for back pain and spasms. In each instance, the Warden promptly responded to Amos\u2019 complaint by acknowledging \u201cthat a gap in your medication did occur with the Dispensary at least partially responsible,\u201d and by assuring Amos that steps were being taken to \u201cdecrease the possibility of a reoccurrence of this problem.\u201d (J.A. at 869.) The Warden informed Amos that he was \u201cdirecting the CMS Medical Provider to <em>insure </em>[sic] that this does not reoccur.\u201d (J.A. at 872.) In response to Amos\u2019 final ARP, the Warden stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-6\">In spite of all efforts by staff, the problems with prescription medications has [sic] persisted through most of November due to the non-delivery by the Pharmacy. It is recognized that these difficulties do not negate the medical suppliers [sic] obligation to provide these medications. The new Pharmacy is now on line and it is anticipated that a dramatic lessening of lapses of this type will occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">(J.A. at 888.)</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">Appellant William Smith is partially paralyzed and wheelchair dependent, and suffers from bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, hypertension, and lymphocytic leukemia. In 1992, a physician suggested that Smith consider undergoing surgery to correct his carpal tunnel syndrome. Unidentified prison employees then told Smith that he had been scheduled for carpal tunnel surgery, but the surgery was never performed. In addition, in 1992, a physician recommended diagnostic tests to ascertain the cause of Smith\u2019s back pain. Like the surgery, the tests have never been performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-12\">Appellant Michael Smith, also paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, suffers from chronic back pain, hypertension, and bladder problems. In 1988, he was prescribed Valium to prevent leg spasms, and received Valium until his release from prison in 1991. In 1993, he was incarcerated again, first at the Maryland Penitentiary, and then, beginning in December 1994, at RCI. Although Smith received Valium while incarcerated at the Maryland Penitentiary, medical staff at RCI prescribed substitute medication that was not as effective as Valium. Smith submitted two \u201cSick-Call Request &amp; Encounter Forms,\u201d one on December 9, 1995, and another on March 14,1995. Each requested that a physician see him about the problem with his medication. On March 17, 1995, Dr. Charles E. Potts of the prison medical staff wrote to Smith that he would \u201carrange for a meeting with you next week to address your concerns.\u201d (J.A. at 866.) A few weeks later, in April 1995, Smith\u2019s Valium prescription was renewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-13\">Appellant Howard Megginson, also paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair, suffered recurrent urinary tract infections while imprisoned at RCI. He filed two ARPs \u201cconcerning the urine [sic] infection.\u201d (J.A. at 727.) In both instances, according to his own testimony, in response to the ARPs, he was seen and treated by physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-14\">Appellant Gary Ralph has \u201ccerebral palsy, [a] history of a femoral fracture, and chronic back pain.\u201d (J.A. at 602.) In June 1995, he began experiencing severe back and leg pain. At some point, after he began experiencing back and leg pain, Ralph filed ARPs informing the Warden of his condition and need for medical attention. As of June 27, 1995, Ralph was no longer assigned to RCI. In August 1995, Ralph received treatment at the University of Maryland Hospital where further diagnostic testing was recommended. Subsequently, \u201c[specialists have recom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>mended conservative treatment for [Ralph\u2019s] lumbosacral disc disease. [Ralph] is receiving chronic pain medications and will have ongoing neurosurgical evaluations at the University of Maryland to provide speciality consultation.\u201d (J.A. at 602.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Appellant Prymerman, who has \u201ca lumbosacral fracture with chronic back pain\u201d (J.A. at 602), \u201ccan walk with [a] cane or crutches, but uses [a] wheelchair most of [the] time due to pain\u201d (J.A. at 830). On November 7, 1991, Dr. Donald Patterson recommended surgery for his back problem. A notation on Prymerman\u2019s medical chart, dated December 1. 1992, states: \u201c[S]till waiting on spinal fusion decision by Dr. Patterson. He (Mr. Prymerman) continues complaining of severe pain.\u201d (J.A. at 830.) Prymerman never filed an ARP regarding the recommended back surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">We begin with the statutory claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In granting summary judgment for Maryland on the prisoners\u2019 ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, the district court stated, citing our decision in <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>57 F.3d 1340 (4th Cir.1995), that \u201ca three-judge panel of the Fourth Circuit strongly stated its view that those Acts do not apply to state prisons.\u201d (J.A. at 41.) The district court concluded that our treatment in <em>Torcasio </em>of the applicability of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons was not controlling, but nevertheless decided \u201cthat considerations of sound judicial management and prudent use of resources dictate that I follow the <em>Torcasio </em>dictum.\u201d (J.A. at 41.) The court stated that if \u201cthe Fourth Circuit concludes on appeal in this case that the <em>Torcasio </em>dictum was incorrect, the case will simply be remanded for further proceedings.\u201d (J.A. at 41.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b641-12\">The prisoners contend \u201cthat the view expressed by this Court in <em>Torcasio, </em>that the statutes do not apply to prisons and prisoners, was incorrect.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 20.) They claim that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons because both statutes are written in broad terms that clearly encompass state correctional facilities. Even if the coverage of the statutes is ambiguous, they argue, \u201cany such ambiguity is entirely overcome by regulations promulgated by the [Department of Justice], to which Congress delegated the authority to implement the statutes.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 20.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Like the prisoners, the amicus curiae Department of Justice (DOJ) contends that the plain language of both statutes establishes that the statutes apply to state prisons, that DOJ regulations confirm that the statutes apply to state prisons, and that our discussion of the applicability of the statutes to state prisons in <em>Torcasio </em>was poorly reasoned dictum that should not control the outcome of this ease. (DOJ Br. at 5-21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b641-13\">In <em>Torcasio, </em>the principal issue was whether it was clearly established at the time the plaintiff in that case was imprisoned that Title II of the ADA and \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons, and whether the individual defendants in that case were entitled to dismissal of the claims against them on qualified immunity grounds. We held that it was not clearly established that the statutes applied to state prisons, and that therefore the individual defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See id. </em>at 1352. While deciding only that the applicability of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>prisons was not clearly established at the time of the alleged discrimination, we strongly suggested that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not apply at all to state prisons and prisoners. <em>See id. </em>at 1344-52. Because Torcasio\u2019s review of the language of the statutes, the relevant constitutional principles, and the manner in which our sister Circuits have addressed the issue was especially thorough, we begin our analysis with a full statement of what we decided in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Anthony Torcasio, a Virginia state prisoner who alleged that he was disabled because of his \u201cmorbid obesity,\u201d filed an action against officials of the Virginia Department of Corrections (VDOC), claiming that they had failed reasonably to accommodate his disability in violation of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1342. The individual defendants moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity. The district court held that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act applied to state prisoners, <em>see id. </em>at 1343 (citing <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>862 F.Supp. 1482, 1490-91 (E.D.Va.1994)), and then \u201cproceeded to analyze, literally request by request, whether the VDOC officials\u2019 responses to Torcasio\u2019s requests for accommodation were reasonable,\u201d <em>id. </em>The district court concluded that the prison officials were entitled to qualified immunity with respect to some of Torcasio\u2019s complaints, but were not entitled to qualified immunity with respect to others. The State of Virginia and the individual defendants appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">On appeal, we began our analysis with the language of the two statutes and noted \u201cthat certain portions of both statutes employ language which, when viewed in isolation, appears all-encompassing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1344. Title II of the ADA prohibits \u201cpublic entities\u201d from discriminating against disabled individuals: \u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12132 (West 1995). A \u201cpublic entity\u201d is broadly defined under the statute to be <em>\u201cany </em>State or local government\u201d and <em>\u201cany </em>department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12131(1) (West 1995) (emphasis added). Similarly, the Rehabilitation Act prohibits discrimination against disabled individuals \u201cunder <em>any </em>program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794(a) (West Supp.1997) (emphasis added), and defines \u201cprogram or activity\u201d to include <em>\u201call </em>of the operations of ... a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">We recognized the apparent breadth of the statutory language, but stated: \u201cWe are not persuaded that this language ... even viewed in isolation from the arguably narrowing text found elsewhere in the acts, brings state prisons \u2018squarely\u2019 within the reach of these acts.\u201d <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1344. Accordingly, we stated that we were reluctant to apply the statutes to state prisons and prisoners, \u201c[ajbsent a far clearer expression of congressional intent.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-11\">Our reluctance to extend the coverage of the statutes to state prisons and prisoners absent a far clearer expression of congressional intent was grounded on the \u201cordinary rule of statutory construction\u201d that Congress must make its intention to alter the constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government unmistakably clear in the statute\u2019s language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>[I]f Congress intends to alter the \u201cusual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government,\u201d it must make its intention to do so \u201cunmistakably clear in the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, </em>473 U.S. 234, 242, 105 S.Ct. 3142, 3147, 87 L.Ed.2d 171 (1985); <em>see also Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.

Santa Fe Elevator Corp., </em>331 U.S. 218, 230, 67 S.Ct. 1146, 1152, 91 L.Ed. 1447 (1947), or if it intends to impose a condition on the grant of federal moneys, <em>Pennhurst State School and Hospital v.

Dole, </em>483 U.S. 203, 207, 107 S.Ct. 2793, 2796, 97 L.Ed.2d 171 (1987). \u201cIn traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance, the requirement of clear statement assures that the legislature has in fact faced, and intended to bring into issue, the critical matters involved in the judicial decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Will v.

We observed that pursuant to Supreme Court directives, \u201cwhere application of a federal statute to a state \u2018would upset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers[,] ... \u201cit is incumbent upon the federal courts to be certain of Congress\u2019 intent before finding that federal law overrides\u201d this balance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1344-45 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Gregory v.

Martinez, </em>416 U.S. 396, 412, 94 S.Ct. 1800, 1810-11, 40 L.Ed.2d 224 (1974) (holding that \u201c[o]ne of the primary functions of government is the preservation of societal order through enforcement of the criminal law, and the maintenance of penal institutions is an essential part of that task\u201d), <em>overruled on other grounds by Thornburgh v. Abbott, </em>490 U.S. 401, 413-14, 109 S.Ct. 1874, 1881-82, 104 L.Ed.2d 459 (1989); <em>Preiser v.

As support for the proposition that the management of state prisons is a core state function, we cited our decision in <em>Harker v. State Use Industries, </em>990 F.2d 131 (4th Cir.1993), which held that state prisoners involved in an employment skills development program in prison were not entitled to the minimum wage mandated by the Fan-Labor Standards Act (FLSA). <em>See Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1345; <em>see also id. </em>at 1345 n. 4 (noting that \u201c[m]ost courts have been similarly unwilling to extend the protections of the FLSA to prison inmates\u201d and citing cases). We also quoted a then-recent Fourth Circuit decision (which itself cited Supreme Court precedent) establishing that in the Eighth Amendment context, \u2018\u201cabsent the most extraordinary circumstances, federal courts are not to immerse themselves in the management of state prisons or to substitute then-judgment for that of the trained penological authorities charged with the administration of such facilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1345-46 (quoting <em>Taylor v.

We thus held that the broad, non-specific language contained in portions of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act did not make unmistakably clear that the statutes applied to state prisons during the time of Anthony Torcasio\u2019s incarceration. We added: \u201cBecause the management of state prisons implicates \u2018decisions] of the most fundamental sort for a sovereign entity,\u2019 Congress must speak unequivocally before we will conclude that it has \u2018clearly\u2019 subjected state prisons to its enactments.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 460, 111 S.Ct. at 2400-01).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">In addition to determining that the definitional sections of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act relied upon by the plaintiff, namely 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12131(1) and 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794(b)(1)(A), do not state in unmistakably clear terms that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons and prisoners, we also determined that other operative provisions of the statutes \u201care much less naturally read as including state prisons than are the aforementioned provisions.\u201d <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1346. First, we noted that although the ADA\u2019s definition of \u201cpublic entity\u201d is broad, \u201cit is still true that prisons are not expressly mentioned in the statute, and they certainly do not come readily to mind as the type of institution covered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1346 n. 5. We further asserted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA83\">[e]ven the name ascribed to Title II [of the ADA] \u2014 \u201cPublic Services\u201d \u2014 connotes a ban on discrimination in services provided to the public, not in the prison context where the public is excluded. State prisons thus do not fit neatly within the definition of \u201cpublic entities\u201d to which the ADA applies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\"><em>Id. </em>Second, we pointed to 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12131(2), in which the ADA defines a \u201cqualified individual with a disability\u201d as a person who \u201cmeets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities.\u201d We held that correctional facilities \u201cdo not provide \u2018services,\u2019 \u2018programs,\u2019 or \u2018activities\u2019 as those terms . are ordinarily understood.\u201d <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1347. We determined that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018eligible\u2019 and \u2018participate\u2019 imply voluntariness on the part of an applicant who seeks a benefit from the state; they do not bring to mind prisoners who are being held against their will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore concluded that only a \u201csuperficial reading of the statutes\u201d would support a conclusion that state prisons are subject to the requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act: \u201cThe recognition that the terms of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are illfitting, at best, in the context of correctional facilities, reinforces our conclusion that the applicability of the acts to state prisons is far from clear on the face of the laws.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-9\">After assessing the statutory language and relevant constitutional principles, we analyzed the manner in which our sister Circuits have addressed the question of whether the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. We began by noting that the Ninth Circuit has \u201csquarely held that the Rehabilitation Act applies to prisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1349 (citing <em>Bonner v. Lewis, </em>857 F.2d 559 (9th Cir.1988)). We noted, however, that the Ninth Circuit had \u201cretreated\u201d significantly from its holding in <em>Bonner:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-10\">In <em>Gates v. Rowland, </em>39 F.3d 1439, 1446-47 (9th Cir.1994), the court considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>\u201chow the Act is to be applied in a prison setting,\u201d and observed, \u201c[t]he Act was not designed to deal specifically with the prison environment; it was intended for general societal application. There is no indication that Congress intended the Act to apply to prison facilities irrespective of the reasonable requirements of effective prison administration.\u201d Thus, the court held that \u201cthe applicable standard for the review of the Act\u2019s statutory rights in a prison setting [is] equivalent to [the standard for] the review of constitutional rights in a prison setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1447.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">57 F.3d at 1349 n. 7 (alterations in original). We stated that \u201cwe consider <em>Gates </em>to be an indication that the Ninth Circuit is beginning to rethink its decision in <em>Bonner </em>that state prisons are subject to the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">We then acknowledged that the Eleventh Circuit, in <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir.1991), expressed its approval of <em>Bonner. See Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1349 (citing <em>Harris, </em>941 F.2d at 1522 n. 41). We also stated, however, that this expression of approval, in addition to being buried in a footnote, was dictum because the issue of whether the Rehabilitation Act applies to state prisons was not before the court. <em>See id. </em>at 1349-50 (discussing <em>Harris </em>dictum).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Next, we discussed the Tenth Circuit\u2019s determination that the Rehabilitation Act \u201cis inapplicable to <em>federal </em>prisoners.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1350. We noted that \u201c[i]n <em>Williams v. Meese, </em>926 F.2d 994 (10th Cir.1991), the Tenth Circuit held that a federal prisoner could not invoke [\u00a7 504] of the Rehabilitation Act because \u2018the Federal Bureau of Prisons does not fit the definition of \u201cprograms or activities\u201d governed by [the Rehabilitation Act].\u2019 \u201d <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1350 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Williams, </em>926 F.2d at 997). We understood <em>Williams </em>to be a broad ruling that state prisons, like their federal counterparts, \u201care not subject to the Rehabilitation Act because they do not sponsor \u2018programs or activities\u2019 as those terms are defined in the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded, for purposes of qualified immunity, that the conflict between the Ninth and Tenth Circuits was enough to show that it was not \u201cclearly established\u201d at the time of the alleged discrimination that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Subsequent to our decision in <em>Torcasio, </em>at least three of our sister Circuits have confronted the issue of whether the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. <em>See White v. Colorado, </em>82 F.3d 364 (10th Cir.1996); <em>Bryant v. Madigan, </em>84 F.3d 246 (7th Cir.1996); <em>Crawford v. Indiana Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>115 F.3d 481 (7th Cir.1997); <em>Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>118 F.3d 168 (3rd Cir.1997).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>White, </em>82 F.3d at 364, the Tenth Circuit confirmed the understanding we expressed in <em>Torcasio </em>of that Circuit\u2019s <em>Williams </em>decision. <em>White </em>rejected, \u201c[f]or the same reasoning relied upon in <em>Williams,\u201d </em>a <em>state </em>prisoner\u2019s allegation that Colorado prison officials violated the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act by denying him prison employment opportunities because of his disability. <em>See id. </em>at 367. <em>White </em>therefore held that state prisons do not fit the definition of \u201cprograms or activities\u201d governed by the statutes. <em>Cf. Williams, </em>926 F.2d at 997.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">In <em>Bryant v. Madigan, </em>84 F.3d 246 (7th Cir.1996), the Seventh Circuit held that the ADA did not provide a cause of action to a disabled state prisoner to challenge the prison\u2019s failure to provide guardrails on his bed. Chief Judge Posner, writing for the court, recognized that the ADA contains \u201cno express exclusion\u201d of state prisons, but stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AeZ\">It is very far from clear that prisoners should be considered \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d within the meaning of the Act. Could Congress really have intended disabled prisoners to be mainstreamed into an already highly restricted prison society? Most rights of free Americans, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>constitutional rights such as the right to free speech, to the free exercise of religion, and to marry, are curtailed when asserted by prisoners; and there are formidable practical objections to burdening prisons with having to comply with the onerous requirements of the Act, especially when we reflect that alcoholism and other forms of addiction are disabilities within the meaning of the Act and afflict a substantial proportion of the prison population.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 248. Chief Judge Posner stated further that \u201cJudge-made exceptions to laws of general applicability are justified to avoid absurdity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 248-49 (citation omitted). An exception to the ADA for prisoners, he suggested, \u201cthough not express, may have textual foundation in the term \u2018qualified individual.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 249. Despite strongly suggesting that the ADA does not apply to prisons, the <em>Bryant </em>court ultimately left the question open by determining that even if the Act applied, the plaintiff had failed to state a claim. <em>See id. </em>at 249 (\u201cEven if there were (as we doubt) <em>some </em>domain of applicability of the Act to prisoners, the Act would not be violated by a prison\u2019s simply failing to attend to the medical needs of its disabled prisoners.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">Recently, the Seventh Circuit, in an opinion again authored by Chief Judge Posner, recanted its strong suggestion in <em>Bryant </em>that the ADA has no application to prisons. In <em>Crawford v. Indiana Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>115 F.3d 481 (7th Cir.1997), the court held, despite the reservations it expressed .in <em>Bryant, </em>that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. <em>See id. </em>at 483, 487. In <em>Crawford, </em>the plaintiff, a former state prisoner, complained that because of his blindness he had been denied access to educational programs, the library, and the dining hall at the prison where he was incarcerated. Because the district court dismissed the suit on the pleadings, the sole question before the court was whether the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. <em>See id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">Beginning with the plain language of the statute, the <em>Crawford </em>court conceded that \u201c[ijnearceration itself is hardly a \u2018program\u2019 or \u2018activity\u2019 to which a disabled person might wish access.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Bryant, </em>84 F.3d at 249). The court conceded further that literal application of the statute to prisons \u201cmight seem absurd,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 486:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-8\">Prisoners are not a favored group in society; the propensity of some of them to sue at the drop of a hat is well known; prison systems are strapped for funds; the practical effect of granting disabled prisoners rights of access that might require costly modifications of prison facilities might be the curtailment of educational, recreational, and rehabilitative programs for prisoners, in which event everyone might be worse off.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-9\"><em>Id. </em>The court conceded still further that \u201cthe special conditions of the prison setting license a degree of discrimination that would not be tolerated in a free environment,\u201d and admitted that \u201capplication [of the ADA] to prisoners might produce some anomalies.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nevertheless, the court reversed the course it had taken in <em>Bryant </em>and determined that the broad statutory language brought state prisons within the statutes\u2019 scope.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-10\">The court recognized that statutes are often interpreted in a manner that creates an exception to broad statutory language. <em>See id. </em>at 484-85. As an example, the court noted that courts have uniformly excluded prisoners employed in a prison from the minimum-wage and maximum-hours provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), despite the fact that the \u201cFLSA defines \u2018employee\u2019 sweepingly; prisoners fall within [the statute\u2019s] literal scope; and there is no express exception for or applicable to prisoners.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 484 (citations omitted). Although acknowledging that \u201cthe failure to exclude prisoners from the [ADA] may well ... have been an oversight,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 487, the court nevertheless stated that \u201ccourts do not create exceptions to statutes every time it seems that the legislature overlooked something,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-11\">Without mentioning our explication in <em>Torcasio </em>of the clear statement rule, the <em>Crawford </em>court determined that the rule is inapplicable to the question of whether the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons \u2014 despite agreeing that \u201c[p]rison ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ministration is indeed a core function of state government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485. The court held that because the defendant state prison conceded that the ADA applies to its relations with employees and visitors, \u201cthe elear-statement rule does not carry this particular core function of state government outside the scope of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court also declined to create an exception \u201cto save the statute from generating absurd consequences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The <em>Crawford </em>court concluded by reinstating the prisoner\u2019s suit. The court recognized that on remand, the defendant might be able to show that there was no reasonable accommodation possible, or that any necessary accommodation would impose an undue burden on the prison system. <em>See id. </em>at 487. \u201cTerms like \u2018reasonable\u2019 and \u2018undue\u2019 are relative to circumstances,\u201d the court opined, \u201cand the circumstances of a prison are different from those of a school, an office, or a factory, as the Supreme Court has emphasized in the parallel setting of prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 84-91, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 2259-63, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)). Thus, the court recognized \u2014 like the Ninth Circuit before it, <em>see Gates, </em>39 F.3d at 1446-47 \u2014 that \u201csecurity concerns ... are highly relevant to determining the feasibility <em>of </em>the accommodations that disabled prisoners need in order to have access to desired programs and services.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 487. The court declined, however, to outline the meaning of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d and \u201cundue burden\u201d in the prison context.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Drawing heavily from the Seventh Circuit\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>opinion, the Third Circuit also recently held that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state correctional facilities. <em>See Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>118 F.3d 168 (3rd Cir.1997). In <em>Yeskey, </em>the court determined that the statutory language was \u201call-encompassing\u201d and \u201cbroad\u201d and therefore brought state prisons within the scope of the statutes. <em>See id. </em>at 170-71. Unlike the Seventh Circuit, the court also relied on regulations promulgated by the Department of Justice (DOJ) \u201clisting correctional facilities ... as covered entities,\u201d as confirmation \u201cthat the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state and locally-operated [prisons].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 172.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-7\">The court recognized that we had questioned in <em>Torcasio </em>the applicability of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons, but held that our analysis in that case was \u201cseriously flawed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>According to <em>Yeskey, </em>our \u201cextension of the clear statement rule was unwarranted [because] <em>Will, Atascadero, </em>and <em>Pennhurst </em>\u201d \u2014 eases we cited in <em>Torcasio </em>as support for applying the clear statement rule \u2014 \u201call involved instances in which there had been no express waiver or abrogation of the state\u2019s traditional immunity from suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In contrast, the court opined, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act each contain an express abrogation of the Eleventh Amendment \u2019 immunity of the States. <em>See id. </em>at 172-73 (citing 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(l) (West 1994) (Rehabilitation Act); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12202 (West 1995) (ADA)).</p>\n<p id=\"b647-8\">The court implicitly recognized that the clear statement rule has been applied by the Supreme Court in cases where there was an express abrogation, by Congress of the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>see, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft, </em>501 U.S. 452, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (holding that Missouri\u2019s mandatory retirement requirement for state judges does not violate the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA)), and explicitly conceded that whenever \u201c \u2018Congress intends to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government, it must make its intention to do so unmistakably clear in the language of the statute,\u2019\u201d <em>Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 173 (quoting <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 460, 111 S.Ct. at 2400-01), and that \u201cprison administration [is] a \u2018core\u2019 state function,\u201d <em>id. </em>Notwithstanding these concessions, the court determined that the clear statement rule was inapplicable because, it concluded, Congress made clear in the language of the statutes that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-9\">The court acknowledged the looming \u201cspecter of federal court management of state prisons,\u201d resulting from application of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. <em>Id. </em>at 174; <em>see also id. </em>(\u201c \u2018[I]f the ADA applies to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>routine prison decisions, it is not unfathomable that courts will be used to reconstruct cells and prison space, to alter scheduling of inmate movements and assignments, and to interfere with security procedures.\u2019\u201d (quoting Appellees\u2019 Br. at 15)). The court held, however, that such concerns \u201cdo not override our conclusion that the ADA applies to prisons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court concluded: \u201c[O]ur holding does not dispose of the controversial and difficult question [of] whether principles of deference to the decisions of prison officials in the context of constitutional law apply to statutory rights. We are not sure of the answer, and need not address that question now.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174-75 (citation and footnote omitted) (citing <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. at 78, 107 S.Ct. at 2255-56). Thus, the court\u2014 like the Seventh Circuit in <em>Crawford </em>\u2014 declined to outline the meaning of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d and \u201cundue burden\u201d under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act in the prison context.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">We remain firmly convinced that <em>Torcasio </em>\u2019s explication of the clear statement principle and its application to the issue before us is both thorough and persuasive. <em>Torcasio </em>accurately outlined the parameters of the clear statement rule, stating that Congress must speak clearly in the statutory text when it intends to alter the traditional balance between the states and the federal government. <em>See </em>57 F.3d at 1346. <em>Torcasio </em>also forcefully explained why the operation of state prisons is an area traditionally reserved to the states, and persuasively outlined the sundry ambiguities in the statutory text which reveal that Congress failed to speak with unmistakable clarity on the issue of whether the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state prisons. Most importantly, <em>Torcasio </em>recognized the profound consequences that would result if the statutes were applied to state prisons: \u201cApplication of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act would have serious implications for the management of state prisons, in matters ranging from cell construction and modification, to inmate assignment, to scheduling, to security problems.\u201d 57 F.3d at 1346.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">Our conclusion today that <em>Torcasio </em>was rightly decided, and that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not apply to state prisons, is fortified by the interpretive analyses undertaken by the Ninth, Seventh, and Third Circuits in determining that the statutes have application in the state prison context, by the extraordinary lengths to which those circuits have gone to acknowledge the chaos that will likely result from their holdings, and, in some cases, by the efforts they have made to limit the reach of their holdings. Most importantly, each of the Circuits holding that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state prisons has gone to extraordinary lengths to acknowledge the chaos likely to result from their holdings. <em>See, e.g., Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 487 (noting \u201csecurity concerns\u201d); <em>Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 174 (acknowledging the \u201cspecter of federal court management of state prisons,\u201d and that \u201cit is not unfathomable that courts will be used to reconstruct cells and prison space, to alter scheduling of inmate movements and assignments, and to interfere with security procedures\u201d (quotation omitted)). In addition, the Ninth Circuit has gone out of its way to limit the reach of its holding that the statutes apply to state prisons. Specifically, while purporting to adhere to the text of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA in determining that the statutes apply to state prisons, the Ninth Circuit \u2014 when forced to outline the meaning of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d and \u201cundue burden\u201d in the state prison context\u2014 has created extratextually, out of whole cloth, a statutory standard by engrafting the constitutional standard onto the statute, see <em>Gates, </em>39 F.3d at 1447; for their part, the Seventh and Third Circuits have transformed themselves into contortionists attempting to avoid the necessary consequences of then-holdings by declining to outline the meaning of \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d and \u201cundue burden\u201d in the prison context, <em>see Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 487; <em>Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 174-75. Unlike the Ninth, Seventh, and Third Circuits, we decline to engage in such interpretive gymnastics.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">Accordingly, we hereby reaffirm that state prisons cannot be subjected to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act unless there has been a clear and plain statement from Congress permitting federal intrusion into this area of historic state control. Furthermore, we con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>elude, as we strongly suggested in <em>Torcasio, </em>that Congress has made no such clear statement regarding the application of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons. Therefore, we hold that state prisons are not subject to the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Not surprisingly, the prisoners and the Justice Department contend that <em>Torcasio </em>was wrongly decided. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 23-25; DOJ Br. at 12-21.) First, they argue that courts are to apply the clear statement rule only where statutory intent is ambiguous, <em>see Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 470, 111 S.Ct. at 2406, and that in this case \u201cthere is no ambiguity as to the statute\u2019s [sic] coverage of state prisons and prisoners.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 25; <em>accord </em>DOJ Br. at 17.) According to the prisoners and the Justice Department, the <em>Torcasio </em>court\u2019s determination that it is \u201cfar from clear on the face of the laws\u201d that Congress intended the statutes to apply to state prisons, <em>see </em>57 F.3d at 1347, was simply erroneous. (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 23; DOJ Br. at 19.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">Relying on the broad, non-specific language of the statutes, the prisoners and the Justice Department argue that \u201cthe operations of state or local correctional facilities fall quite naturally within the terms \u2018programs\u2019 and \u2018activities.\u2019 \u201d (DOJ Br. at 19; <em>accord </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 23.) We cannot agree. \u201c[I]nearceration, which requires the provision of a place to sleep, is not a \u2018program\u2019 or \u2018activity.\u2019 \u201d <em>Bryant, </em>84 F.3d at 249; <em>accord White, </em>82 F.3d at 367 (holding that prisons do not sponsor \u201cprograms\u201d or \u201cactivities\u201d as those terms are ordinarily understood (adopting <em>Williams, </em>926 F.2d at 997)); <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1347 (same). The operations of state prisons fall naturally within the statutory terms \u201cservices,\u201d \u201cprograms,\u201d and \u201cactivities\u201d only when particular services, activities, or programs are divorced from the context of correctional facilities. A family outing to the local public library, for example, falls quite naturally within the common understanding of the meaning of \u201cactivity,\u201d <em>see Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 483. The use of a court-mandated prison law library by an individual incarcerated by a state, <em>see Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977) (requiring prison authorities to provide prisoners with adequate law libraries), on the other hand, does not fall naturally within the ambit of that statutory term. As we stated in <em>Torcasio, </em>\u201cmost prison officials would be surprised to learn that they were\u201d required by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to provide \u201c \u2018services,\u2019 \u2018programs,\u2019 or \u2018activities\u2019 as those terms are ordinarily understood.\u201d 57 F.3d at 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">We also concluded in <em>Torcasio </em>that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018eligible\u2019 and \u2018participate\u2019 imply voluntariness on the part of an applicant who seeks a benefit from the state; they do not bring to mind prisoners who are being held against their will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The prisoners and the Justice Department contend that our suggestion that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are inapplicable to programs and services that are obligatory in nature was incorrect because \u201cthe terms \u2018eligible\u2019 and \u2018participate\u2019 do not, as <em>Torcasio </em>stated,\u2019imply voluntariness\u2019 or mandate that an individual seek out or request a service to be covered.\u201d (DOJ Br. at 20 (citation omitted) (quoting <em>Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1347); <em>accord </em>Appellants\u2019 Br. at 23-24.) The provision by a state government of some compulsory programs and services may be subject to the requirements of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, notwithstanding the fact that such programs or services are in some sense \u201cinvoluntary.\u201d Nevertheless, we are satisfied that our conclusion in <em>Torcasio </em>was correct: The statutory language does not bring to mind prisoners being held against their will, and therefore neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act state with unmistakable clarity that the statutes apply to state prisons. <em>See </em>57 F.3d at 1346-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-9\">Furthermore, the introductory language of both statutes reveals that Congress did not clearly express an intention to make the statutes applicable to state prisons and prisoners. Under the ADA, Congress determined that \u201cthe Nation\u2019s proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>\u00a7 12101(a)(8) (West 1995). Achieving these goals, Congress found, would provide \u201cpeople with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our <em>free society </em>is justifiably famous.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101(a)(9) (emphasis added). This introductory language in no way evinces an intention by Congress to make the ADA applicable to state prisons. As Appellees put it, \u201c[wjithout question, a prison is hardly such a free society.\u201d (Appellees\u2019 Br. at 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Similarly, the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s introductory language does not manifest an intention by Congress to make the Rehabilitation Act applicable to state prisons. The introductory section of the Rehabilitation Act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-5\">(3) disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-6\">(A) live independently;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-7\">(B) enjoy self-determination;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-8\">(C) make choices;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-9\">(D) contribute to society;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-10\">(E) pursue meaningful careers; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b650-11\">(F) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b650-12\">29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 701(a)(3) (West Supp.1997). This introductory language, like that of the ADA, does not even hint at an intention by Congress to make the ADA applicable to state prisons. Indeed, the contrary inference \u2014 that Congress never contemplated that the Rehabilitation Act would apply to state prisons' \u2014 is readily drawn. Disabled and nondisabled prisoners alike, because of their inability to live in a free society, neither \u201clive independently,\u201d \u201cenjoy self-determination,\u201d nor \u201cenjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of American society.\u201d <em>Cf. Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 486 (conceding that \u201c[ijnsofar as the Act is intended to \u2018mainstream\u2019 disabled people, its application to prisoners might produce some anomalies\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-15\">Congress simply has not spoken through the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act with anywhere near the clarity and the degree of specificity required for us -to conclude that state prisons are subject to the statutes. Neither the prisoners nor the Department of Justice are able to direct us to statutory language or legislative history to the contrary. Indeed, the legislative history of both the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act is silent on the applicability of the statutes to state prisons.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In <em>Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d 168, the Third Circuit determined that this congressional silence constituted tacit approval of its conclusion that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \u201capply to state and local correctional facilities.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AvL\">[T]he legislative history does not inveigh against this conclusion. When the ADA was enacted in 1990, the Rehabilitation Act had been law for seventeen years and a number of cases had held it applicable to prisons and prisoners, yet Congress did not amend that Act or alter any language so as to extirpate those interpretations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeZA\"><em>Id. </em>at 174 n. 7; <em>accord Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 484 (noting that \u201c[w]hen the [ADA] was passed in 1990, the Rehabilitation Act ... had been on the books for 17 years, and there were several cases holding that Act applicable to prisons and prisoners\u201d (citing <em>Bonner v. Lewis, </em>857 F.2d 559 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Harris v. Thigpen, </em>727 F.Supp. 1564, 1582-83 (M.D.Ala.1990), <em>aff'd, </em>941 F.2d 1495 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Sites v. McKenzie, </em>423 F.Supp. 1190, 1197 (N.D.W.Va.1976))). Congressional silence in the ADA\u2019s legislative history regarding the applicability of the statute to state prisons, however, provides no basis for inferring congressional approval of one Circuit\u2019s (and two district courts\u2019) interpretation of the Act. Indeed, \u201c[i]t is at best treacherous to find in Congressional silence alone the adoption of a controlling rule of law.\u201d <em>Gir</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number><em>ouard v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 61, 69, 66 S.Ct. 826, 830, 90 L.Ed. 1084 (1946); <em>see also EEOC v. Gilbarco, Inc., </em>615 F.2d 985, 1013-15 (4th Cir.1980) (Murnaghan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (questioning soundness of proposition that congressional silence or inaction in reenacting a statute constitutes approval of prior judicial interpretation of the statute). As the <em>Crawford </em>court acknowledged, \u201cCongress may not have been aware of the cases interpreting that Act.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 484. Accordingly, we can conclude only that Congress did not contemplate, let alone approve, the preADA application of the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons and the implications such application would have for the sovereignty of the States. <em>Cf. Virginia Dep\u2019t of Education v. Riley, </em>106 F.3d 559, 567 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc) (applying clear statement rule and stating that not \u201ca single word from the statute or from the legislative history of [the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) ] evidenced] that Congress even considered\u201d requiring states to continue providing educational services to disabled children after their expulsion for misconduct unrelated to their disabilities).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">Appellees do not argue that had Congress expressed with unmistakable clarity an intention to regulate state correctional facilities through the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, it would nonetheless have been without the authority to do so. Presumably, Appellees decline to make such an argument in light of <em>Garcia v. San Antonio Metro. Transit Auth., </em>469 U.S. 528, 547-56, 105 S.Ct. 1005, 1015-20, 83 L.Ed.2d 1016 (1985) (leaving primarily to political process the protection of the States against intrusive exercises of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause powers). Were we operating <em>pre-Garcia, </em>however, Congress\u2019 authority to regulate state prisons in the manner contended by the prisoners and the Justice Department would be doubtful. <em>See National League of Cities v. Usery, </em>426 U.S. 833, 855, 96 S.Ct. 2465, 2476, 49 L.Ed.2d 245 (1976) (\u201cCongress may not exercise [Commerce Clause] power so as to force directly upon the States its choices as to how essential decisions regarding the conduct of integral governmental functions are to be made.\u201d), <em>overruled by Garcia, </em>469 U.S. at 528, 105 S.Ct. at 1006. <em>Garcia </em>notwithstanding, whether Congress even has the authority to regulate state prisons is not readily apparent. <em>See Garcia, </em>469 U.S. at 580, 105 S.Ct. at 1032-33 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (stating that principle outlined in <em>National League of Cities </em>\u201cwill, I am confident, in time again command the support of a majority of this Court\u201d); <em>see also Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 464, 111 S.Ct. at 2402-03 (noting <em>Garcia\u2019s </em>constraint on \u201cour ability to consider the limits that the state-federal balance places on Congress\u2019 powers under the Commerce Clause,\u201d and stating that \u201c[application of the plain statement rule thus may avoid a potential constitutional problem\u201d). This is true even though Congress, in addition to relying on its Commerce Clause powers, invoked its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment when it enacted the ADA, <em>see </em>42 U.S.CA \u00a7 12101(b)(4) (West 1995). Congress\u2019 enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment is not unlimited. <em>See City of Boerne v. Flores, </em>\u2014 U.S.-,-, 117 S.Ct. 2157, 2159, 138 L.Ed.2d 624 (1997) (holding that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is \u201ca considerable congressional intrusion into the States\u2019 traditional prerogatives,\u201d and that Congress exceeded its power under the Fourteenth Amendment in enacting the statute); <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>469, 111 S.Ct. at 2405 (\u201c[T]he Fourteenth Amendment does not override all principles of federalism.\u201d); <em>but cf. Clark v. California, </em>123 F.3d 1267, 1270 (9th Cir.1997) (holding that \u201cboth the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act were validly enacted under the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d); <em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 487 (holding \u201cthat the ADA is [within] the scope of section 5\u201d of the Fourteenth Amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">Second, in addition to arguing that the clear statement rule should not apply because the statutes are unambiguous, the prisoners contend that the clear statement rule may be applied only where \u201cthe proposed application of federal law would infringe upon a core function going to the \u2018heart of representative government,\u2019 <em>e.g., </em>\u2018the authority of the people of the States to determine the qualifications of their most important government officials.\u2019 \u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 24 (quoting <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 463, 111 S.Ct. at 2402).) Put differently, the prisoners contend that Congress is required to make a clear statement of its intention to alter the usual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government <em>only </em>when federal legislation implicates the functioning of democratic processes within a state. The Supreme Court, however, has not confined the clear statement rule so narrowly. <em>See, e.g., Will, </em>491 U.S. at 65, 109 S.Ct. at 2309 (describing the clear statement rule as an \u201cordinary rule of statutory construction\u201d to be applied in analyzing statutes altering the \u201cusual constitutional balance between the States and the Federal Government\u201d). Indeed, the Supreme Court has held that the clear statement rule is to be invoked \u201c[i]n traditionally sensitive areas, such as legislation affecting the federal balance.\u201d <em>United States v. Bass, </em>404 U.S. 336, 349, 92 S.Ct. 515, 523, 30 L.Ed.2d 488 (1971). As we have stated, the management of state prisons is just such a traditionally sensitive area, and application of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to state prisons would unquestionably affect the federal balance. <em>See Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1345 (citing <em>Procunier, </em>416 U.S. at 412, 94 S.Ct. at 1810-11; <em>Preiser, </em>411 U.S. at 491-92, 93 S.Ct. at 1837-38); <em>cf. Riley, </em>106 F.3d at 566 (holding that \u201cinsistence upon a clear, unambiguous statutory expression of congressional intent to condition the States\u2019 receipt of federal funds in a particular' manner is especially important where ... the claimed condition requires the surrender of one of ... the powers or functions reserved to the States by the Tenth Amendment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The Justice Department argues that the \u201cextension of the clear' statement rule [in <em>Torcasio </em>] was unwarranted ... [because] both Section 504 and Title II of the ADA contain an unequivocal expression of Congressional intent to overturn the constitutionally guaranteed immunity of the several states.\u201d (DOJ Br. at 16 (quotation omitted) (citing 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(l) (West 1994); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12202 (West 1995))); <em>accord Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 172-73. We agree that Congress\u2019 express abrogation in the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act of the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the States suggests that Congress intended for those statutes to apply to states generally.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> However, \u201ca clear statement is required not simply in determining whether a statute applies to the States, but also in determining whether the statute applies in the particular manner claimed.\u201d <em>Riley, </em>106 F.3d at 568 (citing <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 460-70, 111 S.Ct. at 2400-06).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\"><em>Gregory </em>is closely analogous. <em>See </em>501 U.S. at 452, 111 S.Ct. at 2396-97. In <em>Gregory, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), a statute in which Congress expressly abrogated the States\u2019 Eleventh Amendment immunity, <em>see </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 630(b)(2) (West 1985), did not apply to state judges because the statute did not unambiguously reveal that Congress intended such a result. Like the ADEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are statutes in which Congress has expressly abrogated the Eleventh Amendment immunity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>States. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(l); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12202. This express abrogation suggests that Congress intended the statutes to apply to states generally. The applicability of the statutes to state prisons and prisoners, however, like the applicability of the ADEA to state judges, was simply not addressed by Congress in the language of the statutes. Thus, in <em>Gregory </em>the Supreme Court determined that it was ambiguous whether Congress intended the ADEA to apply to state judges. <em>See Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 467, 111 S.Ct. at 2404. The language of the statute, the court held, \u201cis sufficiently broad that we cannot conclude that the statute plainly covers appointed state judges.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, for the same reasons, because the statutory language is so broad, we cannot conclude that Congress intended that the statutes apply to state prisons and prisoners. As in <em>Gregory, </em>the breadth of the statutory language renders it ambiguous. We therefore decline to attribute to Congress an intent to intrude on a core state function in the face of statutory ambiguity. <em>Cf. Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 464-71, 111 S.Ct. at 2402-07; <em>see also Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1346.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">In <em>Gregory, </em>the Supreme Court determined that it could not \u201cconclude that the statute plainly covers appointed state judges,\u201d 501 U.S. at 467, 111 S.Ct. at 2404, because of the solicitude owed to the rights of the States in our federalist system. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-5\">[Ijnasmuch as this Court in <em>Garcia </em>has left primarily to the political process the protection of the States against intrusive exercises of Congress\u2019 Commerce Clause powers, we must be absolutely certain that Congress intended such an exercise. \u201c[T]o give the state-displacing weight of federal law to mere congressional <em>ambiguity </em>would evade the very procedure for lawmaking on which <em>Garcia </em>relied to protect states\u2019 interests.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 464, 111 S.Ct. at 2403 (quoting Laurence H. Tribe, <em>American Constitutional Law </em>\u00a7 6-25, at 480 (2nd ed.1988)). The court went on to hold that Congress also must speak with unmistakable clarity when enacting intrusive legislation pursuant to its power under \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>id. </em>at 467-70, 111 S.Ct. at 2404-06. The court stated that \u2018\u201c[bjecause such legislation imposes congressional policy on a State involuntarily, and because it often intrudes on traditional state authority, we should not quickly attribute to Congress an unstated intent to act under its authority to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 469, 111 S.Ct. at 2405-06 (quoting <em>Pennhurst, </em>451 U.S. at 16, 101 S.Ct. at 1539). The ease before us is indistinguishable from <em>Gregory. </em>Just as \u201cit is at least ambiguous whether Congress intended that appointed judges ... be included\u201d within the scope of the ADEA, <em>id. </em>at 470, 111 S.Ct. at 2406, it is <em>at least </em>ambiguous whether Congress intended that the strictures <em>of the ADA </em>and the Rehabilitation Act apply to state prisons. Accordingly, as in <em>Gregory, </em>\u201c[i]n the face of such ambiguity, we will not attribute to Congress an intent to intrude on state governmental functions regardless of whether Congress acted pursuant to its Commerce Clause powers or \u00a7 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">Finally, both the prisoners and the Department of Justice contend that \u201ceven if this Court were to adhere to the view that it is ambiguous on the face of the statutes whether they apply to state prisons, any such ambiguity is definitively resolved by DOJ regulations.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 26; <em>accord </em>DOJ Br. at 8-12.) They argue that DOJ regulations applying the statutes to state prisons must be accorded \u201cthe greatest possible weight and deference in interpreting the statutes.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 21; <em>accord </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>DOJ Br. at 8 (citing <em>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v.

The regulations promulgated under \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act define \u201cprogram\u201d to mean \u201cthe operations of the agency or organizational unit of government receiving or substantially benefiting from the Federal assistance awarded, <em>e.g., </em>a police department or department of corrections.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.540(h) (1996). The regulations promulgated under Title II of the ADA designate the Department of Justice as the agency responsible for coordinating the compliance activities of public entities that administer \u201cprograms, services, and regulatory activities relating to law enforcement, public safety, and the administration of justice, including courts and correctional institutions.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.190(b)(6) (1996). The preamble to the ADA regulations also states that \u201c[a] public entity is not ... required to provide attendant care, or assistance in toileting, eating, or dressing to individuals with disabilities, except ... where the individual is an inmate of a custodial or correctional institution.\u201d 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, app. A, at 468 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\">The regulations promulgated under the Rehabilitation Act adopt the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS), which apply to federal agencies and entities receiving federal financial assistance. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.522(b) (1996). UFAS lists jails, prisons, reformatories, and \u201c[o]ther detention or correctional facilities\u201d as institutions to which UFAS standards apply. <em>See </em>41 C.F.R. subpt. 101-19.6, app. A, at 150 (1996). UFAS standards regulate in minute detail the construction and maintenance of buildings of federal agencies and institutions receiving federal funding. UFAS standards consume 87 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, <em>see </em>41 C.F.R. subpt. 101-19.6, app. A, at 140-227, and include requirements for, <em>inter alia, </em>the construction, modification, or installation of ground and floor surfaces, parking and passenger loading zones, curb ramps, ramps, stairs, elevators, platform lifts, windows, doors, entrances, drinking fountains and water coolers, water closets, toilet stalls, urinals, lavatories and mirrors, bathtubs, shower stalls, toilet rooms, sinks, handrails, grab bars, tub and shower seats, alarms, telephones, assembly areas, and dwelling units, <em>see id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b654-6\">The regulations promulgated under the ADA permit covered entities building new or altering existing facilities to follow either UFAS or the ADA Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities (ADAAG). <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.151(c) (1996). Amendments to the ADAAG, adopted as an Interim Final Rule, effective December 20, 1994, by the Architectural &amp; Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, include specific accessibility guidelines for \u201cdetention and correctional facilities.\u201d 59 Fed.Reg. 31,676, 31,770-72 (1994); <em>see also </em>36 C.F.R. pt. 1191, app. A, at 782-84 (1996). The Department of Justice has proposed adoption of the interim final rule. <em>See </em>59 Fed.Reg. at 31,808. Like the byzantine UFAS standards, ADAAG standards intricately regulate the construction or modification of existing covered facilities and consume 129 pages of the Code of Federal Regulations. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. pt. 1191, app. A, at 663-792. ADAAG requirements specific to \u201cdetention and correctional facilities\u201d address, <em>inter alia, </em>specifications for prison visiting areas, medical care facilities, and restrooms; the \u201cdispersion\u201d of \u201caccessible cells\u201d within the correctional facility; accommodations for inmates with hearing impairments; and the appropriate height of prison beds. <em>See id. </em>at 782-84.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">The prisoners and the Justice Department contend that in the event of ambiguity over whether the statutes apply to state prisons we must defer to the Justice Department\u2019s interpretation of the statutes as set forth in the regulations. They make this contention \u201cas if we were interpreting a statute which has no implications for the balance of power between the Federal Government and the States.\u201d <em>Riley, </em>106 F.3d at 567. The implications for the balance of power between the Federal Government and the States, however, are enormous. The intrusiveness of regulations (especially the UFAS and ADAAG standards) makes this apparent. Where application of an ambiguous federal statute would \u201cupset the usual constitutional balance of federal and state powers,\u201d <em>Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 460, 111 S.Ct. at 2401, as in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>we will not defer to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of the statute, however reasonable, <em>see Riley, </em>106 F.3d at 567. The argument to the contrary, put forth by both the prisoners and the Department of Justice, has been soundly rejected by the Supreme Court. <em>See Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 493, 111 S.Ct. at 2418 (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (arguing unsuccessfully that <em>Chevron </em>deference, rather than clear statement rule, was appropriate).</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">Finally, if nothing else convinced us that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not apply to state prisons, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Gates </em>would. <em>See </em>39 F.3d at 1439. Bound by a previous decision holding that the Rehabilitation Act applies to state prisons, <em>see Bonner, </em>857 F.2d at 559, the <em>Gates </em>court was forced to consider \u201chow the Act is to be applied in a prison setting.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>39 F.3d at 1446; <em>but cf. Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 174-75 &amp; n. 8 (applying ADA and Rehabilitation Act to state prisons but declining to determine appropriate standard for reviewing claims brought under the statutes); <em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 483, 487 (same). Recognizing that \u201c[t]he Act was not designed to deal specifically with the prison environment,\u201d and that \u201c[tjhere is no indication that Congress intended the Act to apply to prison facilities irrespective of the considerations of the reasonable requirements of effective prison administration,\u201d the court determined that \u201c[i]t is highly doubtful that Congress intended a more stringent application of the prisoners\u2019 statutory rights created by the Act than it would the prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Gates, </em>39 F.3d at 1446-47. Thus, the court deemed \u2014 out of whole cloth \u2014 \u201cthe applicable standard for the review of the Act\u2019s statutory rights in a prison setting to be equivalent to the review of constitutional rights in a prison setting.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1447 (citing <em>Turner v. Safley, </em>482 U.S. 78, 107 S.Ct. 2254, 96 L.Ed.2d 64 (1987)).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> As a result, although the Ninth Circuit has applied the Rehabilitation Act (and the ADA, <em>see Duffy, </em>98 F.3d at 447) to state prisons, it has effectively eviscerated the statutes in the prison context. <em>See </em>Ira P. Robbins, <em>George Bush\u2019s America Meets Dante\u2019s Inferno: The Americans with Disabilities Act in Prison, </em>15 Yale L. &amp; Pol\u2019y Rev. 49, 96 &amp; n.249 (1996) (citing William C.

Because the statutes do not apply to state prisons and prisoners, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b655-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-9\">After the district court granted summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, a hearing was held on Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Eighth Amendment claims of prisoners Amos, William Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>Michael Smith, Megginson, Ralph, and Prymerman, brought under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1983 (West Supp.1997).

Thereafter, the court issued an amended final order granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment \u201cas to all claims.\u201d (J.A. at 136.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The six prisoners contend that the district court erred in granting summary judgment on their Eighth Amendment claims. They argue that they presented evidence of inadequate medical care sufficient to withstand summary judgment. According to the prisoners, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to them establishes that Appellees Lanham, the Commissioner of the Maryland Division of- Corrections, and Galley, the Warden of RCI, knew about but failed to take appropriate measures to remedy serious risks to their health.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>See Higgins v.

The prisoners concede that they \u201cfailed to specify in their Complaint for damages that the defendants were named \u2018in their individual capacities,\u201d\u2019 but argue that \u201cthe court should look to the totality of the Complaint as well as the course of proceedings to determine whether the defendants received sufficient notice of potential exposure to liability.\u201d (Appellants\u2019 Br. at 45 n.39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b656-13\">In <em>Biggs v. Meadows, </em>66 F.3d 56 (4th Cir.1995), we held \u201cthat a plaintiff need not plead expressly the capacity in which he is suing a defendant in order to state a cause of action under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60. Accordingly, we reversed the district court\u2019s dismissal of a \u00a7 1983 complaint brought by a pro se prisoner who \u201chad failed to plead expressly that the defendants were being sued as individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 58. Although the prisoners in this case never cite <em>Biggs, </em>they apparently argue that we should apply the <em>Biggs </em>rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-14\">In <em>Biggs, </em>we noted that the Supreme Court has \u201cdeclined to resolve[ ] a split among the federal circuit courts on the appropriate way to treat a complaint that fails to state explicitly the capacity in which a defendant is sued under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Biggs, </em>66 F.3d at 59 (citing <em>Hafer v. Melo, </em>502 U.S. 21, 23, 112 S.Ct. 358, 360-61, 116 L.Ed.2d 301 (1991)). We determined, however, that \u201ca substantial majority\u201d of the Circuits look \u201cto the substance of the plaintiffs claim, the relief sought, and the course of proceedings to determine the nature of a \u00a7 1983 suit when a plaintiff fails to allege capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because we found this view to be persuasive, <em>see id. </em>at 60, we adopted it. We stated: \u201c[Wlhen a plaintiff does not allege capacity specifically, the court must examine the nature of the plaintiffs claims, the relief sought, and the course of proceedings to determine whether a state official is being sued in a personal capacity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 61.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>The <em>Biggs </em>rule does not apply to the ease before us. By the rule\u2019s own terms, it applies only \u201cwhen a plaintiff does not allege capacity specifically.\u201d <em>Id.; see also id. </em>at 59 (noting that \u201cwhen a plaintiff fails to allege capacity,\u201d the majority of Circuits look to the substance of the complaint). Unlike the prisoner in <em>Biggs, </em>whose complaint was silent on the issue of the defendants\u2019 capacity, the prisoners here alleged capacity specifically by expressly pleading that Lanham and Galley were being sued in their official capacities. Indeed, they concede as much in their briefing on appeal. Furthermore, unlike the prisoner in <em>Biggs, </em>the prisoners in the instant case are not proceeding pro se. Thus, the Supreme Court\u2019s directive that we construe pro se complaints liberally, <em>see Boag v. MacDougall, </em>454 U.S. 364, 365, 102 S.Ct. 700, 701, 70 L.Ed.2d 551 (1982) (per curiam); <em>Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 595-96, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972), is inapposite. The prisoners in this case have been represented from the outset of this litigation by several public interest law firms, including the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland (ACLU), an organization known for its litigation prowess. The relaxed pleading requirements applicable to pro se complaints, therefore, are simply not applicable here. <em>See, e.g., White v. White, </em>886 F.2d 721, 722-23 (4th Cir.1989) (holding that pro se complaints, however inartfully pleaded, must be held to \u201cless stringent standards than pleadings drafted by attorneys\u201d); <em>Boyce v. Alizaduh, </em>595 F.2d 948, 951 (4th Cir.1979) (same). Accordingly, as is revealed on the face of the complaint, the prisoners brought suit against Lanham and Galley in their official capacities only. As such, Lanham and Galley, like MDPSCS and RCI, are immune from suit for monetary damages under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Will, </em>491 U.S. at 71, 109 S.Ct. at 2312 (holding that \u201ca suit against a state official in his or her official capacity ... is no different from a suit against the State itself\u2019 which is barred by the Eleventh Amendment); <em>see also Biggs, </em>66 F.3d at 60. The district court therefore properly granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the prisoners\u2019 constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-7\">To the extent the prisoners seek injunctive relief against Appellees under \u00a7 1983,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the district court properly granted summary judgment. No reasonable jury could conclude that Lanham and Galley violated the prisoners\u2019 constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510 (holding that summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could [not] return a verdict for the nonmoving party\u201d). The Eighth Amendment provides: \u201cExcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\u201d U.S. Const.. amend. VIII.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To establish the imposition of cruel and unusual punishment, a prisoner must prove two elements: (1) that objectively the deprivation of a basic human need was \u201csufficiently serious\u201d; and (2) that subjectively the prison officials acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind. <em>See Wilson v. Seiter, </em>501 U.S. 294, 298, 111 S.Ct. 2321, 2323-24, 115 L.Ed.2d 271 (1991) (holding that Eighth Amendment claims turn on an \u201cobjective component ... (Was the deprivation sufficiently serious?), and[a] ... subjective component (Did the officials act with a sufficiently culpable state of mind?)\u201d); <em>see also Shakka v.

Waters, </em>989 F.2d 1375, 1379 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-8\">In the context of an Eighth Amendment claim based on a deprivation of medical attention, the objective component \u201cis satisfied only if the medical need of the prisoner is \u2018serious.\u2019 \u201d <em>Shakka, </em>71 F.3d at 166 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>Hudson v. McMillian, </em>503 U.S. 1, 9, 112 S.Ct. 995, 1000, 117 L.Ed.2d 156 (1992)). The medical need of the prisoner must be objectively serious \u201c \u2018[bjeeause society does not expect that prisoners will have unqualified access to health care.\u201d\u2019 <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>Hudson, </em>503 U.S. at 9, 112 S.Ct. at 1000). The subjective component of an Eighth Amendment claim alleging the deprivation of a serious medical need is satisfied by a showing of \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d by prison officials. <em>See Wilson, </em>501 U.S. at 303, 111 S.Ct. at 2326-27 (holding that claims alleging inadequate medical care are subject to the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard outlined in <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 105-06, 97 S.Ct. 285, 291-92, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)); <em>see also LaFaut v. Smith, </em>834 F.2d 389, 391-92 (4th Cir.1987). \u201c[Deliberate indifference entails something more than mere negligence, ... [but] is satisfied by something less than acts or omissions for the very purpose of e\u00e1using harm or with knowledge that harm will result.\u201d <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 835, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 1978, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994). Thus, the \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard recognizes a constitutional violation where prison officials know of and disregard an objectively serious condition, medical need, or risk of harm. <em>See id. </em>at 847, 114 S.Ct. at 1984 (holding that \u201ca prison official may be held liable under the Eighth Amendment ... only if he knows that inmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards that risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\">We conclude that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the prisoners, cannot support a finding that Lanham and Galley were deliberately indifferent to the prisoners\u2019 serious medical needs.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 claims for injunctive relief was properly granted. First, there is no evidence to suggest that Lanham or Galley acted with deliberate indifference to Appellant Granville Amos\u2019 need for pain medication. The record reveals that for a time in 1991, Amos (and other inmates) did not receive necessary medication in a timely fashion \u201cdue to the nondelivery by the Pharmacy.\u201d (J.A. at 888.) The record also shows that Amos filed several ARPs notifying Galley of the problem. Galley, however, took affirmative steps to ensure that Amos (and other inmates) received necessary medication on time. Each time Amos notified the Warden that he was not receiving his medication, Galley directed \u201cthe CMS Medical Provider to <em>insure </em>[sic] that this does not reoccur.\u201d (J.A. at 872.) When the problem with Pharmacy services persisted, Galley secured a \u201cnew Pharmacy.\u201d (J.A at 888.) Nothing in the record so much as suggests that Lanham or Galley ignored or postponed addressing Amos\u2019 medical needs \u201cout of mere convenience or apathy.\u201d <em>LaFaut, </em>834 F.2d at 394. To the contrary, the record shows that prison officials acted quickly to remedy the problem brought to their attention by Amos. Accordingly, we hold that a reasonable jury could not conclude that Lanham or Galley exhibited deliberate indifference to Amos\u2019 medical needs, and that therefore the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in their favor on Amos\u2019 Eighth Amendment claim was appropriate. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Further, there is no evidence, either direct or circumstantial, to suggest that Lanham or Galley had any knowledge of the medical needs of Appellants William Smith, Michael Smith, and Boris Prymerman. The record establishes that these prisoners failed to file ARPs informing the Warden of then-medical needs. Accordingly, there is no evidence that Lanham or Galley knew of and deliberately ignored their medical needs that could support a finding of deliberate indifference.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837-38, 114 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>S.Ct. at 1979; <em>Shakka, </em>71 F.3d at 167. Thus, no reasonable jury could conclude that Lanham or Galley exhibited deliberate indifference to the medical needs of Appellants William and Michael Smith, and Boris Prymerman. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Appellant Howard Megginson filed two ARPs informing the Warden of his recurring urinary tract infection. Thus, prison officials were aware of his medical need. Megginson failed, however, to produce evidence suggesting that Lanham or Galley was deliberately indifferent to his need for medical attention. Megginson himself stated, under oath, that after he filed ARPs, medical staff promptly responded and provided appropriate medical attention for his recurring urinary tract infection. As such, Megginson\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim is meritless; the evidence \u201cis so one-sided that [Appellees] must prevail as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 252, 106 S.Ct. at 2512.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Finally, like the other prisoners, Appellant Gary Ralph failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact over whether Lanham or Galley were deliberately indifferent to his medical needs. In an affidavit, Ralph stated that he was \u201cscheduled for surgery while in prison four different times but I have never been provided the recommended surgery on my back.\u201d (J.A. at 159.) The evidence shows, however, that by June 27,1995, Ralph was no longer incarcerated at RCI. As such, Ralph\u2019s prayer for declaratory and injunctive relief is moot. <em>See Williams v. Griffin, </em>952 F.2d 820, 823 (4th Cir.1991) (holding that because prisoner was transferred to another facility and was no longer subjected to the conditions about which he complained, his claim for injunctive relief was moot); <em>Taylor v. Rogers, </em>781 F.2d 1047, 1048 n. 1 (4th Cir.1986) (holding that prisoner\u2019s transfer mooted a request for declaratory and injunctive relief).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Even if Ralph\u2019s prayer for injunctive relief is not moot, he failed to attach supporting documents to his affidavit, or to forecast any evidence whatsoever supporting his claim that back surgery had been scheduled on four occasions but never performed. Contrary evidence in the record reveals that specialists \u201crecommended conservative treatment for [Ralph\u2019s] lumbosacral disc disease,\u201d not surgery. (J.A. at 602.) To avoid the entry of summary judgment, Ralph was required to demonstrate through \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits\u201d that there was a genuine issue of material fact on each element on which he would carry the burden of proof at trial. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>see also Celotex, </em>477 U.S. at 322, 106 S.Ct. at 2552 (\u201c[T]he plain language of Rule 56(e) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party\u2019s case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\u201d). Ralph simply failed to carry this burden with respect to his allegation that he was deprived of necessary surgery. Even if Ralph were able to show that prison medical care providers scheduled but failed to perform necessary surgery, there is no evidence that Ralph filed ARPs apprising the Warden of the medical care providers\u2019 failure to provide the surgery. As a result, there is no evidence that Lanham or Galley knew of and deliberately ignored his allegedly serious need for back surgery that could support a finding of deliberate indifference. <em>See Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837-38, 114 S.Ct. at 1979; <em>Shakka, </em>71 F.3d at 167. If Ralph had been able to show that he was deprived of necessary surgery, he then may have had a colorable Eighth Amendment claim, not against Lanham and Galley, but against the prison medical care providers. <em>See West v. Atkins, </em>487 U.S. 42, 54-56, 108 S.Ct. 2250, 2258-60, 101 L.Ed.2d 40 (1988) (holding that private physicians employed by state to provide medical services to inmates act \u201cunder color of state law\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1983); <em>Conner v. Donnelly, </em>42 F.3d 220, 224 (4th Cir.1994) (same); <em>cf. Richardson v. McKnight, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 117 S.Ct. 2100, 2108, 138 L.Ed.2d 540 (1997) (holding \u201cthat private prison guards, unlike those who work directly for the government, do not enjoy immunity from suit in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>a \u00a7 1983 case\u201d). The private medical care providers, however, are not parties to this suit.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Ralph also stated in his affidavit that he began suffering severe back and leg pain in June 1995, and that at some undesignated time he filed ARPs with the Warden requesting medical attention. The failure of Galley to provide Ralph with medical attention after his transfer from RCI on June 27, 1995, however, cannot constitute deliberate indifference. <em>Cf. Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 842-46, 114 S.Ct. at 1982-83 (characterizing deliberate indifference standard as \u201c[a] prison official\u2019s duty under the Eighth Amendment\u201d to the inmates in his care). As for Lanham, there is nothing in the record suggesting that he was aware of Ralph\u2019s back and leg pain. Moreover, the record reveals that Ralph received treatment at the University of Maryland Hospital after his transfer from RCI. We are satisfied that no reasonable jury could conclude that Lanham exhibited deliberate indifference to Ralph\u2019s medical needs. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for Lanham and Galley on Ralph\u2019s Eighth Amendment claim. <em>See Anderson, </em>477 U.S. at 248, 106 S.Ct. at 2510.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">In sum, we find that Lanham and Galley acted reasonably in ensuring that the prisoners received appropriate medical attention and treatment. Because \u201cprison officials who act reasonably cannot be found liable under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause,\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 845, 114 S.Ct. at 1983, either for monetary damages (if sued in their personal capacities), or for equitable relief (if sued in their official capacities), we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 Eighth Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Appellees on the prisoners\u2019 statutory and constitutional claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b640-10\">.

I disagree with Part II of the majority\u2019s opinion, which holds that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794 (West Supp. 1997), and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (the \u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12165 (West 1995 &amp; Supp.1997), do not apply to state prisons. Both statutes explicitly state in unambiguous terms that they apply to all of the operations of every state government agency, department, and instrumentality. State correctional departments and prisons unquestionably fall within that statutory language. Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellees on the Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">The district court granted summary judgment to the Appellees on the Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims on two grounds. First, the court relied on <em>dicta </em>in <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>57 F.3d 1340 (4th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 772, 133 L.Ed.2d 724 (1996), and held that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not apply to state prisons. Second, the court held that even if the statutes do apply to state prisons, qualified immunity would bar the Appellants\u2019 claim for monetary damages. I would reverse the district court on both grounds. I address each argument in turn below.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-17\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-18\">As the district court and the majority opinion correctly note, we have not previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>decided whether the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state prisons. Although <em>Torcasio </em>involved similar Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims by a state prisoner, we ruled in favor of the prison officials only on the grounds of qualified immunity. We held that qualified immunity barred the prisoner\u2019s claims because it was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violations that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act applied to state prisons. <em>See Torcasio, </em>57 F.3d at 1343-52. We did not address the question at issue in the instant case, namely, whether the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do apply to state prisons. That question presents an issue of first impression in the Fourth Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">In order to answer that question, we must begin by examining the language of the statutes themselves. <em>See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., </em>505 U.S. 469, 475, 112 S.Ct. 2589, 2594, 120 L.Ed.2d 379 (1992). When Congress uses unambiguous terms, we may not inquire beyond the statutory language. <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has .held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AItF\">[I]n interpreting a statute a court should always turn first to one, cardinal canon before all others. We have stated time and again that courts must presume that a legislature says in a statute what it means and means in a statute what it says there. When the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: \u201cjudicial inquiry is complete.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\"><em>Connecticut Nat\u2019l Bank v. Germain, </em>503 U.S. 249, 253-54, 112 S.Ct. 1146, 1149, 117 L.Ed.2d 391 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The plain language of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA unambiguously provides that both statutes apply to all of the operations of every state government agency, department, and instrumentality. Specifically, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under <em>any program or activity </em>receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794(a) (emphasis added). The statute defines \u201cprogram or activity\u201d as <em>\u201call </em>of the operations of ... a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government ... any part of which is extended Federal financial assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 794(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added). A state correctional department such as the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services (\u201cMDPSCS\u201d) clearly constitutes a \u201cdepartment\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d of a state, and a state prison such as the Roxbury Correctional Institution (\u201cRCI\u201d) clearly falls within the \u201coperations\u201d of the MDPSCS. Section 504 clearly states that it applies to \u201cany\u201d such state entity, and thus the plain language of the statute does not suggest any exception for state prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"A3tK\">Title II of the ADA extends the prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability to all services, programs, and- activities that a \u201cpublic entity\u201d provides, regardless of whether the entity receives federal financial assistance. Specifically, Title II provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a <em>public entity, </em>or be subjected to discrimination by any such <em>entity.\" </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12132 (emphasis added). The statute defines \u201cpublic entity\u201d as \u201cany State or local government\u201d and <em>\u201cany </em>department, <em>agency, </em>special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 12131(1)(A),(B) (emphasis added). Again, state correctional departments and state prisons clearly constitute departments or instrumentalities of a state, and Title II\u2019s broad language does not suggest any exception for state prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">In accordance with the plain language of the statutes, the vast majority of courts that have addressed the issue have held that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA do apply to state prisons. <em>See Yeskey v. Pennsylvania Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>118 F.3d 168, 170-74 (3d Cir.1997) (holding that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA apply to state prisons); <em>Crawford v.

Lewis, </em>857 F.2d 559, 561-62 (9th Cir.1988) (same). Only one court of appeals has held that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not apply to state prisons. <em>See White v. Colorado, </em>82 F.3d 364, 367 (10th Cir.1996) (holding that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA do not apply to employment discrimination claims brought by state prison inmates).</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\">Although the majority opinion in the instant case concedes that the statutory language is broad and inclusive and that the legislative histories of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not forbid application to state prisons, it argues that the statutes do not apply to state prisons because the statutes do not clearly and explicitly state that they apply to state prisons. I agree with the majority that Congress must speak clearly in the statutory text when it intends to alter the traditional balance between the states and the federal government. <em>See Gregory v. Ashcroft, </em>501 U.S. 452, 460-61, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 2400-01, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991). I also agree with the majority that the operation of state prisons is an area traditionally reserved to the states. <em>See Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 491-92, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 1837-38, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973). However, the Supreme Court has made it plain that courts should apply the so-called \u201cclear statement rule\u201d as a canon of statutory construction only when the statutory text is ambiguous and furnishes little guidance as to whether Congress intended to subject state agencies to potential liability. <em>See Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 470, 111 S.Ct. at 2406 (describing the clear statement rule as \u201ca rule of statutory construction to be applied where statutory intent is ambiguous\u201d); <em>EEOC v. Wyoming, </em>460 U.S. 226, 244 n. 18, 103 S.Ct. 1054, 1064 n. 18, 75 L.Ed.2d 18 (1983) (holding that the clear statement rule is \u201ca tool with which to divine the meaning of otherwise ambiguous statutory intent\u201d). The Court has held that the clear statement rule simply does not apply when the statutory text is clear and \u201cthere is no doubt what the intent of Congress was.\u201d <em>EEOC, </em>460 U.S. at 244 n. 18, 103 S.Ct. at 1064 n. 18. The clear statement rule simply is \u201cnot a warrant to disregard clearly expressed congressional intent.\u201d <em>Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 173.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">Congress made its intent unmistakably clear with regard to the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. As noted above, the Rehabilitation Act specifically provides that it applies to <em>\u201call </em>of the operations of ... a department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or of a local government,\u201d 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 794(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added), and the ADA explicitly states that it applies to <em>\u201cany </em>department, agency, special purpose district, or other instrumentality of a State or States or local government,\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12131(1)(B) (emphasis added). State correctional departments and state prisons clearly constitute \u201cdepartment[s]\u201d or \u201cinstrumentalities]\u201d of the state, and the statutes clearly provide that they apply to <em>all </em>such state entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">The majority suggests that Congress cannot make the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA applicable to state prisons or to other areas traditionally reserved to the states unless it separately lists each state agency that the statutes apply to in the statutory text. The Supreme Court, however, has expressly rejected such a requirement. <em>See Gregory, </em>501 U.S. at 467, 111 S.Ct. at 2404 (\u201cThis does not mean that the Act must mention judges explicitly.\u201d). Congress only needs to make the scope of a statute \u201cplain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Congress made the scope of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA plain when it specifically provided that both statutes apply to state and local governments and \u201cany\u201d or \u201call\u201d of their operations. As Judge Posner noted in <em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 485, \u201c[w]e doubt ... that Congress could speak much more clearly than it did when it made the [ADA] expressly applicable to all public entities and defined the term \u2018public entity\u2019 to include every possible agency of state or local government.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Moreover, I do not agree with the majority that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA exclude prisoners from coverage because the statutes only protect \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d with a disability. The ADA defines that phrase as \u201can individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications ..., meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12131(2). The terms \u201celigibility\u201d and \u201cparticipation\u201d do not, as the majority opinion argues, imply voluntariness and thus exclude prisoners who by definition are involuntary participants. To the contrary, \u201celigible\u201d simply refers to those who are \u201cfitted or qualified to be chosen,\u201d <em>see </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 736 (1993), without regard to the individual\u2019s choice. The fact that prisoners participate in prison activities involuntarily does not mean that they do not participate. Congress clearly intended the statutes to apply even in \u201cinvoluntary\u201d contexts. In its findings demonstrating the need for the ADA, Congress expressly stated in the statutory text that \u201cdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as ... <em>institutionalization.\u201d </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101(a)(3) (West 1995) (emphasis added). <em>See also Yeskey, </em>118 F.3d at 173 (rejecting the state\u2019s argument that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA exclude coverage for prisoners because they are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d and holding that \u201c[t]he terms \u2018eligibility\u2019 and \u2018participation\u2019 do not ... \u2018imply voluntariness\u2019 or mandate that an individual seek out or request a service to be covered\u201d); <em>Bonner, </em>857 F.2d at 563 (holding that a state prisoner was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d within the meaning of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act even though his participation in prison activities was \u201csometimes required\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Indeed, the majority\u2019s suggestion that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do not apply to obligatory or mandatory programs and services leads to anomalous results. The \u201cvoluntary\u201d limitation that the majority opinion imposes would immunize discrimination on the basis of disability in the provision of compulsory services such as public education, mandatory vaccinations, and jury service. Yet several courts, including the Fourth Circuit, have indeed applied the' statutes to such mandatory and \u201cinvoluntary\u201d programs. <em>See, e.g., DeVries v. Fairfax County Sch. Bd., </em>882 F.2d 876, 880 (4th Cir.1989) (applying section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act to public schools); <em>Galloway v. Superior Court of the District of Columbia, </em>816 F.Supp. 12, 15-19 (D.D.C.1993) (holding that section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA apply to jury service).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">In holding that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state prisoners, Judge Posner noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\">It might seem absurd to apply the Americans with Disabilities Act to prisoners. Prisoners are not a favored group in society; the propensity of some of them to sue at the drop of a hat is well known; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>prison systems are strapped for funds; the practical effect of granting disabled prisoners rights of access that might require costly modifications of prison facilities might be the curtailment of educational, recreational, and rehabilitative programs for prisoners, in which event everyone might be worse off. But ... there is another side to the issue. The Americans with Disabilities Act was cast in terms not of subsidizing an interest group but of eliminating a form of discrimination that Congress considered unfair and even odious. The Act assimilates the disabled to groups that by reason of sex, age, race, religion, nationality, or ethnic origin are believed to be victims of discrimination. Rights against discrimination are among the few rights that prisoners do not park at the prison gates. Although the special conditions of the prison setting license a degree of discrimination that would not be tolerated in a free environment, there is no general right of prison officials to discriminate against prisoners on grounds of race, sex, religion, and so forth. If a prison may not exclude blacks from the prison dining hall and force them to eat in their cells, and if Congress thinks that discriminating against a blind person is like discriminating against a black person, it is not obvious that the prison may exclude the blind person from the dining hall.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b664-4\"><em>Crawford, </em>115 F.3d at 486 (citations omitted). I agree. Congress enacted the ADA \u201cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). <em>See also Alexander v. Choate, </em>469 U.S. 287, 295-97, 105 S.Ct. 712, 717-18, 83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985) (discussing the broad nondiscrimination goals of the Rehabilitation Act). Applying the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA to state prisons, pursuant to the clear and unambiguous statutory text, furthers the broad remedial goals that underlie both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">In sum, the plain language of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA and the remedial purposes underlying both statutes clearly demonstrate that the statutes apply to state prisons. The district court therefore erred when it granted summary judgment to the Appellees on those claims on the ground that the statutes do not apply to state prisons.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The district court also relied on our actual holding in <em>Torcasio v. Murray, </em>57 F.3d 1340 (4th Cir.1995), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 772, 133 L.Ed.2d 724 (1996), and granted summary judgment to the Appellees on the alternative ground that even if the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA do apply to state prisons, qualified immunity would bar the Appellants\u2019 claims for monetary damages under the two statutes. In <em>Torcasio, </em>a state prisoner sued prison officials in their personal capacity pursuant to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA. We held that qualified immunity barred the prisoner\u2019s claims because it was not clearly established at the time of the alleged violations that the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act applied to state prisons. <em>See id. </em>at 1343-52.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">Qualified immunity bars suits against state officials in their <em>personal </em>capacity. Courts developed the doctrine to alleviate the risk that officials\u2019 fear of personal liability might unduly inhibit them in the discharge of then-duties. <em>See Anderson v. Creighton, </em>483 U.S. 635, 638-39, 107 S.Ct. 3034, 3038-39, 97 L.Ed.2d 523 (1987). Thus, when a plaintiff sues state officials in their personal capacity, qualified immunity protects the officials \u201cas long as their actions could reasonably have been thought consistent with the rights they are alleged to have violated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 638, 107 S.Ct. at 3038.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">Unlike the plaintiff in <em>Torcasio, </em>however, the Appellants in the instant case sued two state governmental entities (the MDPSCS and RCI) and two state officials (Richard Lanham and John Galley) in their <em>official, </em>representative capacities only. Sovereign immunity, rather than qualified immunity, bars suits in federal courts against state entities and state officials in their official capacity without the state\u2019s consent. <em>See Seminole Tribe of Fla. v. Florida, </em>\u2014 U.S. -,-, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 1122, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996); <em>Adden v. Middlebrooks, </em>688 F.2d 1147, 1153-54 (7th Cir.1982) (holding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>sovereign immunity barred a wrongful death suit against a state correctional department in federal court); <em>Jones v. Smith, </em>784 F.2d 149, 152 (2d Cir.1986) (holding that sovereign immunity barred a \u00a7 1983 suit for monetary damages against a prison official in his official capacity).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The Supreme Court has held, however, that Congress may abrogate the states\u2019 sovereign immunity if it unequivocally expresses its intent to abrogate the immunity and has acted pursuant to a valid exercise of power, such as section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Seminole Tribe of Fla., </em>\u2014 U.S. at-, 116 S.Ct. at 1125. Congress clearly expressed its intent to abrogate the states\u2019 sovereign immunity under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2000d-7(a)(1) (West 1994) (\u201cA State shall not be immune under the Eleventh Amendment of the Constitution of the United States from suit in Federal court for a violation of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12202 (West 1995) (\u201cA State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of [the ADA.]\u201d). Moreover, Congress passed section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA pursuant to its powers under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>See Welch v. Texas Dep\u2019t of Highways and Public Transp., </em>483 U.S. 468, 472 n. 2, 107 S.Ct. 2941, 2945 n. 2, 97 L.Ed.2d 389 (1987); 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 12101(b)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Thus, sovereign immunity, rather than qualified immunity, potentially barred the Appellants\u2019 claims in the instant case. However, Congress clearly abrogated the states\u2019 sovereign immunity under the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA and thus clearly authorized damage claims against state entities and state officials sued in their official capacity. The district court therefore erred when it granted summary judgment to the Appellees on the Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims on the alternative ground that qualified immunity barred the Appellants\u2019 claim for damages under the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Accordingly, I would reverse the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to the Appellees on the Rehabilitation Act and ADA claims. I would hold that the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA apply to state prisons and that qualified immunity does not bar the Appellants\u2019 claims. Since the district court only addressed the threshold questions of the applicability of the statutes and the Appellees\u2019 qualified immunity defense, I would remand for the district court to address the merits of the Appellants\u2019 statutory claims in the first instance. I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b662-5\"> I also note that I am not persuaded by the majority\u2019s citation to <em>Virginia Dep\u2019t of Education </em>v. <em>Riley, </em>106 F.3d 559, 567 (4th Cir.1997) <em>(en banc), </em>in support of their argument that we should apply the clear statement rule in the instant case. In that case, we examined a provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>sion of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (the \"IDEA\u201d) that required states to have a policy in effect \"that assures <em>all </em>children with disabilities the right to a free appropriate public education,\" 20 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1412 (West Supp. 1997)(emphasis added), in order to receive federal educational funds. Despite the broad and inclusive statutory language, a majority of the <em>en banc Riley </em>Court concluded that the provision was ambiguous, applied the clear statement rule, and held that the federal government may not require states to provide educational services to disabled children who are expelled for misconduct. As the majority opinion in the instant case notes, the <em>Riley </em>Court based its holding on its conclusion that not \"a single word from the statute or from the legislative history of [the] IDEA evidenced] that Congress even considered\u201d requiring states to continue providing educational services to such children. <em>Riley, </em>106 F.3d at 567. Based on the clear statutory language of \u00a7 1412, however, I dissented. <em>See id. </em>at 575 (\"I have concluded that \u2018all\u2019 means \u2018all.\u2019\").</p>\n<p id=\"AW6\">Less than four months after we decided <em>Riley, </em>Congress amended \u00a7 1412 of the IDEA. Section 1412 now provides that in order to receive federal educational funds, states must demonstrate that they have policies in effect that ensure that \u201c[a] free appropriate public education is available to <em>all </em>children with disabilities residing in the State between the ages of 3 and 21, inclusive, <em>including children with disabilities who have been suspended or expelled from school.\" </em>IDEA Amendments for 1997, Pub.L. No. 105-17, \u00a7 612, 111 Slat. 37, 60 (emphasis added). Congress specifically noted in the legislative history that the amendment was merely a \"clarification ],\u201d not a change, to \u00a7 1412. S.Rep. No. 105-17, at 11 (1997). Thus, the majority\u2019s reliance on <em>Riley </em>is questionable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
