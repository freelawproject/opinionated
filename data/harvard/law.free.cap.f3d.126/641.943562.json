(Blue Cross) for an alleged breach of a policy obligation to pay benefits for expenses incurred in treatment for silicone breast implant complications. Dowden complains on appeal that the district court erred in granting summary judgment against her, holding that the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), \u00a7 29 U.S.C. 1132(a)(1)(B) governs the facts in this case, and that Blue Cross rationally determined that the medical expenses which Dowden incurred were not medically necessary, and therefore, not covered under the insurance policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-22\">I. JURISDICTION</p>\n<p id=\"b690-23\">The district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b). A defendant may remove a case on grounds that the plaintiff has asserted a claim preempted by \u00a7 514(a) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>ERISA. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 66, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 1547, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987). ERISA comprehensively regulates, inter alia, employee benefit welfare plans that provide medical care or benefits in the event of sickness through the purchase of insurance. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1); <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. v. Dedeaux, </em>481 U.S. 41, 45, 107 S.Ct. 1549, 1551, 95 L.Ed.2d 39 (1987); <em>Memorial Hosp. Sys. v. Northbrook Life Ins. Co., </em>904 F.2d 236 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">ERISA\u2019s preemption clause dictates that ERISA \u201cshall supersede any state causes of action insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). The federal courts have broadly construed the \u201cdeliberately expansive\u201d language of the ERlSA preemption clause. <em>Corcoran v. United Health-Care, Inc., </em>965 F.2d 1321, 1328-29 (5th Cir.1992). A state cause of action relates to an employee benefit plan whenever it has \u201ca connection with or reference to such a plan.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Ass\u2019n, </em>42 F.3d 942, 945 (5th <em>Cir.1995)(quoting Corcoran, </em>965 F.2d at 1329). If a state law claim addresses an area of exclusive federal concern, such as the right to receive benefits under the terms of an ERISA plan, then the claim falls in the province of the federal courts. <em>Hubbard, </em>42 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Dowden\u2019s claim to recover medical expenses from Blue Cross \u201crelates to an employee benefit plan\u201d thus falling within the scope of ERISA\u2019s preemption provision. \u201cIt is clear that ERISA preempts a state law cause of action brought by an ERISA plan participant or beneficiary alleging improper processing of a claim for plan benefits.\u201d <em>Memorial Hosp., </em>904 F.2d at 245 <em>(citing Pilot Life Ins. Co., </em>481 U.S. at 48, 107 S.Ct. at 1553). Dowden was insured under the group health insurance policy issued by her former employer. Through the provisions of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, Dowden continued to participate in the Blue Cross group policy even after she left her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Dowden, as a former employee, comes under the rubric of ERISA as a participant, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(7). She is able to assert her claim pursuant to ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B). The Supreme Court has held that any suit falling within this provision, even if it purports to raise only state law claims, is necessarily federal in character by virtue of the clearly manifested intent of Congress. <em>Metropolitan Life, </em>481 U.S. at 62, 107 S.Ct. at 1545.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">We agree with the district court that Dow-den claims a violation of ERISA when she alleges a denial of benefits due under the Blue Cross policy. A federal question exists on her claim and the district court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was proper. <em>Hubbard, </em>42 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">II. MEDICAL NECESSITY</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">Dowden\u2019s theory of recovery and the summary judgment entered against her rest upon whether Blue Cross as the plan administrator abused its discretion in interpreting the term \u201cmedically necessary\u201d as expressly defined in the insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-11\">A denial of ERISA benefits by a plan administrator is reviewed by the courts <em>de novo </em>unless the plan gives the plan administrator \u201cdiscretionary authority to determine the eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.\u201d <em>Duhon v. Texaco, Inc., </em>15 F.3d 1302, 1305 (5th <em>Cir.1994)(quoting Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 115, 109 S.Ct. 948, 956, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989)). Contrary to Dowden\u2019s assertion, <em>Southern Farm Bureau Life Insurance Co. v. Moore, </em>993 F.2d 98 (1993), does not stand for the proposition that the court may look to general principles of common law or state law absent ERISA guidance on the interpretation of the plan. <em>Moore </em>states that because ERISA does not dictate the appropriate standard of review for evaluating benefit determinations of plan administrators, courts must first look to the plan terms to determine if the plan administrator has the discretionary authority to interpret the plan terms. 993 F.2d at 100.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">The abuse of discretion standard is the appropriate standard of review to challenges to a plan administrator\u2019s interpretation of the plan terms when that plan grants the administrator the authority to make a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>final and conclusive determination of the claim. <em>Duhon, </em>15 F.3d at 1305 <em>(citing Bruch, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. at 956). In applying the abuse of discretion standard, we analyze whether the plan administrator acted arbitrarily or capriciously. <em>Bellaire Gen. Hosp. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield, </em>97 F.3d 822, 829 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The district court correctly concluded that the contested plan grants Blue Cross \u201cthe exclusive and conclusive authority to determine coverage and benefits, and to interpret provisions of the plan, including whether treatment is medically necessary.\u201d In pertinent part, the contract provides that \u201c[t]he operation of the plan requires decisions regarding eligibility and the construction of terms. In executing this Contract, the Employer gives full and complete authority and discretion to the Carrier to make decisions regarding eligibility and benefits under this Contract. Such authority and discretion includes, but is not limited to, determination whether services, care, treatment or supplies are Medically Necessary .... \u201d The contract also delineates which services are medically necessary such as those \u201cessential to, consistent with and provided for the diagnosis or the direct care and treatment of the condition, sickness, disease, injury, or bodily malfunction,\u201d as well as those treatments \u201cconsistent with accepted standards of medical practice.\u201d Because the plan vests Blue Cross with such authority, judicial review is limited to determining whether substantial evidence exists in the record to support Blue Cross\u2019s decision that Dowden\u2019s treatment was medically unnecessary or whether its refusal to pay the submitted claim was arbitrary and capricious. <em>Bellaire Gen. Hospital, </em>97 F.3d at 828 (5th Cir.1996). \u201cAn arbitrary decision is one made without a rational connection between the known facts and the decision or between the found facts and the evidence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">Dowden carries the burden of proving that Blue Cross arbitrarily and capriciously concluded that the medical test and treatments were medically unnecessary and therefore not covered under the policy. <em>Bayles v. Central States, Southeast, &amp; Southwest Areas Pension Fund, </em>602 F.2d 97, 99 (5th Cir.1979). We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Dowden has not satisfied her burden. Blue Cross evidences an established procedure and policy for processing claims involving silicone breast implant patients. Relying upon learned publications, Dr. Benjamin V. Carnovale, along with other medical and legal staff developed a written policy for the uniform processing of the claims of silicone breast implant patients. Consistent with the insurance contract, the policy also enumerates which procedures are medically necessary. We agree with the district court\u2019s finding that Blue Cross demonstrated a reasonable basis in the record in making its determination of non-coverage. Dr Carnovale\u2019s application of Blue Cross\u2019s established policy and his ensuing interpretation of medical necessity does not appear to be arbitrary and capricious, inconsistent or evidence of a lack of good faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">Dowden contends that in lieu of the definition expressly provided in the contract, medically necessary treatment should be defined by \u201cmedical experts\u201d with great weight given to the opinion of the attending physician. No evidence in the record exists nor does any legal authority stipulate that an attending physician\u2019s opinion should be granted more weight than the established policies and procedures of the plan administrator. To grant conclusive weight to the opinion of the attending physician would vitiate the discretionary authority expressly granted to Blue Cross in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Dowden further argues that the trial judge was \u201cabsolutely wrong and unjust\u201d to defer to Dr. Camovale\u2019s determination that the disputed claim was not medically necessary. Despite Dowden\u2019s contention, it is indeed proper for the district court to exercise deference to the plan administrator\u2019s interpretation when the plan grants the plan administrator discretionary authority to interpret the plan. <em>Sunbeam-Oster Co. Group Ben. Plan v. Whitehurst, </em>102 F.3d 1368, 1373 (5th Cir.1996); <em>Pierre v. Connecticut Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>932 F.2d 1552, 1562 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 973, 112 S.Ct. 453, 116 L.Ed.2d 470 (1991)(\u201cFederal courts owe due deference to an administrator\u2019s factual con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>elusions that reflect a reasonable and impartial judgment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">Finally, Dowden\u2019s allegation that Blue Cross did not assert, in its answer, an affirmative defense that applies to the district court\u2019s decision, is without merit. Blue Cross affirmatively asserted its defense that Dowden\u2019s claims were not covered by the ERISA plan and were not medically necessary within the terms, condition and exclusions of the policy as legally construed by the plan administrator. Further, there is no requirement that Blue Cross rely on a fiduciary in order to fall within the abuse of discretion standard governing the interpretation the contract. Blue Cross may rely on its own plan administrator to interpret the contract of insurance. <em>Bruch, </em>489 U.S. at 115, 109 S.Ct. at 956.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">We find no error in the district court\u2019s holding that the ERISA plan vests discretionary authority in Blue Cross to make determinations as to the medical necessity of treatments. Blue Cross did not abuse its discretion in refusing to pay Dowden\u2019s claims under Blue Cross\u2019s interpretation of the plan terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
