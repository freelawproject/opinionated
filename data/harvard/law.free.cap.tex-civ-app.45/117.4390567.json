Her testimony was- mainly relied on to make out the case, so far as the extent of the injury was concerned, and a reversal of the judgment is claimed because the court excluded certain testimony which appellant sought to elicit from her on cross-examination. As stated in the bill of exceptions, \u201cthe wife of the plaintiff was on the, stand and refused to state why she didn\u2019t take certain medicines pre-^ scribed by her family physician, Dr. Dodson. The defendant\u2019s counsel insisted upon knowing why, and asked her if it was not a fact that it was because she belonged to a sect called Christian Scientists.^ The court sustained the plaintiff\u2019s objection, and defendant\u2019s counsel stated that he wanted to prove by the witness that she would not take medicine on that account, and to ascertain if it was not her belief that she only suffered when she thought she suffered and did not suffer when she thought she didn\u2019t, and it was only a question with her as to whether she suffered or not. The court sustained the objection of the plaintiff that the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>dence was immaterial.\u201d It further appears from the bill of exceptions that \u201cthe defendant could have proven by such witness that she was a Christian Scientist and that as such she lived on a spiritual plane above mental and physical sufferings; that it was an article of her faith that there was no such thing as mental or physical suffering, and that she did not actually suffer.\u201d The bill of exceptions was approved with the following statement: \u201cThe witness testified: T don\u2019t take medicine unless I get down so that I can\u2019t help myself, and they make me take it.\u2019 Counsel asked her: 'You make that a rule, do you?\u2019 She answered: 'Yes, sir.\u2019 When counsel said: 'And because you belong to a sect called Christian Scientist?\u2019 plaintiff\u2019s counsel made objection as follows: 'We object to any such statement.\u2019 The court then ruled as follows: T will sustain the objection. You can state the object of your testimony to the stenographer.\u2019 Whereupon the defendant\u2019s counsel dictated a long statement to the stenographer which is to be found in full on page 48 of the testimony as made out by the stenographer. And after the same had been so dictated the court said: 'All right, I will sustain the objection.\u2019 Defendant\u2019s counsel then said: 'If the court please, I would like to be heard on that.\u2019 Plaintiff: \u2018We object to any further statement being made upon that line in the presence of the jury.\u2019 Defendant\u2019s counsel said: 'I would like to make a statement for the purpose of the bill.\u2019 The court: 'You have already made a statement and you can have your bill.\u2019 There was no further objection to this part of the proceedings.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">It appears from the statement found on the page of the stenographer\u2019s notes referred to in this explanation that counsel for appellant, besides asking the question or questions above quoted in said explanation, expressed a desire to prove what is stated in the main part of the bill of exceptions quoted above, although the question or - questions \u00e1etually propounded to the witness did not call for what the bill of exceptions states could have been proved by the witness. We have, therefore, found some difficulty in determining whether the issue submitted by the following assignment is really presented by the record, but have finally concluded that it is. Said assignment reads: \u201cThe court erred in refusing to permit defendant\u2019s attorney to interrogate plaintiff\u2019s wife with reference to her belief in and practice and experience in what is known as Christian Science for the purpose of showing that she was a Christian Scientist, and that as such she could not suffer either mentally or physi- \u25a0 cally, but lived on a spiritual plane high above mental and physical suffering.\u201d We interpret the record as showing that counsel for appellant indicated to the court his desire to cross examine the witness on the matters stated in the assignment, and that the court declined to permit this to be done on the ground that the inquiry was immaterial, which we think fairly raises the question presented by the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-29\">We are also of opinion that the court erred in treating the inquiry as an immaterial one, since the testimony was pertinent to the main and essential issue in the case, to wit, the mental and physical suffering of the witness. If she had such control of her feelings, or thought she had, as to render her insensible to pain when she willed to be, we see no reason why that circumstance should not have been considered by the jury in determining the extent of her suffering and the compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>to be made on account of it. See Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co. v. Lynch, 87 S. W. Rep., 884, and cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Besides, the ruling complained of involves an invasion of the right of cross-examination, which, however much it may have been abused, yet remains as essential to the search for truth as in the days of the proverb, \u201cHe that is first in his own cause seemet\u00edr just; but his neighbor cometli and searcheth him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">The only counter proposition submitted by appellee in answer to the assignment above quoted is that \u201cspecial defenses in the nature of a confession and avoidance must be specially pleaded,\u201d but while this is a sound proposition, it evidently is inapplicable here, since any evidence affecting the extent of the suffering for which a recovery was sought and had, was clearly admissible under the general issue. For this error the judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
