Rep., 237.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-7\">The court erred in refusing to give in charge to the jury defendant\u2019s special charge number 9, which is as follows:</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b530-8\">\u201cIn this case the defendant claims that at the time of the accident to plaintiff he was under the influence of intoxicating liquors, taken while on duty, in violation of one of its rules; and plaintiff, while denying this is true, says also that the rule in question had been frequently violated, to the knowledge of defendant, and that defendant permitted this, and thereby relaxed or abrogated the rule, and the same was not, therefore, of binding force as a rule. On this matter you are charged that, in order to hold that a rule has been relaxed or abrogated by acquiescence in its violation, it is necessary to show that the violation was not only frequent, but that this fact was either actually known by some officer or agent of defendant, whose duty it was to enforce the rule, or that the rule was so frequently or openly violated that defendant\u2019s officers or agents, whose duty it was to enforce the rule, must, in the proper discharge of their duty, have knowledge of its violation; and it must further appear that the violations of the rule were not protested against, but were consented to by actual or tacit consent; there is no proof of actual consent to its violation, and no amount of a violation of a rule will amount to a relaxation of a rule where the facts do not show a knowledge of the condition, either actual or constructive, as above described, on the part of the agent or officer of the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>whose duty it was to enforce the rule, and where the facts do not also show either actual or' tacit consent to such violation, if any. Applying this rule of law to the facts in this case, on this issue you are charged that even though you should find that the said rule forbidding employes of defendant from drinking intoxicating liquors while on duty, was frequently violated, nevertheless you are not authorized to say that the rule was relaxed or abrogated, nor had the plaintiff a right to so assume if he knew that the rule was still insisted upon, or unless such violation of the rule, if any, were actually known to officers or agents of defendant, whose duty it was to enforce the rule, or that these violations, if any, were so common and open that in the proper discharge of their duties, the officers and agents of defendant, whose duty required them to enforce said rule, must have known of it and neglected to protest against it and forbid it.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b531-3\"><em>Sanford &amp; Douglas, Joseph Jones, George M.

Plaintiff alleged that on December 1, 1902, while in the employ of defendant as a switchman engaged in the operation of trains in its yards at Eagle Pass, he was, while attempting in the discharge of his duty to board one of its trains, thrown underneath by defendant\u2019s negligence and his right leg so badly crushed and mangled as to require its amputation at the knee. That in his effort to board the train he seized the handhold, and, in attempting to step on, his foot slipped on the muddy ground, and, at the same time, defendant\u2019s employes operating the train negligently caused or permitted it to be thrust backwards or lunged with great suddenness and unusual violence, and that such negligent thrusting back and lunging of the train broke his hold and threw him under the train whereby his leg was crushed as aforesaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant, after interposing a general denial, pleaded contributory negligence and assumed risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\"><em>Conclusions of Fact. </em>The evidence is reasonably sufficient to prove that plaintiff sustained the injuries alleged and that they were directly caused by the negligence of defendant\u2019s servants in operating the train as above set forth; and that he was guilty of no negligence proximately contributing to his injuries, and that they were not the result of any risk assumed by him as incident to his employment; and that by reason of the injuries so negligently inflicted by the defendant he has been damaged in the amount found by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\"><em>Conclusions of </em>Law.\u20141. The first assignment of error is directed against the fifth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge, which is as follows: \u201cIf you believe from the evidence that on or about the first day of December, 1902, the plaintiff was in the employ of the defendant in the capacity of a switchman in its yards at Eagle Pass, and that on said date it became plaintiff\u2019s duty to board a moving train of cars in said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>yard, and that he did attempt to board one of the cars in said train; and you further believe from the evidence that when plaintiff attempted to board said car, he seized upon a perpendicular handhold and his foot slipped; and you further believe from the evidence that while he was endeavoring to maintain himself upon said perpendicular handhold, that the defendant\u2019s employes who were engaged in the operation of said train, thrust said train backwards, with great suddenness and unusual violence; and you further believe from the evidence that the defendant\u2019s said servants were guilty of negligence by reason of the suddenness and violence with which they thrust said train backwards, if it was so thrust backwards, and that said negligence, if any, directly caused the plaintiff to fall and be injured as alleged in his petition, and you further believe from the evidence that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence and that he did not assume the risk then I charge you that your verdict must be for the plaintiff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">The contention is that the error consists in the use of the words: \u201cand you further believe from the evidence that plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence and that he did not assume the risk, then I charge you that your verdict must be for the plaintiff,\u201d appearing in the last two clauses of. the paragraph, \u201cbecause\u201d (quoting from appellant\u2019s first proposition under the assignment), \u201cthe charge instructs the jury that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on the facts stated, unless the jury should further find that the plaintiff was guilty of contributory negligence and assumed risk, whereas, under the law, plaintiff was not entitled to recover if he was guilty of either contributory negligence, or if he assumed the risk.\u201d This embodies the substance of the other two propositions under the assignment. The same objection was made to a similar charge in the case of Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Cherry, 98 S. W. Rep., 900, which this court disposed of by saying: \u201cThe charge in our opinion was not subject to be understood as appellant contends. The impression it conveyed'was\" that plaintiff could recover unless the jury believed he was not guilty of contributory negligence and did not assume the risk. Under this charge they had to find both in order to find for plaintiff.\u201d As an application for a writ of error was denied by the Supreme Court in that case, it is deemed conclusive against appellant\u2019s contention in this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">2. It is asserted in appellant\u2019s brief that the second and third assignments of error relate to the same matter, and they are considered together therein with one proposition asserted under them. We do not take them to be such as, under the rules of this court, can be grouped, for they involve separate and distinct rulings of the court and the same points do not arise from nor can they be stated as propositions under each. (Galveston, H. &amp; S. A. Ry. Co. v. Fales, 77 S. W. Rep., 235; Houston &amp; T. C. R. Co. v. De Berry, 78 S. W. Rep., 737; Evans v. Jackson, 92 S. W. Rep., 48), for one complains of the definition contained in the court\u2019s general charge of proximate cause, and the other of the failure of the court to give a special charge defining proximate cause and applying it to a state of facts claimed by defendant to constitute such negligence on the part of the plaintiff. If they should he held to involve the same points, it would only be necessary to consider one of the assignments; for the disposition of one would dispose of the other. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>If, then, they could be considered together, it would be sufficient to say that the definition of proximate cause is in the exact language given in the case of Texas &amp; N. O. Ry. v. Black, 44 S. W. Rep., 673, which was approved, in order to dispose of both; for this is the only point involved in the second assignment of error which is grouped with the third. Besides, the third assignment of error could not be sustained if it were presented in appellant\u2019s brief in such a manner as would entitle it to consideration, because the record shows a material difference in the special charge as embraced in it from the one which was really requested and refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-3\">3. While it appears from the record that the special charge which the fourth assignment of error complains of the court\u2019s giving at plaintiff\u2019s request, was filed, it is not authentically shown- that it was given the jury. Article 1320, Bevised Statutes, requires that the trial judge shall note distinctly which special charges he gives and refuses, and shall subscribe his name thereto. It is apparent from the record that this special charge bears no notation of the trial judge with his name signed ' thereto as required. This should be taken as conclusive that it was not given, notwithstanding the annotation on the margin of the record opposite the charge, that it was given. Ho annotation made by the clerk or any one else upon the transcript of the record can be taken to show what was done, when the record itself fails to show or disclose it. If the charge was in fact given, it should appear from the record that it was done in the manner required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">. 4. Hothing is better settled than, that when evidence is admissible only for a particular purpose, it is proper for the court in its charge to confine the jury in its consideration of it to the purpose for which it was\u201e admitted. Therefore we overrule the fifth assignment of error which complains of the court\u2019s doing this very thing.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">6. There was no error in this part of the court\u2019s charge: \u201cIf you find that it was negligence-on the part of the plaintiff to attempt to board the car at the time, in the manner, or under the circumstances under which you find that he did attempt to board said car, and that such negligence, if any, proximately caused or contributed to cause the accident and plaintiff\u2019s injury, you will return a verdict for the defendant,\u201d which is complained of by the sixth assignments error.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">6. Defendant\u2019s special charge number 2, claimed by the seventh assignment to have been erroneously refused, appears word for word in the eighth paragraph of the court\u2019s charge, and to have given it would have been a mere repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">7. The appellant has withdrawn the eighth assignment of error, and requests that it be not considered. We cheerfully grant the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">8. What is denominated special charge number 9, might be regarded and considered a pretty good argument for the defendant, if it were \u25a0 shown there was evidence upon which it could be based; but it can not be regarded as law which should, in any event, be given in charge to a jury. Therefore, the ninth assignment, which complains of the court\u2019s refusing it, is overruled.'</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">9. The tenth assignment of error assails an argument of appellee\u2019s counsel that does not legally appear from the record to have been made, and it is, therefore, overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>10. Our conclusions of fact dispose of assignments of error from the eleventh to the fifteenth inclusive, all of which are directed against the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain the verdict, adversely to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\">11. There was no error in the court\u2019s giving this charge: \"In this case I charge you that the burden of proof is upon the defendant to establish contributory negligence, but in reaching the conclusion upon such issue, you must take into consideration all the evidence which is before you.\u201d The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">Writ of error refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
