Downs, the defendant, a certain tract of land known as the Daniel Pharis league, alleged to be situated in Sabine and San Augustine Counties in this State. The field notes of the .land sued for are given in the petition as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b244-12\">\u201cBeginning at an inner corner of the Martin White league of land lying mostly in Sabine County, Texas, said beginning corner being 245 varas eastward from the northeast corner of the Thomas Payne league in San Augustine County, Texas, thence northward with one of the west boundary lines of said Martin White league 443 varas to the most northern northwest corner of said Martin White league, and continuing northward in same course 5,572 6-10 varas in all to the H. E. corner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>of said Daniel Pharis league. Thence westward at right angles to the line last described at 1,040 varas the east boundary line of the Armstead Chumney league, where it intersects and conflicts with the north boundary line of the Pharis league, and continuing westward in the same course in all 4,487 varas to the E\". W. corner of said Daniel Pharis league, thence southward, parallel with the first described line of said Pharis league 5,572 6-10 varas to the north boundary line of said Thomas Payne league, thence eastward with the north boundary line of said Thomas Pajme league 4,487 varas to the place of beginning.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-3\">The defendant answered by plea of not guilty, and averred that the claim asserted by the plaintiffs constituted a cloud upon his title, which he prayed to have removed, and to have title vested in him. There was a non jury trial, resulting in a judgment for the defendant and the plaintiffs have appealed. The trial judge filed conclusions of fact, which are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u201c1. During the biennial term of 1834 and 1835, proceedings were instituted by Daniel Pharis, under the Colonization Law of March 25, 1825, to obtain a grant of one league of land from the Free State of Coahuila and Texas. These proceedings culminated in the survey of the land applied for on September 1, 1834. The description of said survey, as contained in said alleged grant is as follows, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u201cThe tract of land surveyed to the colonist Daniel Pharis is situated on an eastern branch of the stream called Villar creek, and begins at the southeast corner of the survey marked J. J., this being the first corner of this survey, from which a gum tree of sixteen inches in diameter, bears south 60 west at a distance of 2 4-10 varas, and another gum of fourteen inches in diameter is to the north 8 degrees east; from there to the east there were measured 4,487 varas unto the line of the neighbor A. T. in which the second corner was formed, drove a stake from which a red wood tree 7 inches in diameter bears south 71 degrees -west and a black gum of 20 inches in diameter is to the south 75 degrees east, at the distance of 4 5-10 varas; from there on the course to the north 5,572 6-10 varas and the third comer was formed, driving a stake, etc., from which a pine 20 inches in diameter bears south at the distance of 80 varas, and a black oak of 22 inches bears north 50 degrees east at the distance of four varas. From there to the west 4,487 varas unto the point of the fourth and last corner, which a pine of 20 inches in diameter bears north 39 degrees west 8 4-10 varas distant, and another pine of 22 inches in diameter bears north 50 degrees east. From there to the south 5,571 6-10 varas until arriving at the corner where this survey was commenced; thus completing the survey of the league of land which you command me to have surveyed. Of the aforesaid tract 8 labors belong to the class of arable land, and the remaining 17 to that of pasture, its configuration being that which the map represents. This grant was extended upon condition expressed therein, that within one year the grantee would construct fixed and permanent monument at every angle of the tract granted; and that he would cultivate it and populate it'in conformity with the provisions of the law referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u201c2. The plaintiffs own whatever title-the alleged Daniel Pharis grant conveyed to the land described in their petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>\u201c3. The evidence affirmatively shows that there is no such creek as \u2018Yillar\u2019 creek on or in the neighborhood of the land described in the petition; and there is no evidence in the record showing the location on the ground of any of the natural objects or other surveys mentioned in the above description. Indeed, there is no evidence that such creek, natural object or other surveys exist anywhere; or that any monument exists or has ever existed at any angle of the land sought to be recovered by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-3\">\u201c4. There is no evidence that plaintiffs, or anyone else, ever claimed the land described in their petition, or attempted to exercise acts of ownership over same, by virtue of the title alleged to have been extended to Daniel Pharis, prior to the institution of this suit on October 18, 1902.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u201c5. There is no map or sketch of any character attached to the testimonio extending said Pharis grant, and if any such sketch or map ever existed, the evidence does not show such map or sketch or any copy thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u201c6. The Daniel Pharis league survey is not delineated on any official map of San Augustine County, or elsewhere. The grant is known in the General Land Office of the State as a lost league/ The survey was made by one David Brown, who is now dead; and who, subsequent to making said Pharis survey, made two other surveys known respectively as the Martin White league and the J ames White league.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\"><em>\u201c7. </em>On September 17, 1835, David Brown surveyed the James White league, and described same as follows in the field notes thereof, viz.:</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u201cDescriptive notes of a survey of a league of land made for Mr. James White, where he lives, by order of Geo.

McFarland surveyed the A. Chumney <em>league. A </em>copy <em>of the </em>field notes of this survey, as on file in the General Land Office of the State bears the following endorsement below the signature of the surveyor, viz.: \u2018Note interference with Pharis began 472 varas from the front of Pharis on N. B. T. (950 varas in breadth and 5,000 in length) equals 4,750,000 sqr. var.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">.\u201c10. Defendant claims the land' described in plaintiff\u2019s petition through the A. Chumney grant, and is the owner of same by virtue of said grant, unless plaintiffs are the owners thereof by virtue of the title extended by Daniel Pharis grant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">As conclusions of law the trial judge held (1) that the evidence failed to show that the land sued for was embraced in the Pharis grant; and (2) that the Pharis title had been abandoned before the grantee performed the conditions on which the grant was extended; and therefore plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Opinion.\u2014The first assignment of error assails the first finding of fact wherein it is stated that the Pharis title culminated in a- survey of the land, when, the assignment alleges, the undisputed evidence shows that a valid grant of the land surveyed was made to Daniel Pharis on September 2, 1834. It is true, as contended by plaintiffs, that a grant was issued to Daniel Pharis for the land described in the survey; and if it was intended by the use of the word \u201cculminated\u201d to indicate that nothing further was shown in reference to the Pharis grant, then that finding is, to that extent, erroneous; but it does not follow that the case should be reversed. And the same may be said in reference to the second assignment, whic^i complains of the third finding of fact, wherein it is stated that the evidence affirmatively shows that there is no such creek as \u201cYillar\u201d creek on or in the neighborhood of the land described in the petition. While the evidence may not have shown affirmatively that there was no such creek, it failed to show that there was such creek; and as the burden rested upon the plaintiffs to identify the land sued for as a part of the Pharis grant, it devolved upon them to show the existence and location of the creek referred to, and not upon defendant to show its nonexistence.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">There are some other assignments assailing the findings of fact, which are not regarded as tenable and are overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">The sixth assignment assails the trial court\u2019s conclusion of law to the effect that the evidence does not show that the land described in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition was embraced in the Pharis grant. What is denominated the first proposition under this assignment is, in fact, two ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>stract propositions, which is not in accordance with the rules; one io the effect that where the evidence is conflicting the court\u2019s finding should be according to the preponderance of the evidence, and the other to the effect that where undisputed evidence establishes an alleged fact, the court should find in accordance with such evidence. It will be observed that in neither of these propositions is it asserted that the undisputed testimony, or even a preponderance thereof, established any fact. The second proposition under this assignment asserts that the field notes of the Jas. White and Martin White surveys made by Brown, the surveyor who made the Daniel Pharis survey, are evidence of the location of the latter survey. It is true that the field notes of the two White surveys, which are shown to be delineated upon official maps, and may perhaps be found upon the ground, do call for certain boundary lines of the Pharis survey; but it is not true that such calls necessarily establish upon the ground the location of the Pharis survey with that degree of certainty which would require a finding that the land described in the plaintiff\u2019s petition is part or all of the Pharis grant. Th\u00e9 testimony given by the witness Hunnicutt, the chief draughtsman in the General Land Office, a surveyor and civil engineer, amply supports the court\u2019s finding on the question under consideration, and fully answers the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. He testified, in substance, that the Pharis survey could hot be identified, mapped or patented because of the fact that it did not call for any other surveys or objects that appeared upon the official map by which its relative position could be determined. He illustrated by saying that it called to begin at the southeast corner of a survey marked J. J.; that it called to run to the line of A. T., and stated that he could find no surveys on the map answering to the description of J. J. or A. T. He also stated, in substance and effect, that he was unable to locate the Pharis by the calls for its lines contained in the two White surveys, for the reason that they called for the Pharis lines to run on different courses from those contained in the field notes of the Pharis, and called for corners with different bearing trees from those given in the Pharis field notes. Hunnicutt was corroborated by the testimony given by George Williams, another surveyor, and plaintiffs submitted no proof to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-3\">The seventh assignment is addressed to the court\u2019s conclusion of law to the effect that the Pharis title had been abandoned. We do not consider it necessary to decide this question. If the trial court was correct, as we have held it was, in holding that plaintiffs had failed to show that the land described in their petition and sued for was embraced in the Pharis grant, then they were not entitled to recover regardless of the validity of the Pharis title.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\">Hnder the eighth assignment the proposition is advanced that the defendant was not entitled to a judgment divesting title out of the plaintiffs for all of the land sued for, and vesting it in the defendant. It was admitted that the plaintiffs were the owners of the Pharis title, and that the defendant was the owner of the Chumley grant. The proof failed to show that the Chumley grant includes all the land described in the plaintiffs\u2019 petition, and for that reason it was error to render judgment vesting title in the defendant to all the land sued for.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">Therefore the judgment will be reformed, so as to relieve it from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>that objection; but as no such objection was urged in the court below where it doubtless would have been corrected, the costs of the appeal will be taxed against the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The ninth and tenth assignments complain because the trial court did not render judgment for the plaintiffs; but the questions presented under this assignment are, in substance, reiterations of questions already decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">No reversible error has been shown and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\n<em>Reformed and affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
