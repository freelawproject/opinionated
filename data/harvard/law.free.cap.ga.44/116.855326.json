F. Duran. In the bond he said: which attachment is returnable \u201cto the May Term of the Superior Court of said county.\u201d The Magistrate ordered the officer to levy and make return \u201c to the May Term of the Superior Court of said county.\u201d It was levied at once upon certain perishable property, and the Court ordered it to be sold. In this order the attachment is said to be \u201c returnable to the November Term of the Superior Court.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-9\">At November Term, 1870, Downing appeared, showed that Duran had, within four months from the issuing of said attachment, been adjudicated a bankrupt under the Bankrupt Act of Congress of 1867, and that he, Downing, had been appointed his assignee and had qualified as such, and moved to be made a party-defendant as assignee. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to this, but the Court overruled the objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-10\">Becoming a party, Downing moved to dismiss the attachment because it was not returned to November Term, 1870, as required by law. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel stated that \u201c May \u201d was put for \u201c November \u201d by mistake, both in the bond and attachment, and proposed to amend them by striking \u201c May \u201d and inserting \u201c November.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b117-11\">The Court refused to dismiss the attachment or to allow the amendment, because, in __his opinion, the bankrupt pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>ceeding stopped the cause in his Court, and he could do <em>no </em>act in the premises. Downing then moved to have said attachment entered as dissolved. For the same reason the Court refused this also.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b118-5\">Each side sued out a bill of exceptions. Kent <em>&amp; </em>Company complain at Downing\u2019s being made a party, and at the * refusal of the amendment.

If an attachment be in fact pending in the Courts of this State, and the defendant be declared a bankrupt, the attachment is, by the Act of Congress, dissolved: Act of 1867, section 14. But how is the State Court to know that the defendant is a bankrupt? Surely the judgment must be, in some authentic mode, made known to the Court. It may be denied. It would be a strange law if, <em>ipso facto, </em>by the fiat of bankruptcy, attachments in other Courts fell to nothing, so as to make the officers of said Courts trespassers. Order is one of the first requisites of legal proceedings, and we do not see how our Courts can take notice of judgments of other Courts by instruction. They must be brought to the notice of the Court, and this cannot be done without parties. We think, therefore, it was proper to make the assignee a party on his own motion, if for no other reason <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>than to have it properly made known to the Court that the defendant was a bankrupt.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">2. We think, too, the assignee had a right to move to dismiss the attachment. If its levy gave the defendant any rights under the attachment bond, that passed, under the</p>\n<p id=\"Ak\">law, to the assignee, he has the right to use the means to make them effective, by dismissing the attachment.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">3. We are clear, however, that the bond and attachment were amendable. The Code, section 3240, authorizes amendments of the bond and attachment. The amendment here was clearly only to correct a clerical error. It appears that in fact the attachment was returned to November Term, 1870. This was patent to the Court, and the amendment was only to make the statements in the attachment and bond conform to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
