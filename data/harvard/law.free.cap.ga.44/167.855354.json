Fulton Superior Court, October Term, 1870.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-10\">Sparks <em>&amp; </em>Tye sued Burgheim in a Justice\u2019s Court; he pleaded a set-\u00f3ff, and obtained a judgment against them. They sued out a <em>certiorari, </em>returnable to October Term of said Court. Sparks <em>&amp; </em>Tye\u2019s counsel filed exceptions to the Justice\u2019s answer thereto. When they were about to argue these exceptions, Burgheim\u2019s counsel moved to dismiss the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>certiorari, </em>because he had not been notified of the sanction of the writ, and of the time and place of hearing, ten days prior to the said term of said Court. (It was admitted that such \u25a0 notice was given during said term.) Sparks &amp; Tye\u2019s eoun-. sel said this motion was out of order. The Court said it was not. They then proposed that time be given to Burglieim\u2019s counsel, if said notice was too recent. But this the Court refused, and dismissed the <em>certiorari </em>for want of such notice prior to the term. This is assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-5\">Mynatt <em>&amp; </em>Dell, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Af\">Section 3987 not applicable to Justices\u2019 Courts. The question is not settled by 34th Ga. R., 122, or 36th, 523. The Act was passed in 1861. Section 3787 applies to Inferior and Ordinary Courts. See rule as to Justices\u2019 Courts. Rule S. C., No. 15, \u201cFinal Judgment,\u201d in section 3995, applies to Justices\u2019 Courts: 17th Ga. R., 429. Trial on merits favored: 30th Ga., R., 675-8; 36th, 393. The notice given was substantial compliance: 36th Ga. R., 396. The \u201ctime and place\u201d of hearing is fixed by law, for the writ is returnable to term. The ten days means ten before the <em>hearing, </em>and not before Court sits.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b168-6\">John Milledge, Jr., for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b168-7\">McCay, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">There is nothing, either in the language nor in the object of section 3987 of the Code to confine its operation to any <em>particular </em>writs of <em>certiorari. </em>Indeed, the propriety of some kind of notice to the other side is very evident. We think the statute is rather rigid in the consequences which it imposes upon failure, but such is the law, and we are bound by it. We are unable to see why the fact that all writs of <em>certiorari </em>are to be sanctioned by the Judge under the new Constitution can affect the question. Notice is just as necessary now as it was when the <em>certiorari </em>issued, as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
