And they agreed that \u201ceither party failing to perform their part forfeits to the other the sum of $1,000 00.\u201d Overstreet sued them for said $1,000 00, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>averring that, at one time, he delivered thirty-seven barrels and at another thirty-six barrels of such turpentine at said place, for them, and they refused to comply with their said contract. Without proof of any special damage, he closed his case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b508-5\">The Court charged the jury that said agreement was not a penal bond, but that the $1,000 00 was stipulated damages, and that, if they found for plaintiff, they should find that sum. They found according to the charge. Said charge is assigned as error. (The cause was continued here twice for want of administration of Overstreet\u2019s estate, he having died <em>pendente lite.)</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-6\">Hab\u00e9is &amp; Williams <em>; </em>T.

And in all cases, if the damages are capable of computation, and is not uncertain in its character, such stipulations will not be declared penalties.\u201d The breach alleged here is a failure to take and pay for two lots of this turpentine. The damages can easily be ascertained. The difference between the price agreed upon and the worth of the article, at the time, in the market, is, <em>prima fade, </em>the measure of damages. The thing bargained about is an article of merchandise. It has always <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a market value, and the case comes exactly within the provision of the Code, which we have quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">If such a contract as this is not a penalty, we see no limitation at all to the stipulation which parties may make, however onerous and unconscionable. Why, if this is not a penalty, may not one bind himself in a penalty of, say $1,000 00, to pay twenty cents per pound for all the cotton one may make, on a particular place, during any one year, and yet this is just the sort of ease that begot the first interference, by Courts of equity, with such agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">We think this was clearly a penalty, and not liquidated damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
