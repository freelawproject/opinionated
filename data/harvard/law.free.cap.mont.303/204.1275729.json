We reverse the decisions of the District Courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b62 The appellants raise several issues, but we find the dispositive issue on appeal to be whether the school territory transfer statute, \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">\u00b63 Lame Deer High School District (LDHSD) was created in 1993 after extensive hearings and testimony. In February of 1991, after petitions were filed to create the new district, the County Superintendents of Schools of both Big Horn and Rosebud Counties held hearings. After both County Superintendents denied the petitions to create LDHSD, the State Superintendent of Public Instruction issued a notice of hearing, consolidated the appeals, and an independent hearing examiner conducted further hearings on the matter. The hearing examiner issued an order; the parties were allowed to file exceptions and present oral arguments. On November 9, 1993, after consideration of this record, the State Superintendent issued her order creating LDHSD.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">\u00b64 The non-voted mill levy assessed in LDHSD is currently about 34 mills, which is close to the statewide average, and which is less than predicted by the State Superintendent when she created the new district. The assessed taxable valuation of the territory belonging in LDHSD is approximately $2,111,689. The transfer sought to be made here will remove approximately $1.6 million through the Rosebud County territory transfer and approximately $325,000 will be removed by the Big Horn County territory transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b65 LDHSD includes land from the Colstrip and Hardin High School Districts in both Rosebud and Big Horn Counties, including lands within and outside of the borders of the Northern Cheyenne Reservation. The territories proposed for transfer in this consolidated case border the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation on three sides. Transferring both the Rosebud and Big Horn territories from LDHSD would leave the district with only $161,000 in taxable valuation, all within the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\">\u00b66 In 1994, individuals residing in both Rosebud and Big Horn Counties, but outside of the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation (collectively \u201cRespondents\u201d), petitioned their respective County Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>perintendents of Schools requesting a territory transfer from LDHSD back to the Colstrip and Hardin High School Districts. Both County Superintendents of Schools held hearings, and both granted the Respondents\u2019 requests to transfer territory from LDHSD pursuant to \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">\u00b67 LDHSD appealed these decisions to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, who reversed the County Superintendents\u2019 decisions. From that determination, Respondents appealed to their respective District Courts. Both District Courts reversed the State Superintendent\u2019s decisions. LDHSD now appeals from the District Courts\u2019 decisions. In February of 1999, we consolidated the cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b68 The dispositive issue on appeal is whether \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, which gives authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts, is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b69 Our review of issues involving constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4. A statute, however, is presumed to be constitutionally valid. <em>Ingraham v. Champion Intern. </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 42, 46-47, 793 P.2d 769, 772. The party challenging the constitutionality of a statute has the burden of overcoming this presumption. <em>McClanathan v. Smith </em>(1980), 186 Mont. 56, 65, 606 P.2d 507, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\u00b610 Respondents argue that this issue is not properly before this Court because it was not raised in the District Courts. LDHSD counters that while this issue is being raised for the first time on appeal both the law and the procedural posture of the case support their position that this Court should review the issue. LDHSD argues that broad public concerns are involved which effect the substantial rights of the litigants and that the only time this issue could have been raised in this case was on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">\u00b611 In general, this Court does not consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Reno v. Erickstein </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 36, 41, 679 P.2d 1204, 1207; Day <em>v. Payne </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 273, 276, 929 P.2d 864, 866. It appears, however, that substantial rights of the litigants are at stake here. Their school district boundaries and tax burden have been affected by a potentially unconstitutional delegation of power to the County Superintendents. Further, the procedural posture of this case is unique. This matter began as an administrative case before the County Superintendent who did not consider any constitutional is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>sues. On appeal, the State Superintendent refused to consider constitutional issues. Even if LDHSD had raised this issue in the District Courts, it still would have been raised for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">\u00b6 12 LDHSD argues that the County Superintendent\u2019s change of the boundaries of LDHSD was an exercise of legislative power. We have previously held that the authority to alter school district boundaries is legislative in nature. The authority to make school district boundaries is entirely within the power of the legislature. <em>Read v. Stephens </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 508, 512, 193 P.2d 626, 628. Montana law on this issue is consistent with those of sister states. <em>See, e.g., School District No. 46 v. City of Bellevue </em>(Neb. 1987), 400 N.W.2d 229, 235; <em>State ex rel. Dix v. Board of Education </em>(Kan. 1974), 527 P.2d 952, 955; <em>Dunker v. Brown County Board of Education </em>(S.D. 1963), 121 N.W.2d 10, 13; <em>Hazlet v. Gaunt </em>(Colo. 1952), 250 P.2d 188, 194; <em>State v. Hines </em>(Kan. 1947), 182 P.2d 865, 868.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b613  Section 20-6-320, MCA, grants local county superintendents the power to transfer territory from one school district to another. Section 20-6-320, MCA, gives the county superintendents the authority to alter the boundaries of school districts, constituting a delegation of legislative power. The legislature may constitutionally delegate its legislative functions to an administrative agency, but it must provide, with reasonable clarity, limitations upon the agency\u2019s discretion and provide the agency with policy guidance. <em>City of Missoula v. Missoula County </em>(1961), 139 Mont. 256, 259, 362 P.2d 539, 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">\u00b614 Article III, Section 1, of the 1972 Montana Constitution (formerly Article IV, Section 1,1889 Montana Constitution) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACH\">Separation of powers. The power of the government of this state is divided into three distinct branches-legislative, executive, and judicial. No person or persons charged with the exercise of power properly belonging to one branch shall exercise any power properly belonging to either of the others, except as in this constitution expressly directed or permitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">\u00b615 In <em>Bacus v. Lake County </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 69, 354 P.2d 1056, we set the standard for a delegation of legislative power. We stated the rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b238-8\">The law-making power may not be granted to an administrative body to be exercised under the guise of administrative discretion. Accordingly, in delegating powers to an administrative body with respect to the administration of statutes, the legislature must ordinarily prescribe a policy, standard, or rule for their guidance and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>must not vest them with an arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion with regard thereto, and a statute or ordinance which is deficient in this respect is invalid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b239-4\"><em>Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 78, 354 P.2d at 1061. A statute granting legislative power to an administrative agency will be held to be invalid if the legislature has failed to prescribe a policy, standard, or rule to guide the exercise of the delegated authority. If the legislature fails to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of power delegated to an administrative agency, or if those limits are too broad, the statute is invalid. <em>See Matter ofAuth. to Conduct Sav. &amp; Loan Act., Etc. </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 361, 369-70, 597 P.2d <em>84, 89; Douglas v. Judge </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 32, 38, 568 P.2d <em>530, 534; Plath v. Hi-Ball Contractors, Inc. </em>(1961), 139 Mont. 263, 272, 362 P.2d 1021, 1025; <em>City of Missoula, </em>139 Mont. at 259, 362 P.2d at 540-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b616 LDHSD argues that the statute\u2019s delegation of power is unconstitutional because it gives the county superintendents unfettered discretion in determining whether to transfer territory. Further, the statute\u2019s only directive is that the decision must be based on the effects of a transfer on both those living in the territory proposed for transfer and those living in the remaining territory. LDHSD argues that the legislature must give more guidance than this broad discretionary language. Respondents counter that the detailed procedure involved in petitioning for a territory transfer expressly constrains the county superintendents\u2019 ability to act.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">\u00b617 The legislature has established a number of conditions which must be satisfied before a petition may be considered by a county superintendent of schools. Satisfaction of these conditions, however, does not require granting of a petition. Section 20-6-320, MCA (1993), is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-7\">(1) A majority of registered electors of a high school district who reside in territory that is a part of a high school district may petition the county superintendent to transfer the territory in which they reside to another high school district if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-8\">(a) the territory to be transferred is contiguous to the high school district to which it is to be attached;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-9\">(b) the territory to be transferred is not located within 3 miles, over the shortest practical route, of an operating school of the high school district from which it is to be detached;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b239-10\">(c) the transfer of the territory will not reduce the taxable value of the district to less than $300,000 unless the remaining territory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>of the high school district contains not less than 50,000 acres of nontaxable Indian land;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-4\">(d) the board of trustees of the school district that would receive the territory has approved the proposed transfer in writing; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-5\">(e) the territory proposed to be transferred to another high school district has not been included in a petition filed under this section in the previous 3 years....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b240-6\">(6) Within 30 days after the hearing, the county superintendent shall, after considering the testimony and exhibits presented at the hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order. The county superintendent shall grant or deny the requested transfer of territory. The decision must be based on the effects that the transfer would have on those residing in the territory proposed for transfer as well as those residing in the remaining territory of the high school district....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">This statute\u2019s only directive on whether to grant or deny a petition is that \u201cthe decision must be based on the effects that the transfer would have on those residing in the territory proposed for transfer as well as those residing in the remaining territory of the high school district.\u201d Section 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993) (statute was amended in 1997, causing the difference in subsection numbers, but the language at issue remains the same). The territory transfer statute does not constrain a county superintendent\u2019s discretion in whether to grant or deny a transfer. The decision is left up to the county superintendent\u2019s unguided judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-8\">\u00b618 While this statute sets forth some criteria, the satisfaction of these conditions does not limit a county superintendent\u2019s discretion in granting or denying a petition once the procedural requirements have been met. This statute fails to provide any checks on the discretion of the county superintendent of schools in deciding whether to grant a territory transfer. The statute\u2019s only directive is that the county superintendent should make the decision based on the effects felt by those transferred and those remaining. Section 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993). The legislature has provided no criteria for balancing the effects felt by the parties involved in a school district territory transfer. Instead, the decision is left solely to the whim of the local county superintendents.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-9\">\u00b619  It is this broad grant of discretion to a county superintendent of schools, unchecked by any standard, policy or rule of decision, that renders the territory transfer statute unconstitutional. In <em>Bacus </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>we stated that \u201cthe standard must not be so broad that the officer or board will have unascertainable limits within which to act.\u201d <em>Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 81, 354 P.2d at 1062. If the legislature had limited a county superintendent to the role of fact finder or if the legislature had set forth the specific criteria to be weighed when deciding to grant or deny a petition, the statute would have conformed to constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-4\">\u00b620  We hold that \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The decisions of the District Courts are reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b241-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES REGNIER, TRIEWEILER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b241-7\">JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ami\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">\u00b621 I specially concur in our opinion. L write separately, first, because I believe that the dissent\u2019s criticism of the procedural component of our opinion is unfounded and, second, because I have my own rationale for concluding that \u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. In sum, I believe that we are correct in addressing this issue; I believe that we are correct in holding the statute unconstitutional; and, finally, I believe that the Legislature can amend the statute to cure its constitutional infirmities by articulating reasonably clear and definite standards, objective criteria and ascertainable limits to guide the county superintendent\u2019s exercise of discretion in territory transfer cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-10\">\u00b622 First, there is the contention that the constitutional issue is being raised for the first time on appeal contrary to our general rule that dictates we not address issues and theories unless first raised in the trial court. There are at least two sound legal reasons which militate against following the usual rule in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-11\">\u00b623 As noted by the Court, there is a \u201csubstantial rights\u201d exception to the general rule. In <em>Matter of N.B. </em>(1980), 190 Mont. 319, 323, 620 P.2d 1228, 1231, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b242-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>This Court reserves to itself the power to examine constitutional issues that involve broad public concerns to avoid future litigation on a point of law. We reject the State\u2019s argument that this appeal should be dismissed for failure to raise these issues for the first time on appeal if the alleged District Court error affects the substantial rights of a litigant. [Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">This exception to the no-review rule is discretionary, and we interpret \u201csubstantial rights\u201d narrowly. <em>Reno v. Erickstein </em>(1984), 209 Mont. 36, 42, 679 P.2d 1204, 1207. Notwithstanding, I believe that this case fits within the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b624 Public education and how school districts are drawn, administered, and financed implicate broad public concerns \u2014 concerns that are the subject of continuing, intense, popular, and legislative scrutiny statewide. Moreover, as part II of this separate opinion demonstrates, these same matters significantly impact the rights of educational opportunity guaranteed under Article X, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution and, thus, the substantial rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the litigants here.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b625 Additionally, this case is one of three school district territory transfer cases presently before this Court. <em>See In re the Petition to Transfer Territory from Belgrade Elementary and High School District No. 44 to Monforton Elementary District No. 27 and Bozeman High School District No. </em>7, No. 99-687; <em>Belgrade Elementary and High School District No. 44 v. Alan and Cindy Morris, Bozeman Elementary and High School District No. 7 and Gallatin County Superintendent of Schools Jill Richards, </em>No. 99-395. In these latter two cases, the unconstitutional delegation issue was raised and briefed below. And, while it might be argued that, to avoid the criticism of the dissent, we should address this issue in one of those two cases, the fact remains that if the statute is unconstitutional for one case, it is unconstitutional for all cases. In practical terms, it simply does not matter which case serves as the vehicle to articulate the dispositive rule of law which governs all three. Moreover, since the instant case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>the first of the three to advance through the opinion writing stage, (and the only one orally argued), it makes good sense to give the Legislature as much lead time as possible in which to consider and adopt amendments to the statute, if that body chooses to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b626 That said, I turn next to the substance of the statute at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b627 Section 20-6-320, MCA (1993), allows territory comprising a high school district to be transferred from one contiguous district to another. Subsection (1) of the statute provides certain specific criteria as to the territory to be transferred, as to the territory remaining and as to the receiving district. Subsection (2) provides certain information that must be included in the transfer petition and for a $50 (now $100) filing fee. Like those in subsection (1), these requirements are black and white and require no exercise of discretion. Under subsection (3), a petition that meets the statutory criteria specified in subsection (1) and contains the information required by subsection (2) is valid; one that does not meet these criteria or contain this information is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">\u00b628 Subsections (3), (4) and (5) set out how the county superintendent is to proceed procedurally after a valid petition is filed. Subsections (7) and (8) also contain other procedural requirements. None of these procedural requirements are at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b629 As noted by the majority, subsection (6) of the statute presents the constitutional infirmity. This subsection provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b243-9\">Within 30 days after the hearing, the county superintendent shall, after considering the testimony and exhibits presented at the hearing, issue findings of fact, conclusions of law, and an order. The county superintendent shall grant or deny the requested transfer of territory. <em>The decision must be based on the effects that the transfer would have on those residing in the territory proposed for transfer as well as those residing in the remaining territory of the high school district.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Section 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b243-11\">\u00b630 Subsection (6) completely fails to provide any objective legislative standard, policy, instruction, criteria, or requirements as to what sort of \u201ceffects\u201d are to guide the county superintendent in exercising his or her power to grant the petition to transfer or to deny the petition. There is no legislative direction as to what \u201ceffects\u201d the county superintendent, at a minimum, is to consider. For example, is he or she to consider the effect of the transfer on educational opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>and quality; on property taxes; on taxable valuation; on fiscal stability and bonding capacity; on student transportation; on plant capacity; on class size; on student, teacher and staff morale; on sports and extracurricular activities; on local control; on racial, cultural, social, economic and demographic diversity or homogeneity; on district geography and on the communities and infrastructure of the transferring and receiving districts? Is he or she to consider all of the above, some of the above, none of the above? Is he or she to consider other \u201ceffects\u201d instead of or in addition to the above?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b631 Moreover, the statute fails to provide any legislative direction as to how, substantively, the county superintendent is to evaluate the types of \u201ceffects\u201d that transfer might implicate. Which \u201ceffects\u201d are important; which are less important; under what criteria are competing \u201ceffects\u201d to be balanced; and are there certain \u201ceffects\u201d that must exist \u2014 or may not exist \u2014 before a transfer petition can be granted or denied? Is some sort of cost-benefit-burden analysis appropriate or necessary? Is the county superintendent required to determine whether the relief sought by the petitioners could be accomplished by some mechanism short of disturbing existing school district boundaries so as to avoid the consequent \u201ceffects\u201d of transfer on the tax base and operations of both districts?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b632 ' The statute does not set out who \u2014 the petitioners or the opponents of transfer \u2014 bears the burden of proof of the \u201ceffects.\u201d The statute simply provides that a majority of the resident electors in territory that is part of a district may petition to transfer the territory in which they reside to another district. Aside from there being no definition as to what constitutes \u201cterritory\u201d \u2014 i.e., is it some percent of the total territory in the district or can it be one family\u2019s lot or farm? \u2014 the statute fails to specify whether this \u201cmajority\u2019 has any obligation to actually offer evidence or prove any \u201ceffects.\u201d The statute does not articulate a standard of proof. Are the \u201ceffects\u201d \u2014 assuming some obligation of proof \u2014 to be demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence; by clear and convincing evidence; or by some other standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">\u00b633 In short, one cannot read subsection (6) without being reminded of the old fast-food commercial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-7\">Customer: \u201cWhat\u2019s in the chicken sandwich?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-8\">Counter person: \u201cParts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-9\">Customer: \u201cWhat kind of parts?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b244-10\">Counter person: \u201cParts is parts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b245-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>In context, the same question can be asked: What\u2019s in this statute? Unfortunately, the answer is the same: \u201cEffects is effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b634 Under this statute, the Legislature has effectively given the county superintendent <em>carte blanche </em>to make virtually any decision he or she wishes. In default of specifying legislative standards, one locally-elected official has been statutorily granted free reign to transfer \u201cterritory\u201d \u2014 whatever that is \u2014 from one school district to another (or to deny a transfer) so long as the decision is based on the \u201ceffects\u201d of the transfer. There is no apparent legislative concern as to the significance, relevance or legitimacy of those \u201ceffects\u201d \u2014 only that there be some. The statute delegates completely unfettered discretion to the administrative official whether to transfer or to not transfer territory. The statute completely fails to set out any reasonably clear and ascertainable limits, objective criteria or clear and definite legislative standards to control the county superintendent\u2019s exercise of discretion and decision-making authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b635 As a result, this scheme allows, if not encourages, arbitrary and capricious decisions based on political expediency instead of on considerations emphasizing thoughtful and fiscally responsible school district administration and, most importantly, insuring the best educational opportunity for the students affected. By virtue of the non-existence of legislative criteria as to the nature and significance of the \u201ceffects\u201d the county superintendent is to consider, these statutes promote litigation between school districts with the attendant non-educationally related cost and expense that no school district in this State can realistically afford.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b636 There being no formal \u201cparties\u201d to school district territory transfer disputes, the \u201cforum\u201d for these sorts of proceedings constitutes little more than a public hearing before the county superintendent. Such a format is better suited to exchanges of opinions and rhetoric by any resident, taxpayer or district representative that wants a say, than to the receipt from knowledgeable witnesses of relevant, probative testimony and hard evidence on the \u201ceffects\u201d of the transfer on each district.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-7\">\u00b637 Moreover, this scheme defies any meaningful review of the county superintendent\u2019s determination because there are no legislative standards against which to judge his or her decision. So long as the county superintendent\u2019s decision is based on the \u201ceffects\u201d of the transfer, who is to say that the county superintendent is right or wrong? One \u201ceffect\u201d is as good or as bad as another \u201ceffect.\u201d One dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>trict\u2019s beneficial \u201ceffect\u201d is the other district\u2019s detrimental \u201ceffect.\u201d \u201cEffects\u201d may be important or they may be trivial. The \u201ceffects\u201d may impact many district residents or they may be personal only to the petitioners. But, so what? \u201cEffects is effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b638 If logic and common sense do not condemn such a perverse statutory scheme, the law does. Thus, it is to this law that I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b639 In <em>Read v. Stephens </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 508, 512, 193 P.2d 626, 628, we held that \u201c[t]he power exercised by the administrative boards or officials in changing the boundaries of school districts is usually termed legislative power ...\u201d We also concluded that the statutory language permitting the county superintendent to grant a transfer petition \u201cif he deem it advisable and for the best interest of the territory proposed to be transferred or included\u201d delegated to the country superintendent of schools and to the board of county commissioners \u201ca full measure of discretionary power in creating and changing the boundaries of school districts.\u201d Read, 121 Mont. at 513, 193 P.2d at 629. Unfortunately, however, we did not directly address the issue framed in the case at bar \u2014 i.e., whether the statutory language accorded with the constitutional requirement that delegation of authority to an administrative officer by the Legislature must be accompanied with objective, clear and ascertainable standards on how that authority should be exercised.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b246-9\">\u00b640 As the Court\u2019s opinion notes, however, this issue was addressed in <em>Bacus v. Lake County </em>(1960), 138 Mont. 69, 79-80, 354 P.2d 1056, 1061-62, wherein we declared unconstitutional a statute that delegated to county and district boards of health the power to enact rules and regulations \u201cpertaining to the prevention of disease and the promotion of public health.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">\u00b641 Citing the \u201cSeparation of Powers\u201d provision, Article IV, Section 1 of the 1889 Montana Constitution (virtually identical to Article III, Section 1 of the 1972 Montana Constitution), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">When the legislature confers authority upon an administrative agency it must lay down the policy or reasons behind the statute and also prescribe standards and guides for the grant of power</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>which has been made to the administrative agency. The rule has been stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-4\">\u201cThe law-making power may not be granted to an administrative body to be exercised under the guise of administrative discretion. Accordingly, in delegating powers to an administrative body with respect to the administration of statutes, the legislature must ordinarily prescribe a policy, standard, or rule for their guidance and must not vest them with an arbitrary and uncontrolled discretion with regard thereto, and a statute or ordinance which is deficient in this respect is invalid. In other words, in order to avoid the pure delegation of legislative power by the creation of an administrative agency, the legislature must set limits on such agency\u2019s power and enjoin on it a certain course of procedure and rules of decision in the performance of its function; and, if the legislature <em>fails to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of power delegated to an administrative </em>agency; <em>or if those limits are too broad, </em>its attempt to delegate is a nullity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-5\">\u201c* * * On the other hand, a statute is complete and validly delegates administrative authority when nothing with respect to a determination of what is the law is left to the administrative agency, and <em>its provisions are sufficiently clear, definite, and certain to enable the agency to know its rights and obligations.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-6\"><em>Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 78-79, 354 P.2d at 1061 (emphasis in original) (quoting 73 C. J.S. Public Administrative Bodies and Procedure \u00a7 29 at 324-25).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">\u00b642 We observed that the statutory language at issue in <em>Bacus </em>was not sufficiently definite to lay down proper standards for the guidance of the administrative agency and that the Legislature\u2019s intention could not be discerned from the language which it used in delegating rule-making authority to the boards. We also pointed out that \u201cthe validity of a statute is determined by what may be done under it not what has been done under it.\u201d <em>Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 79, 354 P.2d at 1061 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">\u00b643 Finally, citing <em>State v. Stark </em>(1935), 100 Mont. 365, 371, 52 P.2d 890, 892, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cDelegation of power to determine who are within the operation of the law is not a delegation of legislative power. * * * But it is essential that the Legislature shall fix some standard by which the officer or board to whom the power is delegated may be governed, and not left to be controlled by caprice.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>We agree with this statement of the law and go further by saying that the standard must not be so broad that the officer or board will have unascertainable limits within which to act. The statute in the case at bar is too broad to prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits within which the officer or board may act.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><em>Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 81, 354 P.2d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">\u00b644 We have continued to follow the <em>Bacus </em>Court\u2019s reasoning in other cases where the Legislature has too broadly delegated its authority to administrative agencies. <em>See Plath v. Hi-Ball Contractors, Inc. </em>(1961), 139 Mont. 263, 362 P.2d 1021 (declaring unconstitutional a statute which delegated to city-county planning boards complete discretion in the development of master plans for the contiguous unincorporated area within a 12-mile radius of the city); <em>Douglas v. Judge </em>(1977), 174 Mont. 32, 568 P.2d 530 (holding unconstitutional a statute authorizing the Department of Natural Resources to make loans to farmers and ranchers who proposed \u201cworthwhile\u201d renewable resource development programs); <em>In the Matter of Savings &amp; Loan Activities </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 361, 597 P.2d 84 (declaring unconstitutional a statute granting the Department of Business Regulation the power to approve or disapprove applications for the merger of savings and loan associations); <em>Shannon v. City of Forsyth </em>(1983), 205 Mont. 111, 666 P.2d 750 (holding that a zoning ordinance requiring the approval of 80% of landowners residing within 300 feet of a particular property before a variance may be granted, was an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority); <em>White v. State </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 81, 759 P.2d 971 (declaring that the Legislature unconstitutionally delegated authority to the Science and Technology Development Board).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">\u00b645 <em>White </em>even more dramatically points up the constitutional infirmities in the school district territory transfer statute at bar. In <em>White, </em>the legislation at issue actually set out a whole list of criteria to be used by the Science and Technology Development Board in making technology investments. These considerations included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-7\">(1) Technology investments may be made from money in the technology development account only upon a favorable determination by the board of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">(a) the relevance of the proposed technology development project to the purposes of this part;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-9\">(b) the prospects for collaboration on the project between public and private sectors of the state\u2019s economy in mineral technology, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>agricultural technology, forestry technology, biotechnology, microelectronics and computer sciences, energy technology, information sciences, and materials science;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-4\">(c) the prospects for achieving commercial success in general and for creating significant numbers of new jobs in the state in particular;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-5\">(d) the quality of the specific product and business development methodology proposed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-6\">(e) the suitability of any proposed milestone for evaluating progress of technology development project results; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-7\">(f) the availability of matching funds required under 90-3-301(2). (2) In this evaluation process, the board shall consider the investment\u2019s:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">(a) job creation potential;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-9\">(b) potential benefit for existing industry;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-10\">(c) potential for creating new industry; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">(d) involvement of existing institutional research strength or whether it involves a newly targeted technology area with development potential.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-12\"><em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 89-90, 759 P.2d at 976.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-13\">\u00b646 Notwithstanding, even with this detail we held that these considerations did not rise to the level of objective criteria, but were more akin to general policy considerations underlying the entire technology investment program. The legislation was constitutionally deficient<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> because \u201c[n]o legislatively defined \u2018policy, standard or rule\u2019 [was] effectively given\u201d and because the bill failed to\"\u2019prescribe with reasonable clarity the limits of power delegated.\u2019\" <em>White, </em>233 Mont. at 90, 759 P.2d at 976 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-14\">\u00b647 If the detailed list of considerations set out in the legislation at issue in <em>White </em>was not sufficiently definite and clear enough to pass constitutional muster for legislative delegation of authority purposes, how much further then from the permissible standard is the school district territory transfer statute at issue in the case <em>sub ju</em>dice? The answer is self-evident. This statute permits the administrative official to grant or deny a petition merely \u201cbased on the effects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>that the transfer would have on those residing in the territory proposed for transfer as well as those residing in the remaining territory of the high school district.\u201d Section 20-6-320(6), MCA. In fact, it is difficult to imagine broader discretionary language. Purely and simply, in enacting subsection (6), the Legislature failed to prescribe any objective policy, standard, or rule of decision to limit the county superintendent\u2019s exercise of discretion. <em>See White, </em>233 Mont. at 90, 759 P.2d at 976. Moreover, subsection (6) of \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, is so broad that the county superintendent has no reasonably clear and ascertainable limits within which to act. <em>See Bacus, </em>138 Mont. at 81, 354 P.2d at 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"AkM\">\u00b648 Under this statute, the county superintendent can make his or her decision for a good reason, for a bad reason, or for no reason at all. Provided his or her decision is based on the \u201ceffects\u201d of the transfer on the residents of the territories involved and assuming he or she says his or her decision is based on the \u201ceffects,\u201d legally it matters not what or how he or she decides. This is so, because there is no objective, clear and certain legislative direction as to what \u201ceffects\u201d he or she is to consider and as to how he or she is to judge the significance, relevance and legitimacy of those \u201ceffects\u201d as to the losing and gaining districts.</p>\n<p id=\"AxvJ\">\u00b649 Moreover, any judicial review of his or her decision \u2014 our appellate review included \u2014 is necessarily little more than an exercise in the judiciary substituting its judgment for that of the county superintendent\u2019s. Since the statute fails to include any objective, legislative policy, standard, or rule of decision as to what \u201ceffects\u201d are to be considered, reviewing courts have no basis for determining whether the county superintendent met or missed the mark. There is no yardstick by which to determine whether his or her decision was arbitrary or capricious; wrong or right.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">\u00b650 In short, the county superintendent\u2019s decision may have no real meat in it at all. It might well be made up of little more than beaks and claws and gizzards and eyeballs. But, under this statute, that\u2019s all right because \u201cParts is parts,\u201d and \u201cEffects is effects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">\u00b651 The language of the territory transfer statute at issue cannot pass the test of constitutionality under either Article III, Section 1, or Article V, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution. For that reason, I agree that \u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA, is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">\u00b652 I concur.</p>\n<judges id=\"b250-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART joins in the forgoing special concurrence.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b241-12\">. All references to this statute in this separate opinion are to the 1993 version of the Montana Code. I note, however, that the language at issue is included in the 1995,1997 and 1999 versions of \u00a7 20-6-320, MCA, as well, not to mention in the statute pertaining to transferring territory from one elementary school district to another. <em>See </em>\u00a7 20-6-213, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b242-7\">. While we have not had the opportunity to characterize the educational rights that are protected under Montana\u2019s Constitution, two members of this Court \u2014 the writer of this separate opinion and Justice Leaphart \u2014 have stated that they believe the educational rights protected by Article X, Section 1 of the Montana Constitution, are fundamental constitutional rights. <em>See Kaptein v.

As a result, I would not reach in this case the substantive issue of whether \u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993), is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. I would affirm the District Courts on the issues properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">\u00b654 With regard to whether the constitutional issue raised by LDHSD is properly before us, our general rule requires us to decline to consider issues raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Day, </em>280 Mont. 273, 929 P.2d 864. The LDHSD having conceded that it is raising this constitutional issue for the first time on appeal to this Court, I would decline to address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">\u00b655 With regard to the Court\u2019s notion that the procedural posture of this case is \u201cunique,\u201d I disagree. It goes without saying that this Court receives many appeals from judicial review by district courts of final agency decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">\u00b656 Nor do I agree with the Court that the earliest the LDHSD could have raised the constitutional issue was in the District Courts and, consequently, the issue would have been raised \u201cfor the first time on appeal\u201d there, thus rendering it somehow permissible for this Court to resolve the issue here and now. Under \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-320 and 20-3-107, MCA (1993), a county superintendent\u2019s decision is \u201cappealable\u201d to the state superintendent of public instruction. The state superintendent\u2019s decision is the final administrative order. <em>See </em>\u00a7 20-3-107(2), MCA (1993). In its appeals to the state superintendent, LDHSD raised at least one constitutional issue and the state superintendent properly left that issue for resolution by the courts. The District Courts, noting that the constitutional issue had been raised, addressed it and, as a result, that issue was properly preserved for consideration by this Court. LDHSD could have done the same with its \u201cunconstitutional delegation\u201d issue; it did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">\u00b657 Moreover, the remedy for one purportedly aggrieved by a final agency decision is \u201cjudicial review,\u201d pursuant to the Montana Administrative Procedure Act (Act), not \u201cappeal,\u201d as stated by the Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2-4-702(l)(a), MCA (1993). In that regard, \u00a7 2-4-702(1)0\u00bb), MCA (1993), of the Act expressly provides that a party proceeding before an agency under the terms of a particular statute may not be precluded from questioning the validity of that statute on judicial review. Thus, the Act specifically allows a challenge to a statute on \u201cjudicial review,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>even if not raised prior to that stage. LDHSD clearly was entitled, by law, to raise the \u201cunconstitutional delegation\u201d argument on judicial review in the District Courts and such an action would not constitute raising an issue for the first time on \u201cappeal.\u201d LDHSD had a second opportunity to raise this issue and failed to do so. I would not give it a third bite of the apple in this Court at this time in derogation of our general rule that we will not address an issue raised for the first time here.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">\u00b658 Finally, the Court\u2019s broad language suggesting that the general no-review rule contains an exception when \u201csubstantial rights of the litigants are at stake\u201d is set forth without any legal basis. Fortunately, Justice Nelson\u2019s special concurrence fills this hole in the Court\u2019s opinion by providing decisional authority. It also, however, clarifies that the \u201csubstantial rights\u201d exception to the no-review rule is interpreted narrowly and is discretionary with this Court. I would focus on the rationale behind the exception, which relates to avoiding future litigation on a point of law, rather than merely the \u201caffects substantial rights\u201d language. <em>See </em>N.B., 190 Mont. at 323, 620 P.2d at 1231. As Justice Nelson points out, other cases pending before us properly preserved the issue regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993). We could, and should, address the issue in one of those cases. Under the circumstances of these cases, the underlying rationale for the exception to the no-review rule-avoiding future litigation-simply does not support discretionary application of the exception here, particularly given another important principle applied by this Court, that we avoid constitutional issues whenever possible. <em>See, e.g., State v. Still </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 261, 902 P.2d 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">\u00b659 Furthermore, the no-review exception raises serious concerns of its own. Presumably, \u201csubstantial rights\u201d always can be argued in the context of a constitutional issue, given lawyers\u2019 creativity in crafting arguments. Consequently, the exception\u2019s application may well overwhelm and engulf the no-review rule, which is premised on the unfairness to district courts which results when this Court considers an issue not previously raised, and reverses-as the Court does here-a district court on an issue never presented to that court for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">\u00b660 The dispositive questions properly before us, at the bottom line, are (1) whether the county superintendents\u2019 decisions to grant a transfer of territory were arbitrary or capricious; (2) whether the state superintendent applied the proper standard on appeal of those decisions; and (3) whether the District Courts erred in concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>that the territory transfers did not constitute racial discrimination in violation of the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. I would resolve all three questions in the negative and affirm the District Courts. I dissent from the Court\u2019s failure to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
