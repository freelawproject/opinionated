We consolidate them for discussion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-13\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Zancanella?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-14\">2. Did the District Court err in denying summary judgment to the Steiners?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b130-15\">\n<em>3. Did the District Court properly grant the Steiners\u2019 motion for a directed verdict?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b130-16\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b130-17\">\u00b65 This case involves an accident between a vehicle driven by Larson-Murphy and a black Angus bull owned by the Steiners. Shortly after 11:30 p.m. on May 8,1993, Larson-Murphy was driving home in a southbound direction on Hoskin Road near Billings, Montana. She crested a slight rise in the highway created by an irrigation ditch culvert, and struck the bull. Upon impact, the bull rolled onto the hood and crashed through the windshield of the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-18\">\u00b66 According to trial testimony, the impact with the bull broke virtually every bone in Larson-Murphy\u2019s mid-face and jaw, and dislodged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>her teeth. Bull hair was actually removed from several of the bone fractures. Multiple reconstructive surgeries were required. As a result of the accident, Larson-Murphy\u2019s vision was permanently damaged.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b67 It is undisputed that Larson-Murphy was not at fault. She was driving lawfully at the time of the accident. The investigating highway patrolman calculated Larson-Murphy\u2019s speed at approximately 34 miles-per-hour, and stated that speed was not a factor in the collision. He further stated that no motorist could have avoided hitting the bull, which was standing in the middle of the highway, because of the darkness of the night and the slight rise in the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b68 Hoskin Road is a two-lane, paved county highway that it is neither a state highway nor a part of the federal-aid primary highway system. The undisputed facts indicate that the road sees fairly significant motor vehicle traffic. Also, the accident occurred on a stretch of Hoskin Road lying within a \u201cherd district,\u201d as provided pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-301 through 310, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">\u00b69 It is apparent from the record that the bull escaped from not one, but two enclosures. It is undisputed that the bull had been placed by the Steiners in a triangular, fenced pasture located roughly 100 yards from Hoskin Road with five heifers for breeding purposes. The Steiners had leased both the triangular pasture and an adjacent pasture from Zancanella. As part of the lease agreement, the Steiners agreed to maintain all of the pasture fences. The Steiners were required to maintain liability insurance under the lease, and it was the understanding of the parties that the Steiners would be responsible for any damage that might be caused by their livestock escaping.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">\u00b6 10 It is unclear, and therefore in dispute, as to how the bull escaped from the triangular pasture to the other leased pasture which borders Hoskin Road, where it was observed by a neighbor prior to the accident. After the accident, both Darin Steiner and the investigating highway patrolman inspected the fence which enclosed the pasture on the west side of Hoskin Road and found that the fence was intact and that no gates had been left open. There were no signs of broken barbed wire, damaged fence posts, or downed gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">\u00b611 During the course of litigation, however, Larson-Murphy contended that the bull may have escaped through a gate in the perimeter fence enclosing the pasture on the west side of Hoskin Road. Larson-Murphy presented evidence that the gate was loose with wide gaps between the wires, and that an irrigation ditch which passed di<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>rectly beneath the gate created a gap under which an animal could escape from the pasture. The gate in question is located within 100 feet of the accident site.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b6 12 Darin Steiner conceded that the perimeter fence had apparently failed to restrain the bull on the night in question, and admitted that the bull was capable of jumping over the fence and thereby obtaining access to the highway. Edwin Steiner also testified that he was aware that it would be dangerous to allow livestock to roam freely in the area, unrestrained by fences. Nevertheless, the Steiners have consistently maintained that the fences and gates on the leased property were well-maintained at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u00b613 Larson-Murphy filed her complaint with the District Court on April 26,1995, and generally alleged that the Steiners negligently allowed the black Angus bull to leave their leased premises and occupy the highway right-of-way. Her complaint was later amended and filed on January 5,1996, to include Zancanella, the owner of the property leased to the Steiners. Likewise, Larson-Murphy alleged that Zancanella, as owner and lessor of the land adjacent to Hoskin Road, was negligent in operating and controlling the premises in a reasonably safe manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u00b614 The District Court, in its May 8,1998 Memorandum, concluded that the Hoskin Road area was not open range pursuant to \u00a7 60-7-102(4), MCA, and accordingly \u201cthe open range doctrine does not apply in this case.\u201d The Steiners claimed that although the leased premises from which the bull escaped were located within a herd district, Hoskin Road, as a matter of law, was open range. The Steiners legal theory maintained that if the highway was within open range, they had no duty to anyone, including motorists, to prevent the bull from wandering onto and occupying the highway, and therefore could not be liable for any damages suffered by Larson-Murphy. Larson-Murphy alleged that the open range doctrine does not apply in herd districts, including the traversing roads, and that the Steiners had a legal duty to maintain a \u201clegal fence\u201d pursuant to state law.</p>\n<p id=\"AKU\">\u00b615 The court\u2019s legal conclusion that the accident did not occur in \u201copen range\u201d followed a series of motions for summary judgment and a motion for reconsideration brought by the respective Defendants. On October 29,1996, the District Court denied the Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, concluding that the Defendants had failed to establish that they lacked a duty to maintain legal fences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>and keep livestock off Hoskin Road. The court concluded issues of material fact remained in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">\u00b616 Then, on January 6, 1997, the court granted Defendant Zancanella\u2019s motion for summary judgment, pursuant to a \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d and dismissed him from this action. The court concluded he did not own the bull involved with the accident, and was not responsible for maintaining any of the fences in question. At the same time, the court nevertheless denied the Steiners\u2019 motion to reconsider, again concluding that the issue of whether the accident occurred in an open range area remained a material issue of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">\u00b617 The Steiners\u2019 again moved for summary judgment on October 7, 1997, arguing that although the accident occurred within a herd district, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Selstad </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 137, 766 P.2d 247, provided a legal basis for determining that the accident nevertheless occurred in open range. The District Court, on November 19,1997, determined that it could not, as a matter of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8V\">[R]ule that this area is open range, and that the open range no-duty law applies to the Defendants in this case. Material issues of fact still exist regarding the status of this area, and the road where the accident occurred. These facts are for a jury to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">\u00b618 Nevertheless, the court entered a directed verdict in favor of the Steiners on May 13,1998, after the trial had begun on May 11,1998. This judgment was entered without an accompanying memorandum providing a legal basis for the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">\u00b619 Both Larson-Murphy and the Steiners appealed. Due to the controversial nature of the \u201copen range doctrine\u201d law at issue, this Court also accepted numerous <em>amicus curiae </em>briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u00b620 By way of appeal and cross-appeal, both parties challenge the District Court\u2019s granting and denying motions for summary judgment during the proceedings below. Our review of the District Court\u2019s summary judgment rulings is governed by Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. Summary judgment is proper only where the record reveals a complete absence of genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P; <em>Clark v. Eagle Sys., Inc. </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 279, 283, 927 P.2d 995, 997. We scrutinize a trial court\u2019s ruling on a summary judgment motion <em>de novo, </em>utilizing the same evaluation as the district court based upon Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P. <em>Dorwart v. Caraway, </em>1998 MT 191, \u00b6 15, 290 Mont. 196, \u00b6 15, 966 P.2d 1121, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u00b621. Finally, this Court has held that issues of negligence are generally not susceptible to summary judgment and are properly left for a jury determination at trial. <em>Kolar v. Bergo </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 262, 266, 929 P.2d 867, 869.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b622 Our review of a directed verdict, which is granted pursuant to Rule 50(a), M.R.Civ.R, is governed by well-established principles. We consider only the evidence introduced by the party against whom the directed verdict is granted. <em>Riley v. American Honda Motor Co., Inc. </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 128, 131, 856 P.2d 196, 198. If that evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the party, tends to establish the case made by the party\u2019s pleading, we will reverse the directed verdict. <em>Riley, </em>259 Mont. at 131, 856 P.2d at 198 (citing <em>Boehm v. Alanon </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 373, 379, 722 P.2d 1160, 1163). The test commonly used to determine if the evidence is legally sufficient to withdraw cases and issues from the jury is whether reasonable persons could not draw different conclusions from the evidence. <em>Riley, </em>259 Mont. at 131, 856 P.2d at 198.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b623 We will affirm a district court\u2019s grant of a directed verdict, however, if the court\u2019s conclusion is correct; the reasons given by the court for granting the directed verdict are immaterial to our review. <em>Riley, </em>259 Mont. at 131, 856 P.2d at 198 <em>(citing Laurie v. M. &amp; L. Realty Corp. </em>(1972), 159 Mont. 404, 408, 498 P.2d 1192, 1194).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">\u00b624 Here, the District Court gave no reason for entering the directed verdict in favor of the Defendants. Nevertheless, we will review the evidence in the light most favorable to Larson-Murphy and determine whether it is sufficient for reasonable persons to draw different conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A0_\">\n<em>I. Introduction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\u00b625 This case involves a general misconception of the import of Montana\u2019s \u201copen range doctrine\u201d in matters involving the legal relationship between the owners of livestock and users of motor vehicles on Montana highways. In sum, the law governing the action below, as expressed by the District Court, can be summarized as follows: (1) if the accident occurred in an \u201copen range\u201d area, then the directed verdict was proper because the Steiners owed no legal duty to anyone to prevent their black bull from standing in the middle of Hoskin Road at night regardless of any foreseeable risk such an obstruction posed to passing motorists; or (2) if the accident <em>did not </em>occur within an open range area, then the action may proceed, because under the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>stances the Steiners conceivably owed a legal duty to motorists to prevent their bull from occupying and obstructing Hoskin Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">\u00b626  We conclude that as an expression of the prevailing law in Montana, the foregoing is incorrect. Namely, what has been termed the \u201cno duty rule\u201d under the open range doctrine does not apply to the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists traveling on this state\u2019s highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\u00b627  Nevertheless, we also conclude that the \u201claw of the open range remains the law of this state.\u201d <em>See State ex rel. Martin v. Finley </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 242, 245, 738 P.2d 497, 499. Further, we also conclude that the term \u201copen range\u201d includes all highways outside of private enclosures and used by the public, as provided under \u00a7 81-4-203, MCA, unless so modified by this state\u2019s Legislature. <em>See State ex rel. Martin, </em>227 Mont. at 244, 738 P.2d at 498 (stating that under \u00a7 81-4-203, MCA, \u201call highways in the state are included under the open range concept\u201d); \u00a7 81-4-306, MCA (proscribing livestock owners from willfully permitting livestock from running at large within any herd district); \u00a7 60-7-201 and 202, MCA (prohibiting livestock from grazing, remaining upon, or occupying certain state highways).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">\u00b628 Asa starting point in addressing the foregoing apparent contradictions, the terms \u201copen range\u201d and \u201copen range doctrine\u201d as they appear-in Montana statutes and interpretive case law have little or nothing at all to do with the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists under a theory of negligence. Simply stated: the assumption that a person\u2019s livestock may lawfully occupy \u2014 or \u201cwander\u201d upon \u2014 any public highway in an \u201copen range\u201d area of this state does not absolutely determine whether or not the owner owes a subsequent legal duty to motorists. Most motor vehicles may also lawfully occupy and roam public highways. In the absence of a governing statute addressing this legal relationship, however, neither enjoy blanket immunity from exercising ordinary care. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 27-1-701, MCA (providing that \u201c[ejxcept as otherwise provided by law, everyone is responsible not only for the results of his willful acts but also for Em injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property or person except so far as the latter has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought the injury upon himself\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">\u00b629 In contrast, under Montana\u2019s current open range doctrine, as expressed under our \u201cContainment of Livestock\u201d statutes, livestock owners owe no legal duty to <em>other landowners </em>to prevent their livestock, which may otherwise lawfully occupy the open range, from <em>accidentally </em>tres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>passing onto the other landowner\u2019s unfenced property \u2014 and no more. While this pronouncement may seem in direct conflict with clear enunciations of law issued by this Court <em>(see, e.g., Bartsch v. Irvine Co. </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 405, 427 P.2d 302), it is equally apparent that the underlying legal principles expressed by Montana\u2019s open range doctrine statutes have been misconstrued over time, and misapplied in the context of the specific legal relationship at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">\u00b630 As the parties here acknowledge, Larson-Murphy\u2019s negligence action may be maintained only if there was a legal duty or obligation that required the Defendants to conform to a particular standard of conduct in order to protect motorists, as foreseeable plaintiffs, against unreasonable risks of harm. <em>See generally Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release Services, Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 295 Mont. 416, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 986 P.2d 1081, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. The existence of a duty or obligation is a question of law to be determined by the court. <em>See Yager v. Deane </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 453, 456, 853 P.2d 1214, 1216. Finally, no immutable rule can be established to determine the extent of a legal duty or obligation for every circumstance of the future; rather, duty or obligation must necessarily be adjudicated upon a case-to-case basis. <em>See Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 362, 916 P.2d 122, <em>134 (quoting Mang v. Eliasson </em>(1969), 153 Mont. 431, 437-39, 458 P.2d 777, 781-82).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\u00b631 In turn, the question of duty is a \u201cproblem of the relation between individuals which imposes upon one a legal obligation for the benefit of the other.\u201d W. Page Keeton et. al., <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton on the Law of Torts, </em>\u00a7 53 (5th ed. 1984) (hereinafter <em>Prosser &amp; </em>Keeton). <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 291, comment f (stating that \u201c[s]ome relationship between the parties or some precedent action is necessary to create such a duty, and duties of positive action are not imposed except under circumstances in which normally the benefit to the other outweighs the burden to the actor\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZO\">\u00b632 Accordingly, a court\u2019s determination of legal duty in this instance must be tailored to the relationship of the particular parties: an owner of livestock whose bull escaped confinement and then wan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>dered onto and obstructed a county highway, and a motorist lawfully driving a vehicle on that same road. And therein lies the problem inherent within our current jurisprudence governing Montana\u2019s \u201copen range doctrine\u201d as the discussion below will address. Namely, no statute explicitly creates or absolves any legal duties particular to the parties here under the circumstances and yet, regrettably, this Court has set forth precedent that would seem to indicate the Montana Legislature, in codifying various tenets and modifications of the open range doctrine, have established such a comprehensive body of law. We conclude it has not.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b633 Thus, we proceed to our discussion of what is, and what is not, the law of this case before addressing the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">\n<em>II. Montana\u2019s Open Range Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">\n<em>A. The common law rule</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">\u00b634 In contrast to the \u201copen range doctrine\u201d in the American west, the English common law held the owner of livestock strictly liable for damages caused to another landowner\u2019s property as a result of a trespass. <em>See Monroe v. Cannon </em>(1900), 24 Mont. 316, 61 P. 863 (stating common law rule that an owner of cattle must answer in damages if they stray upon the land of another and \u201ctread down his neighbor\u2019s herbage, and spoil his corn or his trees\u201d); <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, </em>\u00a7 76 (stating that \u201c[tjhose who keep such animals for their own purposes are required to protect the community, at their peril, against the risk involved\u201d); Roy H. Andes, A <em>Triumph of Myth Over Principle: The Saga of the Montana Open-Range, </em>56 Mont.L.Rev. 485, 486 (1995) (explaining that the common law rule applies in most American jurisdictions, particularly in the eastern United States) (hereinafter <em>Andes).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">\u00b635 Pursuant to this strict liability theory, proving any degree of fault was unnecessary. Thus, the owner was liable regardless of whether the trespass resulted from pure accident or an intentional act. The principle that a livestock owner must \u201cfence-in\u201d or in some manner restrain his livestock to prevent such a trespass developed from this general common law rule. <em>See generally Thompson v. Mattuschek </em>(1959), 134 Mont. 500, 506, 333 P.2d 1022, 1025; <em>Andes, 56 </em>Mont.L.Rev. at 486.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">\n<em>B. Modification of the common law in the American west.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">\u00b636 As a modification of the foregoing common law rule, Montana\u2019s \u201copen range doctrine\u201d that took hold during this state\u2019s early territorial days in the 1800s exclusively applied to the legal relationship be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>tween landowners by redefining an aggrieved party\u2019s remedy for trespass.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b63 7 Under this doctrine, in order to hold a livestock owner strictly liable for trespass damages, a landowner carried the burden of establishing, as a condition precedent, that he had constructed a \u201clawful fence\u201d surrounding his entire property. <em>See Schreiner v. Deep Creek Stock Ass\u2019n </em>(1923), 68 Mont. 104, 110, 217 P. 663, 665. Otherwise, livestock could \u201croam\u201d onto private property and graze and water at will, and the aggrieved landowner could not recover damages for such a trespass. <em>See Smith v. Williams </em>(1874), 2 Mont. 195, 197, 202. From a pragmatic standpoint, the open range doctrine did nothing more than allocate the cost of constructing and maintaining a fence to landowners who wished to exclude livestock from their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">\u00b638 As explained by scholars and various courts over the years, the underlying reason for modifying the common law remedy as well as reassigning the cost burden \u2014 and providing livestock owners with what amounted to a trespass liability shield \u2014 was that the range cattle industry of the 19th century was based on the availability of unoccupied public domain, which as a matter of state and federal policy remained open for grazing purposes. <em>See </em>Valerie Weeks Scott, <em>The Range Cattle Industry: Its Effect on Western Land Law, </em>28 Mont.L.Rev. 155, 156, 178-81 (1967) (stating that a typical rancher in the late 1800s required between 2,000 and 50,000 acres of land upon which to graze his cattle) (hereinafter <em>Scott). </em>Scott\u2019s article quotes an early Colorado decision indicating the underlying policy of shifting the cost of fencing to landowners \u2014 namely farmers \u2014 who wished to exclude another person\u2019s livestock from their property:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Azd\">The commons are now owned principally by the State and by the general government, and if the grasses which grow thereon are not depastured, they will waste and decay.

It was from this particular relationship between landowners that the open range \u201cno-duty\u201d rule arose. <em>See, e.g., Beinhorn v.

As this Court stated in its pivotal decision, <em>Bartsch v. Irvine Co., </em>\u201c[w]hen Montana became a state, the policy of the open range continued, and the Legislature enacted various statutes <em>which dealt with trespass by livestock and the necessity of lawful fences to support any action for trespass.\u201d Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 408, 427 P.2d at 304 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b641 The Territorial statutes at issue in <em>Smith, </em>as the parties and <em>amici </em>thoroughly address, are in fact substantially the same as several of the statutes at issue here. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-101, MCA (defining legal fence),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA (imposing on \u201cowners of stock\u201d liability for all trespass damages resulting from livestock breaking into \u201cany enclosure\u201d if the \u201cfence of the enclosure is legal\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">\u00b642 Accordingly, the \u201clegal fence\u201d statutes did not create any affirmative duty to fence; rather, the open range \u201clegal fence\u201d statutes established only a standard of care for those landowners who chose to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>\u201cfence-out\u201d a livestock owner\u2019s animals. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-103, MCA (establishing liability for damages \u201cby reason of injury to stock\u201d in the event a fence not described in \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA, is defective); \u00a7 81-4-104, MCA (requiring that barbed wire fences be kept in repair so as not to injure livestock).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">\u00b643 Hence, the custom that a landowner must bear the financial burden of \u201cfencing-out\u201d his neighbor\u2019s cattle in order to recover damages \u2014 rather than requiring the livestock owner to bear the far more onerous cost of \u201cfencing-in\u201d his herd \u2014 became the statutory doctrine of Montana and other western states in determining liability for trespass. <em>See, e.g., Smith, </em>2 Mont. at 197, 202 (holding that the \u201clawful fence\u201d statute must be substantially complied with \u201cbefore a right of action accrues,\u201d and stating that the action was \u201cin the nature of trespass ... to recover damages,\u201d after the defendant\u2019s cattle broke and entered the farm or inclosure of the plaintiff, and destroyed his grain crop) (Wade, C.J., writing for the Court). <em>See also Fant v.

In Montana, the modification followed a U.S. Supreme Court decision, <em>Lazarus v. Phelps, </em>which arose in Texas. The <em>Lazarus </em>decision essentially waived the \u201cfence-out\u201d condition precedent in cases where the trespass was intentional, reasoning that the open range doctrine applied narrowly only to those trespasses that were accidental \u2014 where livestock merely followed the inherent instinct to seek food and water. <em>See Lazarus, </em>152 U.S. at 85, 14 S.Ct. at 478. <em>See also Fant, </em>9 Mont. at 61-62, 22 P. at 120-21 (indicating that willful or malicious herding of sheep onto plaintiff\u2019s land by owner would exempt plaintiff from lawful fence requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b647 This narrowing of the doctrine was followed by this Court in 1900, in <em>Monroe v. Cannon </em>(1900), 24 Mont. 316, 61 P. 863. In that case, it was undisputed that the plaintiff\u2019s land was not fenced. Nevertheless, the Court affirmed the plaintiff\u2019s right to recovery for damages where the defendant had willfully or maliciously herded his sheep onto the plaintiff\u2019s land. <em>See Monroe, </em>24 Mont. at 324-26, 61 P. at 865-66 (following <em>Lazarus v. Phelps, </em>and distinguishing <em>Smith v. Williams </em>and <em>Fant v. Lyman).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">\u00b648 Thus, at the start of the 20th century in Montana, livestock trespasses resulting from willful, malicious, or even negligent conduct by the livestock owner followed the English common law rule and waived the lawful fence requirement, leaving only purely accidental livestock trespasses under the open range doctrine, which required a lawful fence in order to recover damages. <em>See, e.g., Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305 (providing that \u201cwillful or intentional herding or driving of livestock onto another\u2019s unfenced land or placing them so near that trespass is bound to occur\u201d is an exception to the open range doctrine) (quoting <em>Montgomery v.

Story </em>(1927), 78 Mont. 477, 493, 254 P. 427, 432 (stating that \u201cwhen cattle are in the public highway, in charge of a person directing or controlling their movements, they are not \u2018running at large\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">\u00b650 The foregoing statutes are accompanied by penalties, including monetary fines, liability for damages \u201cto any party injured by the violation,\u201d castration of the offending animal, and even killing of the offending animal. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 81-4-202,207,208,209 and 212, MCA. Thus, any trespass resulting from the intentional act of permitting such animals to run at large waives the \u201cfence-out\u201d condition precedent of the open range doctrine. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-217, MCA (allowing retention of \u201cwrongfully\u201d trespassing animal as well as those breaking through legal fences); \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA (providing that \u201c[t]his section may not be construed to require a legal fence in order to maintain an action for injury done by animals running at large contrary to law).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b651 Further, the monetary penalty under \u00a7 81-4-202, MCA, as well as the \u201cdamages to any party injured\u201d language expanded the scope of the open range doctrine to provide a benefit for the general public, not just a landowner who suffers damages as a result of a trespass. Nevertheless, the conduct proscribed under \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-201, 204, 210 and 211, MCA, is explicitly intentional. Thus, an accidental escape of one of the animals identified under these statutes from an owner\u2019s premises is not a <em>per se </em>violation. As made clear by this Court in <em>Monroe, </em>and the U.S. Supreme Court in <em>Lazarus, </em>the open range doctrine, as a modification of the common law, never included intentional conduct. <em>See Monroe, </em>24 Mont. at 324-26, 61 P. at 865-66.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b652 Finally, liberally construing Part 2 of our \u201cContainment of Livestock\u201d statutes as a whole, it is clear that \u201copen range\u201d includes \u201call highways\u201d or \u201cpublic highways\u201d that pass through open range areas. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-203, MCA (providing that the term \u201copen range\u201d includes \u201call lands in the state of Montana not enclosed by a fence of not less than two wires in good repair\u201d as well as \u201call highways outside of pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>vate enclosures and used by the public\u201d);<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u00a7 81-4-210, MCA (providing that non-purebred bulls, and all bulls between December 1 and June 1 shall not be turned upon or allowed to run at large on \u201cpublic highways, open range, or national forest reserve\u201d within the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b653 Even so, we conclude that these statutes offer no clear enunciation of any explicit legal duty owed by livestock owners to motorists beyond the inferential duty to not intentionally permit certain animals to occupy highways, which does not include negligent conduct. Therefore, the \u201crunning at large\u201d statutes, under a negligence theory, at the most establish a different standard of care for owners of certain livestock from that required in open range areas: in open range, certain animals may be lawfully permitted to occupy highways, and other animals may hot. Again, the only clear legal duty addressed by the foregoing is that between livestock owners and landowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">C. <em>Exclusion of statutory herd districts</em></p>\n<p id=\"A21\">\u00b654 Under Part 3 of Montana\u2019s Containment of Livestock statutes, the Montana Legislature has permitted landowners to exempt a particular area of land from the open range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-301, MCA (stating requirements for herd district creation); \u00a7 81-4-322, MCA (stating requirements for horse herd districts). This exemption is not absolute; such a district maybe in effect for only certain months of the year. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-305, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"AS\">\u00b655 Critical to our discussion is the fact that the term \u201cfence\u201d (legal or otherwise) does not appear once under this Part in any form, nor did the Legislature include any reference to highways and motorists. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 81-4-301 through 328, MCA. Further, aside from the horse herd district statutes, the more general herd district laws prohibit only willful acts. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-306, MCA (providing penalty to owner who \u201cwillfully permits the animals to run at large\u201d).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>See also Jenkins v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number><em>Valley Garden Ranch, Inc. </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 463, 466-67, 443 P.2d 753, 755 (equating \u201cwillfully\u201d with \u201cpurposely or knowingly\u201d and concluding that escaped cattle did not result from willful act). Thus, similar to \u00a7 81-4-201 through 220, MCA, the herd district statutes do not explicitly contemplate that a livestock owner whose animal accidentally escapes from the owner\u2019s premises commits a <em>per se </em>violation of the statute, or that livestock may lawfully occupy roads within herd districts under the care of herders.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">\u00b656 In light of these omissions, and of particular relevance to the action here, this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Williams v. Selstad </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 137, 766 P.2d 247, addressed whether herd districts under \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-301 through 328, MCA, provided an exception to Montana\u2019s open range doctrine. Specifically, the Court addressed whether the statutes imposed a duty on livestock owners to keep livestock from \u201cwandering onto the roadway within the herd district.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 139, 766 P.2d at 248. Ultimately, we held that the \u201cLegislature did not intend to change the open range no-duty rules through enactment of the herd district statutes.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 141, 766 P.2d at 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b657 This holding, however, was premised on the assumption that \u201cthe open range doctrine relieves owners or possessors of livestock of a duty to keep their livestock from wandering onto the roadway,\u201d which in turn inferentially applied the \u201cno duty\u201d standard to livestock owners whose animals are involved with accidents with motorists. <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 138, 766 P.2d at 247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u00b658 With the enactment of herd district statutes, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 81-4-301 through 328, MCA, the open range doctrine rule that livestock may follow their instincts, and freely wander in search of food and water, came to an end once such a district was created. If owners of livestock are statutorily proscribed from permitting their animals to \u201crun at large,\u201d then the notion that the owner of livestock \u201chas no duty to prevent the livestock from wandering\u201d no longer exists. <em>Compare </em>\u00a7 81-4-306, MCA (prohibiting any livestock owner from \u201cwillfully\u201d permitting animals to run at large within herd district) <em>with Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305 (stating that an owner of livestock has no duty to prevent livestock from wandering in open range country). In turn, if the open range includes \u201call highways outside private enclosures used by the public,\u201d as we have already concluded, then highways passing through herd districts are no longer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>part of the open range, as a matter of law, during those periods when the herd district is in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b659 Again, there is no express broadening of the underlying legal relationship that the open range doctrine addresses: livestock owners and landowners. Rather, as a matter of law, herd districts are no longer \u201copen range,\u201d and therefore the open range \u201cfence-out\u201d rule is no longer required to maintain an action for trespass, which ostensibly returns such districts to the common law trespass rule during those periods when they are in effect. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-307, MCA (entitled \u201cTrespassing animals in herd districts\u201d and permitting the owner of premises \u201cwrongfully\u201d entered by animals referred to in \u00a7 81-4-306, MCA, to recover damages and costs, with no mention of legal fence requirement).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u00b660 Thus, the Court in <em>Williams </em>correctly stated that the herd district statutes \u201cwere intended only to protect landowners and owners of livestock.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 140, 766 P.2d at 248. In turn, the Court also was correct in its conclusion that it was not clear whether \u201cMontana\u2019s Legislature intended to create a duty owed to motorists through enactment of the herd district statutes,\u201d <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 140, 766 P.2d at 248, and thus such a duty may not be judicially \u201cinserted\u201d by this Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA. The Court incorrectly assumed, however, that the open range doctrine\u2019s \u201cno duty\u201d rule that applied exclusively to livestock owners and landowners inferentially applied to the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists \u2014 an assumption that the statutes simply fail to address.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b661  Therefore, we overrule <em>Williams v. Selstad </em>to the extent that it holds that the open range doctrine \u201cno duty\u201d rule may be applied to the legal relationship between livestock owners within a herd district and motorists traveling on herd district highways. We further hold, however, that the herd district statutes, similar to the \u201crunning at large\u201d statutes discussed above, do not establish an explicit legal duty owed by livestock owners to motorists beyond the inferential duty to not intentionally permit certain animals to run at large within the districts \u2014 which, again, does not include negligent conduct. Rather, we conclude that the herd district statutes \u2014 like the running at large statutes \u2014 establish a different standard of care for owners of livestock from that found in open range areas: in open range, certain animals may be lawfully permitted to occupy highways, in herd districts none may be lawfully permitted to \u201crun at large\u201d on highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\n<em>D. Exclusion of statutorily designated state highways.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b662 Similar to the \u201crunning at large\u201d and herd district statutes, our Legislature in 1951 removed certain state highways from the open range \u2014 again, without invoking any explicit statutory duties arising from the legal relationship of livestock owners and motorists. The Legislature merely made it unlawful for livestock owners to use certain U.S. and state highways as a \u201cplace for the pasturage or running of livestock.\u201d <em>See </em>Ch. 95, L. 1951. Codified under \u00a7\u00a7 32-1018-1020, RCM, the statutes were originally inserted under the \u201cobstructions and encroachments\u201d chapter of the Highways, Bridges and Ferries statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b663 Unlike the \u201crunning at large\u201d and herd district statutes, however, traffic safety on such highways can reasonably be presumed as one of the purposes of what would eventually become \u00a7\u00a7 60-7-201 through 205, MCA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, there was never an explicit legal duty, or a standard of liability, ascribed to livestock owners that was owed to motorists. <em>See and </em>compare, <em>e.g., </em>\u00a7 49-4-216, MCA (describing duty and civil liability of pedestrian or driver approaching blind person); \u00a7 61-5-108, MCA (describing liability of minors imputed to parents under motor vehicles statute); \u00a7 61-6-201, MCA (describing liability of owner for negligence of employee driver); \u00a7 61-7-106, MCA (describing duty of a driver of any vehicle which collides with any vehicle which is unattended); \u00a7 61-7-107, MCA (describing duty of driver of any vehicle involved in an accident upon striking fixtures or other property upon a highway); \u00a7 61-8-384, MCA (describing liability of operator of a vehicle in a funeral procession).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b664 Moreover, as originally codified, a violation occurred only if the livestock owner acted \u201cwilfully\u201d which first required that 24-hours\u2019 written notice be given to the owner by a peace officer informing the owner of the presence of his animals on the highway, or a finding that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>the owner \u201chabitually permits such use of such highway by livestock.\u201d <em>See </em>Ch. 95, L. 1951. Otherwise, as originally conceived, there was no immediate legal duty owed by livestock owners to other highway users; rather, livestock could occupy a fenced highway traveled by motorist up until written notice was provided, or the livestock\u2019s presence on a highway was deemed \u201chabitual.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b665 Today, \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA, is far less lenient. An owner oflivestock now may not lawfully permit his livestock to graze, remain upon, or occupy a part of the right-of-way of:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">(1) a state highway running through cultivated areas or a part of the fenced right-of-way of a state highway if in either case the highway has been designated by agreement between the transportation commission and the secretary of transportation as a part of the national system of interstate and defense highways; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">(2) a state highway designated by agreement between the transportation commission and the secretary of transportation as apart of the federal-aid primary system, except as provided in 60-7-202.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Under this statute, this Court has held that livestock owners in Montana may now be found \u201cliable for negligent rather than wilful conduct which results in the presence of their cattle on the right-of-ways,\u201d but cannot be held strictly liable. <em>Ambrogini v. Todd </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 111, 120, 642 P.2d 1013, 1018 (construing the term \u201cpermit\u201d subsequent to a legislative amendment that excised the term \u201cwilful\u201d). Nevertheless, the Legislature expressly provided that even if a livestock owner violates \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA, \u201cthere is no presumption or inference that the collision was due to negligence on the part of the owner or the person in possession of the livestock or the driver or owner of the vehicle.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 60-7-203, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b666 Further, under \u00a7 60-7-202, MCA, the prohibitions of \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA, do not apply to the following: (1) livestock on state highways under the charge of one or more herders; (2) the parts of fenced highways adjacent to open range where a highway device has not been installed to exclude range livestock; and (3) the parts of a state highway or a part of the federal-aid primary system which the department of transportation designates as being impracticable to exclude livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u00b667 In <em>Ambrogini, </em>this Court determined that because none of the foregoing exceptions applied to the facts, the livestock owner, Todd, had a \u201clegal duty to exercise due care in preventing his livestock from wandering on Highway <em>10.\" Ambrogini, </em>197 Mont. at 121, 642 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>1019. After reviewing the facts of the livestock\u2019s escape from the defendant\u2019s premises, we further concluded that \u201c[t]he reasonableness of Todd\u2019s conduct is for a jury to decide\u201d and therefore reversed the district court\u2019s summary judgment in his favor. <em>Ambrogini, </em>197 Mont. at 121, 642 P.2d at 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b668  Thus, under the explicit terms of the foregoing statutes, an owner of livestock may not permit his livestock to freely wander on certain clearly defined state highways that, prior to enactment, may once have been part of the open range. Nevertheless, under certain circumstances, livestock may lawfully occupy such highways without violating the \u201cgrazing of livestock on highways\u201d statutes. Accordingly, establishing a standard of reasonable care for livestock owners in their legal relationship with motorists on such highways is a fact-driven, circumstance-specific inquiry that is merely assisted by a proven violation of \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\n<em>E. Summary of exclusions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">\u00b669 Therefore, even with the various judicial and statutory modifications providing exceptions and exclusions, Montana\u2019s open range doctrine remains true to its original purpose from the 1874 <em>Smith </em>decision forward until 1967: to determine the rights and remedies arising from the relationship of livestock owners and landowners in actions involving the accidental trespass on private property of livestock lawfully occupying the open range. Although our Legislature statutorily altered the common law rule regarding trespass to fit the conditions of this state, and has subsequently from time to time modified these laws, it has not similarly addressed the common law rule regarding the duty, or lack of duty, owed by livestock owners to the users of public highways in Montana other than within the narrow scope of \u00a7\u00a7 60-7-201 through 203, MCA, as addressed in <em>Ambrogini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQx\">\u00b670 We conclude, therefore, that any assertion of legal duties arising from the legal relationship between the owners of livestock and motorists is clearly beyond the scope of Montana\u2019s statutory \u201copen range doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\n<em>I V. Bartsch and Indendi reconsidered</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b148-9\">\u00b671 Until fairly recently, Montana\u2019s \u201copen range doctrine,\u201d pursuant to all relevant statutes discussed thus far, applied exclusively to the legal relationship between landowners in actions involving the accidental trespass of livestock that lawfully run at large on the open range.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u00b672 This course was altered, however, by two of this Court\u2019s decisions, <em>Bartsch v. Irvine Co. </em>(1967), 149 Mont. 405, 427 P.2d 302, and <em>Indendi v. Workman </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 64, 899 P.2d 1085. <em>Bartsch </em>was the first decision that looked to the open range doctrine to determine whether or not a livestock owner owed a legal duty to a motorist driving on highways passing through open range, after a motorist brought an action for negligence following a fatal vehicle accident involving the defendant\u2019s horse. Likewise, <em>Indendi </em>considered whether the open range doctrine statutes governing a \u201clegal fence\u201d could be applied to livestock owners under a theory of negligence <em>per se, </em>in a case that also involved an accident between a vehicle and a horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b673 We conclude that in light of the foregoing discussion, as well as the arguments set forth by the parties and <em>amici, </em>both decisions must be reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\n<em>A. Bartsch v. Irvine Co.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b674 The Court in <em>Bartsch </em>accurately recounted the history of open range trespass case law. <em>See Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 407-409, 427 P.2d at 304-305. The <em>Bartsch </em>Court first cited the 1874 decision <em>Smith v. Williams, </em>and stated that the action was \u201cbrought for damages due to the trespass of cattle on plaintiff\u2019s land.\u201d Next, the Court cited the 1902 decision <em>Beinhorn v. Griswold, </em>and stated that in that case \u201cthe doctrine of open range was further discussed and explained in another trespass action.\u201d The Court then cited to the 1923 case, <em>Schreiner v. Deep Creek Stock Ass\u2019n, </em>and referred to it as \u201canother trespass action.\u201d Next, a 1959 case, <em>Thompson v. Mattuschek, </em>was cited for the proposition that \u201cin range country [livestock] may wander.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>was a trespass action brought after the defendant\u2019s cattle damaged the plaintiff\u2019s barley crop. Finally, the Court cited <em>Montgomery v. Gehring, </em>a 1965 decision involving a boundary dispute between private landowners where the open range doctrine was raised. The excerpted quote from <em>Montgomery </em>included the open range doctrine rule that \u201c[o]ne releasing his livestock onto lands where he has a right to do so is under no duty to restrain them from entering <em>another\u2019s unenclosed land.\u201d Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305 (quoting <em>Montgomery v. Gehring </em>(1965), 145 Mont. 278, 283, 400 P.2d 403, 406) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">\u00b675 Omitting the operative terms \u201canother\u2019s unenclosed land,\u201d the <em>Bartsch </em>Court then reasoned that because the owner of livestock owed no general duty to \u201cprevent the livestock from wandering .... he cannot be said to be negligent if the livestock do wander \u2014 even if such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>wandering takes them onto a highway right of way which runs through open range.\u201d <em>Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305. In reaching this conclusion, not once did the Court refer to any of the open range doctrine statutes. Further, the Court did not cite to any other western-state jurisdiction\u2019s case law that had similarly extended the open range trespass doctrine to the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists, under similar state laws. <em>See, e.g., Kendall v. Curl </em>(Or. 1960), 353 P.2d 227, 231 (concluding that \u201c[i]f cattle and horses have a right to be on the road [in open range areas], their owner is not negligent in allowing them on the road\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AI2\">\u00b676 Subsequently, a series of decisions addressing and applying the open range doctrine to the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists followed. <em>See Jenkins v. Valley Garden Ranch, Inc. </em>(1968), 151 Mont. 463, 443 P.2d 753; <em>Sanders v. Mount Haggin Livestock Co. </em>(1972), 160 Mont. 73, 500 P.2d <em>397; Ambrogini v. Todd </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 111, 642 P.2d 1013; <em>Siegfried v. Atchison </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 14, 709 P.2d 1006; <em>State ex rel. Martin v. Finley </em>(1987), 227 Mont. 242, 738 P.2d 497; <em>Williams v. Selstad </em>(1988), 235 Mont. 137, 766 P.2d 247; <em>Yager v. Deane </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 453, 853 P.2d <em>1214; Indendi v. Workman </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 64, 899 P.2d 1085. <em>But see Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 141, 766 P.2d at 249 (Sheehy, J., dissenting) (stating that for their purposes, \u201clivestock containment laws have a valid application; for torts not related to their purposes, the livestock containment laws should be disregarded and the ordinary rules of negligence laws should apply\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b677 <em>Amicus </em>Montana Stock Growers Association urges this Court to recognize the rule that this Court \u201cmay not substitute its judgment for that of Legislature.\u201d <em>See Bay v. Department of Admin. </em>(1984), 212 Mont. 258, 265, 688 P.2d 1, 4 (stating that it is \u201cthe province of courts to construe and apply the law as they find it and to maintain its integrity as it has been written by a coordinate branch of the state government\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b678 We agree. Substituting its judgment for that of the Legislature is precisely what the Court in <em>Bartsch </em>accomplished by ignoring the fundamental purpose of Montana\u2019s open range doctrine by taking a statutory body of law that pertains to one particular legal relationship and applying it to another that the statutes involved simply do not address, and, consequently, inserting an expansive \u201cno-duty\u201d rule that, to this date, has been omitted from any legislation. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1-2-101, MCA (stating that \u201c[i]n the construction of a statute, the office of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or to omit what has been inserted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b679  We therefore overrule our decision in <em>Bartsch </em>\u2014 as well as subsequent decisions that followed <em>Bartsch </em>\u2014 to the extent that it holds that a livestock owner, pursuant to Montana\u2019s \u201copen range doctrine,\u201d owes absolutely no duty to motorists driving on public highways in open range areas. <em>See Yager, </em>258 Mont. at 458, 853 P.2d at 1217; <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 139-40, 766 P.2d at 248; <em>State ex rel.

Indendi v. Workman</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">\u00b680 In our 1995 decision, <em>Indendi v. Workman, </em>the injured driver, Indendi, brought a negligence claim against the owners of a horse with which she had collided. It was undisputed that the highway in question was part of the federal-aid primary system, and therefore subject to \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA, as well as our decision in <em>Ambrogini.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">\u00b681 The district court had determined that the owners of the horse, the Workmans, fell under the statutory exclusion, \u00a7 60-7-202(2), MCA, which provides that the general proscription of permitting livestock to occupy such highways does not apply to \u201cthe parts of fenced highways adjacent to open range where a highway device has not been installed to exclude range livestock.\u201d The court concluded that although the Workmans\u2019 horse had been confined within a fenced pasture, their ranch nevertheless was \u201copen range,\u201d and therefore they owed no duty to prevent the horse from occupying the highway. <em>See Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 67, 899 P.2d at 1087.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">\u00b682 We concluded that the factual statements in the court\u2019s memorandum and order were not substantiated by the record. <em>See Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 69, 899 P.2d at 1088. We concluded that the directed verdict entered in favor of the Workmans was therefore inappropriate because pursuant to the exception under subsection (2) of \u00a7 60-7-202, MCA, there was no evidence that the highway in question was fenced, and that the area adjacent to the highway was, as a matter of law, open range. <em>Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 69-70, 899 P.2d at 1088-89.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\u00b683 After properly reaching this conclusion, and requiring a remand, we then moved into a negligence <em>per se </em>analysis based on Indendi\u2019s contention that the Workmans had not constructed a \u201clegal fence\u201d around their property in accordance with \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>explained by the Court, one of the key criteria for establishing a negligence <em>per se </em>claim based on the violation of a statute is that the statute was enacted to protect a specific class of persons, and the plaintiff is a member of that class. <em>See Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 72, 899 P.2d at 1090 (quoting negligence <em>per se </em>test from <em>VanLuchene v. State </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 397, 401, 797 P.2d 932, 935). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">It is apparent that the. whole purpose for the legislature\u2019s requiring fences to be constructed in a certain manner is to insure, to the extent possible, that livestock not on open range are adequately confined and are not free to roam and to cause harm to persons and property or to breed with the livestock of others. <em>There could be no other purpose for that sort of legislation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><em>Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 72, 899 P.2d at 1090 (emphasis added). Based on this assumption, we then stated that \u201cit is reasonable to conclude that the legislature ... recognizes the reality that one of the purposes of a legal fence is to keep livestock off the roadways of this state.\u201d <em>Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 72, 899 P.2d at 1090 (addressing \u00a7 81-4-102, MCA, a 1933 amendment, which allows a cattle guard exemption to the legal fence requirement of \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA). <em>But see Ambrogini, </em>197 Mont. at 118, 642 P.2d at 1017 (stating that \u00a7 81-4-102, MCA, merely provides that an auto pass will not make an otherwise legal fence illegal). We reasoned that because \u201c\u00a7 81-4-101, MCA, was enacted to require the containment of livestock by means of a \u2018legal fence\u2019 and, thereby, to prevent, among other harm, livestock/vehicle accidents, Indendi presented evidence that the Workmans violated the statute by failing to constructs legal fence.\u201d <em>Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 73, 899 P.2d at 1090.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b684 As addressed above, the purpose of the legal fence statutes, as indicated by \u00a7 81-4-215, MCA, was to <em>exclude </em>not <em>confine </em>livestock, and applies strictly to the legal relationship between livestock owners and landowners who wish to establish the condition precedent necessary to sustain a trespass action. Based on a clearly erroneous premise, we again substituted our judgment for that of the Legislature by inserting a statutory duty that simply did not exist, and by further establishing that the legal fence statutes established motorists as a \u201cclass of person\u201d that the statutes supposedly were enacted to protect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b685  Thus, we conclude that \u00a7 80-4-101, MCA, which defines a \u201clegal fence,\u201d and \u00a7\u00a7 80-4-103 and 104, MCA, which establish liability for defective fences, do not mandate any statutory duty on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>livestock owners in this state to \u201cfence-in\u201d their animals or otherwise maintain fences, and thus overrule <em>Indendi v. Workman </em>to the extent it holds that a violation of \u00a7 80-4-101, MCA, may serve as a basis for a finding of negligence <em>per se </em>with regard to an injury to a motorist or passenger traveling on a highway. Thus, Larson-Murphy\u2019s argument to the District Court and here that Zancanella\u2019s fence, which the Steiners were obligated to maintain, was \u201clegally defective\u201d due to the fact it violated the \u201clegal fence statute\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\n<em>V. Livestock owner\u2019s common law duty to highway users</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">\u00b686 Seemingly at odds with the historical common law trespass rule \u2014 that an owner of livestock is strictly liable for damages caused to another landowner \u2014 is the companion historical common law rule that on a highway, an animal is not a trespasser, and therefore there is no strict liability for any harm which it may cause to other highway users. Under the common law, as expressed by the House of Lords in a comprehensive 1947 decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b153-6\">An underlying principle of the law of the highway is that all those lawfully using the highway, or land adjacent to it, must show mutual respect and forbearance. The motorists must put up with the farmer\u2019s cattle: the farmer must endure the motorist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b153-7\"><em>Searle v. Wallbank </em>[1947] 1 L.R.App.Cas. 341, 361 (L. du Parcq, concurring). <em>See also Andes, </em>56 Mont.L.Rev. at 492 (discussing \u201cpublic ways\u201d exception); <em>Prosser &amp; Keeton, </em>\u00a7 76 (stating that on the highway itself, \u201ceven an escaped animal is not a trespasser, and there is no strict liability for any harm which it may do upon that basis\u201d); <em>Kendall v. Curl </em>(Or. 1960), 353 P.2d 227, 230 (citing <em>Searle). </em>The common law exception to this rule involved cases only where the animal was known by the owner to have a dangerous propensity or trait that was not characteristic of a domestic animal of like kind. <em>See Prosser &amp; Keeton, </em>\u00a7 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">\u00b687 Thus, at common law, on the one hand a livestock owner may have a legal duty to restrain his livestock to prevent harm to his neighbor\u2019s crops, but has no similar duty to restrain his livestock to prevent them from \u201cusing\u201d a highway \u2014 even though the animal may have escaped the very restraint intended to prevent harm to the neighbor. This apparent contradiction is reconciled by the historical context of the common law as it developed: neither cost-efficient fencing such as barbed wire, nor motor vehicles were a feature of rural England prior to the 20th century. The rural road system, in fact, developed in correlation to markets where livestock were routinely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>herded, and a rural traveler\u2019s common mode of transportation was either on foot or by horse: <em>See generally Searle, </em>1 L.RApp.Cas. at 345-353.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b688 The foregoing \u201cmutual respect and forbearance\u201d rule of common law was never codified in Montana under its open range doctrine statutes, nor has it been expressed, or referenced to, or in any clear manner discussed by our Legislature or this Court in the context of the legal relationship and duties between livestock owners and motorists on Montana highways.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">\u00b689 In contrast, other western states\u2019 legislatures have clearly adopted and incorporated this common law rule into their respective open range doctrines. <em>See </em>Idaho Code \u00a7 25-2118 (stating that \u201c[n]o person owning, or controlling the possession of, any domestic animal running on open range, shall have the duty to keep such animal off any highway on such range, and shall not be liable for damage to any vehicle or for injury to any person riding therein, caused by a collision between the vehicle and the animal\u201d); Nev. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 568.360(1) (stating that \u201c[n]o person, firm or corporation owning, controlling or in possession of any domestic animal running on open range has the duty to keep the animal off any highway traversing or located on the open range, and no such person, firm or corporation is liable for damages to any property or for injury to any person caused by any collision between a motor vehicle and the animal occurring on such a highway\u2019); N.M.State. Ann. \u00a7 66-7-363(0 (providing that \u201c[ojwners of livestock ranging in pastures through which unfenced roads or highways pass shall not be liable for damages by reason of injury or damage to persons or property occasioned by collisions of vehicles using said roads and highways and livestock or animals ranging in said pastures unless such owner of livestock is guilty of specific negligence other than allowing his animals to range in said pasture\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">\u00b690 Our Legislature, meanwhile, has only incidentally modified the concept of the common law \u201cpublic way\u201d rule by restricting certain kinds of animals from running at large in certain areas that include highways, and from restricting animals from certain kinds of highways. Thus, we have no express statutory affirmation or modification or complete abrogation of the common law rule governing the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists as equal, lawful users of highways in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">\u00b691 As previously addressed, in Montana, pursuant to \u00a7 1-1-108, MCA, where the law is not declared by statute, the common law shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>be the law and rule of the decision. We have also held that the term \u201ccommon law\u201d also means \u201cthat body of jurisprudence as applied and modified by the courts of this country up to the time it became a rule of decision in this <em>commoxweaNh\u201d Aetna Accident &amp; Liab. Co. v. Miller </em>(1918), 54 Mont. 377, 382, 170 P. 760. Furthermore, in <em>Nehring v. LaCounte, </em>(1986), 219 Mont. 462, 712 P.2d 1329, we declared that where \u201c[e]urrent conditions in Montana are such that the literal application of the common law rule has become unjust,\u201d we may judicially adopt a standard against which negligence or due care can be measured. <em>See Nehring, </em>219 Mont. at 469, 712 P.2d at 1334 (citing statutory maxim under \u00a7 1-3-201, MCA, that \u201c[w]hen the reasons of a rule ceases, so should the rule itself\u2019).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b692 Thus, we first turn to \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA, encoded in 1895, which provides the general standard against which negligence or due care can be measured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">Except as otherwise provided by law, everyone is responsible not only for the results of his willful acts but also for an injury occasioned to another by his want of ordinary care or skill in the management of his property or person except so far as the latter has willfully or by want of ordinary care brought the injury upon himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">Further, our Legislature (also in 1895) has provided that \u201c[ejvery person is bound, without contract, to abstain from injuring the person or property of another or infringing upon any of his rights.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-1-201, MCA. In the absence of an express statute, it is from these foregoing general rules that the duty in this instant case must be derived.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u00b693  With these general principles in mind, we next observe that we need not judicially adopt an entirely new standard to meet the current conditions. Rather, our case law already provides that where two parties have an equal right to use a public highway, each must use it so as not to injuriously interfere with the other\u2019s right, and each must exercise a degree of care commensurate with the danger of the agency that he himself is using. <em>See Franck v. Hudson </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 480, 484-85, <em>373 P.2d 951, 953; Sztaba v. Great Northern Ry. Co. </em>(1966), 147 Mont. 185, 197, 411 P.2d 379, 386, <em>overruled in part by Kyriss v.

In <em>Sztaba </em>we concluded that \u201c[bjoth the railroad and the motoring public have an equal right to the use of a crossing.\u201d <em>Sztaba, </em>147 Mont. at 197, 411 P.2d at 386. In <em>Hightower, </em>we likewise concluded that in Montana, a pedestrian and a motorist have equal rights in the use of a public highway. <em>Hightower, </em>132 Mont. at 355, 318 P.2d at 247 (stating that a pedestrian must use ordinary care for his own safety). Finally, in <em>Fulton, </em>we stated that this rule applies to all \u201cother persons lawfully using the highway.\u201d <em>Fulton, </em>98 Mont. at 64, 37 P.2d at 1030 (stating that the \u201cdriver of an automobile certainly, in case of a breakdown, a collision, or other accident, if he exercises reasonable care, may use the highway for the purpose of inspection, or repair in case his car is unable to proceed, or may render assistance to another on the highway\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b696  Thus, because both a livestock owner and a motorist may have an equal right to lawfully occupy a highway in an \u201copen range\u201d area, or, to a limited extent, within a herd district under \u00a7 81-4-306, MCA, or designated state highway under \u00a7 60-7-201, MCA, we hold that both owe each other a legal duty to use such roads so as not to injuriously interfere with the other\u2019s right of use. Accordingly, ascertaining the precise standard of care each owes the other is a fact-driven question that must be viewed in light of the circumstances under which the harm occurs. <em>See Lopez v. Great Falls Pre-Release </em>Services, <em>Inc., </em>1999 MT 199, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 295 Mont. 416, \u00b6\u00b6 27-28, 986 P.2d 1081, \u00b6\u00b6 <em>27-28; Ambrogini, </em>197 Mont. at 120, 642 P.2d at 1019 (stating that reasonableness of livestock owner was for jury to decide).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">\u00b697 Obviously, in Montana such a determination involves a broad spectrum of circumstances. As observed by <em>amici, </em>\u201copen range\u201d encompasses remote, seldom traveled unpaved highways where no fences at all restrain livestock, as well \u00e1s heavily fenced areas traversed by high levels of traffic on paved roads near dense population centers where livestock customarily have no cause to be herded or otherwise occupy the highway for the purpose of grazing or seeking water.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">\u00b698 Accordingly, the duty owed to motorists by an owner of a black Angus bull, which is standing in the middle of a highway at night in harm\u2019s way, conceivably may be no different than that owed by an owner of a vehicle who permits his or her vehicle to remain in harm\u2019s way in the middle of the same highway, under the same circumstances. In both instances, each has a legal right to use the highway. Yet both must act in a reasonable manner under the circumstances, and failure to do so may constitute negligence on his or her part. <em>See, e.g., Morton v. Mooney </em>(1934), 97 Mont. 1, 8, 33 P.2d 262, 264 (stating that if a car becomes disabled, \u201cthe motorist should employ due diligence to remove it from the highway within a reasonable time, but, in the absence of any showing of lack of diligence, the mere fact that a disabled car is standing on the highway does not constitute actionable negligence\u201d). <em>See also Carrow v. Lusby </em>(Az. 1990), 804 P.2d 747, 754 (applying duty of ordinary care to livestock owners and stating that \u201cin open range territory, the mere failure to prevent one\u2019s cattle from entering the highway, by erecting fences or otherwise, does not constitute conduct falling below the standard of care required of livestock owners\u201d); <em>Shively v. Dye Creek Cattle Co. </em>(Cal.Ct.App. 1994), 35 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 238, 244 (applying duty of ordinary care to livestock owners and stating that \u201cagainst the backdrop of the \u2018open range\u2019 law, the duty of ordinary care in this context does not contemplate extreme preventive measures\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b699 In accordance with the foregoing we now turn, at last, to the issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">\n<em>VI. Issues presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\n<em>1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Zancanella?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">\u00b6100 The District Court, in its January 6,1997 Order, dismissed Zancanella from the action based on the conclusion that he did not have the duty to either keep the Steiners\u2019 bull off the highway in question, or maintain any fence on the property leased to the Steiners.</p>\n<p id=\"Ar2\">\u00b6101 Larson-Murphy\u2019s argument on appeal rests primarily on the contention that Zancanella had a non-delegable statutory duty to maintain the fences on the property leased to the Steiners, notwithstanding the lease agreement. As discussed above, Zancanella had no statutory duty to maintain a legal fence, pursuant to \u00a7 81-4-101, MCA, and therefore this argument must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">\u00b6102 Moving to a common-law theory, however, Larson-Murphy further relies on <em>Fagan v. Silver </em>(1920), 57 Mont. 427, 188 P. 900, for the proposition that a lessor and lessee may both be liable for damages resulting from maintaining a \u201cnuisance or hazard,\u201d and that, generally, lessors under certain circumstances may be liable for damages suffered by a third party that result from the lessee\u2019s activities. Contrary to the District Court, which did not actually cite authority for its conclusions, we find merit in this argument to the extent that material facts related to this theory remain in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">\u00b6 103 Zancanella is correct that a lessor of land usually has no control over the conduct of the lessee or the person upon the leased land while the lessee is in possession of it. Therefore, the traditional common law rule has been that the lessor is under no obligation to anyone to look after the premises or to keep them in repair, and is not responsible, either to persons injured on or off the land for conditions which develop or are created by the tenant after possession has been transferred. <em>See Prosser &amp; Keeton, </em>\u00a7 63; <em>Parrish v. Witt </em>(1976), 171 Mont. 101, 104, 555 P.2d 741,743 (requiring plaintiff to show that exception to general rule); <em>Lake v. Emigh </em>(1948), 121 Mont. 87, 119-20, 190 P.2d 550, 566 (stating general rule that in the \u201cabsence of an agreement in the lease binding the landlord to put or keep the premises in repair, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>is not liable in damages for failure to do so or for injuries sustained by the tenant by reason thereof\u2019) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b6 104 Two relevant exceptions to the foregoing general rule, to which Larson-Murphy\u2019s argument alludes, are expressed under two, related sections of the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7\u00a7 379A and 837, which we conclude are persuasive authority in this instance. Section 379A provides that a lessor of land is subj ect to liability for physical harm to persons outside of the land caused by activities of the lessee or others on the land after the lessor transfers possession if, but only if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-5\">(a) the lessor at the time of the lease consented to such activity or knew that it would be carried on, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-6\">(b) the lessor knew or had reason to know that it would unavoidably involve such an unreasonable risk, or that special precautions necessary to safety would not be taken.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 379A (1965). Similarly, \u00a7 837 provides that a lessor of land is subject to liability for a nuisance caused by an activity carried upon the land while the lease continues and the lessor continues as owner, if the lessor would be liable if he had carried on the activity himself; and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">(a) at the time of the lease the lessor consents to the activity or knows or has reason to know that it will be carried on, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">(b) he then knows or should know that it will necessarily involve or is already causing the nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 837 (1979). <em>See also </em>Restatement (Second) of Property, <em>Landlord &amp; Tenant </em>\u00a7 18.4 (1977) (providing substantially the same rule as \u00a7 379A). These Restatement sections and interpretive case law suggest that where, for example, a land owner abutting a public highway leases the property knowing it will be used for a potentially hazardous purpose, and as a result a traveler on the highway is injured, the owner may be subject to liability. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 379A, comment <em>c; Park v. Hoffard </em>(Or. 1993), 847 P.2d 852, 855-56 (holding that landlord may be liable for damage caused by tenant\u2019s dog); <em>Klimkowski v. De La Torre </em>(Ariz.Ct.App. 1993), 857 P.2d 392, 395 (holding that if landlord has knowledge of nuisance, and has opportunity to reenter and abate the nuisance, he may be held liable if a third party suffers damage as a result of the nuisance); <em>Easson v. Wagner </em>(S.D. 1993), 501 N.W.2d 348, 351 (stating that a landlord may be held liable for damage to adjoining property occasioned by a tenant\u2019s use of the property that was sanctioned by the landlord, pursuant to negligent leasing theory); <em>Walker v. Everist, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number><em>Inc. </em>(N.M.Ct.App. 1985), 701 P.2d 382, 387 (providing rule that if the potential harm is sufficiently substantial and predictable, it is the duty of the lessor to abate the nuisance created by his lessee).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">\u00b6105 Further, our decision in <em>Criswell v. Brewer </em>(1987), 228 Mont. 143, 741 P.2d 418, upon which Zancanella relies, can be distinguished from the facts here. In that case, we concluded that the owner of a ranch could not be liable for the ranch foreman\u2019s dog that bit a third party, concluding that the ranch owner was not a \u201ckeeper\u201d of the dog. We nevertheless concluded that the ranch owner must still exercise reasonable care as a landowner. The facts indicated that the dog had bitten someone approximately two years before the incident with the plaintiff, the ranch owner was aware of the earlier biting, and had satisfied his duty of reasonable care by providing materials to the dog\u2019s owner to build a fence and dog pen behind the ranch house, and requiring that the foreman keep the dog in the pen unless accompanied by the foreman. <em>See Criswell, </em>228 Mont. at 144, 741 P.2d at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"Apf\">\u00b6106 Thus, the claim of negligence against Zancanella gives rise to two questions of fact: whether he knew of, or consented to, the tenant\u2019s activity which caused the harm and whether he realized the risks associated with that activity. If the expected activity under the lease resulted in a reasonably anticipated injury, the landlord cannot disclaim liability. <em>See Easson, </em>501 N.W.2d at 351 (relying on Restatement (Second) of Property, \u00a7 18.4 and Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 379A).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b6107 The facts here indicate that Zancanella understood and consented that livestock, including bulls, would be kept by his lessees, the Steiners, and consequently it was a condition of the lease that they maintain the fences, and take whatever precautions were necessary for keeping such animals. Obviously, Zancanella was aware of the potential risks involved, having kept livestock, including a bull, on the property in the mid-1970s. Further, in anticipation of any damages the livestock may cause, he required that the Steiners carry liability insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">\u00b6108  While such contractual obligations may give Zancanella a right to indemnification from the Steiners, we conclude that an injured third party, such as Larson-Murphy, is not a party to such an agreement, and thus Zancanella cannot avoid liability if a legal duty was owed. <em>See </em>Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 379A, comment d. Further, the facts are unclear, and therefore in dispute, as to what degree Zancanella exercised reasonable care in addressing whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>this activity on his property would pose a risk to users of the adjacent roads. Zancanella\u2019s argument here, in fact, is premised on the notion that he owed no duty of care under any circumstances, and this assertion formed the basis of the District Court\u2019s conclusion. Unless all material facts undisputedly show that Zancanella fully satisfied his duty of ordinary care under the circumstances as an owner and lessor of the premises, summary judgment in his favor is improper. Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s order dismissing Zancanella from the action is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">\n<em>2. Did the District Court err in denying summary judgment to the Steiners?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">\u00b6109 The District Court denied the Steiners\u2019 motion for summary judgment on two separate occasions, and a motion for reconsideration, all of which address similar issues of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">\u00b6110 In the District Court\u2019s October 29,1996 Order, the court determined that \u201c[i]f an area is not open range, there is a duty to maintain legal fences and keep livestock off the roadways,\u201d pursuant to <em>Indendi v. Workman </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 64, 899 P.2d 1085, and \u00a7 60-7-102, MCA. The court stated that whether \u201cDefendants violated the legal fencing statute, and whether such a violation constitutes negligence <em>per se </em>are questions of fact.\u201d The court concluded that the defendants \u201cfailed to establish they lacked a duty to maintain legal fences and keep livestock off Hoskin road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">\u00b6 111  Pursuant to our discussion here, we conclude that the denial of the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment was proper. Although the Steiners had no duty to maintain a legal fence, pursuant to \u00a7 81-4-201, MCA, they nevertheless had a common law duty to exercise control of their livestock to a particular standard of conduct in order to.protect motorists, as foreseeable plaintiffs, against unreasonable risks of harm under the circumstances \u2014 whether within a herd district or on open range. <em>See </em>\u00a7 27-1-701, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">\u00b6112 It is undisputed that the accident occurred within a herd district, which was in effect at the time. Therefore, the Steiners\u2019 bull, which was \u201cat large,\u201d was not lawfully occupying the highway at the time of the accident, because the highway in question was not \u201copen range.\u201d Thus, the question of what was a reasonable standard of care under the circumstances \u2014 where an animal escapes an owner\u2019s premises in a herd district \u2014 is a fact-specific inquiry. As the court acknowledged \u201cdisputed issues of material fact remain.\u201d Namely, those facts pertaining to how the bull escaped from the premises, and what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>steps the Steiners had taken, or should have taken, in light of the risk involved, remained in dispute at the time the court rendered its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b6113 The District Court\u2019s January 6, 1997 Order denying the Steiners\u2019 motion to reconsider is affirmed under the same rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"AKz\">\u00b6114 Finally, the District Court\u2019s November 19,1997 Order again turned on the legal question of whether the accident occurred in open range, and thus whether or not the Steiners owed a legal duty to Larson-Murphy. The court concluded that the accident did not occur in open range. We affirm this conclusion. Ultimately, the court\u2019s denial of the Steiners\u2019 motion turned on the disputed fact of which fence was relevant: the triangular pasture where the Steiners placed the bull, or the perimeter fence near Hoskin Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">\u00b6115 Disregarding questions of law, we again affirm the order denying the Steiners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. Obviously, material facts regarding which fence was or was not properly maintained, the condition of the gates on the property, and how these conditions relate to the reasonable care required in preventing a black bull from obstructing a highway at night in a herd district remained in dispute at the time of the court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\n<em>3. Did the District Court properly grant the Steiners\u2019motion for a directed verdict?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">\u00b6116 Pursuant to our standard of review, we consider only the evidence introduced by the party against whom the directed verdict is granted. If that evidence, when viewed in a light most favorable to the party, tends to establish the case made by the party\u2019s pleading, we will reverse the directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">\u00b6117 Here, Larson-Murphy\u2019s theory for recovery is that the Steiners were negligent. This theory can be summarized as follows: (1) at some point in the chain of events leading up to the collision of Larson-Murphy\u2019s vehicle with the Steiners\u2019 bull on May 8,1993, the Steiners \u2014 as well as Zancanella \u2014 owed a legal duty to motorists on Hoskin Road to prevent in some manner the bull from obstructing the county highway; (2) the Defendants breached this duty when their conduct fell below a recognized standard of care under the circumstances; (3) this breach of a legal duty caused the accident; and (4) as a result, Larson-Murphy was damaged. <em>See generally Nehring, </em>219 Mont. at 469, 712 P.2d at 1334.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">\u00b6118  Thus, potentially, if the Steiners acted unreasonably in failing to guard against the risk that their bull could obstruct and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>terfere with Larson-Murphy\u2019s lawful use of Hoskin Road, they may be liable for negligence. We conclude that Larson-Murphy presented sufficient evidence at trial that the Steiners\u2019 bull unlawfully obstructed Hoskin Road and caused the accident resulting in her damages, and that its escape arguably resulted from a lack of reasonable care by its owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b6119 Clearly, therefore, reasonable persons could draw different conclusions from the evidence concerning whether the Steiners\u2019 standard of care was reasonable under the circumstances. The trier of fact should have been permitted to make this ultimate determination, and, accordingly, the directed verdict in favor of the Steiners is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b6120 Therefore, this action is affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b163-6\">JUSTICE LEAPHART and DISTRICT JUDGE McKEON, sitting for JUSTICE REGNIER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b136-6\">. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 291 provides that \u201c[w]here an act is one which a reasonable man would recognize as involving a risk of harm to another, the risk is unreasonable and the act is negligent if the risk is of such magnitude as to outweigh what the law regards as the utility of the act or of the particular manner in which it is done.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b139-8\">. It should be noted that a lawful fence, under \u00a7 81-4-101(5), MCA, includes \u201call rivers, hedges, mountain ridges and bluffs, or other barriers over or through which it is impossible for stock to pass,\u201d in addition to the more common legally-defined barrier of barbed wire.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b143-6\">. As originally codified, the open range definition meant all lands not enclosed by a lawful fence. This definition was changed in 1925, to the current two-wire standard. <em>See </em>Ch. 63, L. 1925. Thus, again in concert with the purpose of the open range doctrine, the fencing required to remove land from open range did not apply to livestock owners, who chose to restrain their animals, but to landowners who wished to exclude other persons\u2019 livestock. <em>See also Siegfried v. Atchison </em>(1985), 219 Mont. 14, 17, 709 P.2d 1006, 1008 (concluding that the \u201cpresence of privately constructed fences along the highway right-of-way does not indicate the area is not open range\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">. This intentional conduct standard was a result of a 1925 amendment. Originally, livestock were flatly prohibited from running at large, with no mention of intent. <em>Compare </em>Ch. 74, L. 1917, <em>with </em>Ch. 45, L. 1925. For reasons that remain unclear, no similar willful standard was amended to the horse herd district statute, which does not require intentional conduct. <em>See </em>\u00a7 81-4-324, MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b146-7\">. In 1974, the Legislature charged the State .with the duty of fencing certain highways. <em>See </em>\u00a7 60-7-101 through 103, MCA. The Legislature provided that the purpose of this duty was to \u201cbalance the tradition of the open range and the economic and geographic problems of raising livestock with the need for safer highways and the policy of taking all feasible measures to reduce the high incidence of traffic accidents and fatalities on Montana highways.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 60-7-101, MCA. This pronouncement came, however, more than 20 years after the \u201cgrazing of livestock on highways\u201d statutes were codified, and offers no express reference to \u00a7\u00a7 60-7-201 through 205, MCA. Thus, it is unclear whether the Legislature intended this clear enunciation of \u201csafer highways\u201d policy to apply to the grazing statutes as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b163-7\">JUSTICE TRIEWEILER</author>\n<p id=\"AYX\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">\u00b6121 I concur with the majority opinion, except for that part which reversed the holding in <em>Indendi v. Workmen </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 64, 899 P.2d 1085, that violation of Montana\u2019s legal fencing requirements found at \u00a7 81-4-101 is negligence per se in the context of a livestock-motor vehicle collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">\u00b6122 The majority concludes that violation of the legal fence requirement was not negligent per se in the context of a livestock-motor vehicle collision because motor vehicle operators are not members of the class for which the legal fence requirement was enacted. I disagree and conclude that the majority\u2019s interpretation of the statute\u2019s purpose is far too narrow. Plaintiffs were within the class of persons that legal fencing requirements were enacted to protect because they are victims of cattle roaming in an area where it is required that they be contained. It is not necessary that the legislature foresee every manner in which prohibited acts or omissions could cause injury before negligence as a matter of law can be found.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">\u00b6123 As stated in <em>Indendi, </em>the broad purpose of the legal fence requirement is to assure that livestock are \"... not free to roam and to cause harm to persons and property or to breed with livestock of others.\u201d <em>Indendi, </em>272 Mont. at 72, 899 P.2d at 1090. I do not believe it was necessary for the legislature to foresee each specific type of harm that wandering livestock could cause before principles of negligence per se are applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>\u00b6 124 The maj ority\u2019s sweeping conclusion that legal fences were only required to keep livestock out rather than to keep livestock in is discredited by other provisions found in Title 81, Chapter 4, Part 1. For example, \u00a7 81-4-103, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\">Any person constructing or maintaining any fence of any kind not described in 81-4-101 is liable in a civil action for all damages caused by reason of injury to stock resulting from such defective fence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u00b6125 Section 81-4-104, MCA, provides that owners of barbed wire fences which are in disrepair are liable to owners of livestock injured thereby, when after notice, the fence is not repaired. Furthermore, Part 2 provides penalties and civil liability when prohibited animals are permitted to run at large. Section 81-4-202, MCA. Part 3 provides penalties for persons who allow livestock to run at large in a herd district. Section 81-4-306, MCA. These statutes, when read together, clearly suggest that the legal fencing requirement was intended for more than to protect fenced land from roaming livestock. The fencing requirements were also obviously enacted to protect others from livestock which by law, must be contained. That includes cattle found in herd districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">\u00b6126 I would conclude that to start limiting the laws protection from roaming livestock to only certain classes of tort victims without an expressed intention by the legislature to do so, is far too narrow an application of the legal fencing requirement. For these reasons, I would follow that part of the <em>Indendi </em>decision which held that in the context of livestock/motor vehicle collisions, failure to provide a legal fence is negligence per se and I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse that part of the <em>Indendi </em>holding.</p>\n<judges id=\"b164-7\">JUSTICE HUNT joins in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"ASB\">JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AV7\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">\u00b6127 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s scholarly and sweeping decision which abrogates decades of precedent and fails to take into account that the Legislature, like the livestock owners of Montana, have long relied on that precedent. While I do agree with some of the Court\u2019s discussion, my disagreements are extensive. Rather than have the opinions in this case fill an entire volume of <em>Montana Reports, </em>however, I will address only major points.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">\u00b6128 Regarding points of agreement between myself and the Court, I agree with the Court\u2019s early conclusions that the law of the open range remains the law of this state and that the term open range in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>eludes all highways outside of private enclosures and used by the public, unless modified by the Legislature. I also agree we correctly held in <em>Williams </em>that the herd district statutes were intended only to protect landowners and owners of livestock. Finally, I agree that, while the portions of <em>Indendi </em>analyzing and resolving the questions at issue pursuant \u00a7\u00a7 60-7-201 and 60-7-202, MCA, were correct, the negligence <em>per se </em>discussion and holding therein must be overruled because the legal fence statutes were enacted to exclude, not confine, livestock.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b6 129 I disagree with and, therefore, dissent from most of the rest of the Court\u2019s opinion, with regard to its approach, its discussion and its result. In particular, I strenuously disagree with the Court\u2019s statement in the early part of its Discussion that \u201c[t]his case involves a general misconception of the import of Montana\u2019s \u2018open range doctrine\u2019 in matters involving the legal relationship between the owners of livestock and users of motor vehicles on Montana highways.\u201d Under decades of Montana law, there is no \u201cmisconception,\u201d since that law has clearly held for decades that-absent an exception enacted by the Legislature-an owner of livestock has no duty to prevent the livestock from wandering onto Montana highways. <em>See, e.g., Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305; <em>Williams, </em>235 Mont. at 141, 766 P.2d at 249. For the same reason, I cannot <em>agree </em>with the Court\u2019s statement soon thereafter that the District Court\u2019s expression of the \u201cprevailing law\u201d in Montana with regard to open range is \u201cincorrect.\u201d The prevailing law was-at the time of the District Court\u2019s decision-and has been for decades as stated by that court. That this Court changes, in this case, the prevailing law by overruling decades of well-settled precedent does not support the Court\u2019s statement that the District Court erred under \u201cprevailing law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">\u00b6130 I also disagree with the Court\u2019s statement that open range and the open range doctrine has nothing to do with the legal relationship between livestock owners and motorists \u201cunder a theory of negligence.\u201d The fact is that, under our earlier cases on this subject, a negligence theory in such situations was available only under legislative exceptions to the open range doctrine. <em>See, e.g., Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305; <em>Ambrogini, </em>197 Mont. at 120-21, 642 P.2d at 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">\u00b6131 Overall, my position is this: The Court sweeps away decades of precedent by characterizing our statements of law in those cases that an owner of livestock has no duty to prevent the livestock from wan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>dering on the highways as mere \u201cassumptions.\u201d Such a cavalier approach to the legal determinations of Montana\u2019s highest court is inappropriate and is, in my view, an insufficient starting point to overrule a body of decisions which stated the rule of law on this subject in Montana for decades and provided the stability and predictability in the law which is so necessary in an ordered society.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">\u00b6132 Moreover, the Court fails to notice what, to me, is the clear tie between our cases and the Legislature\u2019s reliance on-and response to-those cases; in doing so, the Court undercuts the Legislature\u2019s lawmaking authority on this subject. The fact is that our 1967 <em>Bartsch </em>decision addressed the livestock-motorist dilemma at a time when the only statutory duty imposed on livestock owners with regard to livestock on highways was for willfully or intentionally allowing livestock onto certain highways. There, we stated without equivocation that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">in open range country, the owner of livestock... has no duty to prevent the livestock from wandering. Since he has no duty to prevent such wandering, he cannot be said to be negligent if the livestock do wander \u2014 even if such wandering takes them onto a highway right of way which runs through the open range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\"><em>Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 409, 427 P.2d at 305. Recognizing the propriety of the result, but concerned about increased motor traffic in the last third of the twentieth century, Justice John C. Harrison specially concurred, urging the Legislature to give the subject its \u201cutmost consideration.\u201d <em>Bartsch, </em>149 Mont. at 410, 427 P.2d at 305 (Harrison, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">\u00b6133 The Legislature heeded Justice Harrison\u2019s plea in the very next legislative session by enacting statutes relating to the subject. <em>See </em>1969 Mont. Laws Ch. 311, Sec. 1. The Legislature acted again in 1974, more vigorously, by enacting what subsequently became \u00a7 60-7-101, MCA, the \u201cPurpose\u201d statement that \u00a7\u00a7 60-7-101 through 60-7-103, MCA, were expressly intended</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-8\">to balance the tradition of the open range and the economic and geographic problems of raising livestock with the need for safer highways and the policy of taking all feasible measures to reduce the high incidence of traffic accidents and fatalities on Montana highways.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-9\"><em>See </em>1974 Mont. Laws Ch. 255, Sec. 1. In a separate bill, the Legislature also amended other statutes on the subject. Of special note, it amended the statute referenced in <em>Bartsch </em>\u2014 which previously had im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>posed a duty only for willfully or intentionally allowing livestock on certain highways-to provide that the livestock owner <em>\u201cmay not </em>permit\u201d occupation of certain highways by livestock. <em>See </em>1974 Mont. Laws Ch. 316, Sec. 7. On the basis of this last legislative amendment, we properly decided in <em>Ambrogini </em>that livestock owners in Montana could be found liable for merely negligent-rather than willful-conduct which results in the presence of their cattle on certain highways designated by the Legislature. Ambrogini, 197 Mont. at 120, 642 P.2d at 1018.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b6134 It is my view that Title 60, Chapter 7 clearly expresses the Legislature\u2019s intent in balancing the modern dilemma of livestock in an open range state with the competing concerns for motorist safety. Certain duties have been imposed on the state of Montana and on livestock owners via those statutes and it is my view that the statutes set the only parameters within which a motorist or passenger may sue a livestock owner for negligently allowing livestock on the designated highways. The facts of the present case do not fall within those parameters.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b6135 The Legislature having done the balancing it found necessary and appropriate, and having done so in response to <em>Bartsch, </em>there is simply no basis for the Court to extend and expand that careful legislative balancing \u2014 via application of \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA-to apply to circumstances the Legislature clearly did not intend to bring within its purview. In short, it is my view that, in enacting Title 60, Chapter 7, the Legislature set forth-as the public policy of this state-the only exceptions to the open range-no duty doctrine available for livestock-vehicle collisions. Our job is not to decide whether we agree with the Legislature\u2019s actions; our job is to \u201c \u2018construe and apply the law as [we] find it and to maintain its integrity as it has been written by a coordinate branch of the state government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Raffety v. Kanta Products, Inc. </em>(1991), 250 Mont. 268, 272, 819 P.2d 1272, 1275 (citation omitted). It is undisputed in the present case that the collision occurred on a county road not included within the statutory exceptions to the open range doctrine set forth by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">\u00b6136 Furthermore, while the Court\u2019s conclusory statement that the herd district statutes authorize certain landowners \u201cto exempt a particular area of land from the open range\u201d is not altogether incorrect, I disagree that the herd district statutes impact on livestock-motor vehicle collisions on county roads. As a result, I also disagree with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Court\u2019s conclusion that, because the accident at issue here occurred <em>within </em>a herd district, it did not occur within the open range.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">\u00b6137 The problem with the Court\u2019s reasoning in this regard is that herd districts are created by <em>owners </em>of <em>land </em>and the penalties for permitting animals to run at large or trespass apply only \u201cwithin a herd district.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 81-4-301,81-4-306 and 81-4-307, MCA. Herd districts do not include county roads adjacent thereto and, therefore, a livestock-motor vehicle collision on such a county road simply does not occur <em>within </em>the herd district. Consequently, the Court\u2019s early conclusion that open range \u201cincludes all highways outside of private enclosures and used by the public\u201d unless modified by the Legislature-a conclusion with which I heartily agree-remains applicable here and no duty arises.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b6138 In summary, I simply cannot agree with the Court\u2019s decision to apply \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA, to the circumstances before us here. The open range-no duty rule and the statutory duty of ordinary care have coexisted-but been separately applied-in Montana for 100 years or more. In both cases, the Legislature has enacted exceptions to the general rules and this Court has applied such statutory exceptions to the cases before it (absent constitutional infirmity). Nothing in this case persuades me that a change in course, especially one by this Court that necessitates turning decades of well-settled law and carefully crafted actions by the Legislature on their head, is either appropriate or necessary. I dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\u00b6139 As a final matter, I turn to the issues stated in-and discussed at the very end of-the Court\u2019s opinion. I dissent from the Court\u2019s resolution of issue one, which reverses the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Zancanella from the action. I do agree with the Court that Larson-Murphy\u2019s reliance on the fencing statute and <em>Indendi </em>in this regard-which constitutes the bulk of her argument on this issue-is misplaced. The only other authority relied on by Larson-Murphy is <em>Fagan </em>and the Court properly does not rely on that case to reverse the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Zancanella.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">\u00b6140 Indeed, the Court\u2019s decision on this issue is based primarily on a discussion of various portions of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, a discussion with which I do not disagree. My problem, however, is that Larson-Murphy\u2019s contentions on this issue are limited to the arguments set forth above. She did not argue Restatement law in support of her position. It is my view that our duty is to decide cases based on the issues and arguments raised by the parties, so each party has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>the opportunity to brief the matters raised and this Court can make a reasoned decision accordingly.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-4\">While the temptation is often great to decide a case on the basis of the argument that \u201cshould have been made,\u201d but was not, in blind-siding an issue we run the very real risk of substituting advocacy for neutrality.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><em>State v. Zabawa </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 307, 318, 928 P.2d 151, 158 (Nelson, J., concurring). Moreover, in relying on the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the Court shifts the thrust of Larson-Murphy\u2019s entire argument from the purported deficiency of the fence to the activity of the Steiners-about which Zancanella knew-of maintaining a bull on the property, with its concomitant risks. It is this sort of \u201cslippery slope\u201d along which it is easy to slide when the Court undertakes to resolve an issue based on an unraised argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b6141 I also dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion on the second issue that the District Court properly denied the Steiners\u2019 motion for summary judgment. For the reasons discussed above at some length, it is my view that the Steiners were entitled to summary judgment under the open range-no duty doctrine, in that no legislative exception to that doctrine applies here. Because Larson-Murphy\u2019s case against the Steiners should have ended with the grant of their motion for summary judgment, I would not separately address whether the District Court properly granted the Steiners\u2019 motion for a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">\u00b6142 In sum, while I agree with portions of the Court\u2019s discussion, I dissent from its overall approach and resolution of this case via the application of \u00a7 27-1-701, MCA. I would affirm the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Zancanella from the action and reverse the denial of the Steiners\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<judges id=\"b169-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE joins in the foregoing dissenting Opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
