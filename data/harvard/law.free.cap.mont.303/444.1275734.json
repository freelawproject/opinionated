Joseph P. Mazurek, Attorney General; C. Mark Fowler, Assistant Attorney General, Helena; Mike McGrath, Lewis and Clark County Attorney; Mike Menehan, Deputy County Attorney, Helena.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b475-7\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"AQT\">delivered the Opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">\u00b61 This is an appeal pursuant to \u00a7 53-21-131, MCA, from an order of commitment issued by the First Judicial District Court, Lewis and Clark County. We affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">\u00b62 On November 10,1999, the District Court ordered that S.C. be committed to Golden Triangle Community Mental Health Center and that she agree to take medication as prescribed by professionals at that facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">\u00b63 There is no dispute as to the facts. S.C. suffers from paranoid-type schizophrenia. Her mental disorder has resulted in acts, omissions or behaviors which endanger her life or health in that she refuses to admit that she is unable to care for herself. On two occasions she was observed throwing her medication in the garbage can. S.C. has a history of treatment non-compliance and medication non-compliance. She presents with paranoia, suspiciousness and anger and her thoughts appear disorganized. S.C.\u2019s mental disorder is treatable with a reasonable prospect of success but has resulted in her refusing or being unable to consent to voluntary admission for treatment. She continues to state that she does not have schizophrenia or need medication. She indicates that she wishes to live independently, yet she has refused treatment, which would allow independent living.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">\u00b64 The District Court further found that if S.C.\u2019s disorder goes untreated, it will predictably result in the deterioration of her mental condition to the point that she will be unable to provide for her own basic health and safety needs, thereby placing herself at risk in a community where she does not use support services.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">\u00b65 The District Court found that S. C. is in need of psychiatric treatment in a minimally structured environment and that medication is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>necessary to facilitate effective treatment. The District Court investigated alternative treatments but found that they would not meet the treatment needs of S.C. nor be in her best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">\u00b66 Based on the above findings of fact, the District Court ordered that S.C.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">shall be committed to Golden Triangle Community Mental Health Center, Jeff Sturm, Clinic Director, Helena, Montana, for a period of 90 days for care, treatment and evaluation of the respondent\u2019s mental health needs, and the respondent shall follow the out-patient plan developed by Golden Triangle Community Mental Health Center, which shall include the following: 1. Respondent will agree to take medication as prescribed and will receive medication monitoring as recommended by professionals at Golden Triangle Community Mental Health Center ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">\u00b67 The question raised by S.C. on appeal is whether the District Court erred in ordering that she agree to take medication as prescribed absent findings that she was incompetent and that involuntary medication was necessary. S.C. contends that the District Court\u2019s order violated her common law, constitutional and statutory rights to refuse medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">\u00b68 In reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence in a civil commitment proceeding, this Court views the evidence in a light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>In re Mental Health of R.J.W. </em>(1987), 226 Mont. 419, 423, 736 P.2d 110, 112. We will not disturb the district court\u2019s findings on appeal unless they are shown to be clearly erroneous. <em>In re G.S. </em>(1985), 215 Mont. 384, 390, 698 P.2d 406, 410. In reviewing conclusions of law, the Court determines whether the decision below was correct or <em>not. In re Mental Health of L.C.B. </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 1, 5, 830 P.2d 1299, 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">\u00b69 S.C. contends that the District Court\u2019s order violated her common law right to refuse medication. The State contends that there is no common law in situations where the law is declared by statute. Section 1-1-1Q8, MCA. With regard to the State\u2019s power to treat the mentally ill, the legislature has specifically established the law in Chapter 21 of Title 53, MCA. If, pursuant to this Chapter, the State meets all procedural prerequisites and restrictions, then a court may order that a mentally ill person be involuntarily medicated. Section 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA. Since the legislature has, through statutory enactment, clearly declared the law as to involuntary medication, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>agree with the State that there is no common law right to refuse medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">\u00b610 S.C. next contends that in ordering involuntary medication, the District Court deprived her of due process of law under the United States and Montana Constitutions and violated her right of privacy under the Montana Constitution. Her constitutional arguments are premised on the assumption that the District Court did not find her to be <em>incompetent </em>to give her informed consent. The Montana statutes on the treatment of the seriously mentally ill, however, do not speak in terms of \u201ccompetency.\u201d Rather, the statutory scheme is couched in terms of \u201cmental disorder,\u201d a term which is defined as \u201cany organic, mental or emotional impairment that has substantial adverse effects on an individual\u2019s cognitive or volitional functions.\u201d Section 53-21-103(7), MCA. Here, the District Court, following the statutory scheme of Title 53, Chapter 21, MCA, determined that S.C. has a mental disorder (paranoid-type schizophrenia) which renders her unable to consent to voluntary admission for treatment. By definition, S.C. thus has an impairment that has a substantial adverse effect on her cognitive and volitional functions. Accordingly, S.C.\u2019s premise that she was not found to be incompetent is a false premise. S.C. fails to place her constitutional arguments in the context of the Montana commitment statutes and she does not specifically argue that the commitment statutes are either unconstitutional on their face or as applied to her. We find no merit to the constitutional arguments as presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">\u00b611 Finally, S.C. contends that the District Court failed to satisfy the statutory prerequisites to ordering involuntary medication. In particular, S.C. argues that, before ordering involuntary medication, a district court must make a separate finding that involuntary medication is necessary, \u00a7 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA, and why it is necessary. Section 53-21-127(2)(e)(vii), MCA. S.C. posits that although the District Court found that medication was necessary, it did not find that <em>involuntary </em>medication was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">\u00b612  Before ordering involuntary medication, a District Court must address four statutory criteria. First it must determine whether the person in question is suffering from a mental disorder and requires commitment and, if so, hold a post-trial disposition hearing. Section 53-21-127(2)(a), MCA. Then upon the conclusion of the post-trial disposition hearing, it must choose among the least restrictive treatment alternatives necessary to protect the individual and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>the public, and permit effective treatment. Section 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA. In selecting the least restrictive treatment, the court can choose between institutionalization, non-institutional care, ordering outpatient therapy or making \u201csome other appropriate order for treatment.\u201d Sections 53-21-127(2)(a)(i) through (v), MCA. Before choosing involuntary medication, the court must find that it is necessary to protect the person or the public or to facilitate effective treatment. Section 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA. Finally, it must make a finding of fact that includes the reason involuntary medication was chosen from among the other alternatives. Section 53-21-127(2)(e)(vii), MCA. It is this final requirement that is the focus of S.C.\u2019s appeal. She contends that the District Court failed to make a specific finding stating the reason involuntary medication was chosen from among other alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">\u00b613 The State counters that neither \u00a7 53-21-127(2)(e), MCA, nor any other provision of the commitment statute expressly requires that a district court declare, in a distinct and explicit statement, its reasons for selecting involuntary medication. Rather, the State contends that we should look to the court\u2019s findings as a whole. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">\u00b614 In its findings of fact, the District Court found that on two occasions S.C. was observed throwing her medication in the garbage can; she has a history of treatment and medication non-compliance; she continues to state that she does not have a problem and does not need medication; and \u201c[i]f [S.C.\u2019s] mental disorder goes untreated, there will be a predictable result in the deterioration of [S.C.\u2019s] mental condition to the point at which [she] will be unable to provide for her own basic needs of health and safety, thereby placing her at risk in a community where she doesn\u2019t use support services.\u201d Although the District Court did not, in one distinct finding of fact, specifically state why involuntary medication was chosen, it is abundantly clear from the court\u2019s other detailed findings of fact why the District Court concluded that involuntary medication was the least restrictive and most appropriate alternative. Furthermore, we have adopted the doctrine of implied findings for purposes of reviewing findings of fact. <em>Interstate Brands Corp. v. Cannon </em>(1985), 218 Mont. 380, 384, 708 P.2d 573, 576. That doctrine provides that where the \u201cfindings are general in terms, any findings not specifically made, but necessary to the [determination], are deemed to have been implied, if supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Interstate </em>Brands, 218 Mont. at 384, 708 P.2d at 576. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>the District Court\u2019s specific findings provide a clear rationale for ordering involuntary medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">\u00b615  We hold that the District Court, in ordering that S.C. \u201cagree to take medication as prescribed,\u201d first complied with the requirements that it find that involuntary medication is necessary to protect the person or the public or to facilitate treatment, \u00a7 53-21-127(2)(c), MCA; and that it set forth the reason involuntary medication was chosen from among other alternatives. Section 53-21-127(2)(e)(vii), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b479-6\">JUSTICES REGNIER, GRAY, NELSON and TRIEWEILER concur</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
