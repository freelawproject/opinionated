Netzorg, Nancy Cachette, and John M. Netzorg (hereinafter Children), who are the natural children of Gordon M. Netzorg and his first wife, Naomi Netzorg. Luse is the surviving spouse and second wife of Gordon M. Netzorg. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">\u00b62 Although phrased in various forms, Luse\u2019s issues can be condensed as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-10\">If counsel for the Children violated one of Montana\u2019s Rules of Professional Conduct in negotiating the settlement agreement with Luse, is the settlement agreement void and unenforceable?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">\u00b63 Gordon M. Netzorg married the defendant, Luse, in 1979 after his first wife, Naomi, died in Texas in 1978. The couple moved to Great Falls, Montana. After Netzorg\u2019s death in 1992, a dispute arose between the Children and Luse concerning the parties\u2019 respective rights to certain personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>\u00b64 Specifically, the Children maintained that following the death of his first wife, their father had retained numerous family heirlooms which the Children had rightfully inherited. The Children contend that they had agreed with their father that he could retain possession of the heirlooms until his death, at which time the heirlooms were to be returned to their possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">\u00b65 The Children allege that upon their father\u2019s death, Luse refused to return the various items, and eventually left Montana and moved to Illinois, taking with her the heirlooms in question. Subsequently, she refused to return any of the property. As a result, the Children filed this action, which would eventually be combined with the intestacy proceedings already underway, in Cascade County. One of the Children, Gordon W. Netzorg, was appointed Special Administrator of those proceedings, and appears now in that role as well as individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">\u00b66 After filing a Notice to Take Deposition on April 18,1995, counsel for the Children traveled to Aurora, Illinois, where Luse resided, for the purpose of taking her deposition on May 16,1995. The Children allege that their counsel, prior to the deposition, discussed this matter with counsel for Luse, and was informed that Luse\u2019s counsel would not be attending the deposition. They further contend that counsel for Luse encouraged counsel for the Children to discuss settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\u00b67 During the course of the deposition, the possibility of a settlement was discussed, which led to a protracted negotiation between the parties. A settlement agreement was reached that day that set forth a list of property that Luse would deliver to the Children, and the conditions for the dismissal of this litigation. The Children contend that the agreement required that Luse would return some, but by no means all, of the heirlooms in question. The agreement was read into Luse\u2019s deposition transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-7\">\u00b68 On May 22,1995, counsel for the Children forwarded a copy of the agreement to Luse and her counsel. Counsel for the Children encouraged counsel for Luse to review the agreement and advise them \u201cas soon as possible of any changes you desire.\u201d The record before this Court includes an apparent handwritten note from Luse\u2019s counsel indicating that the settlement agreement looked fine, that he thought counsel for the Children had \u201chandled it well,\u201d that he would call Luse, and that \u201cwe\u2019ll get it done this week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>\u00b69 Complications arose. Apparently, Luse alleged that she did not possess certain items that she had agreed to transfer to the Children. No items were delivered and Luse never executed the agreement. Nevertheless, counsel for Luse, on August 23,1995, assured counsel for the Children that \u201cElinor has no intention of not abiding by the terms of the settlement agreement\u201d and that \u201cif she has the items, they are going to be sent to you.\u201d A few days later, counsel for Luse encouraged her to contact counsel for the Children, make arrangements for shipping, and suggested that \u201clet\u2019s get this over with.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b610 During the next 18 months Luse did not deliver the personal property in question and refused to sign the agreement. The Children initiated this independent action to enforce the settlement agreement in October of 1996. The Children sought an order for specific performance that would require Luse to immediately deliver all items of personal property in her possession pursuant to the May 1995 settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b611 Following a hearing, the District Court granted the Children\u2019s motion for summary judgment on January 28,2000, and ordered that the parties specifically perform the Settlement Agreement. In reaching its conclusions, the court rejected Luse\u2019s argument that the settlement agreement was void due to the Children\u2019s counsel\u2019s alleged misconduct in contravention of Rule 4.2, Montana Rules of Professional Conduct. Luse alleged that the agreement was void and unenforceable because counsel for the Children had conducted negotiations and reached a settlement with Luse without permission from her counsel. The court concluded that \u201c[e]ven assuming that this is the proper forum in which to raise such issues, the Court is satisfied from reviewing the detailed affidavit of Mr. Ceriani [counsel for the Children], and the exhibits attached thereto, that Mr. Ceriani reasonably believed he had consent to communicate directly with [Luse].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AlB\">\u00b612 The District Court then concluded that a \u201cvalid and enforceable settlement agreement was indeed entered into and that the formal Settlement Agreement drafted by Mr. Ceriani (which incorporates the provisions for mutual releases and the dismissal of all pending litigation between the parties) accurately sets forth the terms and conditions of the contract between the parties.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">\u00b613 Luse appeals the order granting summary judgment on the sole grounds that the settlement agreement is void and unenforceable due to the alleged professional conduct rule violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b614 This Court reviews an order granting summary judgment under Rule 56, M.R.Civ.R, by utilizing the same criteria as the district court. <em>See Erker v. Kester, </em>1999 MT 231, \u00b6 16, 296 Mont. 123, \u00b6 16, 988 P.2d 1221, \u00b6 16. Summary judgment is a remedy which should be granted when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.R</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b615 Luse argues that the May 16,1995 settlement agreement obtained by the Children\u2019s counsel, who allegedly violated Rule 4.2 of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct in the process, is void and unenforceable against her. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b616  Even assuming that counsel for the Children violated Rule 4.2, M.R.Pro.C., this conduct alone does not render an otherwise enforceable agreement void and unenforceable as a matter of law. Thus, we conclude that a professional conduct rule violation, standing alone, simply does not rise to the level of a genuine issue of material fact necessary for the reversal of a summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">\u00b617 Rule 4.2, M.R.Pro.C., provides that \u201c[i]n representing a client, a lawyer shall not communicate about the subject of the representation with a party the lawyer knows to be represented by another lawyer in the matter, unless the lawyer has the consent of the other lawyer or is authorized by law to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">\u00b618 Luse relies on a Wyoming decision that she contends \u201cunequivocally\u201d establishes that an agreement reached involving a violation of Rule 4.2 is void and unenforceable. The Wyoming Supreme Court, in <em>Sandstrom v. Sandstrom </em>(Wyo. 1994), 884 P.2d 968, refused to enforce an agreement in favor of an attorney \u201cwho admittedly engaged in conduct which we consider to be unethical to obtain the agreement.\u201d <em>Sandstrom, </em>884 P.2d at 971 (citing <em>Heiden v. Ottinger, </em>616 N.E.2d 1005, 1011 (1993)). The Wyoming court concluded that the \u201csettlement agreement did not create a genuine issue of material fact because, as a matter of law, it was not enforceable against the wife.\u201d <em>Sandstrom, </em>884 P.2d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">\u00b6 19 The underlying facts in <em>Sandstrom </em>reveal that the husband, an attorney, admittedly conducted <em>ex parte </em>communications with his spouse during the course of a quiet title action related to the couple\u2019s divorce, all the while knowing she was represented by counsel. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>product of the communications was a settlement agreement. At the time, the wife was hospitalized. In response to his motion to dismiss her claim, she argued that the agreement was a product of undue influence. <em>See Sandstrom, </em>884 P.2d at 969-70. The court concluded that the lower court had not erred when it denied the husband\u2019s motion to dismiss and granted the wife\u2019s motion for entry of summary judgment. <em>See Sandstrom, </em>884 P.2d at 971.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b620 Luse also relies on the Illinois court\u2019s decision <em>Heiden, </em>cited in <em>Sandstrom, </em>which similarly concluded that a provision in a settlement agreement was void due in part to a Rule 4.2 violation. <em>See Heiden, </em>616 N.E.2d at 1011. In that case, a discharged attorney of one party to a paternity suit was permitted to pursue the collection of his fees from the opposing party, although the parties had settled the matter on their own, and had agreed to pay their own attorney\u2019s fees. Apparently, the mother and father colluded to prevent the mother\u2019s former attorney from collecting his fees from the father, and the settlement agreement was drafted by the father\u2019s attorney. <em>See Heiden, </em>616 N.E.2d at 1008.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b621 Luse claims, therefore, that it is axiomatic that consent to discuss settlement issues at a deposition does not include consent to make a binding final settlement agreement without express consent from opposing counsel, who was not present and who did not know the terms of the purported final settlement agreement. Thus, Luse argues that the Children\u2019s counsel\u2019s clear violation of Rule 4.2, M.R.Pro.C., renders the settlement agreement void and unenforceable as a matter of law in accordance with the holdings of the Wyoming and Illinois decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b622 It is likewise axiomatic, however, that a client has an absolute right to settle his or her case without the consent of counsel, as indicated by the authority upon which Luse relies. <em>See Heiden, </em>616 N.E.2d at 1010 (stating that there is \u201cno denying that the mother had a right to settle her case without [her attorney\u2019s] consent\u201d). <em>See also </em>Rule 1.2(a), M.R.Pro.C. (providing that a lawyer shall abide by a client\u2019s decision whether to accept an offer of settlement of a matter). It is further axiomatic, according to another Illinois court decision, that in order for a trial court to consider an attorney conduct rule violation, a party must establish that the violation prejudiced his or her rights. <em>See Beale v. Edgemark Financial Corp. </em>(Ill.App.Ct. 1998), 697 N.E.2d 820, 827 (concluding that the only infirmity with a settlement agreement was that the attorneys who obtained it may have done so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>by violating Rule 4.2 of the Illinois Rules of Professional Conduct, and that without more, such conduct can only be sanctioned by the state\u2019s disciplinary commission). A closer reading of the case law relied upon by Luse here, in fact, reveals that such prejudice was claimed and clearly proven. <em>See, e.g., Sandstrom, </em>884 P.2d at 969-70 (admitted professional conduct rule violation substantiated substantive claim of undue influence).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b623 On appeal, Luse does not claim that the alleged rule violation was part and parcel of her substantive claim that she did not give valid consent, or was perhaps subjected to undue influence in her attorney\u2019s absence. In no sense does she claim that the agreement itself is unconscionable, or contains particular prejudicial provisions. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7 28-2-102, MCA (identifying consent as an essential element of a contract formation); \u00a7 28-2-301, MCA (requiring that consent be free, mutual, and communicated by parties to the contract); \u00a7 28-2-401, MCA (providing that consent is not real or free when obtained through duress, menace, fraud, undue influence, or mistake). Under such theories, evidence of a rule violation may serve to establish that an agreement should be ruled voidable as a matter of law. <em>See </em>\u00a7 28-2-1711, MCA (allowing party to rescind a contract where consent was obtained through duress, menace, fraud or undue influence).</p>\n<p id=\"AI1\">\u00b624 Instead, Luse contends that the rule violation standing alone renders the otherwise enforceable agreement void \u2014 even though the record clearly demonstrates that both she and her counsel at one point tacitly admitted that the agreement was valid and enforceable. We are less than persuaded by her authority for this proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"AvI\">\u00b625 In a recent decision handed down by this Court (but after this appeal was filed), we ruled that a party cannot receive relief from a district court for the mere misconduct of an attorney or firm, due to a lack ofjurisdiction. <em>See Schuff v. A.T.Klemens &amp; Sons, </em>2000 MT 357, \u00b6 34, 304 Mont. 274, \u00b6 34, 16 P.3d 1002, \u00b6 34, (citing <em>Carlson v. Morton </em>(1987), 229 Mont. 234, 238, 745 P.2d 1133, 1136). As the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals stated in a case arising in California, the \u201cRules of Professional Conduct do not establish substantive legal duties \u2014 they neither create, augment nor diminish any <em>duties.\u201d In re Kirsh </em>(9th Cir. 1992), 973 F.2d 1454, 1461 (stating that a rule violation, standing alone, does not prove that a fiduciary duty has been breached).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b626 Thus, we concluded in <em>Schuff that </em>a proven or admitted professional conduct rule violation is not <em>prima facie </em>grounds for a party\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>particular request for relief. We concluded that prejudice flowing from the rule violation must be proven. <em>See Schuff, \u00b6 </em>37.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b627  Thus, even if the District Court had determined that counsel for the Children had, in fact, violated Rule 4.2, M.R.Pro.C., it was not necessarily obliged to render the relief sought by Luse here on appeal. Luse was still obligated to establish that the contract should be deemed voidable as a matter of law, pursuant to the controlling statutes cited above, or on other legal grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b628  We conclude, therefore, that there are no genuine issues of material fact as to the existence or the terms of the settlement agreement between the parties, and that the Children are entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b629 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b364-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, GRAY and REGNIER.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
