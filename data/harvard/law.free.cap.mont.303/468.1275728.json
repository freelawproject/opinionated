Dawn Marie Brabeck (Dawn), Gerald Brabeck (Gerald), and Brabeck Construction, Inc. (BCI) (or collectively \u201cRespondents\u201d) brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that Appellant, Employers Mutual Casualty Company (EMC), is required to defend them against a lawsuit arising out of a car accident Dawn was involved in while driving Gerald\u2019s car. The District Court granted Respondents\u2019 summary judgment on this issue. We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">\u00b62 The only issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in ruling that EMC\u2019s insurance coverage of BCI and Gerald requires EMC to defend and indemnify BCI and Gerald against a lawsuit arising out of Dawn\u2019s car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">\u00b63 On July 1, 1997, Dawn was driving her father\u2019s personal car when she was involved in a collision with Don Lesmeister (Lesmeister). Gerald is Dawn\u2019s father. Gerald insured his car personally with State Farm Insurance under a standard automobile liability insurance policy. Lesmeister sued Dawn, Gerald, and BCI over the car accident. State Farm Insurance settled Lesmeister\u2019s claims on behalf of Dawn and Gerald, but reserved his claim against BCI.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">\u00b64 BCI is a Montana corporation, and is engaged in the contracting business around Glasgow. It has two shareholders, Gerald who owns 25% of the outstanding stock, and his brother Mark Brabeck (Mark) who owns the remaining 75%. Gerald is also an officer and employee of BCI. Mark purchased a general liability insurance policy for BCI from EMC. An. insurance agent added both Mark and Gerald as named insureds on the policy. Thus, the policy\u2019s named insureds are BCI, Gerald, and Mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">\u00b65 Lesmeister contended in his complaint against BCI that Dawn was acting in the scope of her employment with BCI. BCI attempted to tender its defense against Lesmiester\u2019s lawsuit to EMC, the general liability carrier for BCI. EMC refused to defend BCI or to pay BCI any indemnity benefits under its policy, citing the \u201cautomobile excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>tion\u201d to the general liability policy. BCI entered its appearance in Lesmeister\u2019s lawsuit by denying that Dawn was in any manner employed by BCI and that no agency or respondeat superior relationship existed between BCI and Dawn at the time of the car accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">\u00b66 BCI then brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that its general liability policy provides coverage under the facts alleged in Lesmeister\u2019s complaint and that EMC is required to defend and indemnify BCI. Respondents alleged in their complaint that Lesmeister claims as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">that Dawn Marie Brabeck was operating the motor vehicle in question at the request of Gerald and Mark Brabeck for the purpose of business or work to be performed for the benefit of Brabeck Lumber and Brabeck Construction, Inc., who is the named insured under the liability policy issued by Defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">Both BCI and EMC filed cross motions for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">\u00b67 The District Court found that the policy definition of \u201cinsured\u201d was ambiguous under the facts of this case. It found that there was doubt whether the automobile exclusion provision applied. Since ambiguities should be resolved against the insurer, EMC, the District Court granted summary judgment in Respondents\u2019 favor. EMC now appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s decision to grant summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>based on the same criteria applied by the district court. <em>Counterpoint, Inc. v. Essex Ins. Co., </em>1998 MT 251, \u00b6 7, 291 Mont. 189, \u00b6 7, 967 P.2d 393, \u00b6 7. Because the material facts are uncontroverted, we limit our review to questions of law. The District Court based its decision upon its interpretation of the insurance contract at issue. The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>Pablo v. Moore, </em>2000 MT 48, \u00b6 12, 298 Mont. 393, \u00b6 12, 995 P.2d 460, \u00b6 12. We review a district court\u2019s conclusion of law to determine whether it is correct. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in ruling that EMC\u2019s insurance coverage of BCI and Gerald requires EMC to defend and indemnify BCI and Gerald against a lawsuit arising out of Dawn\u2019s car accident?</p>\n<p id=\"b500-12\">\u00b610 If the asserted claim is not covered by the policy, then the insurer has no duty to defend the insured. <em>Insured Titles, Inc. v. McDon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>ald (1996), 275 Mont. 111, 116, 911 P.2d 209, 211. An insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured is determined by the language of the insurance policy. <em>Burns v. Underwriters Adjusting Co. </em>(1988), 234 Mont. 508, 511, 765 P.2d 712, 714. Coverage is based upon the acts giving rise to the claim, not necessarily the language of the complaint. <em>New Hampshire Ins. Group v. Strecker </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 478, 482, 798 P.2d 130, 132. If the insurer would have no obligation to indemnify the insured, if the complainant recovers, then the insurer has no duty to defend. <em>Graber v. State Farm Fire and Cas. Co. </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 265, 270, 797 P.2d 214, 217; <em>McAlear v. Saint Paul Insurance Companies </em>(1972), 158 Mont. 452, 456, 493 P.2d 331, 334.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">\u00b611 Here, Lesmeister\u2019s complaint alleges that BCI is vicariously liable for the negligent driving of its agent based on the theory of respondeat superior. Lesmeister\u2019s complaint alleges that Dawn was acting on behalf of BCI by operating Gerald\u2019s car at his request and for the purpose of business or work to be performed for the benefit of BCI. Therefore, the complaint makes Dawn\u2019s operation of the automobile the operation of the automobile by the insured, BCI. However, the insurance policy specially excludes coverage of claims arising out of the operation of an automobile by an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">\u00b612 This Court interprets an insurance policy\u2019s terms according to their usual, common sense meaning as viewed by a reasonable insured. <em>Counterpoint, </em>\u00b6 13. While we interpret any doubts in coverage strictly against the insurer, we do not do this where the policy\u2019s terms are not ambiguous. <em>Pablo, </em>\u00b6 17. Where the policy\u2019s language is clear, we will not rewrite it, but enforce it as written. <em>Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 379, 945 P.2d 32, 36. We hold that the insurance policy\u2019s language at issue here is not ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"Al8\">\u00b613 Here, Section I of the insurance policy sets its scope of coverage as follows:-</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">1. Insuring Agreement</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-7\">a. We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d to which this insurance applies....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-10\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-11\">2. Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-12\">This insurance does not apply to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-13\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-14\">g. Aircraft, Auto or Watercraft</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>\u201cBodily injury\u201d or \u201cproperty damage\u201d arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use or entrustment to others of any aircraft, auto or watercraft owned or operated by or rented or loaned to any insured. Use includes operation and \u201cloading or unloading.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">\u00b614 Section II of the policy defines who is an insured as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-5\">1. If you are designated in the Declarations as:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">a. An individual, you and your spouse are insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of a business of which you are the sole owner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">b. A partnership or joint venture, you are an insured. Your members, your partners, and their spouses are also insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of your business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-8\">c. A limited liability company, you are an insured. Your members are also insureds, but only with respect to the conduct of your business. Your managers are insured, but only with respect to their duties as your managers.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-9\">d. An organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company, you are an insured. Your \u201cexecutive officers\u201d and directors are insureds, but only with respect to their duties as your officers or directors. Your stockholders are also insureds, but only with respect to their liability as stockholders.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-10\">2. Each of the following is also an insured:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-11\">a. Your \u201cemployees\u201d other than either your \u201cexecutive officers\u201d (if you are an organization other than a partnership, joint venture or limited liability company)... but only for acts within the scope of their employment by you or while performing duties related to the conduct of your business...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">\u00b615 Section II, Part 1(d) of this policy provides that if the entity designated as an insured in the declarations is a corporation, then the corporation is an insured. Under the same provision, the executive officers of the corporation are also insured with respect to their duties as officers. Moreover, an employee of the corporation is an insured for acts within the scope of her employment, or while performing duties related to the conduct of the corporation\u2019s business.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">\u00b616 Gerald is both an executive officer and an employee of the corporation. Thus, he qualifies as an insured whether he was performing duties in his capacity as the corporate secretary or in his capacity as an employee of the corporation. Lesmeister\u2019s complaint alleges that Dawn was operating Gerald\u2019s personal motor vehicle at Gerald\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>quest for the purpose of business or work to be performed for the benefit of BCI. The insurance policy does not provide coverage for this type of situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-3\">\u00b617  The policy excludes coverage for any claims arising out of the use of any automobile owned by any insured. Here, the vehicle involved in the accident was personally owned by Gerald. Further, the complaint alleges that Gerald directed its use in connection with the business of BCI. Gerald\u2019s alleged conduct was in his capacity either as an executive officer or as an employee, thereby rendering him an insured with respect to the alleged conduct. Therefore, his entrustment of his vehicle to Dawn was \u201centrustment to others of any ... auto ... owned... by... any insured.\u201d All the exclusion\u2019s elements are satisfied by the underlying complaint\u2019s allegations. EMC has no duty to defend Gerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">\u00b618  Likewise, the insurance policy clearly names BCI as an insured. Respondents\u2019 complaint for declaratory judgment characterizes the basis upon which Lesmeister seeks to establish BCI\u2019s liability as an alleged relationship of employer-employee or the theory of respondeat superior. The basis for Lesmeister\u2019s underlying claim is that BCI acted negligently through its agent in the use of an automobile. This allegation triggers the policy\u2019s automobile exclusion. EMC does not owe BCI a duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">\u00b619 Reversed and remanded for entry of judgment in accordance with the provisions of this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b503-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART, TRIEWEILER, REGNIER and GRAY concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
