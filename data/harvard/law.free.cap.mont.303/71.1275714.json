We affirm Hart\u2019s conviction, but strike part of his sentence and remand for entry of judgement consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">\u00b62 Hart\u2018s appeal raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b102-15\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the State to submit rebuttal testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-17\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the State to ask Hart whether he believed the State\u2019s witnesses were lying?</p>\n<p id=\"AoT\">\u00b65 3. Whether the State violated Hart\u2019s right to a fair trial when presenting its closing arguments?</p>\n<p id=\"b102-18\">\u00b66 4. Whether the District Court erred when it imposed a dangerous weapon sentence enhancement?</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\">\u00b67 On February 9, 1998, the State filed an Information charging Hart with felony assault. The State alleged that David Hart struck his niece, Shandel Hart, in the face with his fist several times and struck her in the back of the head and shoulder with a cattle prod in violation of \u00a7 45-5-202, MCA. Hart pled not guilty and the court appointed counsel. Hart was tried by jury on July 13 and 14,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">\u00b68 During Hart\u2019s trial, the State presented the testimony of three eyewitnesses to Hart\u2019s assault: Shandel Hart, Michelle Floor, and Vanessa Sutton. The State also presented the testimony of the arresting officer, Jason Gartner. Shandel testified that she was at her home on the evening of February 5, 1998, with her 17-year-old ward, Vanessa Sutton; Vanessa\u2019s boyfriend, Michael; Shandel\u2019s friend, Michelle Floor; and Michelle\u2019s three children. Shandel had planned on cutting Michelle\u2019s children\u2019s hair that evening. Shandel\u2019s uncle, David Hart, and his friend, Roy Pearl, stopped by Shandel\u2019s house at around 7:30 or 8 p.m. When Hart and Roy arrived, Shandel and Michelle were home alone, the others having left earlier in Michelle\u2019s car to buy dinner.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">\u00b69 Michelle testified that Shandel planned to repay Hart some money she owed him with the money she earned from the haircuts. Michelle owed Shandel $20 for the haircuts but only had a $50 bill. Roy offered to drive Michelle somewhere in order to change the bill. Roy and Michelle drove to the Tap Inn, a nearby bar, leaving Hart and Shandel alone. Shandel testified that after Roy and Michelle departed, Hart showed her a cattle prod that he was carrying in his pocket.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">\u00b610 About 15 minutes after Michelle and Roy departed, Hart left Shandel\u2019s house and walked to the Tap Inn. Michelle testified that Hart entered the bar and sat down next to her and Roy. Michelle bought Hart a drink and gave him the money that Shandel owed him. Michelle testified that Hart made a rude sexual comment to her. She told Hart that she was offended by his comment. Hart then pulled the cattle prod out of his pocket and pointed it at her. Michelle got up, flipped Hart\u2019s cowboy hat off his head, moved to the other side of the bar and had another drink. Michelle testified that Hart was incensed. Shortly thereafter, Hart and Roy left the bar without Michelle and returned to Shandel\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">\u00b611 While Hart, Roy, and Michelle were at the Tap Inn, Vanessa, her boyfriend, and Michelle\u2019s children returned to Shandel\u2019s house. They <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>were watching television when Hart and Roy walked in the door. Shandel testified that Hart had been gone about an hour and a half. Shandel testified that Hart was angry and was shouting epithets about Michelle. As Hart was ranting about Michelle, she walked in the front door. Shandel testified that Hart ran over to the front door, grabbed Michelle by the hair and began hitting her with his fists. Shandel grabbed Michelle around the waist and pulled her away from Hart. Shandel shouted that Hart was not going to beat Michelle up in Shandel\u2019s house and in front of Michelle\u2019s children. Hart then hit Shandel in the face with the cattle prod. Hart hit Shandel with the cattle prod approximately five or six times about her head and shoulders. The cattle prod was not activated at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b612 Michelle testified that while Hart was attacking Shandel with the cattle prod, she gathered her children, took them out to the garage, and called 911. Michelle returned to the scene of the assault and informed Hart that she had called the police. Once again, Hart came at Michelle. Michelle grabbed a two-by-four board and swung it at Hart. Hart ducked out of the way and Michelle missed, breaking a window with the board. Michelle then yelled, \u201cThere they are right now, they\u2019re here!\u201d, indicating that the police had arrived. Hart and Roy immediately fled out the back door of Shandel\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b613 Officer Jason Gartner was dispatched to Shandel\u2019s home. Officer Gartner arrived, discovered that Hart and Roy had fled in an El Camino, and radioed in a description of their vehicle to a dispatcher. Another officer stopped Hart and Roy a few blocks from Shandel\u2019s home. Officer Gartner drove to the scene of the stop to provide assistance. He testified that Roy was arrested for DUI and that Hart appeared extremely intoxicated. Officer Gartner noticed a cattle prod behind the passenger seat where Hart had been sitting and seized it. He later showed the cattle prod to Shandel and she identified it as the weapon Hart had used to assault her.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b614 After the State presented its case-in-chief, Hart testified on his own behalf. Hart stated that he went to Shandel\u2019s house that night because she had offered to repay him some money she had borrowed. Hart maintained that the cattle prod was on Shandel\u2019s dining room table. During the State\u2019s cross-examination, Hart testified that he visited Shandel\u2019s house two to three times a week and that the cattle prod was always sitting on her table. Hart stated that he thought Shandel had the cattle prod in case her dogs became aggressive. With regard to his altercation with Shandel, Hart testified that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>walking out the door as Michelle was walking in and he ran into her. When he turned around, Shandel was coming at him with the cattle prod in her hand. In the process of attempting to take the cattle prod away from Shandel, Hart grabbed her wrist and shoved it towards her face, injuring her. Hart testified that he never had the cattle prod in his possession prior to his altercation with Shandel. During cross-examination, the State asked Hart whether Michelle, Vanessa, and Shandel were lying when they testified that they saw Hart with the cattle prod prior to the assault. Hart answered affirmatively.</p>\n<p id=\"Akn\">\u00b615 After Hart\u2019s testimony, the State recalled Shandel Hart as a rebuttal witness. On direct examination by the State during its case-in-chief, Shandel had denied owing Hart money. During her rebuttal testimony, Shandel testified that Hart came to her house because he and Roy needed money and he wanted to sell her some pork tenderloins that he had stolen. Shandel testified that Hart made money by shoplifting. Shandel contended that Hart confided to her that he carried the cattle prod so that if someone attempted to catch him while he was shoplifting, he could use it to stop them.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b616 The jury found Hart guilty of felony assault. The District Court issued its Judgment and Commitment on September 24,1998, imposing a sentence of ten years in the Montana State Prison for the commission of felony assault and an additional two years for the use of a weapon to be served consecutively. Hart appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">\u00b617 Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the State to submit rebuttal testimony?</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">\u00b618 After Hart\u2019s testimony, the State offered the testimony of Shandel in rebuttal. The State contended that Shandel would rebut Hart\u2019s testimony that Shandel owed him $50 and rebut Hart\u2019s testimony that he did not possess the cattle prod. The District Court allowed the State to present Shandel\u2019s testimony over Hart\u2019s objections. Shandel testified that Hart did not stop by her house to collect money she owed him, but rather that he stopped by to sell her some pork tenderloins that he had stolen. Shandel also testified that Hart and Roy made their money from shoplifting and that Hart had informed her that he carried a cattle prod in order to prevent people from catching him shoplifting.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-8\">A. Proper Rebuttal</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">\u00b619 Hart first contends that the District Court erred in admitting Shandel\u2019s rebuttal testimony because it was not proper rebuttal testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>mony. Hart maintains that he did not open the door to this testimony nor did he raise a new matter in his testimony. The State asserts that Hart raised the issue of who owned the cattle prod, to what use the cattle prod was previously put, and how it came to be in Shandel\u2019s house for the first time during his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">\u00b620 ,  We have stated that a district court has \u201cwide discretion in determining the scope and extent of re-examination as to new matters brought out on cross-examination.\u201d <em>State v. Veis, </em>1998 MT 162, \u00b6 19, 289 Mont. 450, \u00b6 19, 962 P.2d 1153, \u00b6 19. As with a district court\u2019s determination of the scope and extent of redirect examination, we will review a district court\u2019s admission of rebuttal testimony to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. Rebuttal testimony is proper only if it tends to counteract a new matter offered by the adverse party. <em>State v. Daniels </em>(1984), 210 Mont. 1, 10, 682 P.2d 173, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\u00b621  The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the State\u2019s rebuttal testimony. Shandel\u2019s rebuttal testimony tended to counteract a new matter offered by Hart. The new matter offered by Hart was that Shandel owned the cattle prod and used it to train her dogs. During his direct examination, Hart testified that the first time he observed the cattle prod was when he saw it on Shandel\u2019s dining table. During the State\u2019s cross-examination, Hart further testified that he did not own the cattle prod, that he saw the cattle prod at Shandel\u2019s house about six months to a year prior to the incident, and that he thought Shandel had it in case her dogs became aggressive.</p>\n<p id=\"AVm\">\u00b622 Hart maintains that he did not offer this new matter because it was raised during the State\u2019s cross-examination and not during his direct testimony. Hart\u2019s contention is incorrect. Hart offered this new matter during his direct testimony when he testified that the first time he saw the cattle prod was six months to a year ago on Shandel\u2019s dining room table. During the State\u2019s cross-examination, the prosecutor questioned Hart about this new matter. In response to the State\u2019s question about whether he thought there was anything unusual about Shandel having a cattle prod on her dining room table for the past sixmonths, Hart stated, \u201cI just thought it was in case one of these [sic] dogs got mean or something.\u201d This new matter was offered by Hart. The fact that it was more fully explored by the State during its cross-examination of Hart is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">\u00b623 Lastly, Shandel\u2019s testimony tended to counteract this new matter raised by Hart. Shandel testified that Hart owned the cattle prod <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>and that he told her that he used it to prevent people from catching him shoplifting. Therefore, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it admitted the State\u2019s rebutted testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">B. Evidence of Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts</p>\n<p id=\"APY\">\u00b624 Hart next contends that Shandel\u2019s testimony that he made his living stealing food, that he was carrying the cattle prod to use against people who attempt to stop him from stealing, and that the reason that he was at Shandel\u2019s home was to sell her stolen food was evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts which should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid. The State argues that this testimony did not violate Rule 404(b) because it was admitted for the purpose of challenging Hart\u2019s testimony that Shandel possessed the cattle prod.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">\u00b625 We review a district court\u2019s admission of evidence to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Rogers, </em>1999 MT 305, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 188, \u00b6 11, 992 P.2d 229, \u00b6 11. The admissibility of evidence of prior crimes, wrongs, and acts is reviewed pursuant to the Modified Just Rule, which provides that in order to be admissible the other crimes, wrongs, or acts must be: (1) similar; (2) not remote in time; (3) not admitted to prove the character of a person in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; and (4) the probative value of the evidence must not be substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. <em>Rogers, </em>\u00b6 25</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">\u00b626 The State has not contested the fact that Shandel\u2019s testimony contained evidence of other wrongful acts committed by Hart, nor has Hart claimed that the prior acts were dissimilar or too remote in time to the current charges. Therefore, the admissibility of Shandel\u2019s testimony under Rule 404(b) depends on the last two Modified Just requirements: whether the evidence of other wrongful acts was admitted to prove Hart\u2019s character in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character; and whether the probative value of Shandel\u2019s testimony is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"A8X\">\u00b627 Shandel\u2019s testimony was not admitted to prove Hart\u2019s character in order to show that he acted in conformity with such character. The court explicitly stated that it was allowing Shandel\u2019s testimony in order to rebut Hart\u2019s testimony that the cattle prod was always in Shandel\u2019s house. We think that Shandel\u2019s rebuttal testimony provided the jury with a detailed account of Hart\u2019s presence in her house and Hart\u2019s possession of the cattle prod and was not admitted to prove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Hart\u2019s character. Providing the jury with a reason why Hart was carrying the cattle prod is probative of the fact that Hart indeed had the cattle prod and used it to assault Shandel.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">\u00b628  The probative value of Shandel\u2019s testimony is not outweighed by the danger of any unfair prejudice its admission may have created. It is inevitable that evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts will have some prejudicial effect on a criminal defendant. <em>State v. Southern, </em>1999 MT 94, \u00b6 38, 294 Mont. 225, \u00b6 38, 980 P.2d 3, \u00b6 38. However, relevant evidence will be inadmissible under the fourth part of the Modified Just Rule only when \u201cits probity is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d <em>Southern, </em>\u00b6 38. The prejudicial effect of relevant evidence will substantially outweigh its probative value when such evidence will prompt the jury to decide the case on an improper basis. <em>Southern, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\u00b629 Shandel\u2019s rebuttal testimony was potentially highly prejudicial. Testimony that Hart made his living from shoplifting and carried a cattle prod to prevent others from catching him could certainly prompt a jury to decide that Hart was guilty of assaulting Shandel because he had a propensity for criminal conduct and not because he did in fact assault Shandel. We are not convinced, however, that the prejudicial effect of Shandel\u2019s testimony substantially outweighs its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">\u00b630 Hart contends that the issue of why he had the cattle prod had no probative value because, in order to obtain a conviction for assault, all the State had to prove was that he purposely or knowingly caused bodily injury to Shandel with a weapon. We disagree. Hart misunderstands the central issue of this case: who possessed the cattle prod during the altercation between Shandel and Hart. Rule 404(b), M.R.Evid., explicitly allows for the admission of other wrongs to prove opportunity. By explaining <em>why </em>Hart carried the cattle prod, Shandel\u2019s testimony was highly probative of the fact that Hart was in fact carrying the cattle prod and thus had the opportunity to strike Shandel with it. This testimony directly contradicted the defense\u2019s theory, as testified to by Hart himself, that Shandel owned the cattle prod, that Shandel used it for disciplining her dogs, that the cattle prod was sitting on her dining room table, that she attacked Hart with it, and that Hart injured her in an attempt to take it away from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">\u00b631 The District Court did not abuse its discretion pursuant to Rule 404, M.R.Evid., in admitting Shandel\u2019s rebuttal testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">\u00b632 Whether the District Court erred when it permitted the State to ask Hart whether he believed the State\u2019s witnesses were lying?</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">\u00b633 During the State\u2019s cross-examination of Hart, the prosecution asked Hart if Michelle, Vanessa, and Shandel were lying when they testified that Hart pulled the cattle prod out of his pocket. Hart responded in the affirmative, indicating that each of the State\u2019s eyewitnesses had lied about that fact. Hart\u2019s counsel objected to this line of questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">\u00b634 On appeal, Hart contends that the District Court erred when it permitted the State to ask him whether the State\u2019s witnesses were lying. In support of his argument, Hart refers us to <em>State v. Webb </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 248, 828 P.2d 1351, and <em>State v. Lunstad </em>(1993), 259 Mont. 512, 857 P.2d 723. The State claims that we have not decided whether it is impermissible for the State to ask a defendant whether other witnesses were lying. The State argues that there is a division of authority among other jurisdictions on the permissibility of such questioning and that we should side with those courts which permit such questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">\u00b635 We have not yet decided whether it is reversible error to allow the State to ask a defendant whether other witnesses were lying. In <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 323, 787 P.2d 329, our only decision in which we directly discussed this issue, we were unwilling to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction by reason of the fact that the State asked the defendant whether the State\u2019s witness had lied, because the defendant did not answer the question. <em>Campbell, </em>241 Mont. at 327, 787 P.2d at 332. We also observed that \u201c[w]hen a defendant goes up on the witness stand in his own behalf, and denies the commission of the crime with which he is charged, a very wide latitude of cross-examination is allowed.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>241 Mont. at 327, 787 P.2d at 332 (quoting <em>State v. Rhys </em>(1909), 40 Mont. 131, 136, 105 P. 494, 496).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">\u00b636 In two subsequent decisions, we analyzed whether the State had properly laid the foundation for the admission of evidence by asking the defendant whether other witnesses had lied. We did not determine whether allowing the questioning by itself constituted reversible error. In <em>Webb, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s testimony that the State\u2019s informant had lied was an insufficient basis for the State\u2019s offer of opinion testimony regarding the truthfulness of the informant pursuant to Rule 608, M.R.Evid. <em>Webb, </em>252 Mont. at 256, 828 P.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>1356. In <em>Lunstad, </em>we held that a defendant\u2019s testimony on cross-examination that the victim had lied was an insufficient basis for the admission of the victim\u2019s prior consistent statements under Rule 801(d)(1)(B), M.R.Evid. <em>Lunstad, </em>259 Mont. at 516, 857 P.2d at 725-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">\u00b637 Courts in other jurisdictions differ on whether a prosecutor may ask a defendant if other witnesses have lied. Some courts have held that it is categorically improper for the prosecution to ask a defendant whether a witness has lied. <em>See United States v. Sanchez </em>(9th Cir. 1999), 176 F.3d 1214, 1220; <em>United States v. Boyd </em>(D.C. Cir. 1995), 54 F.3d 868, 871; <em>United States v. Richter </em>(2d Cir. 1987), 826 F.2d 206, 208; <em>Scott v. United States </em>(D.C. App. 1993), 619 A.2d 917, 924-25; <em>State v. Casteneda-Perez </em>(Wash. Ct. App. 1991), 810 P.2d 74, 79; <em>State v. Flanagan </em>(N.M. Ct. App. 1990), 801 P.2d 675, 679. Other courts appear to have held that this line of questioning is categorically proper. <em>See Whatley v. State </em>(Ga. 1998), 509 S.E.2d 45, 51 <em>cert. denied </em>526 U.S. 1101, 119 S.Ct. 1582, 143 L.Ed.2d 676; <em>Fisher v. State </em>(Md. App. 1999), 736 A.2d 1125, 1162-63. Finally, some courts have staked out a middle ground, holding that the permissibility of this type of questioning depends on the circumstances. <em>See State v. Pilot </em>(Minn. 1999), 595 N.W.2d <em>511, 518; People v. Overlee </em>(N.Y.App. Div. 1997), 236 A.D.2d 133, 666 N.Y.S.2d 572, 577; <em>State v. Morales </em>(Ariz. Ct. App. 2000), 10 P.3d 630, \u00b613.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">\u00b638 We disagree with the line of cases which hold that asking a defendant whether other witnesses are lying is always improper. Generally, the rationale of these decisions is that \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions infringe upon the role of the jury to make credibility determinations. <em>See Boyd, </em>54 F.3d at 871 (holding that these questions \u201cinfringed on the jury\u2019s right to make credibility determinations\u201d); <em>Richter, 826 </em>F.2d at 208 (observing that \u201c[djeterminations of credibility are for the jury ... and not for witnesses\u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Casteneda-Perez, </em>810 P.2d at 79 (\u201cUnquestionably, to ask a witness to express an opinion as to whether another witness is lying does invade the province of the <em>jury.\u201d)] Flanagan, </em>801 P.2d at 679 (\u201cit is the role of the jury to determine the credibility of witnesses\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">\u00b639 We are not convinced that permitting the State to ask a defendant whether other witnesses are lying will always impermissibly infringe upon the jury\u2019s role to make determinations of credibility. The difference between the defendant testifying that other witnesses have lied and the defendant testifying to facts which differ from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>facts as testified to by other witnesses is not so great that one line of questioning is categorically improper. Especially in factual situations such as this one, in which the only important distinction between the defendant\u2019s testimony and the victim\u2019s testimony is that each witness is claiming that the other one did it, the difference between the defendant testifying that \u201cyes, the victim lied, she attacked me\u201d or the defendant testifying that \u201cshe attacked me\u201d is, for purposes of the jury\u2019s role in making credibility determinations, irrelevant. In either situation, the jury must still decide which witness is more credible. This is entirely unlike the danger posed by a prosecutor\u2019s comment on an accused\u2019s guilt or innocence which does invade the province of the jury and is an usurpation of its function because the jurors may simply \u201cadopt the prosecutor\u2019s views instead of exercising their own independent judgment as to the conclusions to be drawn from the testimony.\u201d <em>Campbell, </em>241 Mont. at 328, 787 P.2d at 333 (quoting 88 A.L.R. 3d 449, 454-55 (1978)). We do not believe that the jury is likely to simply adopt the defendant\u2019s conclusions regarding the credibility of other witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-4\">\u00b640 We also disagree with those decisions which hold that \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions are always proper. We believe that there may be circumstances in which this line of questioning will be improper because it has no probative value in that it does nothing to assist the jury in assessing witness credibility in its fact-finding mission and in determining the ultimate issue of guilt or innocence. <em>See Pilot, </em>595 N.W.2d at 518. However, we also believe that there may be circumstances in which \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions have probative value in clarifying a particular line of testimony, in evaluating the credibility of a defendant who is claiming that everyone else is lying, or when a witness flatly denies the occurrence of events. <em>Pilot, </em>595 N.W.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\u00b641 For instance, in <em>Pilot, </em>the focus of the defense was that the state\u2019s witnesses were lying and that the evidence against the accused was fabricated as part of a vast conspiracy to convict him of a crime he did not commit. <em>Pilot, </em>595 N.W.2d at 518. The Supreme Court of Minnesota held that it was not error to permit the prosecution to pose \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions during its cross-examination of the defendant because the questions \u201ccould well have assisted the jury in... evaluating his conspiracy theory.\u201d <em>Pilot, </em>595 N.W.2d at 518.</p>\n<p id=\"AUZ\">\u00b642 Similarly, in <em>Overlee, </em>the defendant had testified on direct that a witness for the prosecution was a liar. <em>Overlee, </em>666 N.Y.S.2d at 575. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>On cross-examination, the prosecution asked the defendant whether the prosecution\u2019s witnesses, were lying. The New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, drew a distinction between permissible cross-examination and prosecutorial misconduct, stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\">[A] distinction has to be made between a defendant\u2019s testimony that conflicts with that of the People\u2019s witnesses and yet is susceptible to the suggestion that the witnesses spoke out of mistake or hazy recollection and the situation where, as here, the defendant\u2019s testimony leaves open only the suggestion that the People\u2019s witnesses have lied. In the latter circumstance, the prosecution has the right to ask whether the witnesses are liars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\"><em>Overlee, </em>666 N.Y.S.2d at 576.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">\u00b643  We refuse to adopt a bright-line rule regarding the propriety of questioning the defendant about the truthfulness of other witnesses. Because we hold that \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions are not categorically improper, we commit the decision on whether to allow this type of questioning in any particular instance to the sound discretion of the district court. We will only overturn a court\u2019s decision to admit or deny \u201cwere they lying\u201d questions in those cases in which the propriety of asking such questions is clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">\u00b644  We do not believe that allowing the prosecutor to ask Hart whether the State\u2019s witnesses were lying was clearly improper. As in <em>Overlee </em>and <em>Pilot, </em>the only explanation for the difference between the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses that Hart had the cattle prod in his pocket and Hart\u2019s testimony that the cattle prod had been on Shandel\u2019s dining room table for the past six months was that somebody was lying. The prosecution\u2019s questioning of Hart elicited relevant evidence by focusing the jury\u2019s attention on the central issue of the case. Thus, we conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the State to ask Hart whether other witnesses were lying.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">\u00b645 Whether the State violated Hart\u2019s right to a fair trial when presenting its closing arguments?</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">\u00b646 During the State\u2019s closing arguments, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEh\">But let\u2019s look at what the defendant said. I mean, he didn\u2019t have to get up on the witness stand and testify. He has a right not to do that. But he elected, nevertheless, to get up and tell you his version of what happened. And I submit that most of what the defendant said is completely unworthy of belief and should be rejected by you. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>After all, the defendant is the only one who was allowed to sit through the testimony of every other witness before he got up to testify and, I suggest, had an opportunity to fabricate his testimony based on what the other witnesses said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-4\">\u00b647 The defense did not raise an objection to the State\u2019s summation at trial. For the first time on appeal, Hart contends that the District Court erred when it allowed the prosecutor to observe that Hart exercised his right to be present at trial which provided him an opportunity to fabricate his testimony based on the testimony of the State\u2019s witnesses. The State claims that Hart waived this claim by failing to make a contemporaneous objection and that we should decline to review it under our common law power of plain error review. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"A7K\">\u00b648 Pursuant to \u00a7 46-20-104(2), MCA, \u201cFailure to make a timely objection during trial constitutes a waiver of the objection except as provided in 46-20-701(2).\u201d Hart does not contend that any of the exceptions to the requirement of contemporaneous objection as listed in \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, apply. We have held that, notwithstanding the failure to object to an alleged error and the inapplicability of \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, we may review a claimed error which affects fundamental constitutional rights where failing to review it may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">\u00b649 In order to invoke our power of review under <em>Finley, </em>Hart must \u201cinitially demonstrate that a fundamental right constitutionally guaranteed to him was implicated by the plain error which he claims.\u201d <em>See State v. Pizzichiello, </em>1999 MT 123, \u00b6 11, 294 Mont. 436, \u00b6 11, 983 P.2d 888, \u00b6 11. Hart acknowledges that after the filing of his initial brief the United States Supreme Court rejected this exact claim under the federal constitution in <em>Portuondo v. Agard </em>(2000), 529 U.S. 61, 120 S. Ct. 1119, 146 L. Ed. 2d 47<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>. In his reply brief, Hart limited his claim of error to Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution-specifically, the right to \u201cmeet witnesses against him face to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>face.\u201d Hart observes that we have held that this right is a \u201cfundamental right\u201d which is not included in the federal constitution. <em>See State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 290 Mont. 479, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24, 964 P.2d 766, \u00b6\u00b6 22-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">\u00b650 Hart has demonstrated that his fundamental right to face to face confrontation as guaranteed by Article II, Section 24 may have been implicated by the prosecutor\u2019s summation. As Hart observes, because of the unique constitutional language of Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Portuondo </em>is not dispositive of this issue. <em>See Clark, </em>\u00b6 24. Although we have never held that a defendant\u2019s right to meet adverse witnesses face to face is implicated during a prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, it is conceivable that an accused\u2019s right to face to face confrontation could be burdened by allowing summation comments which negatively remark on the accused\u2019s presence during the testimony of adverse witnesses. We decline to determine whether this potential burden is a constitutionally impermissible one, however, because as addressed below, Hart has failed to meet the second prong <em>ofFinley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">\u00b651 In order to invoke our common law power of plain error review, Hart must also show that \u201cfailing to review the claimed error at issue would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings or compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Pizzichiello, </em>\u00b6 15. The instances in which we have exercised our common law power of plain error review are rare. <em>See Pizzichiello, </em>\u00b6 10 (observing that, as of time of briefing, we had only exercised it in 3 cases out of 14 requests).</p>\n<p id=\"AIo\">\u00b652 Hart has not shown that failing to review the admission of the State\u2019s comments during summation would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial proceedings, or compromise the integrity of the judicial process. Hart maintains that allowing the prosecutor to make such comments during her closing arguments \u201chad the effect of chilling the exercise of his constitutional rights.\u201d However, the prosecutor\u2019s statements could not have \u201cchilled\u201d Hart\u2019s exercise of his right to confront adverse witnesses face to face because those comments occurred during the prosecutor\u2019s summation, after he had already exercised his right to meet adverse witnesses. Furthermore, we are not convinced that by refusing to review this claim raised for the first time on appeal, Hart will have suffered a manifest miscarriage of justice. It is not at all \u201cmanifest\u201d that Hart\u2019s conviction was the result of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>this alleged error. Three eyewitnesses all testified that Hart had the cattle prod in his pocket and that Hart assaulted Shandel with it. We are also not convinced that by refusing to review this claim we will leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of Hart\u2019s trial proceedings or that we will compromise the integrity of the judicial process. We will continue to use our inherent power of plain error review sparingly and only in exceptional cases meeting one of the above criteria. <em>See Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215; <em>see also State v. Dahlin, </em>1998 MT 113, 289 Mont. 182, 961 P.2d 1247 (reviewing claim that defendant did not waive right to a jury trial in writing as required by statute); <em>State v. Weaver, </em>1998 MT 167, 290 Mont. 58, 964 P.2d 713 (reviewing claim that jury verdict may not have been unanimous). Hart\u2019s claim does not present such an exceptional case.</p>\n<p id=\"AUP\">\u00b653 We decline to address Hart\u2019s contention that the prosecutor\u2019s summation violated his right to face to face confrontation as guaranteed under Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution. Hart has failed to demonstrate that this is an appropriate use of our common law power of plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">\u00b654 Whether the District Court erred when it imposed a dangerous weapon sentence enhancement?</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">\u00b655 The District Court sentenced Hart to ten-years\u2019 imprisonment for felony assault with a weapon and enhanced Hart\u2019s sentence by two additional years imprisonment pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA, the dangerous weapon enhancement statute. In <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, 293 Mont. 224, 975 P.2d 312, we held that the application of the weapon enhancement statute to felony convictions where the underlying offense requires proof of the use of a weapon violates the double jeopardy provision of Montana\u2019s Constitution. <em>Guillaume, </em>\u00b6 16. The holding of <em>Guillaume </em>applies retroactively to all cases not yet final. <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>1999 MT 159, \u00b6 13, 295 Mont. 133, \u00b6 13, 983 P.2d 345, \u00b6 13. The State concedes that the District Court\u2019s sentence is in violation of <em>Guillaume. </em>Therefore, we vacate the enhanced portion of Hart\u2019s sentence and remand for entry of judgment consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">\u00b656 Affirmed in part and vacated in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b115-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT, TRIEWEILER, GRAY and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">. In <em>Portuondo, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that a prosecutor\u2019s remarks in summation to the effect that because the defendant was present during the testimony of all the other witnesses he was afforded the opportunity to fabricate his testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s right to be present at trial, right to confront witnesses, or right to due process. <em>Portuondo, </em>120 S.
