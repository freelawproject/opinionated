We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-9\">\u00b62 The sole issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in rejecting Cady\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">\u00b63 In March of 1996, Cady and another man were arrested in a Hamilton, Montana, motel room. The State of Montana charged Cady with possession of dangerous drugs with intent to sell and .with use or possession of property subject to forfeiture. He pled not guilty to the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-11\">\u00b64 Five months later, Cady amended his plea, pleading guilty to the possession charge under a plea agreement in which the State agreed to dismiss the other charge against him and not to seek a persistent felony offender designation. At his change of plea hearing, Cady suggested to the court that he might want a new attorney to investigate \u201csome things [which had] come to [his] attention,\u201d without elaborating further. The court declined to appoint a new attorney without a showing that Cady\u2019s then-counsel was inadequately representing him. Cady also asked that his sentencing hearing be postponed so he could attend drug and alcohol counseling and undergo hernia surgery at the Fort Harrison Veterans Hospital (Fort Harrison) in Helena. The court granted that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-12\">\u00b65 The District Court continued the sentencing hearing for an additional two weeks at the request of Cady\u2019s counsel, to allow counsel time to obtain medical reports regarding Cady\u2019s treatment at Fort Harrison. Cady\u2019s attorney conducted a telephone conversation with Cady\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor at Fort Harrison before the sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>\u00b66 Consistent with the written plea agreement, the District Court sentenced Cady to 20 years at the Montana State Prison, with 12 years suspended, .and recommended that he be placed at the Swan River Correctional Training Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">\u00b67 In July of 1997, Cady filed a pro se petition for postconviction relief with this Court. We dismissed that petition without prejudice in light of the \u00a7 46-21-101(2), MCA, requirement that petitions for postconviction relief must be filed with the sentencing court. Accordingly, Cady refiled his petition in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">\u00b68 The District Court dismissed seven of the eight issues raised in Cady\u2019s petition on the basis that Cady could have raised them on appeal and, as a result, he had waived them for purposes of postconviction relief. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA. The court determined, however, that Cady was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his allegations that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, and appointed new counsel to represent him for such a hearing. At the hearing, the court heard testimony from Cady, his trial counsel, and his sister. Following the hearing, the court denied Cady\u2019s ineffective assistance claims, and Cady appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">\u00b69 Did the District Court err in rejecting Cady\u2019s claim that he was denied effective assistance of counsel?</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">\u00b610 In considering ineffective assistance of counsel claims in postconviction proceedings, Montana courts apply the two-pronged test set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>See State v. Hagen </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 432, 440, 903 P.2d 1381, 1386. Under the <em>Strickland </em>test, the petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Hagen, </em>273 Mont. at 440, 903 P.2d at 1386. In the context of a guilty plea, prejudice is established if the petitioner demonstrates that, but for his counsel\u2019s deficient performance, he would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Bishop v. State </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 100, 106, 835 P.2d 732, 736.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">\u00b611 This Court\u2019s standard of review of a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief is whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. D\u2019Amico, </em>2000 MT 63, \u00b6 7, 299 Mont. 57, \u00b6 7, 997 P.2d 773, \u00b6 7. The credibility of witnesses and the weight to be given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>their testimony are within the province of the trier of fact. <em>State v. Boucher, </em>1999 MT 102, \u00b6 19, 294 Mont. 296, \u00b6 19, 980 P.2d 1058, \u00b6 19. \u00b612 Cady raises two claims of ineffective assistance. First, he argues that his attorney should have moved to withdraw the guilty plea immediately after the plea hearing when, according to Cady, he told his counsel he had been diagnosed as a schizophrenic and asked counsel to move to withdraw the plea. Second, Cady argues his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient because counsel allowed the District Court to sentence him without presenting his medical records from Fort Harrison. Cady contends that, based on the evidence at the hearing on his petition for postconviction relief, the District Court should have allowed him to withdraw his guilty plea and ordered a full psychiatric examination of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b613 With regard to Cady\u2019s first argument, he testified at the postconviction hearing that he told his counsel immediately after the sentencing hearing that he had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. His trial counsel testified, however, that the first time an issue of schizophrenia or other mental illness arose was in Cady\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Counsel further testified that none of his pre-plea conversations with Cady, Cady\u2019s mother, or Cady\u2019s counselor at Fort Harrison had indicated that psychiatric issues might be present other than Cady\u2019s drug and alcohol addictions. He testified that, when Cady asked him immediately after the change of plea hearing if the guilty plea could be withdrawn, he advised Cady it would be extremely difficult to do so. According to Cady\u2019s counsel, Cady was not then angry, bitter, or incommunicative, but merely maintained the attitude he expressed at the plea hearing of wanting to \u201cget this under the bridge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AuG\">\u00b614  The District Court found that Cady\u2019s counsel had a \u201ctenured history of displaying competent expertise in representing and defending criminal defendants\u201d and the record indicated counsel had thoroughly prepared this case for trial. In weighing the credibility of the evidence, the District Court found that no one-not Cady, his mother, or his health care providers-had informed his trial counsel of any psychiatric issues, much less that Cady had been diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Because that finding is supported by substantial evidence and is not otherwise clearly erroneous, we will not disturb it.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">\u00b615 With regard to Cady\u2019s second argument, his postconviction counsel characterizes the Fort Harrison medical reports as \u201cmak[ing] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>it clear over and over again that [Cady] suffered from delusional thinking and other serious mental health problems.\u201d In arguing that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to act on the reports, he speculates trial counsel may have failed to read, or have misread, them.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b616 Trial counsel testified at the postconviction hearing that the partial written reports he had from Fort Harrison at the time of sentencing dealt only with Cady\u2019s substance abuse issues and hernia problem, and did not set forth psychiatric issues. He also testified that, while his efforts to obtain written medical reports from Fort Harrison prior to sentencing were largely unsuccessful, he spoke by telephone with Cady\u2019s drug and alcohol counselor at Fort Harrison, who reported that Cady had done well .in the substance abuse program there and that his hernia had been repaired. The counselor did not mention any psychiatric problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b617 Cady\u2019s trial counsel further testified at the postconviction hearing, however, that the Fort Harrison records he received in the summer of 1998 would have caused him to ask for a psychiatric examination of Cady had he received them earlier. As to that testimony, the District Court found after reviewing the medical records that they did not contain adequate persuasive documentation that an issue existed as to whether Cady lacked the requisite mental capacity at the time he entered his plea. The court found that Cady\u2019s medical records reflected that Cady exhibited delusional and paranoid thinking while he was an inpatient at Fort Harrison, but that a complete psychiatric evaluation and diagnosis was not done. Cady\u2019s medical care providers at Fort Harrison believed he was mentally competent to defend himself in the legal proceedings against him and to make informed voluntary decisions in that regard. The court further found that Cady had not, in fact, been diagnosed a paranoid schizophrenic. These findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record and are not otherwise clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">\u00b618  The District Court determined that Cady failed as a matter of law to establish reliable facts to support his claim of lack of mental capacity. On that basis, it concluded, \u201cthe record reflects that [Cady] is, and was, mentally competent to make informed voluntary decisions on his own behalf throughout these legal proceedings.\u201d We hold the District Court\u2019s conclusion is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\u00b619 As a final matter, Cady asserts he should have been allowed to withdraw his guilty plea after the postconviction hearing and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>court should have ordered a psychiatric examination of him at that time. The assertions however, are more in the nature of requests for remedies than claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. Cady having failed to establish that he was denied the effective assistance of counsel, we hold that the District Court did not err in declining to provide these remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b620 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b293-5\">JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, REGNIER, HUNT and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
