Belgrade School District contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, the statutes which confer authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts, are constitutional. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b62 On August 28,1998, Brad and Heide Haderlie submitted two petitions to Gallatin County Superintendent of Schools Jill Richards requesting that Richards allow the transfer of their property from Belgrade Elementary School District No. 44 to Monforton Elementary School District No. 27, and from Belgrade High School District No. 44 to Bozeman High School District No. 7. The Gallatin County Superintendent held a hearing on the Haderlies\u2019 petitions on September 21, 1998, and subsequently granted their petitions for transfer by order dated October 21,1998.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">\u00b63 On November 17,1998, Belgrade School District filed a petition in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, seeking judicial review of the Gallatin County Superintendent\u2019s decision. The District Court held oral argument on Belgrade School District\u2019s petition on August 23,1999. On October 13,1999, the court issued an Order denying Belgrade School District\u2019s petition and affirming the decision of the Gallatin County Superintendent of Schools. Belgrade School District appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\u00b64 Our review of issues involving constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4. When the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, we begin with the presumption that the statute is constitutional, and the party attacking it has the burden of proving it unconstitutional. <em>Connery v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>1998 MT 125, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 94, \u00b6 9, 960 P.2d 288, \u00b6 9. A statute will be \u201cupheld on review except when proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Montanans for Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Comm\u2019rs, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 11, 296 Mont. 402, \u00b6 11, 989 P.2d 800, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b281-4\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, the statutes which confer authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts, are constitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\u00b66  We have previously held that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, are unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority. <em>Hayes v. Lame Deer High Sch. Dist., </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 204, \u00b6 20, 15 P.3d 447, \u00b6 20, (holding that the statutory precursor to \u00a7 20-6-320(5), MCA, is unconstitutional); <em>Belgrade Elementary and High Sch. Dist. No. 44 v. Morris, </em>2000 MT 347, \u00b6 8, 303 Mont. 245, \u00b6 8, 15 P.3d 482, \u00b6 8, (holding that \u00a7 20-6-213(5), MCA, is unconstitutional).</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">\u00b67 Belgrade School District also contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that the Gallatin County Superintendent\u2019s decision complied with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA. This contention is mooted by our decision that the statutes pursuant to which the superintendent reached her decision are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">\u00b68 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
