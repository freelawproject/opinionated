We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the WCC erred in concluding that Dunnington was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">\u00b63 In the spring of 1994, Dunnington began working for Century Construction, Inc. (Century) as a traffic controller on Century\u2019s highway construction projects. Century generally paid Dunnington $9.00 per hour unless a particular construction project mandated \u201cDavis-Bacon wages,\u201d which were higher. Due to the seasonal nature of the work, Dunnington\u2019s employment with Century ended in the late fall of 1994. In early January of 1995, Dunnington began working for Mor-Berg, Inc. (Mor-Berg), where his job duties included steam cleaning heavy equipment and janitorial work. His employment with Mor-Berg was part-time, on an \u201cas needed\u201d basis, and he was paid $6.50 per hour. In early spring of 1995, Dunnington went back to work for Century on its highway construction projects and again was laid off in the late fall when the weather made the construction work impossible. He returned to work for Mor-Berg in December of 1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">\u00b64 On February.8,1996, when working for Mor-Berg, Dunnington was injured while steam cleaning a construction loader. Mor-Berg was insured by the State Fund, which accepted liability for the injury and paid Dunnington temporary total disability benefits, permanent partial disability benefits and medical expenses. The amount of Dunnington\u2019s disability benefits was determined based on his wages earned at Mor-Berg. Dunnington subsequently filed a petition in the WCC alleging that the State Fund\u2019s determination of his disability benefits based solely on his Mor-Berg wages was incorrect. He asserted that his benefits should be calculated based on an aggregation of both his Mor-Berg and his Century wages because the two compa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>nies were actually one entity or, alternatively, because he was concurrently employed by both companies at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">\u00b65 After a hearing on Dunnington\u2019s petition, the WCC entered findings of fact and conclusions of law. The court determined that Century and Mor-Berg were separate entities and that Mor-Berg was Dunnington\u2019s only employer at the time of his injury. As a result, the court concluded Dunnington\u2019s wages from the two employments could not be aggregated and the' State Fund correctly calculated Dunnington\u2019s disability benefits using only his Mor-Berg wages. The WCC entered judgment dismissing the petition and Dunnington appeals only that portion of the WCC\u2019s decision which concluded he was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">\u00b66 Our review of WCC decisions is twofold. We review the court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether they are supported by substantial credible evidence and we review its conclusions of law to determine whether those conclusions are correct. <em>Hale v. Royal Logging, </em>1999 MT 302, \u00b6 11, 297 Mont. 165, \u00b6 11, 990 P.2d 1245, \u00b6 11. Here, Dunnington does not challenge any of the WCC\u2019s findings of fact and, consequently, our review is confined to whether the court\u2019s legal conclusion that Dunnington was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">\u00b67 Did the WCC err in concluding that Dunnington was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury?</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">\u00b68 The amount of disability benefits paid to a claimant as a result of a work-related injury under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) is determined in relation to the wages the claimant was earning at the time of the injury. <em>See, e.g., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 39-71-701(3), 39-71-702(3) and 39-71-703(6), MCA. Generally, wages are determined by calculating the claimant\u2019s average actual earnings for the four pay periods immediately preceding the date of injury. Section 39-71-123(3)(a), MCA. It has long been the rule, however, that earnings from concurrent employments may be combined when determining a claimant\u2019s wages under the Act. <em>See, eg., Gee v. Cartwheel Restaurant </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 335, 338, 642 P.2d 1070, 1071 (citations omitted). The Montana Legislature codified this rule in 1989 and added it to the Act\u2019s definition of \"wages.\u201d <em>See </em>1989 Mont. Laws, Ch. 333, Sec, 12. The Legislature did not statutorily define concurrent employment at that time. <em>See </em>\u00a7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>39-71-123(4), MCA (1989). In 1995, however, the Legislature again amended \u00a7 39-71-123(4), MCA, to provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-4\">\u201cconcurrent employment\u201d means employment in which the employee was actually employed at the time of the injury and would have continued to be employed without a break in the term of employment if not for the injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Section 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995). The 1995 statute was in effect at the time of Dunnington\u2019s injury and, therefore, it governs the determination of whether Dunnington was concurrently employed at the time of his injury. <em>See Hale, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">\u00b69 In determining the amount of Dunnington\u2019s disability benefits, the State Fund calculated his wages pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-123(3)(a), MCA, by averaging his earnings from Mor-Berg over four pay periods. Dunnington asserted in the WCC that his earnings from Mor-Berg alone did not accurately reflect his actual earnings and the court should apply the \u00a7 39-71-123(3)(b), MCA, exception to the general wage calculation provision. He argued that, because he was employed by both Mor-Berg and Century, the court should determine his wages by aggregating his earnings from both companies as provided in \u00a7 39-71-123(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\u00b610 The WCC found that, at the time of his injury, Dunnington was employed by Mor-Berg, was not employed by Century because he had been laid off at the end of the construction season and his further employment with Century in the next construction season was not guaranteed. Based on these findings and the definition of \u201cconcurrent employment\u201d in \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995), the WCC concluded that Dunnington was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury because he was not \u201cactually employed\u201d by Century. Dunnington asserts that the WCC\u2019s conclusion that he was not concurrently employed is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">\u00b611 Dunnington contends that the WCC misinterpreted the \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA, definition of concurrent employment by reading the phrase \u201cactually employed\u201d as precluding the aggregation of wages from seasonal employment when the claimant\u2019s injury occurred in the off-season of that employment. He argues that the statutory definition of concurrent employment should be interpreted in conformity with prior case law holding that earnings from seasonal employment may be included in determining a claimant\u2019s wages under the Act. In support of his argument, Dunnington cites <em>Gee, Lovell v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 279, 860 P.2d 95, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number><em>Walter v. Public Auction Yards </em>(1979), 181 Mont. 109, 592 P.2d 497. We conclude, however, that these cases are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">\u00b612 While the cases on which Dunnington relies are factually distinguishable from the present case, the most important distinguishing factor is that each of these cases was decided under versions of \u00a7 39-71-123, MCA, in effect prior to the 1995 amendment adding the definition of \u201cconcurrent employment\u201d to the statute. <em>See Gee, </em>197 Mont. at 337, 642 P.2d at 1071; <em>Lovell, </em>260 Mont. at 285, 860 P.2d at 99; <em>Walter, </em>181 Mont. at 113-14, 592 P.2d at 499. Consequently, those decisions did not interpret the phrase \u201cactually employed\u201d as used in \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995), and applicable here. It is well-established that, when determining a claimant\u2019s entitlement to benefits under the Act, we must apply the statutes in effect at the time the claimant was injured. <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 14. Thus, cases addressing different versions of the statute \u2014 especially versions which lack the specific language at issue here \u2014 are of no assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">\u00b613 In addressing whether the WCC correctly concluded Dunnington was not \u201cconcurrently employed,\u201d we must look first to the statutory definition of the term as provided by the Legislature in \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995). <em>See, e.g., In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8. In construing that definition, we must pursue the intent of the Legislature and \u201cwe determine that intent by interpreting the plain meaning of the language used by the Legislature.\u201d In <em>re R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 8. \u201cThe statutory language must be reasonably and logically interpreted and words given their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d In <em>re R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">\u00b6 14  As stated above, \u201cconcurrent employment\u201d is defined, in pertinent part, as \u201cemployment in which the employee was actually employed at the time of the injury ...\u201d Section 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995). The point of contention in this case is the interpretation of the phrase \u201cactually employed.\u201d \u201cActual\u201d is defined as \u201c1. Existing and not merely potential or possible .... 2. Being, existing, or acting at the present moment ....\u201d The American Heritage Dictionary 18 (3rd ed. 1992). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary similarly defines \u201cactual\u201d as \u201cexisting presently in fact...\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 34 (6th ed. 1990). Thus, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995), a claimant is concurrently employed if, when he or she is injured at one job, the claimant has a second job which, in fact, exists at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">\u00b615  Here, the WCC found that, at the time he was injured, Dunnington was employed only by Mor-Berg, he was not employed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Century and his future employment with Century was not guaranteed. The WCC\u2019s findings of fact \u2014 findings which Dunnington does not challenge \u2014 make it clear that Dunnington\u2019s employment with Century did not in fact exist at the time he was injured at Mor-Berg. As a result, Dunnington was not \u201cactually employed\u201d by Century at the time he was injured and, under the plain language of \u00a7 39-71-123(4)(a), MCA (1995), he was not \u201cconcurrently employed.\u201d We hold that the WCC correctly concluded that Dunnington was not concurrently employed at the time of his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-3\">\u00b616 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b287-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
