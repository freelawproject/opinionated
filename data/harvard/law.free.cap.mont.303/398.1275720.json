Maney (Maney) and the Louisiana Pacific Corporation (LP) appeal from the judgment entered by the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, on its order granting summary judgment to Thomas B. Cheff, d/b/a T &amp; S Cheff Logging (Cheff), and denying LP\u2019s motion for leave to file a cross-claim against Cheff. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"Aei\">\u00b62 We address the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Cheff based on its conclusion that the claims raised in Maney\u2019s complaint were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying LP\u2019s motion for leave to file a cross-claim against Cheff?</p>\n<p id=\"b430-13\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b430-14\">\u00b65 Prior to the summer of 1994, Cheff contracted with LP to cut and remove timber owned by LP and located in the Mill Creek drainage in Park County, Montana. Cheff hired Jason Robert Fogleson (Fogleson) to assist in logging the timber. On July 8, 1994, while working for Cheff, Fogleson was injured by a falling tree; he died later that day. At the time of the accident, Fogleson was covered by workers\u2019 compensation insurance provided by Cheff.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-15\">\u00b66 Maney, Fogleson\u2019s mother, subsequently filed a complaint against Cheff and LP for damages resulting from Fogleson\u2019s death, asserting claims based on negligence, loss of consortium, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of the Montana Safety Act. The complaint was filed by Maney individually, as personal representative of Fogleson\u2019s estate and as guardian <em>ad litem. </em>of Fogleson\u2019s minor siblings. LP answered the complaint and asserted various affirmative defenses. Cheff moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that Maney\u2019s claims were barred by the exclusivity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>provision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act (the Act) because Fogleson\u2019s injury and death were compensable under the Act. While Cheffs motion to dismiss was pending, LP moved the District Court for leave to amend its answer to assert a cross-claim against Cheff for indemnity and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">\u00b67 The District Court heard arguments on both motions and, because Cheff had filed an affidavit in support of the motion to dismiss, converted that motion to one for summary judgment. The court concluded that all of Maney\u2019s claims were barred by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision and granted summary judgment to Cheff on that basis. Based on its conclusion that the Act barred Maney\u2019s claims against Cheff, the court also denied LP\u2019s motion for leave to amend its answer to assert a cross-claim against Cheff.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">\u00b68 Maney appeals from the District Court\u2019s order granting summary judgment to Cheff on her negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims which were based on her seeing the severe injuries her son suffered and watching him die in the hospital. LP appeals from the court\u2019s denial of its motion for leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to Cheff based on its conclusion that the claims raised in Maney\u2019s complaint were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Act?</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">\u00b610 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment using the same Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., criteria applied by that court. <em>Sherner v. Conoco, Inc., </em>2000 MT 50, \u00b6 10, 298 Mont. 401, \u00b6 10, 995 P.2d 990, \u00b6 10. In that regard, summary judgment is appropriate only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. Here, the parties do not dispute the material facts and, as a result, we review only whether Cheff is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">\u00b611 The general purpose of the Act is to protect employers and employees by incorporating a <em>quid pro quo </em>for negligent acts by employers. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 17. Employees are assured of compensation for their work-related injuries under the Act and forego other legal recourse against their employer. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 17. In turn, employers are given immunity from suit by an injured employee and relinquish their common law defenses to liability. <em>Sherner, </em>\u00b6 17. In furtherance of this purpose, the Act contains an exclusive remedy provision which states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>For all employments covered under the ... Act... the provisions of this chapter are exclusive. Except as provided in part 5 of this chapter for uninsured employers and except as otherwise provided in the... Act, an employer is not subj ect to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the... Act or for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of such injuries or death. The ... Act binds the employee himself, and in case of death binds his personal representative and all persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or death, as well as the employer and the servants and employees of such employer and those conducting his business during liquidation, bankruptcy, or insolvency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Section 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">\u00b612 Cheff argued in the District Court that Maney\u2019s claims were barred by \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, because they were based on Fogleson\u2019s personal injury and death. The District Court agreed and granted Cheff summary judgment on all of Maney\u2019s claims. Maney asserts the court erred in determining that the Act precludes her from bringing her claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\u00b613 Maney\u2019s first argument is that her emotional distress claims are not barred by \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, because they are psychological injuries which do not come within the purview of the Act. She asserts that a psychological injury such as emotional distress is not an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, and is not compensable under the Act. She contends, therefore, that because her emotional distress claims do not constitute injuries under the Act, they are not precluded by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision. In support of her argument, Maney cites <em>Stratemeyer v. Lincoln County </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 67, 915 P.2d <em>175, Kleinhesselink v. Chevron, U.S.A. </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 158, 920 P.2d 108, and <em>Yarborough v. Mont. Mun. Ins. Auth. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 475, 938 P.2d 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">\u00b614 In <em>Stratemeyer, </em>the plaintiff sued his employer alleging he had suffered severe mental and emotional distress resulting from a work-related incident. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 70, 915 P.2d at 177. The district court granted the employer\u2019s motion to dismiss, concluding that the Act provided the plaintiff\u2019s exclusive remedy. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 69, 915 P.2d at 176. We held on appeal that, because an emotional injury resulting from work-related mental or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>emotional stress \u2014 known as a \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury \u2014 is not an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, and is not compensable under the Act, the exclusive remedy provision did not apply. <em>Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 78, 915 P.2d at 181-82. Thus, a plaintiff with a work-related \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury may bring a tort action against his or her employer to recover damages. <em>See Stratemeyer, </em>276 Mont. at 79, 915 P.2d at 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">\u00b615 In <em>Kleinhesselink, </em>the plaintiff brought suit against his employer alleging both mental and physical injuries resulting from work-related emotional or mental stress. <em>Kleinhesselink, </em>277 Mont. at 160, 920 P.2d at 109-10. In other words, the plaintiff alleged both \u201cmental-mental\u201d and \u201cmental-physical\u201d injuries. We observed that \u00a7 39-71-119(3)(a), MCA, excludes both mental and physical conditions arising from emotional or mental stress from the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d and, as a result, the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmental-mental\u201d and \u201cmental-physical\u201d injuries were not compensable under the Act. Therefore, pursuant to our holding in <em>Stratemeyer, </em>we held that the plaintiff could proceed with a tort action against his employer. <em>Kleinhesselink, </em>277 Mont. at 163, 920 P.2d at 111. In <em>Yarborough, </em>we held that the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly denied a claimant benefits under the Act where the evidence established the claimant suffered from a \u201cmental-mental\u201d injury excluded from the \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA, definition of \u201cinjury.\u201d <em>Yarborough, </em>282 Mont. at 483, 938 P.2d at 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">\u00b6 16 In each of these cases, the issue was the nature of the employee\u2019s injury and whether it was a compensable \u201cinjury\u201d under the Act. If an employee\u2019s injury is not compensable under the Act, the exclusive remedy provision does not preclude a tort action against the employer. Thus, the initial inquiry in determining whether the \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, exclusive remedy provision applies is whether the employee suffered an \u201cinjury\u201d as defined in \u00a7 39-71-119, MCA. Before even reaching the \u201cinjury\u201d portion of the inquiry, of course, it is clear that, to avoid the exclusivity provision, the injuries at issue must be those of the employee. In attempting to analogize her injuries to those at issue in our previous cases, Maney fails to recognize that she was not the injured employee here; Fogleson was. Furthermore, the parties do not dispute that Fogleson\u2019s physical injury and death were compensable injuries under the Act, thus bringing into play the exclusive remedy provision. Consequently, <em>Stratemeyer, Kleinhesselink, </em>and <em>Yarborough </em>do not apply here.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>\u00b617 Maney also argues that the emotional distress claims are outside the purview of the Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision pursuant to our holding in <em>Sacco v. High County Independent Press </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 220, 896 P.2d 411, 417-18, that negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims may be brought as independent, rather than derivative, causes of action. She contends that, because the claims are independent from Fogleson\u2019s injury and neither she nor Fogleson\u2019s siblings have any relationship to Cheff, his employer, the Act and its exclusive remedy provision do not apply. She urges us to adopt the reasoning in <em>Nelson v. Hawkins </em>(D. Mont. 1999), 45 F.Supp.2d 1015, where the federal district court addressed the issue now before this Court and held that independent emotional distress claims brought by an employee\u2019s family are not barred by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision. <em>See Nelson, </em>45 F.Supp.2d at 1021. The <em>Nelson </em>court observed that, pursuant to <em>Sacco, </em>the family\u2019s emotional distress claims were independent from \u2014 and not derivative of \u2014 the injured employee\u2019s claim, were personal to the family and were based on a separate duty owed by the employer to the family. <em>Nelson, </em>45 F.Supp.2d at 1020-21. The court determined that, due to the independent nature of the claim, the <em>quid pro quo </em>policy underlying the Act was not involved and the exclusive remedy provision does not operate to preclude the family\u2019s emotional distress claims. <em>Nelson, </em>45 F.Supp.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">\u00b618 Cheff responds that the legally independent nature of emotional distress claims is irrelevant to'whether the Act precludes Maney\u2019s claims here. He relies on the broad language of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, that employers are not subject to \u201cany liability whatever\u201d for an employee\u2019s work-related injury or death and that, in case of the employee\u2019s death, the Act \u2014 including the no liability provision \u2014 binds \u201call persons having any right or claim to compensation for [the employee\u2019s] injury or death...\u201d From that language, Cheff contends any tort claim which arises collaterally to the employee\u2019s death \u2014 whether considered independent or derivative \u2014 is precluded. Cheff also points to holdings from other jurisdictions that independent emotional distress actions by an employee\u2019s family are barred by workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy statutes, citing specifically <em>Williams v. Schwartz </em>(Cal. App. 1976), 131 Cal.Rptr. 200, <em>Provost v. Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(Wash. 1985), 696 P.2d 1238, and <em>McLaughlin v. Stackpole Fibers Co., Inc. </em>(Mass. 1988), 530 N.E.2d 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>\u00b619 Our analysis of whether \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, bars Maney from bringing an independent tort action for emotional distress against Cheff begins with a determination of the intent of the Legislature as evidenced by the plain meaning of the language used. <em>See In re R.L.S., </em>1999 MT 34, \u00b6 8, 293 Mont. 288, \u00b6 8, 977 P.2d 967, \u00b6 8. \u201cThe statutory language must be reasonably and logically interpreted and words given their usual and ordinary meaning.\u201d <em>In re R.L.S., </em>\u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\u00b620 As stated above, \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, provides that \u201can employer is not subject to any liability whatever for the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the ... Act...\u201d This language is clear and unequivocal. An employer has no liability for an employee\u2019s work-related injury or death which is compensable under the Act. The statute then states that, in case of an employee\u2019s death, the Act binds \u201call persons having any right or claim to compensation for his injury or <em>death...\u201d </em>This also is clear and unequivocal. In the case of an employee\u2019s death, the employer has no liability for any claim of any person for that injury and death. Moreover, in the context of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, no liability \u201cfor\u201d the injury or death means \u201c[a]s a result of; because of\u201d or \u201c[a]s regards; concerning.\u201d <em>See </em>The American Heritage Dictionary 686 (4th ed. 2000). Thus, the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision bars any third party action against an employer for compensation claimed \u201cas a result of\u201d or \u201cconcerning\u201d an employee\u2019s injury or death. Finally, we previously have indicated that the \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, exclusive remedy provision precludes claims against employers by third parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-6\">Our statute rules out \u201cany liability whatever\u201d even before it goes on to state that the employee and those under him are limited to such recovery as the Act allows against the employer. The language \u201cany liability whatever\u201d would be surplusage unless it is read to mean liability not only to the employee and those claiming under him, but also any other party attempting to claim liability against the employer for the same incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-7\"><em>Cordier v. Stetson-Ross, Inc. </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 502, 508-09, 604 P.2d 86, 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">\u00b621 Consequently, the fact that the torts of negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress are independent, rather than derivative, causes of action pursuant to our decision in <em>Sacco </em>is not pertinent to a determination of whether those actions are barred by the Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision. The language of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, precluding \u201cany liability whatever\u201d and binding any person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>having any claim to compensation for an employee\u2019s injury or death neither contemplates nor encompasses technical legal distinctions relating to the independent or derivative nature of a tort created in non-workers\u2019 compensation contexts. Rather, the inquiry to be made in analyzing whether a third party claim for emotional distress is barred by the Act\u2019s exclusivity provision is whether it is a claim for compensation \u201cas a result of\u2019 or \u201cconcerning\u201d the employee\u2019s injury or death. The question, therefore, is whether there is some rational nexus between the third party\u2019s claim and the acts or omissions leading to the employee\u2019s injury or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">\u00b622 Here, while Maney\u2019s claims for negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress are independent tort causes of action, they are logically related to the underlying injury to, and death of, Fogleson. In other words, had Fogleson\u2019s injury and death not occurred, Maney\u2019s emotional distress claims would not have arisen. Thus, her claims arose as a result of \u2014 and directly concern \u2014 Fogleson\u2019s compensable injury and death. Moreover, her complaint does not allege any acts by Cheff resulting in her emotional distress separate from \u2014 or in addition to \u2014 the negligence which allegedly caused Fogleson\u2019s accident. There is a clear nexus between the injury to, and death of, Fogleson and Maney\u2019s emotional distress claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">\u00b623 Other jurisdictions have addressed this issue under similarly broad exclusive remedy provisions and held that independent emotional distress claims brought by an employee\u2019s family are barred. The Washington Supreme Court has held that actions brought by an employee\u2019s family for negligent infliction of emotional distress are barred by Washington\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provision \u2014 notwithstanding that the family\u2019s emotional distress action was separate and distinct from the employee\u2019s cause of action \u2014 because such actions arise out of the employee\u2019s injury or death. <em>Provost, </em>696 P.2d at 1241. Similarly, the California Supreme Court has held that \u201ca claim for negligent or intentional infliction of emotion distress, based on the plaintiff\u2019s having witnessed the physical injury of a close relative, is logically dependent on the prior physical injury\u201d and, as a result, is barred by the state\u2019s exclusive remedy statute. <em>Snyder v. Michael\u2019s Stores, Inc. </em>(Cal. 1997), 945 P.2d 781, 785 (citing <em>Williams, </em>131 Cal.Rptr. at 203); <em>see also Cole v. Fair Oaks Fire Protection Dist. </em>(Cal. 1987), 729 P.2d 743, 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>\u00b624 The Supreme Court of Wyoming also has held that emotional distress actions by an employee\u2019s family members are barred notwithstanding the independent nature of the action, because the actions arise out of the underlying employment and \u201cworker\u2019s compensation benefits cover all injuries having any rational nexus to the employment.\u201d Anderson <em>v. Solvay Minerals, Inc. </em>(Wyo. 2000), 3 P.3d 236, 240 (citation omitted). Additionally, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts has held that a claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress brought by an employee\u2019s widow \u201carose from his injury and ultimate death, and are therefore barred\u201d by the workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provision. <em>McLaughlin, </em>530 N.E.2d at 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">\u00b625 The common thread in the holdings of each of the above cases is the concept that, where the independent emotional distress action brought by someone other than the employee is based on alleged acts of an employer which are the same acts which resulted in the employee\u2019s compensable injury, the emotional distress claims are logically related to \u2014 or arise from \u2014 the employee\u2019s injury. Thus, the emotional distress claims are claims for compensation for the employee\u2019s injury and are barred by workers\u2019 compensation exclusive remedy provisions. The rationale applied in these cases is in accord with our interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">\u00b626  With regard to Maney\u2019s reliance on <em>Nelson, </em>\u201cwe are not constrained to follow the interpretations of Montana\u2019s statutes by the federal judiciary ...\u201d <em>Wetch v. Unique Concrete Co. </em>(1995), 269 Mont. 315, 319, 888 P.2d 425, 427; see <em>also Ridley v. Guaranty National Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 334, 951 P.2d 987, 992. Moreover, <em>Nelson </em>is unpersuasive in light of the fact that the federal district court cited no legal authority in support of its conclusion that \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, does not preclude bringing an independent tort action against an employer when the underlying injury to the employee is compensable under the Act; nor did it take our statements in <em>Cordier </em>into account. As a result, we conclude that Maney\u2019s emotional distress claims are claims \u201cfor the death of or personal injury to an employee covered by the ... Act...\u201d and are barred by the exclusive remedy provision in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">\u00b627 Finally, Maney argues that her claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress is not barred by the Act\u2019s exclusive remedy provision because, pursuant to \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, a separate cause of action may be brought against an employer when an employee is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>jured by an intentional and malicious act. She asserts that her allegations of an intentional tort constitute an allegation that Cheff acted intentionally and maliciously and remove this claim from the purview of the Act. Cheff responds that Maney\u2019s complaint did not allege facts sufficient to support a claim under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"A2q8\">\u00b628  It is a plaintiff\u2019s burden to adequately plead a cause of action. <em>Oliver v. Stimson Lumber Co., </em>1999 MT 328, \u00b6 61, 297 Mont. 336, \u00b6 61, 993 P.2d 11, \u00b6 61. Moreover, while a concise statement of facts upon which relief can be granted is sufficient, \u201c <em>\u2018a </em>complaint must state something more than facts which, at the most, would breed only a suspicion that plaintiffs have a right to relief. Liberality does not go so far as to excuse omission of that which is material and necessary in order to entitle relief.\u2019 <em>\u201dRyan v. City of Bozeman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 507, 512, 928 P.2d 228, 231 (quoting <em>Rambur v. Diehl Lumber Co. </em>(1963), 142 Mont. 175, 179, 382 P.2d 552, 554). In the context of the Act, we have held that something more than mere negligence by the employer must be alleged in order to meet the standard of \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, and avoid the exclusive remedy provision in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA. <em>Kortes v. Pool Co. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 474, 478, 893 P.2d 322, 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">\u00b629  Maney\u2019s complaint states \u201c[t]hat said acts by the Defendants as set out above have proximately caused and resulted in negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, on the Plaintiffs ....\u201d However, the complaint alleges no facts which would establish that Cheff acted intentionally or maliciously in relation to Fogleson\u2019s injury and death. Indeed, the complaint is devoid of any factual allegations of specific acts or omissions by Cheff. We conclude that Maney\u2019s conclusory allegation of an intentional tort, absent any factual allegations regarding intentional and malicious acts by Cheff, is not sufficient to allege a separate cause of action under \u00a7 39-71-413, MCA, and avoid the exclusivity provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">\u00b630  We hold that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment to Cheff based on its conclusion that the claims raised in Maney\u2019s complaint were barred by the exclusive remedy provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">\u00b631 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in denying LP\u2019s motion for leave to file a cross-claim against Cheff?</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">\u00b632 After filing its answer to Maney\u2019s complaint, LP moved the District Court for leave to amend its answer to add a cross-claim against Cheff for indemnity and contribution. The court denied the motion and LP asserts error. We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>amend a pleading to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Hadford v. Credit Bureau of Havre, Inc., </em>1998 MT 179, \u00b6 36, 289 Mont. 529, \u00b6 36, 962 P.2d 1198, \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">\u00b633  Section 39-71-411, MCA, provides, in part, that \u201can employer is not subject to any liability whatever... for any claims for contribution or indemnity asserted by a third person from whom damages are sought on account of [an employee\u2019s] injuries or death.\u201d Here, LP is the third \u201cperson\u201d from whom Maney seeks damages on account of Fogleson\u2019s injuries and death. Having held above that Mane/s claims against Cheff are barred by the exclusive remedy provision in \u00a7 39-71-411, MCA, we conclude that the statute also bars LP from asserting claims of indemnity and contribution against Cheff for those claims. Consequently, we hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying LP\u2019s motion for leave to file a cross-claim against Cheff.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b439-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES TRIEWEILER, LEAPHART, REGNIER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b439-8\">JUSTICE HUNT:</author>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
