Gustafson pled not guilty. The jury found Gustafson guilty of all three counts. The District Court sentenced Gustafson to ten years in the Montana State Prison with two years suspended for the felony assault conviction. Gustafson received an additional consecutive two-year sentence for use of a weapon during the commission of the felony assault and was given consecutive sentences for the other offenses. Gustafson appeals from evidentiary rulings by the District Court and from application of the weapon enhancement statute at sentencing. We affirm Gustafson\u2019s conviction but strike the sentence enhancement for use of a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-4\">1. Did the District Court err when it denied Gustafson\u2019s motions to exclude testimony regarding the events surrounding his arrest?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b418-6\">2. Did the District Court err when it enhanced Gustafson\u2019s sentence for use of a weapon?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b418-8\">\u00b63 On April 13,1998, Michelle Dahl attended a family friend\u2019s wedding reception. After going home and changing clothes, she. went to James Gustafson\u2019s residence. Because Gustafson lived outside of Great Falls, Dahl did not arrive at his house until about 11 p.m. Dahl and Gustafson had been dating for approximately two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">\u00b64 Dahl and Gustafson were sitting on a sofa watching television when Dahl told Gustafson that his guitar was in her car and that she would bring it inside before she left. Dahl testified that Gustafson stood up and said \u201cI am so tired of you hurting me,\u201d kicked her in the chest and knocked her backwards on the sofa. Gustafson then hit Dahl, called her names, and dragged her through the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">\u00b65 When Gustafson went to the bathroom to get a washrag for Dahl, Dahl grabbed her keys from the floor and attempted to escape. As she reached the door, Gustafson grabbed her and threw her back on the couch. Gustafson told Dahl that he hated her, sat on top of her and put his knee on her throat, threatening to choke her if she spoke.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-11\">\u00b66 Gustafson then took a shotgun and put it under his chin with his finger on the trigger and said \u201cI\u2019m going to do it. I\u2019m going to do it.\u201d Dahl begged Gustafson not to kill himself. After a few minutes, Gustafson waived the shotgun around and intentionally fired at the ceiling. Dahl testified that she thought Gustafson would kill her and then shoot himself. Throughout this episode, Gustafson also told Dahl he loved her. Dahl repeatedly asked Gustafson to let her leave.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-12\">\u00b67 After restraining Dahl at his house for approximately four hours, Gustafson agreed to let her leave but again suggested the possibility of taking his own life. Around 4 a.m., Dahl drove home and went to sleep for a few hours before going to work. At work the next morning, Dahl called the Victim Witness Office. Over her lunch hour, she met with two deputy sheriffs. She recounted the events of the previous night and handed over keys she had been given to Gustafson\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-13\">\u00b68 Several officers went to Gustafson\u2019s house. They knocked on the door and announced their presence. After getting no response, the officers entered the house. Deputy Cascade County Sheriff Jim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Panagopolous noticed a loaded shotgun in the foyer. He emptied the shotgun but noticed another shotgun in the living room. Panagopolous also noticed a rifle, with ammunition on the chair next to it, in one of the bedrooms. One of the officers checked the other bedroom door, which was locked. The officers believed that Gustafson was in the locked bedroom and were concerned that he might have additional weapons.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">\u00b69 The officers went outside and took the weapons with them. Officer Panagopolous contacted his captain and explained the situation. It was decided that the officers should knock out a window in the bedroom where they believed Gustafson was hiding. The officers threw a brick through Gustafson\u2019s bedroom window. As the officers pushed aside the blinds covering the window, they heard Gustafson yell \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d The officers explained their presence and told Gustafson that they needed to talk to him about the incident with Michelle Dahl. The officers asked him to come out of his house several times, but Gustafson refused. Gustafson told the officers that he had weapons inside, but refused to specify what type of weapons. Gustafson told the officers that he would only talk to his friend Dennis Kuiper.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">\u00b610 After being contacted by the officers, Kuiper arrived at Gustafson\u2019s house and talked to Gustafson through the window. Kuiper and Gustafson then talked on the front porch for about 30 minutes. Kuiper asked about the hole in the ceiling. Gustafson admitted that he shot the hole in the ceiling during his fight with Dahl. Finally, Gustafson agreed to go to the hospital and Kuiper drove him there. Officers arrested Gustafson for domestic abuse soon after he arrived at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\u00b611 The Cascade County Attorney charged Gustafson with felony assault pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1997), partner/family member assault pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-206(l)(a), MCA (1997), and unlawful restraint pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-301, MCA (1997). Gustafson pled not guilty to the charges. Following a trial, the jury found Gustafson guilty of all three counts. The District Court sentenced Gustafson to ten years in the Montana State Prison with two years suspended for the assault charge and added a two-year consecutive sentence for the use of a weapon pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-221, MCA (1997). The District Court also imposed consecutive sentences for the other two offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u00b6 12 Before trial, Gustafson made a motion to exclude the testimony of Kuiper. Gustafson argued that testimony concerning the circumstances surrounding his arrest was irrelevant and unnecessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>prejudicial. The District Court denied the motion subject to relevancy, stating that Til have to wait and hear the testimony.\u201d However, the District Court invited Gustafson to \u201cobject anyplace that you think is necessary\u201d during the trial. At trial, Gustafson\u2019s attorney did object to the testimony of Kuiper and Panagopolous as it related to Gustafson\u2019s conduct dining his arrest. The District Court overruled these objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">\u00b613 Gustafson now appeals from the District Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings. Gustafson further appeals imposition of an additional two-year consecutive sentence for the use of a weapon in the commission of a felony. We affirm Gustafson\u2019s conviction but strike the two-year sentence enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">\u00b614 The standard of review for evidentiary rulings in a criminal case is whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Gollehon </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 293, 301, 864 P.2d 1257, 1263. The determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be overturned absent a showing of an abuse of that discretion. <em>Gollehon, </em>262 Mont. at 301, 864 P.2d at 1263.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-8\">\u00b615 We review a criminal sentence to determine whether the sentence is lawful. <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A4t\">ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err when it denied Gustafson\u2019s motions to exclude testimony regarding the events surrounding his arrest?</p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">\u00b617 Gustafson contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion to exclude testimony and when it overruled his objections to the introduction of evidence regarding the events surrounding his arrest. According to Gustafson, his conduct, more than 12 hours after the altercation with Dahl, had no relation to the charges against him. Therefore, testimony about the \u201carmed standoff\u201d between Gustafson and the officers at Gustafson\u2019s house was merely calculated to \u201cprovoke the jury\u2019s instinct to punish people who place law enforcement officers in such a dangerous position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">\u00b618 The State argues that the testimony in question was properly admitted as relevant corroborating evidence which was not overly prejudicial to Gustafson. The State contends that the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Gustafson sought to exclude was directly relevant to proving the felony assault charge. Moreover, the State notes that Panagopolous merely testified that he saw numerous weapons when he entered the house while Kuiper made no reference to weapons other than to say that he observed the hole in the ceiling and that Gustafson admitted shooting at the ceiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">\u00b619  At trial, Gustafson conceded that his conduct toward Dahl constituted partner/family member assault and unlawful restraint. Therefore, the felony assault charge remained the only disputed charge at trial. In order to convict Gustafson of felony assault, the State had the burden of proving that Gustafson purposely or knowingly caused Dahl reasonable apprehension of serious bodily injury by use of a weapon. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-202(2)(b), MCA (1997). Relevant evidence is evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence. Rule 401, M.R.Evid. Because Kuiper corroborated Dahl\u2019s testimony that Gustafson assaulted her and fired his shotgun into the ceiling, his testimony was relevant to the felony assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">\u00b620  Relevant evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury. Rule 403, M.R.Evid. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we find no support for Gustafson\u2019s contention that Kuiper\u2019s testimony was overly prejudicial. Kuiper testified that Gustafson admitted shooting a hole in the ceiling with one of his shotguns. That testimony was relevant because it corroborated important elements of the victim\u2019s account. Consequently, we affirm the District Court\u2019s admission of Kuiper\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-8\">\u00b621 However, except for his testimony that he saw weapons in Gustafson\u2019s house, the testimony of Officer Panagopolous was not relevant because the circumstances surrounding Gustafson\u2019s arrest bore no relation to the incident between Dahl and Gustafson. We conclude that the testimony was not relevant pursuant to Rule 401, M.R.Evid., and was therefore inadmissable.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-9\">\u00b622 Nevertheless, even when a district court has abused its discretion by admitting irrelevant testimony, we will not set aside a conviction on that basis unless the error was prejudicial. <em>See State v. Lancione, </em>1998 MT 84, \u00b6 24, 288 Mont. 228, \u00b6 24, 956 P.2d 1358, \u00b6 24. When reviewing error for prejudice, we examine the totality of the circumstances in which the error occurred. <em>State v. Bower </em>(1992), 254 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Mont. 1, 6, 833 P.2d 1106, 1109. We must determine, based on the record, whether the inadmissable evidence might have contributed to a conviction. <em>Bower, </em>254 Mont. at 6, 833 P.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">\u00b623  In the context of the conduct alleged and admitted, we conclude that description of the circumstances surrounding Gustafson\u2019s arrest was not prejudicial. Notwithstanding Gustafson\u2019s claim to the contrary, Panagopolous did not make any reference to an \u201carmed standoff\u201d with police, nor did he otherwise unfairly provoke the jury\u2019s \u201cinstinct to punish.\u201d Gustafson admitted that he committed partner/family member assault and unlawful restraint and Dahl\u2019s testimony provided graphic detail to support the felony assault conviction. By comparison, the circumstances surrounding Gustafson\u2019s arrest were not inflammatory. Accordingly, we conclude that the admission of Panagopolous\u2019 testimony was not reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">\u00b624 Did the District Court err when it enhanced Gustafson\u2019s sentence for use of a weapon?</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">\u00b625  Gustafson was convicted of and sentenced for felony assault based on his use of a weapon, and received an additional sentence for the use of a weapon during the commission of an offense pursuant to the weapon enhancement statute. The State concedes that our holding in <em>Guillaume </em>applies to Gustafson\u2019s case. This Court held in <em>Guillaume </em>that application of the weapon enhancement statute to a felony assault conviction violates the prohibition against double jeopardy found at Article II, Section 25 of the Montana Constitution. <em>State v. Guillaume, </em>1999 MT 29, \u00b6 16, 293 Mont. 224, \u00b6 16, 975 P.2d 312, \u00b6 16. Therefore, we conclude, as we did in <em>State v. Aguilar, </em>1999 MT 159, \u00b6 10, 295 Mont. 133, \u00b6 10, 983 P.2d 345, \u00b6 10, that the illegal sentence enhancement should be stricken and the judgment amended to that limited extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">\u00b626 The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and reversed in part, and this case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b422-10\">JUSTICES NELSON, GRAY, REGNIER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
