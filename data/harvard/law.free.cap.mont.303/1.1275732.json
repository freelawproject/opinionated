Adam further moved to amend his complaint to seek uninsured coverage. Upon cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court found in favor of State Farm Insurance. Adam appeals from that order. We affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">\u00b62 We state the issues on appeal as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">\u00b63 1. Is Adam entitled to underinsured motor vehicle coverage un-</p>\n<p id=\"b32-9\">der policies issued to his stepmother, Joan Meyer?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-10\">\u00b64 2. Is Adam entitled to uninsured motor vehicle coverage when</p>\n<p id=\"b32-11\">the driver of the vehicle was not insured but the vehicle which he was operating was insured by a liability policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b32-12\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b32-13\">\u00b65 The interpretation of an insurance contract is a question of law. <em>See Stutzman v. Safeco Ins. Co. of America </em>(1997), 284 Mont. 372, 376, 945 P.2d 32, 34. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo </em>to determine whether they are correct. <em>See Steer, Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Revenue </em>(1990), 245 Mont. 470, 474-75, 803 P.2d 601, 603. Summary judgment is proper when no genuine issues of material fact exist and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>see also Cecil v. Cardinal Drilling Co. </em>(1990), 244 Mont. 405, 409, 797 P.2d 232, 234. The initial burden of proof is on the moving party to establish that no genuine issues of material fact exist. <em>Sprunk v. First Bank System </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 463, 465, 830 P.2d 103,104; <em>Westmont Tractor Co. v. Continental I, Inc. </em>(1986), 224 Mont. 516, 521, 731 P.2d 327, 330. Once the moving party meets that burden, the burden shifts to the non-moving party to establish the existence of genuine issues of material fact. Our standard of review in appeals from grants of summary judgment is <em>de novo. See Meyer v. Creative Nail Design, </em>Inc., 1999 MT 74, \u00b6 13, 294 Mont. 46, \u00b6 13, 975 P.2d 1264, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">\u00b66 The undisputed facts are that Adam was injured in a car accident on June 21,1997. The medical bills alone for the accident were nearly $100,000. At the time of the accident, Adam and his sister, Amanda, were passengers in a Buick Skylark (Skylark) owned by Amanda and Adam\u2019s father, Norman Meyer. The Skylark was being driven by Olyn Payne. The State Farm policy insuring the Skylark was issued to \u201cNorman Meyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b33-5\">\u00b67 At the time, the Meyers had three other vehicles insured by State Farm as follows: 1984 Chevrolet pickup truck (pickup) with Norman Meyer as the named insured; 1993 Chevrolet van (van) with Norman and Joan Meyer named as insureds; and 1992 Olds Cutlass (Cutlass) with Norman and Joan Meyer as named insureds.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">Relevant Policy Provisions:</p>\n<p id=\"b33-7\">\u00b68 Resolution of the issues presented hinges upon the following definitions contained in the State Farm policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-8\"><em>Relative </em>- means a <em>person </em>related to <em>you </em>by blood or adoption who lives withyoii. It includes your unemancipated child away at school.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYP\"><em>You </em>or <em>Your </em>- means <em>theperson(s) </em>or organization shown on the declarations page as named insured(s). It includes a <em>person </em>regularly residing in the named insured\u2019s household with whom the named insured has a personal relationship arising out of a civil contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM\"><em>Person \u2014 </em>means a human being.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-9\">An <em>underinsured motor vehicle </em>does not include a land motor vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-10\">1. insured under the liability coverage of this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-11\">2. furnished for the regular use of <em>you </em>or any <em>relative.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-12\"><em>Insured - </em>means theperson. <em>ox persons </em>covered by uninsured motor vehicle or underinsured motor vehicle coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-13\">This is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-14\">1. The <em>first person named',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-15\">2. that <em>person\u2019s relatives', </em>and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-16\">3. any other <em>person </em>while <em>occupying:</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b33-17\"><em>a. your car, </em>a <em>temporary substitute car, a newly acquired car </em>or a trailer attached to such <em>car.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b33-18\">\u00b69 1. <em>Is Adam entitled to underinsured coverage under policies issued to his stepmother, Joan </em>Meyer?</p>\n<p id=\"b33-20\">\u00b610 Norman Meyer is a named insured on all four policies. Since Adam is Norman\u2019s son by blood, Adam is a \u201crelative\u201d of Norman and thus an \u201cinsured\u201d under all the policies.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>\u00b611 The question which must be resolved here, however, is not whether Adam is an \u201cinsured\u201d but whether the Skylark is an \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle\u201d under the two State Farm policies which name Joan Meyer as an insured. In contending that Adam is not entitled to underinsured motor vehicle coverage, State Farm relies on the following exclusion in each of the policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-4\">An <em>underinsured motor vehicle </em>does not include a land motor vehicle:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-5\">1. insured under the liability coverage of this policy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b34-6\">2. furnished for the regular use of you or any <em>relative.,</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">\u00b6 12 Adam concedes that since the Skylark itself is insured for liability under one of the four State Farm policies owned by the Meyers, it is an excluded vehicle under subsection (1) of that policy. He also concedes that since he is a \u201crelative\u201d of his father Norman, who is the sole named insured on the pickup, there is no underinsured coverage for Adam on the policy covering the pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">\u00b613 Adam contends, however, that the situation is different as to the policies covering the van and the Cutlass since those policies name Joan Meyer as an insured. He argues that neither he nor Amanda are related to Joan \u201cby blood or adoption\u201d and thus are not Joan\u2019s \u201crelatives\u201d as the policy defines that term. He contends that, when analyzed from the perspective of Joan, the vehicle involved in the accident was not \u201cfurnished for the regular use of\u201d any of Joan\u2019s relatives, and, therefore, was not subject to the exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-9\">\u00b614 Adam argues that the underinsured motorist coverage in the Cutlass policy, for example, only excludes coverage for vehicles furnished for \u201cyou or a relative.\u201d He concludes that, since the Skylark was furnished for the use of Amanda, Joan\u2019s stepdaughter, the underinsured exclusion in the Cutlass policy does not apply to the Skylark. He makes a similar argument for the policy on the van.</p>\n<p id=\"Aa\">\u00b615 The fallacy in Adam\u2019s logic is that he focuses solely on whether Amanda and Adam are \u201crelatives\u201d of the insured Joan. Admittedly they are not.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That proposition, however, only addresses half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>exclusion. The exclusion applies not only to \u201crelatives,\u201d but to \u201cyou.\u201d The question presented here, then, is not whether Joan is a \u201crelative,\u201d but whether she comes within the term \u201cyou\u201d as it is used in the exclusionary provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-4\">\u00b6 16 We determine that Joan Meyer meets the State Farm definition of \u201cyou\u201d in two respects. First, she is a named insured under the Cutlass and van policies. Second, the owner of the Skylark, Norman Meyer, resides in the same household with Joan and has \u201ca personal relationship arising out of a civil contract\u201d with her. That is, Joan is Norman\u2019s wife. Thus, vehicles such as the Skylark, which are furnished for the regular use of \u201cyou\u201d (Norman and his wife Joan) are excluded from the definition of an underinsured motor vehicle. It does not matter that Joan is not a \u201crelative\u201d of Adam or Amanda. Adam\u2019s argument that the policy is ambiguous because it lends itself to a different interpretation depending upon whether or not the provisions are read from the perspective of the insured Norman or the insured Joan is without merit. In light of their marital relationship, it makes no difference from whose perspective the issues are analyzed. As insureds and spouses, both Norman and Joan come within the definition of \u201cyou\u201d and any vehicles (such as the Skylark) which are furnished for their regular use are excluded as underinsured motor vehicles under subpart 2 of the exclusion. Although Adam is not a \u201crelative\u201d of Joan\u2019s, Joan, as an insured under the Cutlass and van policies, is encompassed within the \u201cyou\u201d language of the exclusion. Furthermore, as Norman\u2019s spouse, she (along with Norman and Amanda) has use of the Skylark. Thus the Skylark does not qualify as an underinsured motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b35-5\">\u00b617 Finally, we find no merit to Adam\u2019s argument that the use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d in the exclusion (\u201cfor the use of you <em>or </em>any relative\u201d) creates an ambiguity; that the sentence can be read to both include and exclude coverage depending upon whether it is read from the perspective of Norman or Joan. In <em>American Family Mut. Ins. Co. v. Livengood, </em>1998 MT 329, \u00b6 16, 292 Mont. 244, \u00b6 16, 970 P.2d 1054, \u00b6 16, we addressed the effect of the disjunctive term \u201cor\u201d as used in an insurance policy exclusion.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b35-6\">In its common usage, \u201cor\u201d connotes the disjunctive, and it is used to express an alternative or give a choice of one among two or more things. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1095 (6th ed. 1990). When a provision is written in the disjunctive, it is clear that only one of the separately stated factors must exist.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>\u00b618  There is no ambiguity in the policies at issue. Norman and Joan, either jointly or separately constitute \u201cyou\u201d within the exclusionary language.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-5\">\u00b619 This decision of the District Court granting summary judgment to State Farm on the issue of underinsured motor vehicle coverage is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-6\">\u00b620 2. <em>Is Adam entitled to uninsured motor vehicle coverage when the driver of the vehicle was not insured but the vehicle which he was operating was insured under a liability </em>policy?</p>\n<p id=\"b36-8\">\u00b621 Although the Skylark was insured by Adam\u2019s father, the driver of the vehicle, Olyn Payne, was not insured. Relying on our holding in <em>State Farm Mutual Ins. Co. v. Taylor </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 215, 725 P.2d 821, Adam argues that uninsured coverage applies \u201cwhenever <em>either </em>the ownership, maintenance or use is uninsured.\u201d In <em>Taylor, </em>the vehicle driven by Taylor was rear ended by a vehicle driven by Moss. The Moss vehicle was uninsured but Moss personally had liability insurance. The policy in question stated, as do the policies at issue here, that State Farm would pay damages an insured is legally entitled to collect from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle. The policy then defined \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as a motor vehicle, \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use of which is: (a) not insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>223 Mont. at 217, 725 P.2d at 822. State Farm argued that since <em>the use </em>of the vehicle was insured (by Mr. Moss\u2019 liability policy) there was no uninsured coverage. Taylor argued that under the policy, a motor vehicle is uninsured if the ownership, maintenance <em>or </em>use is not insured. Thus, although the use was insured (through Mr. Moss), the maintenance and ownership were not insured. Therefore, under the disjunctive provision, there was coverage. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b36-9\">This policy does not clearly state whether it provides uninsured motor vehicle coverage when the driver is insured but the ownership of the vehicle is not. We conclude that the policy is ambiguous. We therefore interpret the policy to provide coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b36-10\"><em>Taylor, </em>223 Mont. at 218, 725 P.2d at 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-11\">\u00b622  Here, Adam contends that ownership and maintenance were insured, but use was not, so the result should be the same as it was in <em>Taylor. </em>There is, however, an important distinction between <em>Taylor </em>and the present case. In <em>Taylor, </em>of the three disjunctives, two (ownership and maintenance) were uninsured while one (use) was insured. It was due to this situation that the Court found an ambiguity. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number><em>Taylor, </em>223 Mont. at 218, 725 P.2d at 823. Here, contrary to Adam\u2019s assertions, all three disjunctive aspects are insured. Ownership and maintenance were covered by Norman Meyer\u2019s liability policy on the Skylark. Further, although the driver Payne was not personally insured for liability, he was a permissive user of the vehicle and thus his \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle was likewise insured through Norman\u2019s policy. Furthermore, as set forth in the complaint, the State Farm policy provided liability coverage as a result of Payne\u2019s permissive use. In conclusion, the policy defines \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d as a motor vehicle, \u201cthe ownership, maintenance or use of which is not insured or bonded for bodily injury liability at the time of the accident.\u201d In the present case, all three aspects (ownership, maintenance and use) were insured. Therefore, under the terms of the policy, the Skylark does not qualify as an \u201cuninsured\u201d vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b37-4\">\u00b623 The District Court\u2019s judgment declaring that Adam is not entitled to uninsured motor vehicle coverage is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b37-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES HUNT, REGNIER and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b34-10\">. Using a common sense interpretation, we determined in <em>Stutzman </em>that a spouse is included within the term \u201crelative,\u201d a term defined in the Safeco policy as follows: \u201cRelative means a relative of the named insured who is a resident of the same household.\u201d The definition of \u201crelative\u201d in the State Farm policies presently under consideration is, however, more restrictive. It requires that the \u201crelative\u201d be a person \u201crelated to you by blood or adoption.\u201d A spouse or a stepparent, of course, would not meet the \u201cblood relationship\u201d test under the State Farm policies.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
