Belgrade School District contends that the District Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, the statutes which confer authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts, are constitutional. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b276-10\">\u00b62 On August 7,1997, Allan and Cindy Morris submitted two petitions to Gallatin County Superintendent of Schools Jill Richards requesting that Richards allow the transfer of their property from Belgrade School District to Bozeman Elementary and High School District No. 7. The Gallatin County Superintendent held a hearing on the Morris\u2019s petitions on November 24,1997, and subsequently granted their petitions for transfer by order on December 15,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-11\">\u00b63 On January 14,1998, Belgrade School District filed a petition in the Eighteenth Judicial District Court, Gallatin County, seeking judicial review of the Gallatin County Superintendent\u2019s decision. The District Court held oral argument on Belgrade School District\u2019s petition on March 25,1999. On April 26,1999, the court issued an Order denying Belgrade School District\u2019s petition and affirming the decision of the Gallatin County Superintendent of Schools. Belgrade School District appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b277-4\">\u00b64 Our review of issues involving constitutional law is plenary. <em>State v. Bedwell, </em>1999 MT 206, \u00b6 4, 295 Mont. 476, \u00b6 4, 985 P.2d 150, \u00b6 4. When the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, we begin with the presumption that the statute is constitutional, and the party attacking it has the burden of proving it unconstitutional. <em>Connery v. Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp., </em>1998 MT 125, \u00b6 9, 289 Mont. 94, \u00b6 9, 960 P.2d 288, \u00b6 9. A statute will be \u201cupheld on review except when proven to be unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Montanans for Responsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Comm\u2019rs, </em>1999 MT 263, \u00b6 11, 296 Mont. 402, \u00b6 11, 989 P2d 800, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">\u00b65 Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, the statutes which confer authority to county superintendents of schools to grant or deny petitions to transfer territory among school districts, are constitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">\u00b66 The District Court concluded that the statutes governing the transfer of territory from one school district to another do not impermissibly grant legislative or rule making authority to county superintendents of schools. The court determined that the statutes adequately define the balancing of interests which the county superintendent must perform in deciding whether to grant or deny a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b67  Sections 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, provide that a comity superintendent shall grant or deny a requested transfer of territory \u201cbased on the effects that the transfer would have on those residing in the territory proposed for transfer as well as those residing in the remaining territory\u201d of the elementary or high school district.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b68  We conclude that \u00a7\u00a7 20-6-213(5) and -320(5), MCA, are unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority beyond a reasonable doubt. We have previously concluded that \u00a7 20-6-320(5), MCA, represents an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority. <em>Hayes v. Lame Deer High School Dist., </em>2000 MT 342, \u00b6 20, 303 Mont. 204, \u00b6 20, 15 P3d 447, \u00b6 20, holding that the grant of authority contained in \u00a7 20-6-320(6), MCA (1993), the statutory precursor to this provision, is unconstitutional). Upon reflection, the rationale set forth in the majority opinion of <em>Hayes, </em>as well as the special concurrence of Justice Nelson, controls the case <em>sub judice. </em>The grant of legislative authority contained in \u00a7 20-6-213(5), MCA, suffers from the same constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>deficiency as \u00a7 20-6-320(5), MCA: both statutes confer legislative authority to a county superintendent of schools to grant or deny territory transfer petitions \u201cbased on the effects\u201d of the proposed transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"AM39\">\u00b69 Reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b278-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES GRAY, NELSON, LEAPHART, HUNT and TRIEWEILER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
