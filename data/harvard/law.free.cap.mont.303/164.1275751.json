We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">\u00b62 With regard to the denial of Vernon Kills On Top\u2019s petition for postconviction relief, his appeal raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred when it limited its decision to Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-13\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred when it concluded that Petitioner\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel was not violated?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-15\">\u00b65 With regard to Petitioner\u2019s resentencing, his appeal raises the following issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-16\">\u00b66 3. Whether the District Court erred when it denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for a change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-18\">\u00b67 4. Whether the District Court erred when it admitted victim impact evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-20\">\u00b68 5. Whether the District Court erred when it sentenced Petitioner?</p>\n<p id=\"b197-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b197-22\">\u00b69 Petitioner was convicted of the aggravated kidnaping, robbery, and deliberate homicide of John Martin Etchemendy, Jr. following trial by jury in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County, on August 6,1988. On September 8,1988, he was sentenced to 40 years in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Montana State Prison for robbery, and sentenced to death for the aggravated kidnaping and homicide convictions. He appealed his conviction to this Court and we affirmed. <em>State v. Vernon Kills On Top (Vern) </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 793 P.2d 1273, <em>cert. denied </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 1259, 111 S. Ct. 2910, 115 L. Ed. 2d 1073 <em>(\u201cVernon Kills On Top I\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b610 On February 19,1992, Vernon Kills On Top filed a petition for postconviction relief in the Sixteenth Judicial District Court, Custer County. In that petition, he claimed 15 separate grounds for relief. The District Court dismissed all but part of one claim by summary judgment. The District Court denied the part of his petition which was not dismissed by summary judgment after an evidentiary hearing. In addition, the District Court denied Petitioner\u2019s combined motion to amend claims 2 and 11 of his petition and add claims 16-18, his motion for investigative assistance, his motion for leave to conduct discovery, and his motion for appointment of a psychiatrist. The District Court also denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b6 11 Petitioner appealed. We reversed the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief and remanded for an evidentiary hearing. We also vacated Petitioner\u2019s death sentence as disproportionate to his actual conduct, stating that if his conviction was affirmed on remand, the District Court must resentence him without the possibility of death. <em>Vernon Kills on Top v. State </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 384, 928 P.2d 182 <em>(\u201cVernon Kills On Top II\").</em></p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b612 On remand, the District Court entered an order pursuant to an agreement between the parties regarding the procedures for resolving Petitioner\u2019s postconviction relief claims. On August 13,1998, the District Court issued its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order dismissing Petitioner\u2019s amended petition for postconviction relief. Following the dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief, the District Court scheduled a resentencing hearing. Petitioner moved to exclude victim impact testimony from the resentencing hearing and moved for a change of venue. The court orally denied both motions. The court held a resentencing hearing on November 10,1998, at the conclusion of which it sentenced Petitioner to 40-years\u2019 imprisonment for robbery, life imprisonment for deliberate homicide, and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for aggravated kidnaping, with the sentences to run consecutively. The court denied parole eligibility with respect to Petitioner\u2019s conviction for aggravated kidnaping pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1987). The court also designated Petitioner as a dangerous offender for parole eligibility purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>\u00b613 Petitioner appeals from both the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for postconviction relief and the District Court\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">POSTCONVICTION RELIEF CLAIMS STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b614 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for postconviction relief to determine whether the court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>State v. Wilson, </em>1999 MT 52, \u00b6 11, 293 Mont. 429, \u00b6 11, 976 P.2d 962, \u00b6 11. Petitioner claims that due process requires that no deference be given to the District Court\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law because the District Court essentially adopted the State\u2019s proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law. We have held that a district court does not commit error when it adopts a party\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions where the adopted findings and conclusions are \u201csufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for the decision and are supported by the evidence.\u201d <em>Hans v. State </em>(1997), 283 Mont. 379, 393, 942 P.2d 674, 683. We decline to rule that the court committed reversible error by its adoption of the State\u2019s proposed findings and conclusions. However, we are mindful of the court\u2019s verbatim adoption in our analysis of whether the court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous and whether its conclusions are correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">ISSUE ONE</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">\u00b615 Whether the District Court erred when it limited its decision to Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b616 On July 14,1992, Petitioner moved the court to amend his petition for postconviction relief, adding claims 16-18. The District Court denied Petitioner\u2019s motion stating that his proposed amendments \u201cwould be futile.\u201d On appeal, we held that the District Court erred when it denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to amend. <em>Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 393, 928 P.2d at 188. On remand, the District Court limited its decision to Petitioner\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims and did not address the merits of Petitioner\u2019s proposed claims 16-18.</p>\n<p id=\"A1n\">\u00b617 Petitioner claims that the District Court erred by failing to address proposed claims 16-18 in its Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law and Order dismissing his amended petition for postconviction relief. We agree. The scope of our remand required the District Court to determine whether Petitioner was entitled to postconviction relief on the basis of his proposed claims 16-18. We clearly stated that the District Court erred when it denied Petitioner\u2019s motion to add proposed claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>16-18. <em>Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 393, 928 P.2d at 188. By remanding the District Court to allow Petitioner to add proposed claims 16-18, we necessarily required the District Court to address the merits of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b618  However, we believe that the District Court\u2019s failure to address Petitioner\u2019s proposed amendments was harmless. We have held that postconviction relief proceedings are collateral attacks that are \u201ccivil\u201d in nature and independent of the underlying criminal cause. <em>State v. Garner, </em>1999 MT 295, \u00b6 19, 297 Mont. 89, \u00b6 19, 990 P.2d 175, \u00b6 19 (citing <em>Coleman v. State </em>(1981), 194 Mont. 428, 433, 633 P.2d 624, 627). It is well established that \u201cno civil case shall be reversed by reason of error which would have no significant impact upon the result; if there is no showing of substantial injustice, the error is harmless.\u201d <em>See Newbauer v. Hinebauch, </em>1998 MT 115, \u00b6 20, 288 Mont. 482, \u00b6 20, 958 P.2d 705, \u00b6 20. We note that the resolution of these claims depends solely on documentary evidence in the form of testimony already taken by deposition, affidavit, or at hearing. With respect to record testimony, this Court sitting in review is in as good a position as the District Court to judge the weight to be given to such testimony, as distinguished from oral testimony where the trial court actually observes the character and demeanor of the witness on the stand. <em>See Liberty Northwest Ins. Corp. v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 76, 79, 945 P.2d 433, 435 (reviewing decision issued by Workers\u2019 Compensation Court). Furthermore, Petitioner has not requested that we remand his petition to the District Court for farther proceedings on these proposed claims, but instead presents these issues to us on the merits. Accordingly, we have analyzed the merits of Petitioner\u2019s newly discovered evidence claim, <em>Brady </em>claim, and cumulative error claim to determine whether he was harmed by the District Comb\u2019s failure to address these claims on remand. Upon analysis, we have determined that Petitioner\u2019s proposed claims 16-18 are without merit. Therefore, we conclude that the Petitioner was not harmed by the District Court\u2019s failure to address his proposed claims 16-18 because this error would have no impact on the District Corub\u2019s denial of his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">A. Newly Discovered Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b619 In proposed claim 16, Petitioner claimed that newly discovered evidence in the form of an affidavit of Diane Bull Coming warranted a new trial. Petitioner claimed that in Bull Coming\u2019s affidavit, she admitted that she may have mistakenly misconstrued Petitioner\u2019s nonverbal grunts as an assent to kill Etchemendy. On appeal, we stated that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u201c[s]ince his alleged consent to the victim\u2019s murder served as a partial basis for the District Court\u2019s imposition of the death penalty, and since newly discovered evidence is a justification for postconviction relief, this allegation, if true, could hardly have been considered futile.\u201d <em>Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 392, 928 P.2d at 187. The State contends that the issue in Petitioner\u2019s proposed claim 16 was only relevant to the imposition of the death penalty and, therefore, rendered moot when we vacated Petitioner\u2019s sentence. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">\u00b620 Petitioner\u2019s proposed claim 16 is not relevant to the liability phase of his trial. In an affidavit dated May 1,1992, Bull Coming stated, \u2018When Vem took the blindfold off [Etchemendy], Lester got mad and said Hnow he knows what we look like so we have to kill him[\u2019]. Vem grunted and I, at the time, interpreted this as agreement.... I agree that it is possible that my interpretation could have been wrong.\u201d In his motion to amend, Petitioner claimed that this newly discovered evidence was plainly material to the outcome of his trial because it was the only evidence offered that he had any intent to kill Etchemendy.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b621  Whether Petitioner agreed with Lester Kills On Top that Etchemendy should be killed, however, is immaterial to Petitioner\u2019s conviction for deliberate homicide. To serve as the basis for a new trial, newly discovered evidence must, among other things, be \u201cso material that it would probably produce a different result upon another trial.\u201d <em>State v. Hall, </em>1999 MT 297, \u00b6 54, 297 Mont. 111, \u00b6 54, 991 P.2d 929, \u00b6 54 (quoting <em>State v. Greeno </em>(1959), 135 Mont. 580, 342 P.2d 1052). Newly discovered evidence is \u201cmaterial\u201d if it is \u201cso highly probative of the defendant\u2019s innocence that its introduction probably would produce an acquittal.\u201d <em>Hall, </em>\u00b6 55. Petitioner was convicted of deliberate homicide pursuant to \u00a7 45-5-102(l)(b), MCA (1987), the \u201cfelony murder rule.\u201d The elements of felony murder are as follows: (1) the commission of a felony; (2) death; and (3) a causal connection between the felony and the death. <em>State v. Kills on Top </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 378, 387, 787 P.2d 336, 342 <em>(\u201cLester Kills on Top I\u201d). </em>Pursuant to the felony murder rule, whether Petitioner did or did not agree with Lester Kills On Top that Etchemendy should be killed is irrelevant; proof of intent to commit aggravated kidnaping or robbery is sufficient for conviction. <em>Lester Kills on Top </em>I, 241 Mont. at 387, 787 P.2d at 341-42. Bull Coming\u2019s ambiguous interpretation of Petitioner\u2019s grunt is not at all probative of his innocence. Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial based on this evidence. B. <em>Brady </em>Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>\u00b622 In proposed claim 17, Petitioner asserted that he was entitled to a new trial due to the prosecution\u2019s violations of its duty pursuant to <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 83 S. Ct. 1194, 10 L. Ed. 2d 215, to disclose evidence favorable to the accused and material to the accused\u2019s guilt or punishment. Petitioner asserted that the prosecution failed to disclose evidence that Bull Coming claimed to have been repeatedly raped by a Custer County jailer and failed to disclose evidence that Bull Coming had mutilated Etchemendy. On appeal, we stated that \u201cthis <em>Brady </em>violation was cause to set aside Lester\u2019s death penalty. A similar claim could not have been futile for Vernon when Diane Bull Coming was the only witness who even linked Vernon to Etchemendy, Jr.\u2019s death.\u201d <em>Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 392, 928 P.2d at 187. The State contends that, as we held in <em>Lester Kills on Top v. State </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 32, 44-45, 901 P.2d 1368, <em>1376 (\"Lester Kills on Top II\"), </em>any <em>Brady </em>violations it may have committed with regard to information about Bull Coming are relevant to Petitioner\u2019s sentence, but not to his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b623  Pursuant to the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution, the prosecution must disclose all evidence favorable to the accused that is material to either guilt or punishment. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S. Ct. at 1196-97. This duty applies to proceedings in state court. <em>See Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 45, 901 P.2d at 1377. The prosecutorial duty to disclose favorable material evidence encompasses impeachment evidence. <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 105 S. Ct. 3375, 87 L. Ed. 2d 481. Evidence is material if there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Strickler v. Greene </em>(1999), 527 U.S. 263, 289-90, 119 S. Ct. 1936, 1952, 144 L. Ed. 2d 286; <em>accord Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 42, 901 P.2d at 1374-75. Thus, a <em>Brady </em>violation has three elements: (1) the evidence at issue must be favorable to the accused, either because it has exculpatory or impeachment value; (2) the evidence was willfully or inadvertently suppressed by the State; and (3) the suppression resulted in prejudice to the accused. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 281-82, 119 S. Ct. at 1948.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">\u00b624 We previously discussed the import of this evidence with regard to Lester Kills On Top\u2019s appeal from his denial of postconviction relief. With regard to alleged information that Bull Coming mutilated Etchemendy, we stated that it would be neither exculpatory nor useful for impeachment purposes. <em>Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 43-44, 901 P.2d at 1375-76. We decline the opportunity to reassess the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>value of this alleged information. With regard to Bull Coming\u2019s allegations of sexual assault, we concluded that this information had impeachment value in that Lester Kills On Top could have used it to \u201cattempt to cast doubt on Bull Coming\u2019s veracity or to show her propensity to manipulate <em>others.\" Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 44, 901 P.2d at 1376. We concluded that this information should have been furnished to Lester Kills On Top because it created a reasonable probability that the outcome of his sentence would have been different had it been disclosed. However, we also held that the State\u2019s failure to disclose this information did not create a reasonable probability that the outcome of Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial would have been different had such information been provided to the defense. <em>Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 44-45, 901 P.2d at 1376-77. We observed that although Bull Coming was an important witness for the State, there was an abundance of testimony from other accomplices and our confidence in the verdict was not undermined by the State\u2019s failure to disclose. <em>Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 45, 901 P.2d at 1376.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">1. Bull Coming\u2019s Allegations of Rape</p>\n<p id=\"AQg\">\u00b625 Bull Coming was held at the Custer County jail from October 21, 1987, until she was transferred to the Rosebud County jail on April 7, 1988. After her transfer, Bull Coming told Ron Bromley, a Rosebud County Deputy Sheriff, that she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted by a Custer County jailer. Bromley notified Bull Coming\u2019s attorney, Garry Bunke, about Bull Coming\u2019s allegations, who then called FBI agent Ed Traeger in Billings. The FBI conducted an investigation and subsequently notified the Custer County Sheriff that they would not be pursuing further action. The State never informed Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel about Bull Coming\u2019s allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"A2o\">\u00b626 In order to qualify as a <em>Brady </em>violation, suppressed evidence must be both favorable to the accused and material. <em>Strickler, </em>527 U.S. at 281-82, 119 S. Ct. at 1948. Petitioner claims that this evidence is favorable because of its impeachment value. Petitioner contends that if Bull Coming\u2019s allegation was true, this information could have been used to show that Bull Coming had a motivation to testify falsely in order \u201cto get free of her horrific situation in jail.\u201d However, this claim is factually impossible. By the time Bull Coming testified in either Lester Kills On Top or Petitioner\u2019s trials, held in June and July of 1988, she had already been transferred out of the Custer County jail-she was transferred to the Rosebud County jail on April 7,1988. Furthermore, Bull Coming did not face any threat of being returned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>to the Custer County jail based on the truth or falsity of her testimony. This information has no impeachment value for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"ADQi\">\u00b627 Petitioner contends that if Bull Coming\u2019s allegation was false, it could have been used for three impeachment purposes: (1) it would \u201cdemonstrate Bull Coming\u2019s manipulative nature and her routine lying to get what she wants\u201d; (2) it would contradict Bull Coming\u2019s testimony that it was Lester Kills On Top, and not she, who taunted Etchemendy as to \u201chow he liked raping Indian girls\u201d; and (3) it would show that Bull Coming was the \u201cmoving force behind the crimes\u201d because she had a motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b628 Bull Coming\u2019s allegation, if false, may have had some impeachment value. Whether Bull Coming falsely accused a Custer County jailer of sexually assaulting her does not establish that she had a motive to kidnap, rob, and kill Etchemendy. Similarly, Bull Coming\u2019s allegation, if proven false, does not contradict her testimony that it was Lester Kills On Top and not she who taunted Etchemendy. On the other hand, it is conceivable that had Petitioner\u2019s trial counsel been informed of this information, he could have developed facts which would somehow have indicated that Bull Coming\u2019s allegation was false, questioned Bull Coming about these facts during his cross-examination, and thus attempted to undermine her credibility. <em>See Lester Kills on Top II, </em>273 Mont. at 44, 901 P.2d at 1376 (observing that Lester Kills on Top could have used information about Bull Coming\u2019s allegation of sexual assault to \u201cattempt to cast doubt on Bull Coming\u2019s veracity or to show her propensity to manipulate others\u201d). Arguably, this evidence has some favorable impeachment value.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">2. Bull Coming\u2019s Criminal History</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b629 Petitioner also contends that the State violated <em>Brady </em>by not providing his attorney with Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history. The State argues that Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history has no impeachment value because it was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">\u00b630 Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history has some impeachment value. Aspects of Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history, such as her conviction for forgery, might have been admissible as probative of her character for truthfulness or untruthfulness. <em>See State v. Maier, </em>1999 MT 51, \u00b6 55, 293 Mont. 403, \u00b6 55, 977 P.2d 298, \u00b6 55 (holding that circumstances surrounding a witness\u2019s previous forgery conviction were admissible pursuant to Rule 608(b), M.R.Evid.). Although Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history may have some favorable impeachment value, it has no exculpatory value. We do not believe that Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>be used to disprove that Petitioner participated in the events that led to Etchemendy\u2019s kidnaping, robbery, and death.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">3. Bull Coming\u2019s Background</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b631 Petitioner also contends that the State failed to disclose information regarding Bull Coming\u2019s allegedly violent background, false statements, long standing racial prejudice, contradictions in her testimony, failure to abide by her plea agreement conditions, and \u201cdeception and manipulation.\u201d However, with the exception of Diane Bull Coming\u2019s attack on Roy Dean Bull Coming and a note Diane Bull Coming passed to Petitioner while at the Custer County Jail, Petitioner has not directed our attention to any evidence in the record which would indicate that the State was aware of this information prior to or during his trial and intentionally or inadvertently suppressed it. Moreover, this evidence has no favorable exculpatory value with regard to Petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. For instance, information concerning Bull Coming\u2019s background does not tend to disprove that Petitioner drove the car in which Etchemendy was held and robbed. Petitioner has also not explained how any of this evidence might have been used at the time of his trial to impeach Bull Coming.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">4. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b632 In sum, Petitioner did not establish that the State failed to disclose any exculpatory evidence. However, Petitioner did establish that the State failed to disclose some information which may have been useful in impeaching Bull Coming\u2019s testimony-namely, Bull Coming\u2019s sexual assault allegation and Bull Coming\u2019s previous criminal history. Petitioner contends that the \u201cevidence at trial was weak and circumstantial as it related to [his] involvement in the crimes\u201d and that \u201cthe most damning evidence was the testimony offered by Bull Coming.\u201d Petitioner also states that this information could have \u201cshredded [Bull Coming\u2019s] credibility in front of the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b633 Petitioner\u2019s assertion that the State\u2019s failure to disclose Bull Coming\u2019s criminal history or sexual assault allegation was prejudicial is completely without merit. In no way could the failure to disclose this information \u201creasonably be taken to put the whole case in such a different light as to undermine confidence in the verdict.\u201d <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 435, 115 S. Ct. 1555, 1566, 131 L. Ed. 2d 490. No amount of suppressed evidence merely impeaching Bull Coming\u2019s testimony could establish a reasonable probability that the result of Petitioner\u2019s trial would have been different. Had Bull Coming\u2019s testimony been completely discredited or excluded entirely, an overwhelming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>abundance of accomplice testimony and corroborative evidence established that Petitioner participated in or aided and abetted Etchemendy\u2019s aggravated kidnaping, Petitioner participated in or was accountable for Etchemendy\u2019s robbery, and Etchemendy died as a result of this criminal episode thereby exposing Petitioner to liability for felony murder. <em>See Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 401-06, 928 P.2d at 193-96 (reviewing evidence supporting Petitioner\u2019s conviction while, at the same time, not accepting Bull Coming\u2019s testimony at \u201cface value\u201d); <em>see also Vernon Kills on Top I, </em>243 Mont. at 86-89, 793 P.2d at 1294-96 (discussing the plethora of evidence corroborating the testimony of Petitioner\u2019s accomplices); <em>cf.

The State did not violate <em>Brady </em>with regard to the guilt phase of Petitioner\u2019s trial because any favorable information the State failed to disclose was not material to Petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">C. Cumulative Error</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b635 In proposed claim 18, Petitioner claimed that he suffered a cumulative denial of due process due to all of the circumstances alleged in his previous claims. On appeal, we stated that \u201c[cjumulative error can serve as a basis for reversal.\u201d <em>Vernon Kills on Top II, </em>279 Mont. at 392, 928 P.2d at 187. We do not, however, apply the cumulative error doctrine when no errors have been shown. <em>State v.

Jones </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 121, 124, 923 P.2d 561, 562. The right to counsel protects the fundamental right to a fair trial guaranteed by the Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 684-85, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 2063, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674. The right to the assistance of counsel is of critical importance to a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial because access to counsel\u2019s skill and knowledge is necessary to accord a defendant the opportunity to test the prosecution\u2019s case in our adversarial system. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 685, 104 S. Ct. at 2063. For that reason, the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>preme Court has recognized that the right to assistance of counsel is the right to effective assistance of counsel. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 686, 104 S. Ct. at 2063.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b638 A convicted defendant\u2019s claim that counsel\u2019s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction has two components:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOc\">First, the defendant must show that counsels performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the \u201ccounsel\u201d guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel\u2019s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is rehable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b207-5\"><em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064. Generally, a defendant must establish both parts of the test to prevail. <em>Jones, </em>278 Mont. at 133, 923 P.2d at 567. However, when a defendant establishes that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in that counsel suffered from an actual conflict of interest which adversely affected the defendant\u2019s representation, prejudice to the defense is presumed. <em>See Wilson v. State, </em>1999 MT 271, \u00b6 17, 296 Mont. 465, \u00b6 17, 989 P.2d 813, \u00b6 17. Petitioner claims that his counsel, for purposes of his trial and direct appeal, committed prejudicial errors and that his counsel suffered from actual conflicts which adversely affected his representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">A. Ineffective Assistance Due to Prejudicial Errors</p>\n<p id=\"AsL\">\u00b639 Petitioner contends that John S. Forsythe, his attorney for purposes of his trial and direct appeal, committed two prejudicial errors which denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel. Petitioner maintains that he was prejudiced by Forsythe\u2019s failure to use available impeachment evidence from Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial which would have demonstrated that Bull Coming controlled the other participants in the crimes. Petitioner also insists that he was prejudiced by Forsythe\u2019s failure to fully challenge Bull Coming\u2019s testimony. In order to succeed, Petitioner must establish that Forsythe made errors so serious that he was \u201cnot functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment,\u201d and he must establish that he was prejudiced by Forsythe\u2019s allegedly deficient performance. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S. Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">1. Impeachment Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">\u00b640 Petitioner claims that Forsythe failed to use the trial transcript from Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial to challenge witnesses in his trial. Petitioner refers us to the following impeachment evidence which he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>claims Forsythe erroneously failed to introduce and which caused him prejudice: (1) Bull Coming\u2019s testimony in Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial that Lester beat her up at the Golden West Bar was impeached by the testimony of Steve Hathaway who testified that he saw Bull Coming hitting Lester Kills On Top; (2) Bull Coming testified in Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial that Lester shoved her out of the door at the Golden West Bar while Jenelle Eads testified that she saw blood on Lester\u2019s face; (3) at Petitioner\u2019s trial Bull Coming denied speaking to Etchemendy before he got into the vehicle driven by Petitioner, while Bull Coming told the FBI she had talked to Etchemendy in the Golden West Bar parking lot; and (4) Lavonne Quiroz testified at Lester Kills On Top\u2019s trial that Bull Coming was mad at Doretta Four Bear for running away while in Ashland, Montana. Petitioner insists that this \u201cimpeachment evidence demonstrates that Bull Coming controlled the other defendants including [himself].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b641  We agree with the District Court that Petitioner has failed to establish that, by reason of these alleged omissions, Forsythe\u2019s performance was so deficient as to fall outside the \u201cwide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 689, 104 S. Ct. at 2065. As the State observes, the testimony to which Petitioner has directed our attention has no evidentiary significance with regard to his guilt or innocence. Whether Bull Coming hit Lester Kills On Top in the Golden West Bar; whether she shoved Lester Kills On Top out the door of the Golden West Bar; whether she first talked to Etchemendy in the parking lot or in the vehicle; or whether she was angry at Doretta Four Bear for running away does not tend to disprove that Petitioner participated in or was accountable for the aggravated kidnaping and robbery of Etchemendy which resulted in his death. Moreover, this evidence does not tend to establish that Bull Coming \u201ccontrolled the other defendants, including [him].\u201d Petitioner has not proven that by failing to introduce this evidence, Forsythe\u2019s performance was so deficient that he was \u201cnot functioning as the \u2018counsel\u2019 guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 2064.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">2. Failure to Challenge Bull Coming\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">\u00b642 Petitioner contends that Forsythe committed prejudicial error by failing to fully challenge Bull Coming\u2019s testimony. Petitioner insists that Forsythe failed to investigate Bull Coming\u2019s background, the circumstances of her plea bargain, her prior acts of violence, her criminal background, her history of manipulation, and her history of prostitution. The District Court concluded that Forsythe\u2019s investigation into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Bull Coming\u2019s background was of reasonable breadth and was adequate to allow Forsythe to pursue his strategy of minimizing Petitioner\u2019s involvement in this criminal episode. The court also noted that Petitioner did not establish prejudice in this regard because, at most, such information would have merely tended to portray Bull Coming as a greater actor in the criminal episode than she testified to at Petitioner\u2019s trial-a fact that would have made no difference in view of Petitioner\u2019s liability for Etchemendy\u2019s kidnaping, robbery, and death regardless of the precise nature of each accomplice\u2019s contribution to the criminal episode. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b643 This ineffective assistance claim is essentially the same as Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims. The test for prejudice under <em>Strickland </em>is the same as the test for materiality under Brady. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 694, 104 S. Ct. at 2068. As we stated above in our discussion of Petitioner\u2019s <em>Brady </em>claims, had Bull Coming\u2019s testimony been completely discredited or excluded entirely, an overwhelming abundance of accomplice testimony and corroborative evidence established that Petitioner participated in the series of events which led to Etchemendy\u2019s kidnaping, robbery, and death. Petitioner was not prejudiced by any alleged error Forsythe may have committed in his investigation of Bull Coming\u2019s background.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">B. Ineffective Assistance Due to Conflicts of Interest</p>\n<p id=\"A-U\">\u00b644 Petitioner contends that his attorney, Forsythe, for purposes of his trial and direct appeal, was burdened with two conflicts of interest which denied him the right to effective assistance of counsel. One alleged conflict relates to Forsythe\u2019s campaign for district judge for the Sixteenth Judicial District and his campaign for county attorney of Rosebud County. The other alleged conflict relates to a book Forsythe authored entitled Death Sentence: Murder On the Prairie. The District Court held that Petitioner failed to establish either an actual conflict or any connection between any alleged actual conflict and an adverse effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b645 In <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan </em>(1980), 446 U.S. 335, 348, 100 S. Ct. 1708, 1718, 64 L. Ed. 2d 333, the Supreme Court held that a defendant who did not raise an objection at trial to a conflict of interest arising from multiple representation must demonstrate that an actual conflict of interest adversely affected his lawyer\u2019s performance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We have held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>that in order to succeed on a conflict of interest claim, a defendant must prove: (1) counsel actively represented conflicting interests; and (2) the conflict adversely affected counsel\u2019s performance. <em>State v. Wereman </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 245, 249, 902 P.2d 1009, 1011. If a defendant establishes both elements, we will presume that the defendant was prejudiced by the conflict. <em>Wereman, </em>273 Mont. at 249, 902 P.2d at 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">1. Campaigns for Public Office</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">\u00b646 On March 16,1988, Forsythe filed a Statement of Candidate, announcing his candidacy for district judge of the Sixteenth Judicial District. Forsythe\u2019s campaign advertisements noted that he was the Rosebud County attorney for 12 years with \u201c80% convictions in over 3,000 cases\u201d and that he had authored the book, Death Sentence. Forsythe lost his bid for a district judge position in a primary election held on June 7, 1988. Petitioner\u2019s trial began on July 26, 1988. Forsythe filed a Statement of Candidate, announcing his candidacy for county attorney of Rosebud County on March 9,1990. Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal was deemed submitted to this Court on March 13,1990, and decided on May 21,1990. Petitioner\u2019s petition for rehearing was denied on June 15,1990. Forsythe won the election for county attorney of Rosebud County in November 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">\u00b647  We agree with the District Court that Petitioner failed to establish an actual conflict based on Forsythe\u2019s campaigns for public office. We have previously stated that in order to establish a violation of the right to assistance of counsel based on a conflict of interest, the defendant must establish the existence of an actual conflict, not just a possibility of a conflict, through a factual showing on the record. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 18. Other courts have addressed claims of conflict based on similar facts and have concluded that such claims fail to establish the existence of an actual conflict. For instance, in <em>Garcia v. Bunnell </em>(9th Cir. 1994), 33 F.3d 1193, the Ninth Circuit held that defense counsel\u2019s plan to work for the district attorney\u2019s office at the end of petitioner\u2019s trial did not create an actual conflict of interest. The court concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>that the petitioner failed to establish that his counsel \u201cactively represented competing interests.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>33 F. 3d at 1198. In so holding, the court stated, \u201c[W]e generally presume that the lawyer is fully conscious of the overarching duty of complete loyalty to his or her client.\u201d <em>Garcia, </em>33 F.3d at 1198, 1199 (quoting Burger <em>v. Kemp </em>(1987), 483 U.S. 776, 784, 107 S. Ct. 3114, 3120, 97 L. Ed. 2d 638). Similarly, in <em>United States v. Horton </em>(7th Cir. 1988), 845 F.2d 1414, defense counsel in federal court was a finalist for appointment as the United States Attorney for that district at the same time as he counseled his client to accept a plea agreement. The Seventh Circuit held: \u201cWe will not indulge in the presumption that a defense attorney who is being considered for a position as United States Attorney is unable to represent a defendant in federal court to the best of his ability and with the defendant\u2019s best interests in mind.\u201d <em>Horton, </em>845 F.2d at 1419.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">\u00b648 The fact that Forsythe was a candidate for district court judge and county attorney during his representation of Petitioner does not establish an actual conflict without further support in the record. We agree with the analysis <em>ofHorton </em>and will not presume that a defense attorney who is campaigning for a position as a district judge or a county attorney is unable to represent a defendant to the best of his or her abilities and with the defendant\u2019s best interests in mind.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, the record does not disclose that Forsythe actively represented competing interests. It is not entirely inconceivable that an unprincipled candidate for county attorney or district judge might attempt to curry political favor with the electorate by ensuring that an unpopular client does not escape conviction and then publicizing his or her role in obtaining that conviction. However, Petitioner has not presented us with any evidence that this occurred. A hypothetical conflict is insufficient; in order to succeed, a defendant must establish the existence of an actual conflict, not just the possibility of a conflict, through a factual showing on the record. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 18. As the District Court observed, there is absolutely no evidence that Forsythe\u2019s representation of Petitioner was an issue in either election. Forsythe\u2019s advertising of his success rate as the county attorney of Rosebud County during his campaigns did not raise the issue of his representation of Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>\u00b649 Although we conclude that Petitioner\u2019s claim of a conflict of interest based on Forsythe\u2019s campaigns for public office fails because he did not establish the existence of an actual conflict, we also note that Petitioner failed to establish any effect which resulted from this alleged conflict, let alone an adverse effect. Once an actual conflict is shown, the defendant need demonstrate only that some effect on counsel\u2019s handling of a particular aspect of the trial was likely. <em>Wilson, </em>\u00b6 18. As the State observes, Forsythe\u2019s campaign activity during the period of his representation of Petitioner was insubstantial. Forsythe lost his bid for a position as a district judge prior to Petitioner\u2019s trial. The only actions undertaken by Forsythe with respect to his representation of Petitioner after filing for the county attorney of Rosebud County position were an oral argument on Petitioner\u2019s direct appeal and a petition for rehearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">2. Death Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">\u00b650 Forsythe published a book in 1983 entitled Death Sentence: Murder on the Prairie. In Death Sentence. Forsythe describes the prosecution of Dewey Coleman and Robert Nank for the kidnaping, rape, and murder of Peggy Harstad.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The crimes occurred in Rosebud County, and Forsythe became involved in their prosecution upon assuming the position of Rosebud County Attorney in January 1975. Petitioner directs our attention to the conclusion of Death Sentence, in which Forsythe wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Criminal prosecution at its best creates a naked struggle between good and evil. The good forces use their weapons of scientific investigation, exposure of the truth at public trials and in the media, and the threat and use of punishment against the wicked. The evil forces counter with distortion and lies, secrecy, delay and every device that diminishes the good weapons. Can we doubt that God is involved in these titanic clashes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">It is frustrating to see the evil force apparently succeed, as murderers and other criminals go undetected or are freed on technicalities, and big lies masquerade popularly as the truth. It is most unfortunate in capital cases to have the federal court system duplicate the already redundant, multiple reviews of the state court. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Since we have so little faith in our courts, and since our courts have so little faith in themselves, it is not surprising that our courts are so ineffective.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\">What a shame that Peggy Harstad\u2019s murderers could formulate and carry out her death in a few hours, but our court system waits ten years or more to respond with equal justice. But with our dedicated efforts, I do believe Dewey Coleman will hang.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">John Forsythe, Death Sentence: Murder on the Prairie 89 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">\u00b651 We agree with the District Court that Petitioner failed to establish that Forsythe suffered from an actual conflict of interest based on his statements in the conclusion of Death Sentence. Petitioner contends that Forsythe\u2019s hostile attitude toward the representation of criminal defendants, legal \u201ctechnicalities,\u201d and federal habeas corpus review, as evidenced by the conclusion to Death Sentence quoted above, conflicted with his representation of Petitioner. However, Forsythe\u2019s conclusion to Death Sentence is simply not evidence that Forsythe \u201cactively represented conflicting interests.\u201d <em>See Wereman, </em>273 Mont. at 249, 902 P.2d at 1011. Once again, Petitioner has established the possibility of a conflict, but has completely failed to establish the existence of an actual conflict \u201cthrough a factual showing on the record.\u201d <em>See Wilson, </em>\u00b6 18. In fact, a review of the record leads us to exactly the opposite conclusion. Forsythe\u2019s representation of Petitioner manifests that he was neither biased against criminal defendants as a class nor hostile to the use of \u201clegal technicalities\u201d in their defense. As the District Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">Forsythe raised \u201ctechnical\u201d defenses on Petitioner\u2019s behalf. He argued that the amended information failed to give Petitioner adequate notice of the offenses with which he was charged; that the District court lacked jurisdiction over some or all of the offenses; that Petitioner was denied a speedy trial; that the District Court improperly denied a motion to suppress physical evidence seized at the time of Petitioner\u2019s arrest in Billings; and that the District Court improperly denied a motion to suppress statements made by Petitioner to Federal Bureau of Investigation special agents following the arrest. <em>Vernon Kills on Top </em>I, 243 Mont. at 70-80, 82-85, 793 P.2d at 1282-89, 1290-92. The suggestion that the last page of Death Sentence in some fashion reflects an -unwillingness on Forsythe\u2019s part to advance defenses that might be regarded by the lay public as technical cannot be reconciled with his actions in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>\u00b652 In sum, we conclude that the District Court did not err in denying Petitioner\u2019s request for a new trial. Petitioner is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence because that evidence was immaterial to his guilt or innocence. The State did not violate its <em>Brady </em>obligation because the information it failed to disclose was immaterial to Petitioner\u2019s guilt or innocence. Lastly, Petitioner was not deprived of his right to effective assistance of counsel. Forsythe did not suffer from an actual conflict of interest nor was Forsythe\u2019s performance so deficient as to fall outside the wide range of reasonable professional assistance. Petitioner\u2019s criminal liability for these charges has been tested by a district court trial, on direct appeal to this Court, on an application for certiorari to the United States Supreme Court, in a petition for postconviction relief in District Court, on appeal from the denial of his petition to this Court, on remand to the District Court, and in the instant appeal. Petitioner\u2019s convictions stand; he is not entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">RESENTENCING CLAIMS ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b653 Whether the District Court erred when it denied Petitioner\u2019s motion for a change of venue?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">\u00b654 Petitioner contends that the District Court erred when it denied his motion for a change of venue for the resentencing hearing because, \u201c[a]lthough there was no jury to be influenced by the emotionally charged atmosphere surrounding this case, there was a serious danger that the District Court was improperly influenced by the prevailing climate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">\u00b655 With regard to a motion for a change of venue, we have stated that an accused is entitled to a change of venue when it appears there are reasonable grounds to believe that the prejudice alleged actually exists and that by reason of the prejudice there is a reasonable apprehension that the accused cannot receive a fair and impartial trial. <em>State v. Abe, </em>1998 MT 206, \u00b6 34, 290 Mont. 393, \u00b6 34, 965 P.2d 882, \u00b6 34. We review a district court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for a change of venue to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>Abe, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">\u00b656  Petitioner has not directed us to any evidence in the record that the prejudice he alleged actually existed at the resentencing hearing. He claims that \u201cthe resentencing hearing was revisited with the same air of hostility that the original trial and sentencing proceedings carried.\u201d In support of this contention, Petitioner observes that the victim\u2019s family and supporters were present during the proceedings as was the local me<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>dia. The presence of the victim\u2019s family and supporters and the local media are not reasonable grounds for believing that prejudice in the form of an \u201cair of hostility\u201d actually existed. Nor do we believe that the presence of the victim\u2019s family and the media affected the District Court to the extent that there was a reasonable apprehension that Judge Larson could not provide Petitioner with a fair and impartial resentencing hearing. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in denying Petitioner\u2019s motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b657 Whether the District Court erred when it admitted victim impact evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">\u00b658 Over Petitioner\u2019s objections, the District Court admitted three exhibits offered by the State during Petitioner\u2019s resentencing. The State\u2019s Exhibit A consisted of a transcript of Etchemendy\u2019s father\u2019s testimony given during Lester Kills On Top\u2019s resentencing hearing. The State\u2019s Exhibit B was a videotape showing Etchemendy playing with his children. The State\u2019s Exhibit C was a letter included in Petitioner\u2019s presentence investigation report, in which Colleen Newton, Etchemendy\u2019s widow, expressed her thoughts about how the murder of her husband had affected her and her children\u2019s lives.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">\u00b659 Petitioner contends that the admission of victim impact evidence at sentencing is prohibited by <em>Booth v. Maryland </em>(1987), 482 U.S. 496, 107 S. Ct. 2529, 96 L. Ed. 2d 440. Whether the admission of this evidence violates <em>Booth </em>is a question of law which we will review for correctness. <em>See State v. Clemo, </em>1999 MT 323, \u00b6 5, 297 Mont. 316, \u00b6 5, 992 P.2d 1263, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b660 Petitioner\u2019s claim that the admission of victim impact evidence violated <em>Booth </em>fails for a number of reasons. In <em>Booth, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits a jury from considering victim impact evidence at the sentencing phase of a'Capital trial. <em>Booth </em>is, by its very terms, only applicable to jury sentencing in a death penalty case. <em>Booth, </em>482 U.S. at 503, 107 S. Ct. at 2533 (holding that victim impact evidence is inadmissible in a capital case because it creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk that \u201cthe jury may impose the death penalty in an arbitrary and capricious manner\u201d). <em>See also State v. Langford </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 420, 437, 813 P.2d 936, 949; <em>Vernon Kills on Top </em>I, 243 Mont. at 103-04, 793 P.2d at 1305; Lesfer <em>Kills on Top </em>I, 241 Mont. at 400, 787 P.2d at 350; <em>State v. Dawson </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 345, 360, 761 P.2d 352, 361; <em>State v. Keith </em>(1988), 231 Mont. 214, 237, 754 P.2d 474, 488. Furthermore, we note that <em>Booth </em>has been expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>overruled by <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 830, 111 S. Ct. 2597, 2611, 115 L. Ed. 2d 720.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-4\">\u00b661 Petitioner also contends that admission of Colleen Newton\u2019s letter and the videotape of the victim playing with his children rendered the resentencing hearing fundamentally unfair because he was not able to confront these witnesses. Whether Petitioner\u2019s right to confront witnesses was violated is a question of law which we will review for correctness. <em>See Clemo, </em>\u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">\u00b662  This claim also fails. We have previously upheld the admission of nontestimonial victim impact evidence. <em>See Langford, </em>248 Mont. at 437, 813 P.2d at 949 (letters); <em>Dawson, </em>233 Mont. at 359-60, 761 P.2d at 361 (victim impact statement in presentence investigative report); <em>Keith, </em>231 Mont. at 236, 754 P.2d at 488 (victim impact statement in presentence investigation report). Furthermore, we have held that an offender\u2019s right to confront witnesses and an offender\u2019s due process rights at sentencing are satisfied so long as the offender is informed of the information that will be presented and is provided an opportunity to rebut that information. <em>State v. DeSalvo </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 343, 350, 903 P.2d 202, 206. <em>See also Williams v. New York </em>(1949), 337 U.S. 241, 69 S. Ct. 1079, 93 L. Ed. 1337 (holding that a sentencing judge\u2019s consideration of out of court evidence did not violate defendant\u2019s right to due process). Petitioner was informed of the information that the State planned to present at his resentencing hearing and was provided with ample opportunity to respond to that information. The District Court did not err in admitting victim impact evidence during Petitioner\u2019s resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">ISSUE FIVE</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">\u00b663 Whether the District Court erred when it sentenced Petitioner?</p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">\u00b664 The District Court resentenced Petitioner to 40 years for robbery, life imprisonment for aggravated kidnaping, and fife imprisonment for deliberate homicide, with the sentences to run consecutively. The court denied Petitioner eligibility for parole with respect to his conviction for aggravated kidnaping because \u201chis conduct in connection with such crime was an integral part of the events leading to the victim\u2019s death and because [Petitioner] had the opportunity to take action to terminate the kidnaping and thereby prevent the victim\u2019s brutal and needless death.\u201d The District Court also designated Petitioner a dangerous offender for parole eligibility purposes, stating that he \u201crepresents a substantial danger to other persons or society by reason of his participation in this brutal criminal episode.\u201d The court noted that Petitioner is a recovering alcoholic and has been alcohol-free since his incarceration and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>several certified chemical dependency counselors testified that they believe he is likely to remain sober. The court noted, however, that these counselors also testified that there can be no guarantee of continued sobriety. The court stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of any assurance in this regard and in view of the nature of the conduct for which [Petitioner] has been convicted, he represents a substantial danger to other persons or society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b665 We review a criminal sentence for legality only (i.e.,whether the sentence is within the statutory parameters). <em>State v. Montoya, </em>1999 MT 180, \u00b6 15, 295 Mont. 288, \u00b6 15, 983 P.2d 937, \u00b6 15. Petitioner claims that the application of this standard of review to him violates federal and state constitutional prohibitions against <em>ex post facto </em>laws because the standard of review at the time he committed the offenses was whether the court abused its discretion. <em>See, e.g., State v. Graveley </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 519, 521, 915 P.2d 184, 186. We disagree. A rule of decision is only prohibited as <em>ex post facto </em>if it punishes as a crime an act which was not unlawful when committed, if it makes the punishment for a crime more burdensome, or if it deprives the person charged with a crime of any defense available under the law at the time the act was committed. <em>State v. Leistiko </em>(1992), 256 Mont. 32, 36, 844 P.2d 97, 99-100 (citing <em>Beazell v. Ohio </em>(1925), 269 U.S. 167, 46 S. Ct. 68, 70 L. Ed. 216). Application of our clarified standard of review in <em>Montoya </em>does not punish Petitioner for a crime which was not unlawful when committed, does not make his punishment more burdensome, and does not deprive him of a defense to the crime charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">A. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b666 At the end of his resentencing hearing, Petitioner objected to the evaluation and recommendation contained in his presentence investigation report in that it was \u201cnot based upon the factual information provided to the probation officer\u201d \u201cit\u2019s biased in favor of the State,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s based on hearsay and uninvestigated reports,\u201d and that his criminal history data was not verified. The District Court stated that \u201c[a]s an objection, I overrule it. I will consider it as argument.\u201d The court accepted the report. On appeal, Petitioner contends that he was prejudiced by a biased and partial probation officer who wrote his presentence investigation report.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b667  A convicted defendant has a due process guarantee against a sentence predicated on misinformation. <em>State v. Bauer, </em>1999 MT 185, \u00b6 21, 295 Mont. 306, \u00b6 21, 983 P.2d 955, \u00b6 21. Under the constitutional guarantee of due process, an offender must be given an opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>explain, argue, and rebut any information, including presentencing information, that may lead to a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. <em>See Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22. However, due process does not protect against all misinformation \u2014 rather, the inquiry turns on whether the sentence was premised on materially false information. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22. An offender is under an affirmative duty to show that the alleged misinformation is materially inaccurate or prejudicial before a sentence will be overturned by this Court. <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 22. Furthermore, we have recognized that \u201cwhere a sentencing court is found not to have relied on improper or erroneous information in sentencing a criminal defendant, there is \u2018nothing to correct or rebut\u2019 and, therefore, that the defendant is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds.\u201d <em>Bauer, </em>\u00b6 24 (quoting <em>Coleman v. Risley </em>(1983), 203 Mont. 237, 250-51, 663 P.2d 1154, 1162). Accordingly, in order to succeed on his claim, Petitioner must establish that the District Court relied upon materially inaccurate or prejudicial information in sentencing him.</p>\n<p id=\"A1S\">\u00b668 Petitioner is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds. Petitioner was provided with his presentence investigation report prior to the sentencing hearing and the court provided him the opportunity to explain, argue, and rebut the information contained therein. Petitioner\u2019s counsel extensively cross-examined the author of the report, Probation and Parole Officer Margaret Corbett, and his counsel offered evidence and testimony in support of Petitioner\u2019s position. Petitioner has not established that the court relied on any misinformation in sentencing him, let alone any material misinformation. Therefore, Petitioner is not entitled to resentencing on due process grounds \u2014 there is nothing in the District Court\u2019s sentence to correct or rebut<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">B. Parole Eligibility</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">\u00b669 Petitioner insists that the District Court erred when it denied him eligibility for parole with respect to his conviction for aggravated kidnaping. The court denied Petitioner eligibility for parole because \u201chis conduct in connection which such crime was an integral part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>the events leading to [Etchemendy\u2019s] death and because [Petitioner] had the opportunity to take action to terminate the kidnaping and thereby prevent [Etchemendy\u2019s] brutal and needless death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b670  We conclude that the District Court did not err when it denied Petitioner eligibility for parole with respect to his conviction for aggravated kidnaping. Pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-202(2), MCA (1987), a district court may deny a defendant eligibility for parole whenever it imposes a sentence of imprisonment in the state prison for a term exceeding one year. If the district court chooses to deny eligibility, the court shall state its reasons in writing. The District Court abided by the statutory requirements. The court imposed a sentence for a term of more than one year and stated its reasons for denying Petitioner parole eligibility. Furthermore, the factual basis for the court\u2019s reason is not clearly erroneous. Petitioner\u2019s conduct in connection with the kidnaping was an integral part of the events leading up to the Etchemendy\u2019s death and he did have the opportunity to take action to terminate the kidnaping and prevent Etchemendy\u2019s death. As the District Court noted in its findings of fact, Petitioner drove the car in which Etchemendy was held from Miles City, Montana, to Ashland, Montana; he heard Etchemendy pounding on the trunk of the car in Gillette, Wyoming, and instructed Lavonne Quiroz to move the vehicle to an alley where any noise made by Etchemendy would be less likely to be heard; and he took no action to stop Lester Kills On Top and Bull Coming after they left the bar in Gillette with the disclosed purpose of murdering Etchemendy.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">C. Dangerous Offender</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">\u00b671 Petitioner contends that the District Court erred when it designated him a dangerous offender for purposes of parole eligibility because its designation was unsupported. The District Court designated Petitioner a dangerous offender for parole eligibility purposes, stating that he \u201crepresents a substantial danger to other persons or society by reason of his participation in this brutal criminal episode and for the reasons stated in paragraph 11 of the Findings of Fact.\u201d In paragraph 11, the court found that Petitioner is a recovering alcoholic and has been alcohol-free since his incarceration and that several certified chemical dependency counselors testified that they believe he is likely to remain sober. The court noted, however, that these counselors also testified that there can be no guarantee of continued sobriety. The court stated that \u201c[i]n the absence of any assurance in this regard and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>in view of the nature of the conduct for which [Petitioner] has been convicted, he represents a substantial danger to other persons or society.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AZV\">\u00b672  We conclude that the District Court\u2019s dangerous offender designation was adequately supported. We review a district court\u2019s dangerous offender designation to determine whether the court abused its discretion. <em>State v. Eichenlaub </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 332, 338, 901 P.2d, 90, 94. The court determined that Petitioner represented a substantial danger to other persons or society, thus making him ineligible for nondangerous offender status pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-404(l)(b), MCA (1987). The court cited to specific facts taken from the record when giving its reasons why Petitioner represented a substantial danger. <em>See State v. Collier </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 46, 58, 919 P.2d 376, 384 (stating that \u201ca district court must give specific facts taken from the record of the case as reasons for making its decision\u201d). The facts taken from the record in support of the court\u2019s designation are not clearly erroneous. Petitioner does not contest the fact that he participated in a brutal criminal episode, that he is an alcoholic, that alcohol played a role in the offenses, and that there is no guarantee of his continued sobriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">D. Maximum Sentences to be Served Consecutively</p>\n<p id=\"A-k\">\u00b673 Petitioner contends that the District Court \u201cviolated the principles of inter and intra case proportionality\u201d when it sentenced him to the maximum allowable sentence for each conviction and ordered the sentences to run consecutively. The District Court sentenced Petitioner to 40 years for robbery, life imprisonment for aggravated kidnaping, and life imprisonment for deliberate homicide, with the sentences to run consecutively.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b674 As stated above, we review sentences for legality only. <em>Montoya, </em>\u00b6 15. The District Court did not exceed its statutory authority in sentencing Petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s sentences all fall within the applicable statutory parameters. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-5-401(2), MCA (1987) (robbery punishable by up to a 40-year term of imprisonment); \u00a7 45-5-303(2), MCA (1987) (aggravated kidnaping punishable by death, life imprisonment, or up to 100 years imprisonment); \u00a7 45-5-102(2), MCA (1987) (deliberate murder punishable by death, life imprisonment, or up to 100 years imprisonment). Accordingly, we hold that the court lawfully sentenced Petitioner. To the extent Petitioner\u2019s complaints relate to the equity of his sentence, those complaints are properly addressed to the Sentence Review Division of this Court. <em>See State v. Gordon, </em>1999 MT 169, \u00b6 54, 295 Mont. 183, \u00b6 54, 983 P.2d 377, \u00b6 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\u00b675 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b221-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. The Supreme Court has not decided whether the <em>Cuyler </em>standards apply to conflict of interest claims outside of the multiple client representation context.

Section 46-23-201(1), MCA (1987), conditions parole on the parole board\u2019s determination that, \u201cthere is reasonable probability that the prisoner can be released without detriment to the prisoner or to the community....\u201d Furthermore, subparagraph (2) of the same statute provides that: \u201c[a] prisoner shall be placed on parole only when the board believes that he is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">\u00b679 The issue then is whether there is something about a defendant\u2019s background which presents such a threat to society that the parole board should be precluded from ever considering whether that person can \u201cfulfill the obligations of a law-abiding citizen.\u201d In this case, the District Court concluded that no matter how long Vernon Kills On Top is incarcerated, and no matter how great the degree of his rehabilitation, the parole board should never be allowed to even consider his suitability for reentry to society because of the nature of his crime and the fact that no one can guarantee that he will never drink again.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">\u00b680 Section 46-18-202(2), MCA (1987) provides that the District Court may restrict a Defendant\u2019s eligibility for parole \u201c[i]f the Court finds that the restriction is necessary for the protection of society....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIG\">\u00b681 Section 46-18-404, MCA (1987) provides that Vernon Kills On Top was eligible to be designated a nondangerous offender if he did \u201cnot represent a substantial danger to other persons or society.\u201d The District Court designated the Defendant in this case ineligible for parole based on its conclusion that his conduct was an integral part of the events leading to the victim\u2019s death and because he did not prevent the victim\u2019s death. The District Court designated the Defendant a dangerous offender because of his participation in the events leading to the victim\u2019s death and because there was no testimony that the Defendant\u2019s sobriety could be guaranteed in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">\u00b682 The District Court found as a fact that Defendant participated in the battering and robbery of the victim and used the victim\u2019s credit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>card to purchase gas. However, those findings are not supported by the record of the Defendant\u2019s trial. After thorough review of that record, this Court pointed out that the State\u2019s only witness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-4\">[S]tated that at no time while Etchemendy was in the trunk of the group\u2019s vehicle did Vernon ever strike him, injure him, or take anything of monetary value from him. She agreed that he never initiated talk of murder other than in response to Lester and then said \u2018later.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ajy\">Kills <em>On Top v. State </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 384, 406, 928 P.2d 182, 196.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AB7\">The only reliable evidence is that Diane Bull Coming confiscated Etchemendy\u2019s credit card and that Diane and Lester cashed Etchemendy\u2019s checks and divided the money. While a portion of the money was given to Vernon, he misplaced it, and even that portion was subsequently retrieved by Diane. Neither is the dissent correct when it repeats the allegation from this Court\u2019s previous opinion that Vernon did nothing in the pre-murder stages to prevent the homicide. According to even Diane\u2019s testimony, Vernon repeatedly stalled suggestions that Etchemendy be murdered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-5\"><em>Kills On Top, </em>279 Mont. at 408, 928 P.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"A-1\">\u00b683 The District Court, as did the dissent <em>in Kills On Top v. State, </em>clung to discredited facts reported in this Court\u2019s original opinion found at <em>State v. Vernon Kills On Top </em>(1990), 243 Mont. 56, 793 P.2d 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">\u00b684 Upon thorough review of the actual record this Court concluded in <em>Kills On Top II </em>that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">Based on even Diane\u2019s testimony, Vernon Kills On Top was not present when Etchemendy was killed, and he did not participate in any act which caused Etchemendy\u2019s death. While she did testify that on two separate occasions he agreed that something would have to be done with the victim, she also testified that he sought to postpone any further harm to the victim and that after his expression of reluctance, she and Lester took the victim to another location where Lester performed the murderous act himself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-9\"><em>Kills On Top, </em>279 Mont. at 405, 928 P.2d at 195.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-10\">However, while Etchemendy was in the trunk, it was Vernon who let him out to go to the bathroom; Vernon who checked on his condition; and Vernon who incurred his brother\u2019s wrath by removing Etchemendy\u2019s blindfold so that he could go to the bathroom</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aso\"><em>Kills On Top, </em>279 Mont. at 408, 928 P.2d at 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-11\">\u00b685 Therefore, when the District Court concludes that no matter how long the Defendant has been imprisoned, and no matter the degree of his rehabilitation, he will still be \u201ca substantial danger to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>other persons\u201d and his lifetime imprisonment is necessary for the \u201cprotection of society\u201d and then bases those conclusions on findings that the Defendant battered and robbed his victim, used his credit card to purchase gas, and did nothing to avoid his death, the District Court\u2019s conclusions were based on findings that are clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b686 Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Defendant can never be eligible for release because no one can guarantee that he will never drink again is completely arbitrary, ignores the best evidence available regarding an alcoholic\u2019s rehabilitation and condemns every criminal defendant who has ever had an associated drinking problem to a denial of parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b687 No court could ever be presented with stronger evidence of an alcoholic\u2019s rehabilitation than was presented to the District Court in this case. Four different chemical dependency or substance abuse counselors testified at the Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing. None expressed the remotest concern that Vernon Kills On Top would resume drinking if released from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">\u00b688 Miles Finly, a certified chemical dependency counselor at Montana State Prison described the Defendant as a positive role model for other inmates who would make a model citizen if released from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u00b689 Ginger Faver, who is also a certified chemical dependency counselor at Montana State Prison, described the Defendant as \u201can inspiration\u201d to other inmates and stated that she \u201cwould be very comfortable having Vern be a neighbor.\u201d She said that she trusted him and would have no qualms about his release from prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">\u00b690 William Martin is a chemical dependency counselor at Montana State Prison. He described his selection of the Defendant as an assistant to help in the rehabilitation of others and explained that he has received treatment to help avoid relapsing to alcohol abuse that was unavailable outside the prison. He testified that his rehabilitation was \u201c[a]s good as or as better as anybody else I have ever seen.\u201d He described the Defendant as \u201chead and shoulder above any inmate I know.\u201d He stated that if released from prison the Defendant would be a \u201cmodel citizen.

Other prison employees were interviewed as part of the presentence investigation. All were unanimous in their praise of the Defendant as a model inmate with no infractions in over ten years who performed a constructive role at the prison and who by all appearances has been rehabilitated from a life set in motion by his own childhood of abuse, neglect, and poverty, and his adulthood dependence on alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b694 In sum, more could not have been shown to demonstrate that at least at some point in his life, Vernon Kills On Top should be allowed to appear before the parole board and give them the opportunity to consider whether after many years of imprisonment, rehabilitation, and positive contributions to the prison administration and the rehabilitation of other inmates he could be released \u201cwithout detriment to the prisoner or to the community\u2019 and \u201cthat he is able and willing to fulfill the obligations of a law abiding citizen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">\u00b695 The District Court ignored the evidence presented at the Defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing and resurrected discredited findings regarding the Defendant\u2019s participation in the events which led to his imprisonment in order to support its conclusion that he should be ineligibile for parole. Therefore, I conclude that that conclusion was based on findings which are not supported by substantial evidence and are clearly erroneous. For the reasons set forth in this opinion, I dissent from the majoritys conclusion to the contrary. I would reverse the District Court\u2019s determination that at no time during the remainder of his life, regardless of how he lives the remainder of his life, should Vernon Kills On Top be eligible to rejoin society.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
