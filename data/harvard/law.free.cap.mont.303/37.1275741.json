Following a jury trial, damages were awarded against Karns but none were awarded against Gondeiro. The District Court granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for a new trial of the claim against Gondeiro, who appeals the District Court\u2019s order. We affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u00b62 The following issues are presented for review:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\u00b63 1. Have Armstrong\u2019s claims against Gondeiro been satisfied by the judgment paid by Karns?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-11\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b69-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b69-13\">\u00b66 On November 14,1997, Vivian Armstrong filed a complaint in which she named Donna Karns and Donald Gondeiro as Defendants. Armstrong alleged that on November 18, 1994, Karns negligently drove her vehicle into the rear of the vehicle in which Armstrong was a passenger and injured her. Armstrong also alleged that on April 10, 1995, while she was crossing a street, Gondeiro negligently struck her with his vehicle and injured her. Armstrong alleged that her injury that resulted from each incident was indivisible and that, therefore, both Karns and Gondeiro were liable for the entire amount of her damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-14\">\u00b67 On January 15,1999, Karns moved the District Court for an order granting each Defendant four peremptory challenges to the jury panel. Karns asserted that Gondeiro\u2019s and her theories were adverse to each other. Gondeiro joined Karns\u2019 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-15\">\u00b68 On February 1,1999, the District Court entered its pretrial order. The parties agreed that Karns was negligent and that as a result Armstrong was injured. Karns contested only the amount of Armstrong\u2019s damages. Gondeiro, however, denied that he was negligent and denied that he injured Armstrong. The District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>granted Karns\u2019 motion and awarded both Karns and Gondeiro four peremptory challenges to the jury panel. The District Court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEl\">The interests of the defendants are hostile. Each defendant is attempting to pass the blame off to the other defendant by asserting that the plaintiff\u2019s damages are related to either the first or the second accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">\u00b69 At the conclusion of the evidence, the District Court held that Gondeiro was negligent as a matter of law, however, following trial, the jury found that Gondeiro\u2019s negligence did not cause injury to Armstrong. The jury found that Karns\u2019 negligence did cause injury to Armstrong and that Armstrong\u2019s damages were $43,737.04.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">\u00b610 Following the jury verdict, Armstrong moved for a new trial because the District Court granted both Karns and Gondeiro four peremptory challenges. On April 22, 1999, the District Court granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for a new trial. It stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-7\">[T]he Defendants were each addressing completely different issues. Karns had already admitted liability and was litigating only the issue of damages; whereas, Gondeiro was addressing the issue of causation, i.e., did his negligence on April 10, 1995, cause Armstrong\u2019s injuries. In seeking additional peremptory challenges, Karns and Gondeiro attempted to show that their interests were requisitely hostile to each other. However, aside from denying their own negligence was the cause of Armstrong\u2019s injuries, Karns and Gondeiro\u2019s only evidence to support a finding of hostility is that Gondeiro pursued a course of discovery to establish that Armstrong\u2019s injuries were' preexisting.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-8\">Gondeiro now appeals from the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">\u00b611 Have Armstrong\u2019s claims against Gondeiro been satisfied by the judgment paid by Karns?</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">\u00b612 Gondeiro\u2019s first argument on appeal is that since damages allegedly caused by Karns and Gondeiro were indivisible, payment of the judgment entered against Karns satisfied any claim against Gondeiro. Whether Armstrong\u2019s acceptance of the judgment satisfies her claim against Gondeiro is an issue of law. The standard of review of a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County v. Union Reserve Coal Co. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 459, 469, 898 P.2d 680, 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>\u00b613  Gondeiro takes the position that Armstrong\u2019s claims were satisfied by Armstrong\u2019s acceptance of the judgment, based on his assumption that the jury applied the \u201csingle indivisible injury rule.\u201d The single indivisible injury rule can apply even though there is no concert of action between the defendants. <em>Azure v. City of Billings </em>(1979), 182 Mont. 234, 251, 596 P.2d 460, 470. The rule serves to shift the burden of proving the divisibility of an injury to defendants who have, by separate acts, been found to have caused injury to the plaintiff. Azure, 182 Mont. at 253, 596 P.2d at 471. If the harm is not divisible between the defendants, then joint and several liability will be imposed on both. <em>Azure, </em>182 Mont. at 251, 596 P.2d at 470. Gondeiro asserts that application of the single indivisible injury rule should preclude Armstrong\u2019s claims against him. While we agree with Gondeiro\u2019s characterization of the single indivisible injury rule, we conclude that it does not bar Armstrong\u2019s claims because, as illustrated by the jury instructions, the rule was not applied by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"A3\">\u00b614 Specifically, jury instruction No. 9 directed the jury to find one award of total damages <em>\u201cif </em>you find that the acts or omissions <em>of each Defendant </em>were a cause of Plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Instruction No. 28 allowed the jury to render a single sum verdict only \u201c[if] you find that Vivian Armstrong is entitled to recover damages <em>against more than one defendant.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u00b615  Gondeiro\u2019s argument ignores the jury\u2019s determination that his negligence did not cause Armstrong\u2019s injuries and therefore did not award damages that he obviously caused. For example, the uncontroverted evidence at trial was that Armstrong received medical treatment as a result of the Gondeiro accident, including $520.42 for an ambulance and $3693.09 for hospital services from April 10 to 12, 1995. These damages were obviously not attributable to Karns. The jury awarded damages for only the injury caused by Karns because it found no injury was caused by Gondeiro. Therefore, the District Court properly held that satisfaction of the judgment against Karns did not satisfy all damage claims against Gondeiro.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">\u00b616 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for a new trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">\u00b617 We review a district court order granting a new trial pursuant to \u00a7 25-11-102(1) and (7), MCA, for a manifest abuse of discretion. <em>Benson v. Heritage Inn, Inc., </em>1998 MT 330, \u00b6 13, 292 Mont. 268, \u00b6 13, 971 P.2d 1227, \u00b6 13. \u201cThe decision to grant or deny a new trial is</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent a showing of manifest abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Baxter v. Archie Cochrane Motors, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 286, 287-88, 895 P.2d 631, 632.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">\u00b618 Section 25-11-102, MCA, provides the grounds for a new trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC_\">The former verdict or other decision may be vacated and a new trial granted on the application of the party aggrieved for any of the following causes materially affecting the substantial rights of such party:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">(7) error in law occurring at the trial and excepted to by the party making the application.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">\u00b6 19 Gondeiro contends that the District Court abused its discretion when it concluded that it had erred when it granted each Defendant four peremptory challenges. Armstrong responds that the District Court\u2019s conclusion was correct because the Defendants\u2019 positions were not hostile.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">\u00b620 The role of a jury in both civil and criminal cases is to resolve disputed issues of fact. <em>State v. DeVore, </em>1998 MT 340, \u00b6 37, 292 Mont. 325, \u00b6 37, 972 P.2d 816, \u00b6 37. Where issues of fact exist, the jury is the ultimate trier of the case and fairness requires that both parties have an equal opportunity to shape the jury\u2019s composition by being provided an equal number of peremptory challenges. DeVore, \u00b6 37. \u201cA peremptory challenge is a challenge to a prospective juror for which no reason need be given or cause assigned.\u201d 47 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Jury </em>\u00a7 234 (1995). Section 25-7-224, MCA, provides each party with four peremptory challenges. In civil actions where there are several plaintiffs or several defendants, the general rule is that all parties on the same side are entitled to only the number of peremptory challenges allowed a single plaintiff or defendant. <em>See </em>50A C.J.S. <em>Juries </em>\u00a7 427 (1997); <em>Bueling v. Swift, </em>1998 MT 112, \u00b6 15, 288 Mont. 472, \u00b6 15, 958 P.2d 694, \u00b6 15. The exception to the rule is when litigants on the same side are adverse to each other with respect to an issue of fact that the jury will decide. <em>Garcia v. Central Power &amp; Light Co. </em>(Tex. 1986), 704 S.W.2d 734, 736. If coparties are not adverse and are provided with additional peremptory challenges, then they have no motive to exercise their challenges against each other and instead exercise them against their opponent. <em>See Wardell v. McMillan </em>(Wyo. 1992), 844 P.2d 1052, 1061. \u201cThe side with the greater number of peremptory challenges clearly has a tactical advantage created by its ability to elimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>nate potentially unfavorable jurors without cause.\u201d <em>King v. Special Resource Management, Inc. </em>(1993), 256 Mont. 367, 371, 846 P.2d 1038, 1041. Such an advantage affects the composition of the jury and implicates the right to a fair trial. <em>See Wardell, </em>844 P.2d at 1061. In <em>Bueling, </em>we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-4\">This Court has interpreted \u201ceach party\u201d to mean each side, unless the codefendants are hostile to one another... \u201cdistrict courts have no discretion in granting additional peremptory challenges. Multiple parties on one side are either hostile or they are not hostile.\u201d The district court must determine hostility on a case-by-case basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Axv\"><em>Bueling, </em>\u00b6 15. The Wyoming Supreme Court has provided the following factors for determining hostility among coparties:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-5\">An illustrative, but not exhaustive, list of factors to be considered would include: (1) whether separate acts of misconduct were alleged against the defendants; (2) whether comparative negligence principles applied to the case; (3) the type of relationship among the defendants; (4) whether cross-claims or third party complaints had been filed and the positions taken therein; (5) information disclosed by pretrial discovery; and (6) representations made by the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b73-6\"><em>Wardell v. McMillan </em>(Wyo. 1992), 844 P.2d 1052, 1061. The existence of hostility between litigants is a question of law. <em>See Hunsaker v. Bozeman Deaconess Foundation </em>(1978), 179 Mont. 305, 315, 588 P.2d 493, 500. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine if they are correct. <em>McCormick v. Brevig, </em>1999 MT 86, \u00b6 73, 294 Mont. 144, \u00b6 73, 980 P2d 603, \u00b6 73. The district court determines hostility before the beginning of voir dire and bases its determination only on the facts present at the time of its ruling. <em>Bueling, </em>\u00b6 12. \u201c[I]f an appellate review determines that peremptory challenges were improperly granted, prejudice is presumed as a matter of law.\u201d King, 256 Mont. at 374, 846 P.2d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\u00b621 Gondeiro contends that the District Court correctly granted each Defendant four peremptory challenges because his and Karns\u2019 theories of the case were hostile. He argues that the \u201clawsuit combined two separate and distinct claims against two distinct defendants,\u201d which \u201carose out of two separate and distinct transactions.\u201d Gondeiro asserts that \u201cseparate acts of negligence against each defendant, on its face, suggests hostility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">\u00b622 Armstrong responds that Gondeiro and Karns were addressing different issues that were not adverse or hostile. Armstrong asserts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>that during discovery Karns made no effort to show that Gondeiro was negligent or that he caused Armstrong\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">\u00b623  In this case, Armstrong alleged separate acts of negligence; the allegedly negligent acts occurred independently of each other; Gondeiro and Karns had no relationship prior to becoming defendants; and neither Gondeiro nor Karns filed either a cross-claim or a third-party complaint. Further, before trial Karns conceded that her negligence caused injury to Armstrong. Karns proceeded to trial for the purpose of disputing the amount of damages she owed to Armstrong. Conversely, before trial, Gondeiro asserted that he was not negligent and that if he was negligent, his negligence did not cause Armstrong\u2019s injury. The District Court correctly found that \u201caside from denying their own negligence was the cause of Armstrong\u2019s injuries, Karns and Gondeiro\u2019s only evidence to support a finding of hostility is that Gondeiro pursued a course of discovery to establish that Armstrong\u2019s injuries were preexisting.\u201d We hold that the District Court did not err when it concluded that Gondeiro\u2019s and Karns\u2019 theories were not hostile. By providing Gondeiro and Karns each with four peremptory challenges when their interests were not hostile, the District Court gave them a clear tactical advantage by permitting them to eliminate twice the appropriate number of unfavorable jurors without cause. <em>See King, </em>256 Mont. at 371, 846 P.2d at 1041. We hold that the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it granted Armstrong a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b624 Did the District Court err when it granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law?</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">\u00b625 A motion for judgment as a matter of law is governed by Rule 50(a), M.R.Civ.P, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">(1) If during a trial by jury a party has been fully heard on an issue and there is no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue, the court may determine the issue against that party and may grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law against that party with respect to a claim or defense that cannot under the controlling law be maintained or defeated without a favorable finding on that issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">\u00b626 We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct. <em>Carbon County, </em>271 Mont. at 469, 898 P.2d at 686. Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury and all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from that evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Durden v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 1, \u00b6 22, 955 P.2d 160, \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">\u00b627  Gondeiro argues that the District Court erred when it granted Armstrong\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, because there was a factual dispute about whether his vehicle actually made contact with Armstrong. However, even if this Court views the evidence in a light most favorable to Gondeiro and concludes that Gondeiro\u2019s truck did not strike Armstrong, Gondeiro remains negligent as a matter of law pursuant to \u00a7 61-8-502, MCA. The uncontradicted evidence showed that Gondeiro was turning his truck onto the street that Armstrong was crossing in an unmarked crosswalk at the intersection; that Gondeiro did not see Armstrong until he was making the turn; that Gondeiro then applied the brakes; that his truck either bumped Armstrong or very nearly missed her; and that she fell to the pavement as a result of the collision or near collision. Whether Gondeiro\u2019s vehicle actually struck Armstrong is irrelevant; Gondeiro failed to yield to a pedestrian crossing the roadway within an unmarked crosswalk at an intersection. He therefore violated \u00a7 61-8-502, MCA, and was negligent as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b628  Moreover, the District Court\u2019s finding of negligence as a matter of law did not preclude Gondeiro from arguing causation. The District Court allowed Gondeiro to argue that his negligence did not cause Armstrong\u2019s injuries. After hearing the evidence, the jury chose not to attribute any of Armstrong\u2019s damages to the negligent acts of Gondeiro. Thus, holding Gondeiro negligent as a matter of law had a substantially different effect than imposing liability as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b629  Based on the evidence presented, the trial court correctly determined that Gondeiro was negligent as a matter of law. We therefore affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE TURNAGE, JUSTICES NELSON, HUNT and REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b75-9\">JUSTICE LEAPHART,</author>\n<p id=\"Aat\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">\u00b630 I concur with issue number three, dissent as to issue two and I would not reach issue number one.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">\u00b631 Armstrong filed suit against two defendants, Karns and Gondeiro. The District Court found that Karns and Gondeiro were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>hostile to one another and therefore granted four peremptory challenges to each of them. At trial, the jury found that although Karns\u2019 negligence caused injury to Armstrong, Gondeiro\u2019s negligence did not. Thus there was a defense verdict for Gondeiro and a plaintiffs verdict against Karns.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b632 Armstrong then sought a new trial against Gondeiro arguing that the finding of hostility between Karns and Gondeiro was in error and thus the court should not have granted four extra peremptory challenges. The District Court agreed, concluding that its initial finding of hostility was in error. On appeal, this Court upholds the granting of the new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">\u00b633 I would hold that Armstrong, having accepted the benefits of the verdict against Karns, is estopped from challenging the defense verdict for Gondeiro. As the Court recognizes, in giving both defendants four peremptory challenges, the District Court \u201cgave <em>them </em>a clear tactical advantage by permitting <em>them </em>to eliminate twice the appropriate number of unfavorable jurors without cause.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Accordingly, if the District Court erred, it erred as to both defendants. The unfair advantage corrupted the entire verdict. Armstrong cannot, at her convenience, contend that the unfairness was harmless to the extent she prevailed and prejudicial when she did not. Either the process was unfair to Armstrong or it was not. She cannot, \u201crun with the hare and hold with the hounds.\u201d John Lyly, Euphus (1579). I would reverse the granting of the new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b76-6\">JUSTICE GRAY, joins in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
