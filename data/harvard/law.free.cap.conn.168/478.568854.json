This right of way runs generally northerly along the rear of property owned by the plaintiffs New Haven Housing Authority, Bertha Lenart and Anua M. Buotolo, from UI\u2019s Quinnipiac substation to the rear of the Cedar Hill freight yards, all within the city of New Haven. The line was to be placed upon towers to be constructed by UI within the right of way of the railroad and includes the right of way containing the line which was being used for transportation of railroad passengers and freight service. The PUC gave written permission on November 12,1970, to UI to build the line over the right of way as requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Subsequently, on April 12, 1971, UI applied to the PUC to modify its plans for the construction of the proposed line; the application was granted that same day. Finally, on April 18, 1971, UI applied for permission to extend the line and supporting towers from the Cedar Hill freight yards to UI\u2019s Grand Avenue substation; the PUC granted this application on April 29, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">In the meantime, the New Haven board of aider-men had passed an ordinance on December 7, 1970, purporting to regulate the location and construction of all overhead electrical transmission lines within the city, including lines located on private property. This ordinance, referred to as \u00a7 120 of the code of ordinances of the city of New Haven, was to become effective on January 14, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On July 6, 1971, without conceding the validity of the ordinance, UI submitted a letter formally noti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>fying the hoard of aldermen of its plans to construct the transmission line. Later, after newspaper advertisements appearing on August 16 and 17, 1971, the hoard\u2019s municipal services committee reported favorably on UI\u2019s plans. In addition, a public hearing was held on November 22, 1971, by the committee concerning this report, following further newspaper advertisements of November 7, 8, 9, 19, 20, and 21. Construction of the towers to support the transmission line was initiated by UI in March, 1972; thereafter, on April 3, 1972, the board of aldermen rejected the municipal services committee\u2019s report favoring the plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The conductors of the transmission line were strung in February, 1973. At the time of the trial the line was in operation to serve UI\u2019s Quinnipiac substation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">The action in Superior Court was commenced by the plaintiffs by complaint dated May 15,1972. The matter was decided on the basis of exhibits in the return, those presented to the court at the hearings and on a stipulation of facts agreed to by the parties. The parties also agreed that the court should hear and decide two issues of law raised by those facts, the court\u2019s determination of these issues in favor of the defendants to be dispositive of the case. These two issues were: \u201c(a) Was there a legal requirement that the PUC give notice, or afford a hearing to the City, or other plaintiffs prior to or after rendering its orders [on November 12, 1970, on April 12, 1971, and on April 29, 1971, granting the aforementioned applications submitted by UI] ? (b) Is the aforesaid Section 120 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of New Haven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>within the power of the Board of Aldermen and valid, and was such ordinance applicable to the line in question?\u201d The court decided both issues in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The plaintiffs have attacked several findings and conclusions which form the basis of the court\u2019s determination that the plaintiffs were not entitled to notice or a hearing prior to or after the approval by the PUC of UI\u2019s proposed construction of the transmission line. The court\u2019s conclusions are tested by the finding and must stand unless they are legally or logically inconsistent with the facts found or involve the application of some erroneous rule of law material to the case. <em>Lonergan </em>v. <em>Connecticut Food Store, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 122, 124, 357 A.2d 910. Moreover, this court will not alter findings of fact made by the trial court which are reasonably supported by the evidence or which are based on inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence. <em>Schurgast </em>v. <em>Schumann, </em>156 Conn. 471, 475, 242 A.2d 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Initially, the plaintiffs claim they were entitled to notice and a hearing under various Connecticut statutory provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 16-234 provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo . . . electric light company or association, nor any company or association engaged in distributing electricity by wires or similar conductors or in using an electric wire or conductor for any purpose, shall exercise any powers which may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>been conferred upon it to change the location of, or to erect or place, wires, conductors, fixtures, structures or apparatus of any kind over, on or under any <em>highway </em>or <em>public ground, </em>without the consent of the adjoining proprietors, or, if such company or association is unable to obtain such consent, without the approval of the commission, <em>which shall be given only after a hearing upon notice to such proprietors.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The trial court found that the transmission line in question is located entirely within the right of way owned by the railroad and concluded that this right of way is neither a \u201chighway\u201d nor \u201cpublic ground\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-234, and that the aforementioned statute did not require that either notice or a hearing be afforded to any of the plaintiffs prior to or after the PUC\u2019s approval of the transmission line. The plaintiffs have assigned error in the court\u2019s finding and conclusions, and they argue that the statute applied and required such notice and hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">The challenged finding, that the transmission line is located entirely within the railroad\u2019s right of way, is amply supported by the facts in the stipulation and by the statements appearing in the exhibits. Thus, the stipulation expressly indicates that the first segment of the transmission line was to be constructed \u201cwithin a 45-foot wide right-of-way across property owned by the Penn Central Transportation Company.\u201d Furthermore, two of Ill\u2019s applications to the PUC contain statements that this first segment of the line would be within and along the railroad\u2019s right of way. In addition, the third application, which concerns the construction of the second segment of the line, expressly states that all construction would be within the right of way.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>The court\u2019s conclusion that the railroad\u2019s right of way is not a \u201chighway\u201d as contemplated by \u00a7 16-234 also rests on a firm basis. It is well settled that a statute must be applied as its words direct. <em>Dental Commission </em>v. <em>Tru-Fit Plastics, Inc., </em>159 Conn. 362, 365, 269 A.2d 265; <em>Obuchowski </em>v. <em>Dental Commission, </em>149 Conn. 257, 265, 178 A. 537. Moreover, words and phrases in a statute are construed according to their commonly accepted usage. <em>Klapproth </em>v. <em>Turner, </em>156 Conn. 276, 280, 240 A.2d 886. Indeed, if the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no room for construction. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>Fusari, </em>163 Conn. 401, 411, 311 A.2d 65. To determine the meaning of a word used in a statute, we may look to related statutory provisions for guidance. <em>Bania </em>v. <em>New Hartford, </em>138 Conn. 172, 176-77, 83 A.2d 165; see also <em>Waterford </em>v. <em>Connecticut State Board of Education, </em>148 Conn. 238, 243, 169 A.2d 891. Our attention has not been directed to anything which would persuade us that the word \u201chighway\u201d as used in \u00a7 16-234 includes within its reach a right of way such as is owned by the railroad in the present case. The plain meaning of the word \u201chighway\u201d is \u201c[a] main road or thoroughfare; hence, a road or way open to the use of the public.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d Ed.) 1179. It is thus that this court has customarily understood the word. We have stated, for example, that the essential feature of a highway is that \u201cevery traveler has an equal right in it with every other traveler.\u201d <em>Laufer </em>v. <em>Bridgeport Traction Co., </em>68 Conn. 475, 488, 37 A. 379. As the trial court stated in its memorandum of decision, \u201cthe term \u2018highway\u2019 is ordinarily used in contradistinction to a private way, over which only a limited number of persons have the right to pass.\u201d <em>Stavola </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>v. <em>Palmer, </em>136 Conn. 670, 683, 73 A.2d 831. Moreover, while chapter 283 of title 16 of the General Statutes, of which \u00a7 16-234 is a part, nowhere defines the words \u201chighway\u201d or \u201cright of way,\u201d the two terms are differentiated from one another in chapter 279 of title 16. In \u00a7 16-96 of the General Statutes, for example, it is stated that \u201c[wjhen any highway or street is altered by any railroad company with the consent of the commission, and it is necessary to take any land <em>for a highway </em>to which such company has not-obtained title, and over which neither such company nor the town in which such alteration is made has any <em>right of way, </em>. . . the same proceedings shall be had for the purpose of procuring the required right of way as are provided in section 16-86 for taking land for railroad purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.) Finally, there is nothing in the statute itself suggesting that a judicial reading of the word \u201chighway\u201d so as not to include the railroad\u2019s right of way in this case would in any way frustrate the overall purpose of the statute. <em>Northeastern Gas Transmission Co. </em>v. <em>Collins, </em>138 Conn. 582, 592, 87 A.2d 139.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Nonetheless, as the court also found, portions of the railroad right of way within which the transmission line is located pass over or under six streets in New Haven, viz., Grand Avenue, Middletown Avenue, Blatchley Avenue, Humphrey Street, Ferry Street and James Street. Accordingly, the plaintiffs argue that the transmission line is, in effect, being erected or placed \u201cover, on or under any highway\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-234, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>that, contrary to the court\u2019s conclusion, the giving of notice and a hearing was a prerequisite to the PUC\u2019s approval of the line. The statute, however, requires only that notice and a hearing be afforded to \u201cadjoining proprietors\u201d who refuse to consent to the proposed construction. The record does not disclose, nor do the plaintiffs claim, that the plaintiffs housing authority, betterment association, neighborhood association, or the two individual plaintiffs, are proprietors adjoining the street crossings which they assert to be relevant. According to the unchallenged stipulated facts found by the court, the only property involved in this case owned by any of these plaintiffs is property on Quinnipiac Avenue, which the route maps presented to the court as exhibits indicate are not crossed by the transmission line. The claim has been made that the plaintiff city of New Haven, as the \u201cowner\u201d of the city streets crossed by the transmission line within the railroad right of way, constitutes an \u201cadjoining proprietor\u201d entitled to notice and a hearing by \u00a7 16-234. Such a theory, however, is at odds with the plain meaning of the term \u201cadjoining proprietors\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 16-234. See, e.g., <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Southern New England Telephone Co., </em>92 Conn. 633, 635, 103 A. 754. The purpose of this provision is manifestly to make the procedural safeguards of notice and a hearing available to owners of property <em>contiguous </em>to the highway or public ground over, on, or under which the transmission line or other facility in question is erected or placed. This is the meaning generally ascribed to the term \u201cadjoining\u201d when used in reference to property owners or holders. <em>State ex rel. Boynton </em>v. <em>Bunion, </em>141 Kan. 103, 105, 40 P.2d 326; <em>Broun </em>v. <em>Texas &amp; N. O. B. Co., </em>295 S.W. 670, 674 (Tex. Civ. App.); 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Adjoin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>ing Landowners, \u00a7 1; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th Ed. Rev.) 62. No showing has been offered or made in this case that the plaintiff city is a proprietor \u201cadjoining\u201d any of the streets crossed by the railroad\u2019s right of way within the meaning of the pertinent provisions of \u00a7 16-234.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">Accordingly, the court did not err in concluding that none of the plaintiffs in this case was entitled to notice and a hearing under \u00a7 16-234.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">There is no dispute over the court\u2019s conclusion that in entering its orders the PUC was exercising its jurisdiction under \u00a7 16-243 of the General Statutes.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition, the plaintiffs concede in their brief that this statute did not by its terms- require notice and a hearing <em>prior to </em>the issuance of PUC\u2019s orders in the present case. Nonetheless, they argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>that this provision must be considered in light of the \u201centire statutory scheme\u201d affecting these proceedings. Specifically, they claim that the statutory grant of a right of appeal to the Court of Common Pleas under \u00a7 16-35 of the General Statutes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> to any city or person, inter alia, \u201caggriev\u00e9d\u201d by an order, authorization, or decision of the PUC would be \u201cmeaningless\u201d if the PUC were not also required to give notice of its order, authorization or decision in a timely manner <em>after </em>filing such order, authorization, or decision but before the thirty days allowed by \u00a7 16-35 to bring an appeal has expired. The plaintiffs further claim that they received no formal notice of the PUC\u2019s actions until July 6, 1971, more than thirty days after the PUC had given its final approval of UI\u2019s proposals (April 29, 1971). Their argument, in essence, is that, when read together, \u00a74 16-243 and 16-35 constituted a \u201clegislative direction\u201d to the PUC to notify the plaintiffs formally of its action within the statutory appeal period. Accordingly, they have assigned error in the court\u2019s refusal to rule on claims of law in which they advanced this interpretation of the statute. There might be more force to the plaintiffs\u2019 claims in this respect had there been any showing in the trial court that they were \u201caggrieved\u201d in some way by the PUC\u2019s orders for purposes of taking an appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>under \u00a7 16-35, as the meaning of that term was recently discussed by this court in <em>New Haven </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>165 Conn. 687, 698-704, 345 A.2d 563. However, the trial court, on the basis of the stipulated questions properly before it and because this action was not brought under the appeal statute, $ 16-35, had no occasion to determine whether any of the plaintiffs had been so \u201caggrieved,\u201d and whether, as a result, the PUC was subject to the purported \u201clegislative direction\u201d claimed by the plaintiffs. The court did not err, then, in declining to rule on the asserted claims of law of the plaintiffs; rather, in view of the limited scope of the stipulated questions, its conclusion that the plaintiffs were not entitled to notice after the approval of the transmission line by the PUC under \u00a7 16-243 properly precluded any consideration of these claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The plaintiffs have also assigned error in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 16-9 of the General Statutes<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> did not require that written notice of the PUC\u2019s approval of the transmission line be given to the plaintiffs. The statute states that such notice \u201cshall be given to the company or person affected\u201d by the PUC\u2019s orders, decisions or authorizations in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>question. We construed a similar notice provision in General Statutes (Rev. 1949) \u00a7 5646, which was the predecessor to General Statutes \u00a7 16-235 and which pertained to the scope of the power of a local zoning commission over the location of a public service generating plant, to require the issuing authority to provide written notice of its orders only upon those who were \u201cunder a duty to comply with the order,\u201d e.g., the party who seeks the ruling from the issuing authority. <em>Wilson Point Property Owners Assn. </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>145 Conn. 243, 266, 140 A.2d 874. In reaching this conclusion, we stated: \u201cIt would be unreasonable to suppose that the legislature, in providing for the giving of written notice of the order of the zoning commission, intended that personal service should be made upon every property owner who might claim to be personally affected.\u201d The same considerations persuade us that a similarly restrictive interpretation of the notice provision in \u00a7 16-9 is warranted here. The fact that the legislature used the words \u201cthe company or person\u201d instead of \u201cthe companies or persons\u201d suggests that it intended that notice should be given to the applicant, if the order were issued in response to an application, or, in other cases, to the party to whom the order was directed. We conclude that the court correctly interpreted and applied the notice provision of \u00a7 16-9 to the facts as stipulated in the proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">4.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">Finally, the plaintiffs have assigned error in the court\u2019s conclusion that section 16-11-139 of the PJTC\u2019s regulations pertaining to electrical standards and specifications did not require either notice to or consent from the city of New Haven prior to or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>after the approval of the transmission line. The PUC regulation in question states that a petition to the PUC for approval of a transmission line \u201cshall he accompanied\u201d by, inter alia, \u201ccopies of letters from each . . . municipality or other utility affected, stating that it has been notified of the details of the proposed line and that it offers no objection to the method or manner of construction.\u201d Begs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a716-11-139(2). The term \u201cmunicipality\u201d is defined in the regulations to mean \u201ca town, city, borough or any municipality or department thereof, owning, leasing, maintaining, operating, managing or controlling electric plants or parts of electric plants within this state.\u201d Id. \u00a7 16-11-100 (b). The court concluded that the plaintiff city is not a \u201cmunicipality\u201d as defined in \u00a7 16-11-100 (b), a conclusion which the plaintiffs have assigned as error. In connection with this conclusion, the court made a finding which the plaintiffs do not challenge: from 1946 through 1973, it was the consistent practice of the PUC to interpret the regulations in question such that no city was construed to be a \u201cmunicipality\u201d under \u00a7 16-11-100 (b) unless it owned, leased, maintained, operated, managed or controlled an electric plant. The court also found that there was no evidence that during any time relevant to the action the city of New Haven owned, leased, maintained, operated, managed or controlled any electric plant or part thereof,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and thereupon concluded that the city was not a \u201cmunicipality\u201d under \u00a7 16-11-100 (b). The court properly attached the weight it did to the past interpretation of the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>\u00a7 16-11-100 (b) by the PUC in reaching this conclusion. We have stated that \u201c[t]he practical interpretation of legislative acts by governmental agencies responsible for their administration is a recognized aid to statutory construction.\u201d <em>State ex rel. James </em>v. <em>Rapport, </em>136 Conn. 177, 182, 69 A.2d 645. Indeed, it has been said that where the governmental agency\u2019s time-tested interpretation is \u201creasonable\u201d it should be accorded \u201cgreat weight\u201d by the courts. <em>Investment Company Institute </em>v. <em>Camp, </em>401 U.S. 617, 626-27, 91 S. Ct. 1091, 28 L. Ed. 2d 367. In this case, the term \u201cmunicipality\u201d was not part of a statute enacted by the legislature, but, rather, part of the PUC\u2019s own regulatory scheme dealing with electrical standards and specifications. Our review of this regulatory scheme discloses that the PUC\u2019s interpretation of the term was indeed reasonable, particularly in view of the notable absence of ambiguity in the language used in the definition of the term in \u00a7 16-11-100 (b). The court, then, was fully warranted in accepting the PUC\u2019s long-standing interpretation of the term appearing in one of its own regulations and applying it to the facts of the case at hand. See <em>Zuber </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>396 U.S. 168, 192, 90 S. Ct. 314, 24 L. Ed. 2d 345. We find no fatal inconsistencies then in its ultimate conclusion that 116-11-139 of the regulations did not require notice to or consent from the plaintiff city prior to or after the PUC\u2019s approval of the transmission line.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The plaintiffs have also assigned error in the court\u2019s conclusion that the due process clauses of the fourteenth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7 8, of the Connecticut constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number><footnotemark>8</footnotemark> did not require that either a notice or a hearing be afforded to any of the plaintiffs prior to or after the approval of the transmission line by the PUC. To determine whether such procedural due process requirements apply, the court must first determine whether a party has been deprived of liberty or property by some action of the government; furthermore, in making this determination, \u201cwe must look not to the \u2018weight\u2019 but to the <em>nature </em>of the interest at stake,\u201d any \u201cweighing process\u201d being relevant only to a \u201cdetermination of the <em>form </em>of hearing required in particular situations.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 570-71, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548; see also <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>419 U.S. 565, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725. In this case, the plaintiffs argue that the photographic exhibits which the court incorporated into its finding establish that the towers and lines constructed as part of the project approved by the PUC interfered with the plaintiff housing authority\u2019s enjoyment of light, air and view appurtenant to its ownership of real property. It is true, of course, that \u201cthe property interests protected by procedural due process extend well beyond actual ownership of real estate, chattels, or money.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 571-72. Nonetheless, \u201c[pjroperty interests . . . are not created by the Constitution. Rather, they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\u201d <em>Board of Regents </em>v. <em>Roth, </em>supra, 577; see also <em>Goss </em>v. <em>Lopez, </em>supra; cf. <em>Gotkin </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>379 F. Sup. 859, 868 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>(E.D. N.Y.). To invoke the requisites of procedural due process legal rights of parties must be directly affected. <em>Hannah </em>v. <em>Larche, </em>363 U.S. 420, 422, 80 S. Ct. 1502, 4 L. Ed. 2d 1307. Neither the stipulated facts as found by the court nor the exhibits incorporated in its finding disclose the existence of any statute, contract, or easement, express or implied, which might conceivably serve as the basis for its claimed right to light, air, and view unobstructed by such structures as the towers and lines involved in this case. See General Statutes \u00a7 47-25; <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Pease, </em>135 Conn. 535, 539, 66 A.2d 590; <em>Puorto </em>v. <em>Chieppa, </em>78 Conn. 401, 404, 62 A. 664; <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Clapp, </em>65 Conn. 365, 384, 32 A. 939; 1 Am. Jur. 2d, Adjoining Landowners, \u00a7\u00a789-90; 29 C.J.S., Electricity, \u00a7 17. In short, the plaintiffs failed to establish that the PUC\u2019s approval of the transmission line operated so as to deprive the plaintiff housing authority of a constitutionally protected property interest in the light, air and view appurtenant to its ownership of the property in question. In this respect, then, the court\u2019s conclusion that procedural due process did not require notice or a hearing was proper under the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The only other argument advanced by the plaintiffs in support of their claim of error in this conclusion by the court is that the plaintiff city of New Haven was \u201caggrieved\u201d by the PUC\u2019s action within the meaning of General Statutes \u00a7 16-35. However, as we pointed out previously, the court did not find, nor did it have reason to find, that the plaintiff city of New Haven was \u201caggrieved\u201d in this case. Determining aggrievement for purposes of bringing an appeal from an administrative agency pursuant to a statute such as \u00a7 16-35 is procedurally different from determining whether a party has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>deprived of a constitutionally protected property interest and is entitled to notice and a hearing under the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">The plaintiffs betterment association, neighborhood association and the individual plaintiffs have not specifically delineated or proved the existence of any constitutionally protected property interest which would entitle them to notice or hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We need not consider the additional claims of error in the rulings of the court related to this conclusion since to do so would not affect our decision as to its propriety.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Error has also been assigned in the court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 120 of the code of ordinances of the city of New Haven<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was beyond the power of its board of aldermen to enact and invalid. We have stated that \u201c[a]s a creature of the state, a munic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>ipality can exercise only such, powers as are expressly granted it or such, powers as are necessary to enable it to discharge the duties and carry into effect the objects and purposes of its creation.\u201d <em>New Haven Water Co. </em>v. <em>New Haven, </em>152 Conn. 563, 566, 210 A.2d 449. Significantly, exclusive jurisdiction over the manner of construction and direction of overhead electric transmission lines located upon private property has been granted by statute to the PUC. General Statutes \u00a716-243; <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co. </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>161 Conn. 430, 444, 288 A.2d 415. Municipalities have been expressly precluded from exercising jurisdiction over such subject-matter by General Statutes \u00a7 16-235. The court in this ease properly found that the transmission line in question is located entirely within the railroad\u2019s right of way, which is neither a highway nor public ground as contemplated by \u00a7 16-234 of the General Statutes. The exclusivity of the PUC\u2019s jurisdiction over the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>transmission lines located upon such private property as the railroad\u2019s right of way in this case is subject to no exceptions or limitations identified in the statute which are relevant to this case. Contrary to the claim of the plaintiffs the court properly concluded that the board of aldermen lacked the power to enact the ordinance in question insofar as it purported to regulate the construction of overhead transmission lines located upon private property. Furthermore, the plaintiffs\u2019 claim that UI waived its rights to assert the invalidity of the ordinance is without foundation, inasmuch as the court\u2019s conclusion to the contrary is fully supported by the statement in UI\u2019s letter of July 6, 1971, to the board of aldermen that \u201cby this letter [UI] does not intend to waive or foreclose any claim it may hereafter make regarding the limits of power vested in your Board by Section 16-235 of the General Statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">We need not consider the plaintiffs\u2019 other claims of error since to do so would not affect the result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b502-10\"> The plaintiffs are the city of New Haven, the New Haven Housing Authority, the Fair Haven Betterment Association, Inc., the East Bock Neighborhood Association, Inc., and certain property owners whose premises abut or adjoin the railroad right of way over which the transmission line is being constructed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b508-6\"> Title 16 of the General Statutes involves, generally, \u201cpublic service companies.\u201d Chapter 283 concerns \u201ctelegraph, telephone, illuminating, power and water companies.\u201d Chapter 279 pertains to \u201crailroad construction and location.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b510-8\"> The plaintiffs have not claimed that the court erred in concluding that the railroad\u2019s right of way is not \u201cpublic ground\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 16-234; thus the propriety of the court\u2019s decision in this respect need not be discussed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b510-9\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 16-243. jurisdiction of commission over electricity transmission lines.
