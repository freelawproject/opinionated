See <em>Harbor Construction Corporation </em>v. <em>D. V. Frione &amp; Co., </em>158 Conn. 14, 225 A.2d 823.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-11\">On December 5, 1973, the referee, acting as the court, rendered judgment of interpleader, ordering the plaintiff to pay the claims of some of the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>ants, including those of Harbor and Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company, hereinafter Hartford A. &amp; I., the parties to this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">By motion filed April 9, 1974, Harbor moved to open and set aside the judgment of December 5, 1973. A motion to erase, filed on April 11, 1974, by Hartford A. &amp; I. was granted by the court on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction because the motion to open and set aside the judgment was filed after the expiration of the term in which the judgment had been rendered. Harbor has appealed to this court from the granting of the motion to erase.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The decisions of this court in <em>Poneleit </em>v. <em>Dudas, </em>141 Conn. 413, 106 A.2d 479, and <em>Cichy </em>v. <em>Kostyk, </em>143 Conn. 688, 125 A.2d 483, are dispositive of the merits of this appeal. As the <em>Poneleit </em>case reiterated (p. 416), \u201c\u2018It is well settled that, unless proceedings looking to modification of a judgment are started before the expiration of the term of court at which it was entered, a court has no power to modify it in matters of substance, as distinguished from the correction of clerical errors, after the expiration of the term, except by consent or waiver of the parties or in proceedings for a new trial,\u2019 \u201d and added, \u201cAs the term of court during which the judgment was rendered had expired at the time the motion to open the judgment was filed, the trial court did not have the power to grant it.\u201d See also <em>Beard </em>v. <em>Beard, </em>168 Conn. 53, 54, 357 A.2d 465. The <em>Cichy </em>case (p. 695) makes clear that there is no merit to Harbor\u2019s contention that since the motion to open \u2014 \u25a0 filed after the expiration of the statutory \u201csession\u201d \u2014-was filed before the expiration of the statutory \u201cterm,\u201d the court erred in granting the motion to erase.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
