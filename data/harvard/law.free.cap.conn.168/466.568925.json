By way of relief, the appeal prayed for an order requiring the defendant board to assess the property in question as open space on that tax list and directing that the valuation of the property he reduced to reflect an open space classification. The court found the issues for the plaintiff and rendered judgment sustaining the appeal and adjudging that the land described in the complaint qualified as open space land, to be assessed as such. From that judgment the defendant has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">The finding, which is based largely upon a stipulation of facts submitted to the trial court and which is not subject to material correction, discloses the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>following facts: The plaintiff, a privately owned club open only to members and their guests, leases approximately 160 acres of land, part of which is developed as an eighteen-hole golf course. As a long-term lessee, the plaintiff has standing to maintain this appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property is valued in the customary manner as unimproved land in a two-acre residential zone.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">During the month of June, 1963, the planning and zoning commission of the town of Wilton, acting as a planning commission, adopted a town plan of development consisting of a written plan and maps relating thereto which were affirmed by a final vote of the commission on June 25, 1963. The portion of the written plan relating to recreational use recites the need for preserving adequate park and recreation space and for acquiring additional space for such purposes.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It lists the plaintiff\u2019s golf course as an existing recreational facility of approximately 160 acres and states, with specific reference thereto, that \u201cthe Town should be ready to acquire this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>facility if, in the future, the likelihood arises that the property may go into residential development.\u201d Two maps entitled \u201cWilton Planning and Zoning Commission Plan of Development\u201d were filed June 11, 1963, in the office of the town clerk of Wilton, together with a similar map of larger scale with color designations. There was no designation on those maps of any property as \u201copen space,\u201d hut several areas, including the property under discussion, were designated \u201cprivate recreation,\u201d and since at least 1966, the printed plan of development map included in the written plan of development, as disseminated by the commission and as posted in the commission\u2019s office, designates several areas on the map, including that under consideration, as \u201crecreation \u2014 open space \u2014 private.\u201d The records of the commission do not disclose how and why the words \u201copen space\u201d first appeared on the current map, but on several occasions the commission, in making changes in the town plan of development, has made changes with reference to the current map.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">From the foregoing facts the court concluded that by its public dissemination of the current map of the plan of development and by making changes in its town plan of development with reference to such map, the commission had adopted and endorsed the use of the map as its official map of the plan of development and had ratified the designation of the plaintiff\u2019s property as open space. The defendant board has assigned error in the court\u2019s reaching this conclusion, thereby raising as the first issue for our consideration the question whether the plaintiff\u2019s property had been designated as open space land on the Wilton plan of development so as to make it eligible for open space tax classification under the applicable statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>In 1963, the General Assembly enacted \u00a7\u00a7 12-107a-12-107e of the General Statutes, which provided for preferential tax treatment of farmland, forest land and open space land. In its \u201c [d] eclaration of policy,\u201d \u00a7 12-107a declares, in relevant part, \u201c(a) that it is in the public interest to encourage the preservation of farm land, forest land and open space land ... to conserve the state\u2019s natural resources and to provide for the welfare and happiness of the inhabitants of the state,\u201d and \u201c(b) that it is in the public interest to prevent the forced conversion of farm land, forest land and open space land to more intensive uses as the result of economic pressures caused by the assessment thereof for purposes of property taxation at values incompatible with their preservation as such farm land, forest land and open space land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Section 12-107b (c), after giving definitions of \u201cfarm land\u201d and \u201cforest land,\u201d defines \u201copen space land\u201d as any area of land \u201cnot excluding farm land, the preservation or restriction of the use of which would (1) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural or scenic resources, (2) protect natural streams or water supply, (3) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, beaches or tidal marshes, (4) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces, (5) enhance public recreation opportunities, (6) preserve historic sites or (7) promote orderly urban or suburban development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">With the foregoing background of legislative intent and purpose in mind, we consider the specific question whether the plaintiff\u2019s land, at the time of the plaintiff\u2019s application to the tax assessor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>for classification thereof as open space land on the tax list of 1971, had been designated upon the plan of development of the town of Wilton as an area \u201cof open space land\u201d within the meaning and under the provisions of \u00a7 12-107e, the relevant portions of which are set forth in the footnote.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is not disputed that the commission formally adopted a town plan of development and maps related thereto in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>June, 1963, the final vote affirming prior action having been taken on June 25,1963. Section 12-107e became effective the preceding day, on June 24,1963, and whether or not the members of the commission were aware of its existence when they adopted the plan, which the defendant\u2019s brief claims \u201cis incredible to assume,\u201d they did at that time designate the plaintiff\u2019s property on the maps as a \u201cprivate recreation\u201d area and referred to it specifically in the written plan as an area which the town should be ready to acquire \u201cif, in the future, the likelihood arises that the property may go into residential development.\u201d The defendant, in its brief, makes much of the fact that the specific words \u201copen space land\u201d were not employed on the original maps and in the original text of the written plan, but \u00a7 12-107e simply states that the planning commission \u201cmay designate upon such plan areas which it recommends for preservation as areas of open space land,\u201d without requiring that the specific label of \u201copen space land\u201d be applied to each such area. This was made clear by the many diverse functions of land use listed under the statutory definition of that term contained in the then \u00a7 12-107b (c) as previously quoted, including, in addition to the seven specific uses enumerated, \u201cforest land, land designated as wetland under section 22-7j [now \u00a7 22a-30] and not excluding farm land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">It was not the function of the planning commission to make a designation so worded as specifically to grant a reduced valuation for tax purposes. Its recommendations for uses of property in various areas are merely advisory. <em>State National Bank </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>156 Conn. 99, 105, 239 A.2d 528. And in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>156 Conn. 107, 239 A.2d 478, the farmland classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>for tax purposes was held to be applicable even where the property in question had been zoned for industrial purposes at the request of the owner. As we stated there (p. 113): \u201cA declared purpose of the statute granting favorable tax treatment to farmland is to prevent its forced conversion to more intensive uses as a result of an assessment based on its market value rather than its current use.\u201d In both <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Newington, </em>supra, and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>160 Conn. 71, 273 A.2d 706, we interpreted liberally the statute under consideration with respect to farmland, stating in <em>Johnson </em>(p. 73) that \u201c[i]t is thus clear that 12-107a\u201412-107e, as derived from . . . [Public Acts 1963, No.] 490, are as much conservation statutes as they are tax relief measures. The declaration of policy in \u00a7 12-107a recites, inter alia, that it is in the public interest \u2018to conserve the state\u2019s natural resources.\u2019 Indeed, it would appear that the purpose of the tax relief is to aid the conservation effort, and not merely to aid food production itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">If there are any ambiguities in the statute itself with respect to the specific term to be applied by the planning commission before property qualifies for designation as open space land, such ambiguities must be construed in favor of the plaintiff for, \u201c[w]hen a taxing statute is being considered, ambiguities are resolved in favor of the taxpayer.\u201d <em>Consolidated Diesel Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>Stamford, </em>156 Conn. 33, 36, 238 A.2d. 410. And if there were any ambiguities or uncertainties about the designation of the plaintiff\u2019s land in June, 1963, they were resolved sometime during or prior to .1966 by the designation on the printed plan of development map in the written plan of development of certain areas, including the plaintiff\u2019s land, as \u201crecreation\u2014open <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>space\u2014private.\u201d This was no amendment to the original plan but merely a clarification of it, and the official map, showing that designation, has been posted in the commission\u2019s office, disseminated by the commission, and used as the basis for changes in the plan of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Without regard to the use of the specific words \u201copen space\u201d on the map, it was clearly within the original plan of development, which became effective July 6, 1963, two weeks after the effective date of Public Acts 1963, No. 490, that the plaintiff\u2019s land should not be considered for residential use. The court did not err in concluding that the land in question had been designated as open space land on the Wilton plan of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The defendant\u2019s next claim of error is based upon its contention that \u201ca private golf course and country club on developed land does not qualify for an open space tax classification.\u201d Stressing first the fact that the land has been developed, it makes the assertion that \u201c[i]t is doubtful whether developed land qualifies for the open space\u201d classification at all since \u201c[t]he intention of Public Act 490 is to keep property from being developed.\u201d There is no merit to this claim since neither \u00a7 12-107b nor any other legislation pertaining to \u201copen space land\u201d requires that it be left in its pristine, natural state. Nowhere is the word \u201cundeveloped\u201d employed, and the specific inclusion of farmland clearly militates against any such requirement. The basic concept is that the land be \u201copen,\u201d and not that it be entirely unused, undeveloped or unimproved. See General Statutes \u00a7 7-131c (b). It also is interesting to note that \u00a7 7-131c additionally defines \u201copen space land\u201d as \u201cany land acquired under the provisions of sections 7-131e to 7-131k, inclusive\u201d (the grant-in-aid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>program) and refers to \u201crecreational and conservation purposes\u201d as specifically including use of land for golfing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The place of private golf clubs in the open space program was specifically referred to in the so-called Whyte Report, formally entitled \u201cConnecticut\u2019s Natural Resources, A Proposal for Action,\u201d which was published by conservationist William H. Whyte in 1962<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and clearly was availabl\u00e9 to the legislative committees considering the legislation in question. See hearings before Joint Standing Committee on State Development and Agriculture, Conn. Gen. Assembly, 1963 Sess., pp. 9-11; Tyler &amp; Valentine, \u201cThe 1972 Open Space Conveyance Tax\u2014Recapture or Reaction,\u201d 47 Conn. B.J. 332, 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">The defendant makes the further claim that even though a public golf course might qualify as open space land under \u00a7 12-107b (c), which includes any area of land \u201cthe preservation or restriction of the use of which would ... (5) enhance public recreation opportunities,\u201d a private golf club could not qualify because it is open only to members and their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>guests but not to the general public. It certainly is not arguable that the mere fact of private ownership and use of the land does not disqualify land from open space classification, for such ownership and use are implicit in the entire structure of open space legislation. Otherwise, there would be no purpose in even considering preferential tax treatment for privately owned .farmland, forest land and other lands which qualify physically as open space land under the definitions given in \u00a7 12-107b (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The defendant further contends that the inclusion in \u00a7 12-107b (c) of land which would \u201c(5) enhance public recreation opportunities\u201d as one of the qualifying categories indicates an intention by the legislature that uses which would enhance private recreation would not so qualify. The short answer to this contention is that land used as a golf course, whether private or public, falls clearly within several of the other alternative categories enumerated in $ 12-107b (c). It certainly would tend to \u201c(1) maintain and enhance the conservation of natural or scenic resources\u201d and \u201c(4) enhance the value to the public of abutting or neighboring parks, forests, wildlife preserves, nature reservations or sanctuaries or other open spaces\u201d; in many instances it tends to \u201c(2) protect natural streams or water supply,\u201d and to \u201c(3) promote conservation of soils, wetlands, beaches or tidal marshes\u201d through the preservation of open areas of fields, grasses, ponds, streams and marshes and simply by the absence of buildings, filling operations and eroding factors introduced by residential or commercial developers. Although it is not necessary to qualify under category (5) as well as under one or more of the other categories mentioned above, it is even arguable that a private golf course indirectly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>enhances public recreation opportunities by relieving the pressure on public golfing facilities and by frequently permitting \u201cbff-season\u201d public uses of the golf course for sledding, skating and skiing.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">In any event, \u201cpublic use\u201d is not one of the statute\u2019s criteria, for it is clear that this legislation is directed toward privately owned and privately used properties by the total absence of any requirement that designated properties be open to use by members of the general public. If public use properties already would be exempt from taxation under \u00a712-81 (4) or \u00a712-81 (5)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> of the General Statutes, there would have been no purpose for the adoption of Public Acts 1963, No. 490, the clear intent of which is to promote conservation by offering a measure of tax relief to privately owned and privately used properties qualifying as open space land. And although it is true that, as argued by the defendant, tax exemption statutes, generally speaking, must be strictly construed in favor of the sovereign, this court has stated: \u201cIt is also true, however, that such strict construction neither requires nor permits the contravention of the true intent and purpose of the statute as expressed in the language used.\u201d <em>Jewett City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Board of Equalization, </em>116 Conn. 172, 185, 164 A. 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-5\"> Although \u00a7 12-107e of the General Statutes provides that \u201can owner of land\u201d may apply for open space land qualification, it further states that \u201cany person aggrieved by the denial ... of any application\u201d may appeal therefrom. The printed record and the exhibits fail to disclose who signed or filed the original application for classification, but since it was stipulated by the parties that the plaintiff \u201cas lessee has standing to maintain this appeal\u201d and the court specifically so found, this question was not considered by the trial court nor was it raised or considered in the appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> \u201cAs Wilton becomes more fully developed over the years just ahead, the need for park and recreation space will become more acute \u2014 at the same time that the chances of getting good, well-located recreation areas will decrease. . . . Most communities have grown without preserving enough land, among other things, for natural forest and for active recreation. This must not happen in Wilton if the Town is to retain its basic attraction as a good place to live. ... In order to preserve some of the Town\u2019s open character, additional park and . . .
