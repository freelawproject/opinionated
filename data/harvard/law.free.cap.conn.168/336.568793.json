The plaintiff, Walter Morgan, applied for medical assistance under what is commonly referred to as the \u201cMedicaid\u201d program administered by the state welfare department under \u00a7\u00a7 17-134a\u201417-134l of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>General Statutes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> His eligibility to participate in tbe program having been denied by a caseworker, and having also been denied by a hearing officer after a statutory fair hearing, the plaintiff appealed to the Circuit Court under the then provisions of \u00a7 17-2b.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Circuit Court rendered judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s appeal, whereupon the plaintiff sought review in the Appellate Division of the Court of Common Pleas which reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case with direction to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. Counsel entered into a stipulation to include as part of the record in this appeal the transcript of the fair hearing, the exhibits presented therein, and the finding of the fair hearing officer, hereinafter PHO.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The relevant facts, drawn mainly from the fair hearing transcript,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hereinafter FHT, which is not inconsistent with the synopsis of the evidence as printed in an appendix to the plaintiff\u2019s brief, are as follows: The plaintiff, who at the time of the hearing was a patient at Park Manor Convalescent Hospital in Waterbury, applied for medical assistance under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 17-134a through 17-134l. As previously indicated, the medical assistance program consists of the administration by the commissioner of the federal medical aid program provided in Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965; 42 U.S.C, \u00a7\u00a7 1396-1396i; commonly referred to as Medicaid. The plaintiff\u2019s application was filed on February 2, 1971, and denied on March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>24,1971, by a caseworker solely on the ground of the plaintiff\u2019s purported disposal of assets without fair value, in that, in October, 1969, the plaintiff had quitclaimed his interest, valued at $10,000, in his East Haven home to his daughter in consideration of her having lived with the plaintiff and having provided him with nursing care from July, 1966, to the spring of 1969. At the time of the filing of Ms application the plaintiff received a monthly pension in the amount of $192, and Ms wife was employed and had gross weekly earmngs of $105.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">In 1966 the plaintiff and Ms family determined that he needed professional assistance to care for him on a daily basis since he was suffering from multiple sclerosis. In-home professional care was financially impractical. Marilyn A. Pelsted, the plaintiff\u2019s daughter, in 1963, had purchased property on wMch she had planned to build a home to accommodate herself and her parents. In 1966 the plaintiff\u2019s condition worsened and immediate action became necessary. The construction of her house not having yet been commenced, Mrs. Pelsted thereupon entered into an oral agreement with the plaintiff whereby she would sell her property and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Morgans would sell their home. Together, with the proceeds of the two sales, they would purchase a house large enough to accommodate both Mrs. Felsted\u2019s family and the Morgans. Accordingly, in June, 1966, the Morgans and Mrs. Felsted purchased a house located at 600 Thompson Street in East Haven. The Morgans and Mrs. Felsted each contributed $10,000 toward the down payment on the purchase price, which was $33,000. Mrs. Felsted and her husband obtained a mortgage for $13,000 to cover the balance of the purchase price and assumed the payment of that note and all maintenance costs for the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">The Felsteds then invested $2500 in remodeling the house to accommodate the two families. Under the oral agreement, Mrs. Felsted was to give up her full time employment as a nurse, in which she earned $105 weekly, in order to provide full time nursing care for her father. The parties agreed to value her services at $60 per week and further agreed that when the accrued value of her services approximated the amount of the Morgans\u2019 share of the down payment on the Thompson Street property, the Morgans would convey their interest in the property to Mrs. Felsted. Originally, title to the property was recorded only in the names of the Morgans for the reason that the parties apparently feared that should any of Mrs. Felsted\u2019s six stepchildren become involved in tortious conduct it might mean the loss of the house. The Morgans had once been the victims of a large civil suit and this was given as the reason for their apprehension. In October, 1969, the property was quitclaimed to Mrs. Felsted, the parties being satisfied that the accrued value of Mrs. Felsted\u2019s services to that date provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>adequate consideration for the transfer. At that time the parties did not anticipate that the plaintiff would ever apply for welfare assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">As previously indicated, the record clearly shows that the application for medical assistance originally was denied solely on the basis of the conclusion of the caseworker that reasonable consideration had not been given for the transfer of the property. The PHO in her memorandum cited \u00a7 17-109 of the General Statutes<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and volume 1, Connecticut Welfare Manual \u00a7\u00a7 326 and 326.1,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in concluding that the execution of the oral agreement was not fair value or reasonable consideration for the transfer. The Appellate Division of the Court of Common Pleas held that the executed oral agreement did constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>sufficient consideration for the transfer and that the conflicting sections in the manual must give way to this conclusion.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Section 17-134a of the General Statutes provides that the commissioner is to administer the Title XIX program \u201cin accordance with the requirements provided therein.\u201d Section 17-134e states: \u201cAll of the provisions of this chapter are extended to the medical assistance program except such provisions as are inconsistent with federal law and regulations governing Title XIX of the Social Security Amendments of 1965 and this part.\u201d Thus, the legislature recognized the primacy of the applicable federal provisions and this court must be guided by those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>provisions. Stated in another way, the federal statutes and regulations set a limit upon the authority of the commissioner as well as furnishing a guide to his administration of the program. This limitation would apply, with particular force, to the eligibility requirements, and thus, where the state sets stricter standards for eligibility than those enumerated by the pertinent federal law, the state standards are tacitly inconsistent with those federal provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Section 1396a of 42 U.S.C. states in pertinent part: \u201cA State plan for medical assistance must . . . (17) include reasonable standards . . . for determining eligibility for and the extent of medical assistance under the plan which (A) are consistent with the objectives of this subchapter, (B) provide for taking into account only such income and resources as are, as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, available to the applicant or recipient and ... as would not be disregarded ... in determining his eligibility for such aid, assistance, or benefits, (C) provide for reasonable evaluation of any such income or resources.\u201d Section 1396a further states in subsection (19) that the state plan must \u201cprovide such safeguards as may be necessary to assure that eligibility for care and services under the plan will be determined, and such care and services will be provided, in a manner consistent with simplicity of admixfistration and the best interests of the recipients.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">The federal regulations presently applicable, 45 C.F.R. \u00a7248.21 (1974), provide the following with regard to financial eligibility for medical assistance programs: \u201c(a) State plan requirements. A State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>plan under Title XIX of the Social Security Act must: ... (2) .... (i) Provide that only such income and resources as are <em>actually available </em>will be considered and that income and resources will be reasonably evaluated; . . . (3) . . . (iv) Provide that only such income and resources will be considered as will be \u2018in hand\u2019 within a period, preferably of not more than 3 months, but not in excess of 6 months, ahead, including the month in which medical services were rendered, for which payment would be made under the plan.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The federal statutes and regulations were fully discussed in their relation to the state administration of Title XIX in <em>Wilczynski </em>v. Harder, 323 F. Sup. 509 (D. Conn.). The court there distinguished the eligibility requirements under the four state categorical assistance programs \u2014 dependent children, aged, blind, and disabled \u2014 from eligibility requirements for participation in the Title XIX program, and found that, despite ineligibility for state relief under the four enumerated programs, those persons satisfying Title XIX requirements would be eligible for Medicaid benefits. Id., 514, 515. The court found three classes of eligible recipients for Title XIX. The first class consists of those receiving aid under any one of the four categorical assistance programs. The second class consists of those persons who would be eligible for aid under one of the categorical assistance programs but for state eligibility requirements applicable to those programs which are at the same time specifically prohibited as eligibility requirements for Title XIX. These first two classes are referred to as the \u201ccategorically needy.\u201d The third class, referred to as the \u201cmedically needy,\u201d consists of those who are related to the categorical programs, that is, by being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>old, or disabled, or blind or by having dependent children, but whose income \u201cand/or\u201d assets exceed the eligibility limits of the appropriate category but are insufficient to pay for their medical care. <em>Wilczynski </em>v. <em>Harder, </em>supra, 515.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Where \u00a7 17-134e incorporates the other provisions of chapter 302 not inconsistent with federal law, the incorporation creates the classes referred to in <em>Wilczynski. </em>The use by the FHO of \u00a7 17-109 (e) as an outright bar to eligibility disregards the distinctions enumerated in <em>Wilctsynsld. </em>Even if we assume the correctness of the FHO\u2019s conclusion concerning eligibility under \u00a7 17-109 (e), this conclusion would merely render the plaintiff ineligible for the particular state categorical programs to which \u00a7 17-109 applies, that is, assistance to the aged, blind and disabled. It would not create an automatic ineligibility for Title XIX relief. The commissioner had the responsibility, before denying Title XIX relief, to determine whether the plaintiff was eligible as a member of either the second or third class discussed in <em>Wilczynski. </em>No such determination was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">In addition, we cannot find that, in the first instance, the FHO correctly concluded that \u00a7 17-109 (e) barred the plaintiff. The issue of the enforceability of this type of oral contract, involving a similar family arrangement, has previously been decided by this court. In <em>Padula </em>v. <em>Padula, </em>138 Conn. 102, 82 A.2d 362, the facts of which are relevant to our consideration here, Liberto Padula agreed to live with his father-in-law, Amar\u00f3se, on his (Amarose\u2019s) farm and to care for both the property and Amarose. Liberto constructed a new farm building and, at his own expense, made extensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>repairs and improvements. Amar\u00f3se had orally agreed that if Liberto would live with him and care for him and the property, he would give Liberto the farm. Por a period of thirty years Liberto fulfilled his part of the agreement. Amar\u00f3se, however, conveyed the farm to Liberto\u2019s sons by reason of some claimed undue influence on their part, and Liberto sought to set aside this conveyance. The trial court sustained demurrers to his complaint, two of the issues raised being that the oral contract violated the Statute of Frauds and that the contract was not founded upon valuable consideration. In reversing the trial court, this court ruled that performance by Liberto was sufficient to remove the contract from the Statute of Frauds. As to the question of consideration the court stated (p. 109): \u201cThe defendants\u2019 contention, concerning Liberto\u2019s cause of action, that the contract was not equal, just and fair and founded upon a valuable consideration is without merit. The consideration alleged is Liberto\u2019s agreement to live on the farm and take care of it and of Amar\u00f3se during the latter\u2019s life. That not only is legal consideration for the contract but also is adequate to justify enforcement of the agreement in equity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Similarly, in the case before us, the performance by Mrs. Felsted of her duties under the oral agreement was sufficient to render the agreement an enforceable contract and, further, constituted reasonable consideration. Even more compelling than the situation in <em>Padula </em>is the fact that, having placed a specific value upon her services, the Morgans conveyed their interest at the time that the accrued value of Mrs. Felsted\u2019s services approximated the value of that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>The restrictions of \u00a7 326.1 of volume 1 of the Connecticut Welfare Manual, that only support rendered subsequent to the -date of transfer constitutes consideration and that receipt for payment of a debt must be secured by note or deed, are too strict, and, as has been demonstrated, conflict with this court\u2019s decision in <em>Padula. </em>Within the grant of authority allowing judicial review of such agency action exists the authority to review the propriety of the standards relied upon by the commissioner in effecting his delegated duties. <em>General Motors Corporation </em>v. <em>Mulquin, </em>134 Conn. 118, 131, 55 A.2d 732. We have, in various contexts, reviewed administrative regulations to determine whether they are within the purview of the enabling act and whether the criteria contained in such regulations are as reasonably precise as the subject-matter requires and are reasonably adequate and sufficient to guide the agency and to enable those affected to know their rights and obligations. <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning </em>Commission, 155 Conn. 669, 679, 680, 236 A.2d 917. As we stated in <em>Forest Construction </em>(p. 679): \u201cIt is unrealistic to demand detailed standards which are impracticable or impossible. . . . As the complexity of economic and governmental conditions increases, the modern tendency is liberal in approving broad regulatory standards so as to facilitate the operational functions of administrative boards or commissions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Section 17-109 (e) of the General Statutes and \u00a7 D-244.11 of volume 1 of the Connecticut Welfare Manual, which is, in essence, a paraphrasing of \u00a717-109 (e), furnish guidelines necessary to a cautious determination of eligibility to insulate the assistance programs from fraudulent transfers, but they must be applied in a manner consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>the language and purpose of the federal statutes and regulations. Such standards are necessary for the efficient and equitable operation of these programs, hut they must be sufficiently elastic to incorporate correct legal principles and recognize the realities of the varying practical situations of applicants. Adherence to standards grounded upon a misconception of applicable legal principles only serves to reinforce the growing public perception of such agencies and their operatives as mired in counterproductive pedantries. The commissioner has mistaken the law and thus has acted illegally. <em>Dempsey </em>v. <em>Tynan, </em>143 Conn. 202, 206, 120 A.2d 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The execution of the oral agreement by the Morgans and Mrs. Felsted rendered it enforceable, and the rendition of valuable services by Mrs. Felsted to the plaintiff in reliance on the promise to recompense her by transferring to her the property at such time as the accrued value of her services approximated the value of their interest, despite language in \u00a7 326.1 to the contrary, constituted reasonable consideration under \u00a7 17-109 (e) and \u00a7\u00a7 326 and D-244.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b360-6\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 17-134a. acceptance of federal grants for medical assistance. The welfare commissioner is authorized to take advantage of the medical assistance programs provided in Title XIX, entitled \u2018Grants to States for Medical Assistance Programs,\u2019 contained in the Social Security Amendments of 1965 and may administer the same in accordance with the requirements provided therein, including the waiving, with respect to the amount paid for medical care, of provisions concerning recovery from beneficiaries or their estates, charges and recoveries against legally liable relatives, and liens against property of beneficiaries.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b360-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 17-2b. decision, appeal, (a) Not later than thirty days after such hearing, the commissioner or his designated hearing officer shall render a final decision based upon all the evidence introduced before him and applying all pertinent provisions of law, regulations and departmental policy, and such final decision shall supersede the decision made without a hearing.

Upon receipt of such copy, the welfare commissioner shall certify to the court a transcript of the hearing record, together with a copy of tne hearing decision, and shall forward to the appellant a copy of the transcript of the hearing record. The findings of the commissioner or his designated hearing officer as to the facts, if supported by substantial and competent evidence, shall be conclusive.

A rehearing was scheduled for September 8, 1971, solely for the purpose of creating a proper record for the plaintiff\u2019s appeal to the Circuit Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b362-7\"> It was not determined by the caseworker that the combined monthly income of the Morgans rendered the plaintiff ineligible for medical assistance. The KHO, however, considered ineligibility also on the basis of income and stated in her finding that without offsetting medical costs the income of the Morgans would exceed the maximum monthly support allowance detailed by the regulations of the welfare department in effect at that time. See 1 Conn. Welfare Manual \u00a7 344.2. The fair hearing was conducted solely to determine the correctness of the caseworker\u2019s ruling with regard to the disposal of assets, and the parties presented no evidence with regard to the plaintiff\u2019s ineligibility by reason of excessive income. In determining the validity of the ageney action, the KHO should have confined herself to the stated basis for that aetion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 17-109. eligibility.
