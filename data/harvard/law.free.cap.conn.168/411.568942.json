In a detailed memorandum of decision the trial court <em>(Saden, J.) </em>discussed the well-settled, controlling principles of law and properly applied them to the facts which it found. Our examination of the record discloses no material changes which should be made in the court\u2019s finding and no harmful error in any ruling of the court made in the course of the hearing on the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">The trial court\u2019s memorandum of decision is reported in 32 Conn. Sup. 20, 337 A.2d 1, and we adopt it as a sufficient statement of the reasons why the plaintiffs cannot prevail on the appeal to this court. Since we find no error on the plaintiffs\u2019 appeal, it is unnecessary to consider the merits of the cross appeal filed by the named defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
