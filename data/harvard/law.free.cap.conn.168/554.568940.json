Cutler, the appellant herein, and of Hanoman Realty Corporation and Milton Hanoman. Upon the motion of the plaintiff, three disinterested appraisers were appointed by the court, and they, under oath, within ten days after the time limited for redemption, appraised the mortgaged property and made a written report thereof to the court as required by General Statutes \u00a7 49-14. The court overruled an objection entitled a \u201cremonstrance\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to the acceptance of the report and, thereafter, rendered a supplemental judgment for the plaintiff for the deficiency resulting from the difference between the total amount due on the mortgage debt with interest, costs and fees and the appraised value of the property. The defendant Cutler has appealed, assigning error in the court\u2019s overruling of his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>The initial challenge to the appraisers\u2019 report is one of form, the defendant contending that the appraisal was not in conformity with the requirements of \u00a7 49-14, that the report merely stated that the appraisers \u201cappraised said property\u201d and then listed a value opposite each appraiser\u2019s name without relating the basis for the appraisers\u2019 conclusion as to this value or stating whether it constitutes the fair market value for the property and, further, that the language employed in Practice Book Form No. 361 (fourth form)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not contained in the report. For purposes of comparison, we have reprinted in footnote <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the report issued jointly by the three appraisers omitting the description of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>The defendant\u2019s contention that the report is formally irregular is based on the absence in the report of the words \u201cand find its value to be\u201d as stated in Form 361. The forms set forth in the Practice Book, as stated in a preamble to the section on forms, are merely illustrative; Practice Book, p. 249; and do not carry the force of law. These forms were eom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>piled for the convenience of the bench and bar and their language is not mandatory. The report of the appraisers was in conformity with the requirement of \u00a7 49-14 and the absence of the phrase \u201cand find its value to be\u201d quoted by the defendant from Form 361 did not render the report invalid. The defendant\u2019s argument ignores substance and constitutes a pedantic adherence to form not required in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\">The absence of any stated basis for the appraisal does not render the written report invalid. The determination of value by the appraisers is final and conclusive. General Statutes \u00a7 49-14; <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>153 Conn. 290, 293, 216 A.2d 187, appeal dismissed, 385 U.S. 2, 87 S. Ct. 33, 17 L. Ed. 2d 2. The court\u2019s power to review the determination of value upon an objection is confined to questions of law. Ibid.; <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>122 Conn. 451, 456, 190 A. 616. The appraisers determine the value of property upon their own experience and judgment. <em>Buck </em>v. <em>Morris Park, Inc., </em>supra. The defendant suggests in his brief that the appraisers should be required to employ uniformly one of three appraisal methods: (1) market data approach, (2) comparable sales approach, or (3) reconstruction approach. It is not uniformity of method that is intended by the employment of three indifferent appraisers but the obtaining of three independent judgments as to value. Although the court may properly consider the methods employed by the appraisers, errors of judgment as to the value of the property must stand uncorrected. <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>supra, 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">The defendant next complains that one of the three appraisers made a substantial mistake of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>by employing what the defendant refers to as the \u201creconstruction approach.\u201d The simple answer to this contention is contained in <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade </em>(p. 458): \u201c[T]he appraisal is not made by one individual but is the joint act of all three, bringing to bear upon the problem the individual knowledge and the individual judgment of each, affording the opportunity for the correction of an individual member\u2019s error by action of the others. It is for this reason that a mistake by a single appraiser is insufficient to invalidate the appraisal reached by all three acting jointly. In no case can an appraisal so determined be set aside in the absence of a showing of some serious mistake of fact or the adoption of an erroneous principle of law which substantially affected it as made by the three considered as a joint board. While inquiry of the individual appraiser as to the principles and methods which he used is permissible where an appraisal is challenged on these grounds, the ultimate inquiry must be, not whether the individual appraiser made a mistake, but whether there was a mistake of fact or law which substantially affected the appraisal which was finally made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-4\">The appraisers concluded that the cost of rehabilitating a dilapidated building upon the mortgaged property was prohibitive. All three appraisers agreed that rehabilitation was infeasible but ascribed different costs to rehabilitating or reconstructing the building. By the defendant\u2019s calculations, this reconstruction or rehabilitation approach would have resulted in a valuation by one appraiser of $13,600 rather than $4000. The higher value is based upon a reconstruction of the building and the rental of its six apartments at $140 per month. \u201cIt is the actual value of the property as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>of the date when title vested in the plaintiff under the foreclosure decree which it was incumbent upon the appraisers to determine under the statute.\u201d <em>Equitable Life Assurance Society </em>v. <em>Slade, </em>supra, 459. The reconstruction approach urged by the defendant would not have reflected the actual value on the date of foreclosure and the selection and use of an alternate method of valuation was proper and correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b577-7\"> Since adoption of the 1963 Practice Book, the term \u201cremonstrance\u201d is no longer used in our practice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-4\"> The Practice Book suggests the following form for appraisal reports:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">361</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">Appraisal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5o\">\n<em>Caption of Case</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-7\">We, the undersigned, appointed to appraise under oath the property described in the judgment of foreclosure in the above entitled case, having been sworn by Joseph Smith, of New Haven, a commissioner of the superior court, to make a true appraisal thereof, so appraised it on July 12, 1962, and find its value to be $8000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-8\">James Pox</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ9\">Henry Doe</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsR\">Jules Camp\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b578-9\"> \u201cReport op Appraisers</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-10\">To the Clerk op said Court:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-11\">State op Connecticut]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-12\">\u00a1- ss.
