The complaint alleges that while the minor plaintiff was playing in the backyard of a home at which he was visiting, the defendant threw a rock, stone or other missile into the yard and struck the minor plaintiff in the eye and \u201c [a] s a result of said battery by the defendant, the plaintiff Richard Alteiri suffered severe, painful and permanent injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">The date of the alleged battery was April 2,1966. The writ, summons and complaint were dated March 18, 1969, and filed on March 20, 1969. The defendant answered the allegations of the complaint by leaving the plaintiffs to their proof except for admitting the minority of the plaintiff Richard Alteiri. On the first day of trial the defendant, over the objection of the plaintiffs, was allowed to plead as a special defense that the action \u201cwas not brought within one year from the act of neglect complained of and is therefore barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d At the close of evidence and prior to the commencement of argument, the court brought to the attention of counsel the fact that no evidence had been offered with respect to the special defense of the Statute of Limitations. Counsel for the defendant moved to \u201creopen\u201d in order to offer proof of the special defense by way of judicial notice of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>pleadings or by offer of evidence. The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion and later charged the jury to disregard the special defense of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Six interrogatories were submitted to the jury. Two interrogatories were answered in the affirmative as follows: \u201cOn April 2,1966, did the defendant, John Colasso, throw a stone which struck the plaintiff, Richard Alteiri, in the right eye?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d \u201c[W]as that stone thrown by John Colasso with the intent to scare any person other than Richard Alteiri?\u201d Answer: \u201cYes.\u201d The jury answered \u201cNo\u201d to four other questions concerning whether the defendant had intended to strike either the minor plaintiff or any other person and whether he had thrown the stone either negligently or wantonly and recklessly. A plaintiffs\u2019 verdict was returned. The defendant has appealed from the judgment rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The defendant assigns error in the court\u2019s refusal to charge on the applicability of the one-year Statute of Limitations to a personal injury action arising out of negligence or reckless or wanton misconduct, in its charging the defense of this statute of limitations out of the case, and in its overruling the defendant\u2019s motion to open to offer proof relative to this special defense. Whether the court was in error as claimed by the defendant need not be determined. The jury specifically found, as evidenced by their answers to the interrogatories,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the conduct of the defendant was neither neg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ligent nor reckless and wanton bnt intentional. Consequently, the Statute of Limitations relied upon by the defendant, then General Statutes \u00a7 52-584,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> by its terms does not apply to this action; rather General Statutes \u00a7 52-577, which requires actions founded upon a tort to be brought within three years from the date of the act or omission complained of, would govern. The defendant could not have been harmed by the actions of the court in denying the motion to open or in removing the defense of the one-year Statute of Limitations from the consideration of the jury. Accordingly, whether the court committed error in this respect need not be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Error is assigned in the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motions to set aside the verdict and for judgment notwithstanding the verdict. The defendant claims that the jury could not have reasonably and logically rendered a verdict under our law when in their answers to the interrogatories they expressly found that the defendant did not throw the stone with intent to strike either the minor plaintiff or any other person and did not throw the stone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>either negligently or wantonly and recklessly. In this state an actionable assault and battery may be one committed wilfully or voluntarily, and therefore intentionally; one done under circumstances showing a reckless disregard of consequences; or one committed negligently. <em>Russo </em>v. <em>Porga, </em>141 Conn. 706, 708-9, 109 A.2d 585; <em>Lentine </em>v. <em>McAvoy, </em>105 Conn. 528, 531, 136 A. 76. By their answers to the interrogatories it is clear that the jury found that the battery to the minor plaintiff was one committed wilfully. The issue to be determined on this appeal is whether a jury upon finding that the defendant threw the stone with the intent to scare someone other than the one who was struck by the stone can legally and logically return a verdict for the plaintiffs for a wilful battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">In <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Doody, </em>119 Conn. 532, 534, 178 A. 51, in discussing the distinction between reckless disregard and wilfulness the court stated that a \u201cwilful and malicious injury is one inflicted intentionally without just cause or excuse. It does not necessarily involve the ill will or malevolence shown in express malice. Nor is it sufficient to constitute such an injury that the act resulting in the injury was intentional in the sense that it was the voluntary action of the person involved. Not only the action producing the injury but the resulting injury must be intentional.\u201d The defendant claims, in reliance upon this principle, that as there was no intention either to injure the minor plaintiff or to put bim in apprehension of bodily harm there could be no recoyery for a wilful battery. The intention of the defendant was not only to throw the stone \u2014 the act resulting in the injury was intentional \u2014 but his intention was also to cause a resulting injury, that is, an apprehension of bodily harm. If the stone <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>had struck the one whom the defendant had intended to frighten, the defendant would have been liable for a battery. The statement in <em>Rogers </em>that the \u201cresulting injury must be intentional\u201d would be satisfied as the injury intended was the apprehension of bodily harm and the resulting bodily harm was the direct and natural consequence of the intended act. Restatement (Second), 1 Torts \u00a7 13 ;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Weisbart </em>v. <em>Florh, </em>260 Cal. App. 2d 281, 290, 67 Cal. Rptr. 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">It is not essential that the precise injury which was done be the one intended. 1 Cooley, Torts (4th Ed.). \u00a7 98. An act designed to cause bodily injury to a particular person is actionable as a battery not only by the person intended by the actor to be injured but also by another who is in fact so injured.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Restatement (Second), 1 Torts \u00a713; <em>Singer </em>v. <em>Marx, </em>144 Cal. App. 2d 637, 301 P.2d 440; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Moran, </em>43 Ill. App. 2d 373, 193 N.E.2d 466; <em>McGee </em>v. <em>Vanover, </em>148 Ky. 737, 147 S.W. 742; <em>Talmage </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>101 Mich. 370, 59 N.W. 656; <em>Carnes </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>48 S.W.2d 903 (Mo.); <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Flores, </em>225 S.W.2d 621 (Tex.

This principle of \u201ctransferred, intent\u201d applies as well to the action of assault. See <em>Davis </em>v. <em>McKey, </em>167 So. 2d 416 (La. App.); <em>Jeppsen </em>v. <em>Jensen, </em>47 Utah 536, 155 P. 429; Prosser, supra; 6 Am. Jur. 2d, Assault and Battery, \u00a7 115. And where one intends merely an assault, if bodily injury results to one other than the person whom the actor intended to put in apprehension of bodily harm, it is battery actionable by the injured person. Restatement (Second), 1 Torts \u00a7 16;<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Martinez, </em>68 N.M. 271, 361 P.2d 152; <em>Daingerfield </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>74 Va. (33 Grratt.) 136; Prosser, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">The defendant claims that comment b to subsection 2 of \u00a7 16 of the Restatement (Second) indicates that subsection 2 applies only to negligent acts where a person not intended to be injured is injured. The comment states in pertinent part that \u201c[i]t is not necessary that the actor know or have reason even to suspect that the other is in the vicinity of the third person whom the actor intends to affect and, therefore, that he should recognize that his act, though directed against a third person, involves a risk of causing bodily harm to the other so that the act would be negligent toward him.\u201d It is clear that the gist of this comment is that the actor need not know or suspect the presence of the third party, that is, need not be negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>It follows that the jury conld logically and legally return a plaintiffs\u2019 verdict for wilful battery, and that the court in accepting that verdict and denying the defendant\u2019s motions was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-9\"> The primary purpose of au interrogatory is to elicit a determination of material facts and to furnish a means of testing the correctness of the Verdict rendered. <em>Willamets </em>v. <em>Guida-Seibert Dairy Co., </em>157 Conn. 295, 301-2, 254 A.2d 473.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 52-584. limitation op action por injury to person OR property.
