In an affirmative reply to this defense the plaintiff claimed that any statute of limitations which might apply was tolled because of the plaintiff\u2019s unsound mind and Ms <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>false imprisonment. The trial court sustained the Institute\u2019s demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s affirmative reply and, the plaintiff having failed to plead over, judgment was rendered in favor of the Institute. <em>Kirwan </em>v. <em>State, </em>31 Conn. Sup. 46, 320 A.2d 837. This appeal is from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">The correctness of a ruling sustaining a demurrer is determined upon the basis of the facts which may properly be proved under the allegations demurred to; <em>Rutt </em>v. <em>Roche,. </em>138 Conn. 605, 608-609, 87 A.2d 805; and these are to be given the same favorable construction that the trier would adopt in admitting evidence. <em>McNish </em>v. <em>American Brass Co., </em>139 Conn. 44, 48-49, 89 A.2d 566, cert. denied, 344 U.S. 913, 73 S. Ct. 336, 97 L. Ed. 704.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">The complaint alleges the following: In August, 1941, the plaintiff, a resident of the state of New York, was lured into Connecticut and committed to the Institute pursuant to an order of the Probate Court for the district of Hartford, \u201cto be confined while said mental illness continues, or until he shall be discharged in due course of law.\u201d Despite the plaintiff\u2019s repeated requests to be released and returned to New York, he was kept under close supervision and restraint at the Institute against his will until July 20, 1942, when he was transferred, successively, to two privately owned asylums in Connecticut, where he remained until August 11, 1967, and then was transferred to a hospital located in the state of New York. He was released March 6, 1972, after a court in that state so ordered. The plaintiff, who is now deceased, instituted this action by complaint dated February 7, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Neither of the relevant Statutes of Limitations<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> makes provision for tolling in the ease of insane persons. While it must be admitted that this omission is unusual in the light of the fact that in at least forty-six states there is provision for tolling; see statutes cited in 4 Am. Jur. Trials 602, Statutes of Limitation, appendix fig. 7; and that its absence may work hardship, it is not the function of this court to pass upon the merit of legislation. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>135 Conn. 176, 179, 62 A.2d 771. Suffice it to say that the omission of a tolling provision in these sections of the General Statutes is highlighted by the inclusion of tolling provisions in another section;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> hence, we must assume that the differences were intentional and that the legislature did not intend insanity necessarily to toll the Statute of Limitations. <em>Lametta </em>v. <em>Connecticut Light &amp; Power Co., </em>139 Conn. 218, 92 A.2d 731, and see cases cited therein. It is clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>that the plaintiff\u2019s insanity does not toll the Statute of Limitations, any more than a person\u2019s ignorance that a cause of action exists saves him from the operation of limitations. <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Johns-Manville Sales Corporation, </em>supra, 179. Consequently, the plain meaning and intent of the statute bars the plaintiff\u2019s negligence claim in the absence of any allegation that the Institute fraudulently concealed from him the existence of a cause of action. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-595; <em>Rosenblatt </em>v. <em>Berman, </em>143 Conn. 31, 40, 119 A.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">The plaintiff claims that the Statute of Limitations should not have run while he was insane, raising in his brief for the first time the possibility that he was under disability. If the plaintiff were legally incompetent to sue or his access to the courts were impaired, the statute could not commence the limitatations period running until he regained his legal competency; otherwise, through no fault of Ms own, he could be barred from any redress and thus become a legally helpless and vulnerable target for any careless or malicious person. See <em>Hobart </em>v. <em>Connecticut Turnpike Co., </em>15 Conn. 145, 148. Furthermore, in no case does the law deprive an insane person or a person under a disability of access to the courts in order to seek redress, but a court may make provision to insure that such person\u2019s interests are well represented. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 17-201 (habeas corpus),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 45-75 (conserva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>tors), 45-54 (guardian ad litem), 52-175 (evidence); <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Jerman, </em>77 Conn. 374, 380, 59 A. 425; <em>Neely </em>v. <em>Hogan, </em>62 Misc. 2d 1056, 310 N.Y.S.2d 63, 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Thus, it is insufficient, for Statute of Limitations purposes, to allege merely that a party is insane. Absent an allegation, which must later be proved, that the insane person was or should have been adjudicated incompetent; annot., \u201cProof of unadjudged incompeteney which prevents running of statute of limitations,\u201d 9 A.L.R.2d 964; or that he was prevented from pursuing his remedies by the tortious or illegal acts of the Institute, the complaint raises no issue as to the suspension of the operation of the Statute of Limitations, it being presumed that the plaintiff was competent and capable of pursuing his case in the courts. Annots., 24 A.L.R.2d 618 (Imprisonment); 166 A.L.R. 960 (Insane Persons).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The plaintiff in his brief contends that the course of treatment was terminated on March 6, 1972, when he was released from the hospital in New York. However, the Institute terminated its course of treatment on July 20, 1942, when the plaintiff was transferred. Absent an allegation \u2014 which must be later proven \u2014 that the other institutions were agents of the Institute or were engaged in a conspiracy with the Institute in a policy designed to avoid liability at the expense of proper therapy, no case can be made out for holding that the course of treatment afforded by the Institute extended to March 6, 1972. The court did not err in sustaining the Institute\u2019s demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s affirmative reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-6\"> General Statutes \u00a7 52-584, entitled \u201cLimitation of action for injury to person or property,\u201d provides, in pertinent part: \u201cNo action to recover damages for injury to the person, . . . caused by negligence, or by reckless or wanton misconduct, or by malpractice of a physician, surgeon, . . . hospital or sanatorium, shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b523-9\">General Statutes \u00a7 52-577, entitled \u201cAction founded upon a tort,\u201d provides: \u201cNo action founded upon a tort shall be brought but within three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b523-11\"> The action clearly sounds in intentional tort and in negligence. Hence the contract Statute of Limitations, \u00a7 52-576, which provides that in actions for account or on simple or implied contracts \u201cpersons legally incapable of bringing any such action at the accruing of the right of action may sue at any time within three years next after becoming legally capable of bringing such action,\u201d does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b524-7\"> First enacted as chapter 162 of the 1889 Public Acts. Since the plaintiff was committed, it cannot be argued that his remedy of habeas corpus was ineffective. Compare <em>Logan </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>346 F. Sup. 1265 (D. Conn.), aff\u2019d, sub nom. <em>Briggs </em>v. <em>Arafeh, </em>411 U.S. 911, 93 S. Ct. 1556, 36 L. Ed. 2d 304, with comment, \u201cThe Mentally Ill in Connecticut\u2014A Survey,\u201d 6 Conn. L.
