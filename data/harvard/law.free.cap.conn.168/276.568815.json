The case arose from a dispute over the execution of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>contract for the reconstruction of the main floor concrete slab of the plaintiff\u2019s firehouse. It is the claim of the plaintiff that the defendant contractor violated provisions of the contract calling for the floor to be of green color and to be free of blemishes from poor workmanship. The contract provided for the arbitration of any claim or dispute \u201cexcept those relating to artistic effect.\u201d As to \u201cmatters relating to artistic effect,\u201d it was provided that the architect\u2019s decision should be final \u201cif consistent with the intent of the Contract Documents.\u201d The specifications provided that \u201csix pounds of green color pigment would be added to each bag of cement to produce a deep green color of concrete.\u201d The architect-engineer on the project approved the defendant\u2019s bill for payment of the contract price plus extras of $800.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The court granted the defendant\u2019s motion that the parties proceed to arbitration of their dispute and denied the plaintiff\u2019s application to stay arbitration proceedings. The plaintiff has appealed, claiming error in the court\u2019s ruling that disputes over floor color and blemishes from defective workmanship are not excluded from the arbitration agreement as matters of \u201cartistic effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The basic question, of course, is whether the contractor properly fulfilled its obligations under the contract, including among the specifications for the work the color achieved by compliance with those specifications. A dispute on these questions is clearly subject to arbitration under the terms of the parties\u2019 agreement while leaving any question as to the \u201cartistic effect\u201d to the decision of the architect.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We find no error in the court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
