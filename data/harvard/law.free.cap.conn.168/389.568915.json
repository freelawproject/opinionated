The plaintiff was arrested on November 12, 1969, and charged with murder. He was arraigned in the Superior Court in New Haven on the same day, denied bail and held in custody under a mittimus. On August 3, 1970, a jury found the accused guilty of murder in the second degree and, on August 21, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment. He remained in custody under the mittimus from the date of his arrest until the date of his sentencing, a total of 282 days. Upon the refusal of the defendant, the commissioner of correction, to credit the plaintiff with the period of time spent in custody prior to sentencing, the plaintiff petitioned the Superior Court to issue a writ of mandamus ordering the defendant commissioner to credit the plaintiff\u2019s life sentence with 282 days for parole consideration. The court, after hearing, granted the petition and the defendant has appealed from that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">The agreed issue presented in this appeal is whether the plaintiff, who was sentenced to life imprisonment, is entitled to credit for presentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>confinement, commonly referred to as \u201cjail time,\u201d under the provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98. In determining this issue, we also consider \u00a7\u00a7 54-125 and 18-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">Section 18-97<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in its relevant portions grants a \u201ccredit\u201d towards the prison or jail sentence of \u201cany person\u201d for days spent in custody under a mittimus awaiting trial and sentencing or any other proceeding. Section 18-98<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> grants a similar credit to \u201cany person\u201d who has been denied bail by the court or who has been unable to obtain bail. Section 54-125<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>is concerned with the statutory provisions pertaining to an inmate\u2019s eligibility to appear before the parole board for consideration. That statute allows \u201cany person,\u201d if sentenced for life, to be paroled after he has been confined for not less than twenty-five years, less \u201cgood time\u201d not exceeding five years, as may have been earned under \u00a7 18-7 of the General Statutes. Under the provisions of \u00a7 18-7, the so-called good-time-earned statute, any inmate may, by good conduct and obedience to the rules of the correctional institution, earn a diminution or commutation of his sentence amounting to sixty days for each year, and, in addition, five days of each month, as a meritorious time service award for exemplary conduct and meritorious achievement.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">The defendant commissioner claims that under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a754-125 and 18-7, an inmate serving a life sentence is required to serve a minimum of twenty years <em>after </em>the day of sentencing before he becomes eligible for parole consideration, i.e., twenty-five years under the minimum sentence, less five years\u2019 maximum earned or \u201cgood\u201d time as provided in \u00a7 18-7. It is the defendant\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in crediting 282 days of presentence confinement since such credit reduced the plaintiff\u2019s minimum term below the twenty years required by \u00a7\u00a7 54-125 and 18-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\">In considering the relevant statutes, it is a cardinal rule of construction that statutes are to be construed so that they carry out the intention of the legislature. <em>Hurlbut </em>v. <em>Lemelin, </em>155 Conn. 68, 73, 230 A.2d 36. This intent is to be ascertained from the language of the statute itself, if the language is plain and unambiguous. <em>Landry </em>v. <em>Personnel Appeal Board, </em>138 Conn. 445, 447, 86 A.2d 70. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>Where the legislative intent is clear, and the language used to express it is unambiguous, there is no room for statutory construction. <em>State ex rel. Cooley </em>v. <em>Kegley, </em>143 Conn. 679, 683, 124 A.2d 898; <em>State ex rel. Rourke </em>v. <em>Barbieri, </em>139 Conn. 203, 207, 91 A.2d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The legislative intent is clearly expressed in \u00a7 18-97; therefore, there is no necessity for statutory construction. The legislature, in using the words \u201cany person,\u201d unambiguously intended that all prison inmates serving sentences in all correctional institutions are entitled to be credited with whatever period of time they served while held in custody awaiting trial and sentencing because of a court-ordered mittimus. A similar legislative intent is expressly stated in \u00a7 18-98 to grant all inmates, who are denied bail or are unable to obtain bail, credit for \u201cjail time\u201d spent awaiting trial and sentencing. Both statutes are mandatory and require automatic administrative action and procedure. The language of both statutes is inclusive and indicates no intention to exclude inmates who are serving life sentences. The words used in expressing the legislative intent are to be given their commonly approved meaning, unless a contrary intent is clearly expressed. General Statutes \u00a71-1; <em>Southern New England Telephone Co. </em>v. <em>Public Utilities Commission, </em>144 Conn. 516, 522, 134 A.2d 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">It is not the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98 to reduce the time a prisoner must serve pursuant to a sentence, as is the purpose of \u00a7 18-7, the \u201cgood-time\u201d statute. Rather, the purpose of the \u201cjail-time\u201d statutes is to give recognition to the period of presentence time served and to permit the prisoner, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>effect, to commence serving his sentence from the time he was compelled to remain in custody due to a mittimus (\u00a7 18-97) or because of the court\u2019s refusal to allow bail or the defendant\u2019s inability to raise bail (\u00a7 18-98).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">In contradistinction to \u201cjail time,\u201d \u201cgood time\u201d is a commutation of a sentence, affecting an inmate\u2019s parole and discharge dates, thereby serving an important rehabilitative function by allowing an inmate the opportunity to earn an earlier release for himself. See <em>McGinnis </em>v. <em>Royster, </em>410 U.S. 263, 271, 35 L. Ed. 2d 282, 93 S. Ct. 1055. Thus \u201cjail time\u201d is fundamentally distinct from \u201cgood time,\u201d and the defendant\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 54-125 as limiting the amount of both to five years would contradict the express language of \u00a7\u00a7 18-97 and 18-98.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">In this opinion Loiselle, MacDonald and Bogdanski, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-7\"> \u201c[General Statutes] See. 18-97. credit towards fine or sentence for a period spent in custody under mittimus.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiQ\">(dissenting). I do not agree with the conclusion that an inmate serving a life sentence is entitled to credit under the provisions of \u00a7 18-97 of the General Statutes for any days spent in custody before trial. Rather, I would follow the reasoning expressed by the Superior Court in <em>Kimbro </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>30 Conn. Sup. 20, 295 A.2d 569, and the \u201c \u2018well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute which might otherwise prove controlling.\u2019 <em>Kepner </em>v. <em>United States, </em>195 U.S. 100, 125, 24 S. Ct. 797, 49 L. Ed. 114.\u201d <em>Charlton Press, Inc. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>153 Conn. 103, 110, 214 A.2d 354. My conclusion is buttressed by the fact that \u00a7 18-97, of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>application, was adopted as \u00a7 1 of the 1969 Public Acts, No. 735, and thereafter, as \u00a7 30 of the 1973 Public Acts, No. 73-116, the General Assembly reenacted the specific provision now contained in \u00a7 54-125 of the General Statutes that \u201c[a]ny person confined in the Connecticut Correctional Institution, Somers ... if sentenced for life, after having been in confinement under such sentence for not less than twenty-five years, less such time, not exceeding a total of five years, as may have been earned under the provisions of section 18-7, may be allowed to go at large on parole in the discretion of the panel of the board of parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">To allow an inmate serving a life term credit in excess of the time earned for good behavior runs directly counter to the repeated and latest specific expression of the legislative intent that in the absence of action by the board of pardons such an inmate must serve a minimum of twenty-five years less only good behavior time in a maximum amount of five years.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
