This causal connection must rest upon more than surmise or conjecture. <em>Witkowski </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>115 Conn. 693, 696, 163 A. 413; <em>Green </em>v. <em>Stone, </em>119 Conn. 300, 306, 176 A. 123. A trier is not concerned with possibilities but with reasonable probabilities. <em>Richardson </em>v. <em>Pratt &amp; Whit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>ney Mfg. Co., </em>129 Conn. 669, 672, 30 A.2d 919. The cansal relation between an injury and its later physical effects may be established by the direct opinion of a physician, by his deduction by the process of eliminating causes other than the traumatic agency, or by his opinion based upon a hypothetical question.\u201d <em>Boland </em>v. <em>Vanderbilt, </em>140 Conn. 520, 525, 102 A.2d 362.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">In the absence of any medical evidence whatsoever which would support a finding that the bills offered into evidence by the plaintiff were causally connected with the alleged negligence of the defendant, the court properly excluded the offered exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
