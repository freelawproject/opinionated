That the amount of the taxable property of said borough of Ephrata, according to the last assessment, is $794,337 ; and the amount of the indebtedness of the said borough on January 1, 1894, was $15,500.

That the ordinance of September 9, 1895, providing for said issue of bonds to the amount of $30,000, assesses and levies an annual tax of only two mills upon the assessed valuation of the property of said borough, which tax if all were collected will, upon the valuation of the property of the said borough, amounting to $794,337, produce only the sum of $1,588.67, which will not in thirty years or less pay the interest on said bonds amounting to $1,200 per annum, and the principal thereof amounting to $30,000.

That neither the principal officer or officers nor any officer or officers \u00a9f the borough of Ephrata have filed in the office of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>the clerk of quarter sessions of Lancaster county any statement showing the actual indebtedness of the borough of Ephrata, the amount of the last preceding assessed valuation of taxable property therein, the amount of debts to be incurred, the form, number and date of maturity of the obligations to be issued therefor, the amount of annual tax levied and assessed to pay said indebtedness, to which there has been appended any oath or affirmar tion of the truth of the facts therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-3\">10. That the proposed increase of indebtedness of the borough of Ephrata will exceed three per centum; that the ordinance as amended on October 9, 1895, levies a tax sufficient to pay the principal and interest of the debt within thirty years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-4\">CONCLUSIONS OK LAW.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-5\">The main question submitted to us in this contention is the interpretation of the act of assembly of the 18th of April, 1895 (P. L. 86). The plaintiffs contend that the municipality by this act is permitted to increase its indebtedness to an amount not exceeding two per centum at any one time, and as the borough has proposed to increase it more than three per centum, such action is illegal, and without authority of law. The defendant, on the other hand, contends that the law permits the indebtedness of any borough to be increased to an amount exceeding two per centum, and not exceeding seven per centum, with the assent of the electors : that the act of 1895 does not change the law as it stood in this respect; that it intends only to relieve and abolish the eight per centum restriction under the act of 1874 (P. L. 65), and, therefore, seeks to amend section 4 of the act of 1874 for that purpose, leaving the act of 1891 (P. L. 252) in full force.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-6\">Section 4 of the act of assembly of April 20, 1874, as amended by section 1 of the act of the 18th of April, 1895, reads as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b103-7\">44 Whenever, by the returns of such election, it shall appear that there is a majority voting for 4 no increase of debt,\u2019 such increase shall not be made. Nor shall any other election upon the same subject be held in that municipality for one year from the date of such preceding election. If the return of such election shall show a majority voting that4 debt may be increased,\u2019 the corporate authorities of the municipality may increase the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>same to the amount named and specified in the notice given for the holding of such election for increasing indebtedness, to an amount not exceeding two per centum, including the sworn statement to be filed in the office of the court of quarter sessions of the proper county; and they shall, before issuing any obligation therefor, assess and levy an annual tax, the collection whereof shall commence the first year after the said increase, which tax shall be equal to and sufficient for and applied exclusively to the payment of the interest and the principal of such debt within a period not exceeding thirty years from the date of such increase; and the moneys arising from such tax shall be applied, at such periods as the municipality may stipulate in such obligations, to the redemption at par, of the said outstanding obligations according to their terms.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-4\">Section 2. All acts and parts of acts inconsistent herewith be and the same are hereby repealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">It seems to us that the obvious intention of the act of 1895, as we read it, was to regulate the mode of increasing indebtedness as well as to relieve from and abolish the eight per centum restriction. It will be observed that it is a supplemental act to the act of 1874 with a distinct repealing clause, repealing all acts or parts of acts inconsistent therewith. The following words contained in section 4 of the act of 1874, and also in the act of 1891, commencing on the eighteenth line of section 4 of the former act, as cited for amendment, were altogether left out of the act of 1895 : \u201c In the manner and subject to all the requirements provided by the second section of this act.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-6\">The clause, as it stands in the former act, is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-7\">\u201c If the return of such election shall show a majority voting that \u2018 debt may be increased,\u2019 the corporate authorities of the municipality may increase the same to the amount named and specified in the notice given by them for the holding of such election, in the manner and subject to all the requirements provided by the second section of this act for increasing indebtedness to an amount not exceeding two per centum, including the sworn statement to be filed,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-8\">The clause as it reads in the act of 1895 is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-9\">\u201c If the return of such election shall show a majority voting that \u2018 debt may be increased,\u2019 the corporate authorities of the municipality may increase the same to the amount named and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>specified in the notice given for the holding of such election for increasing indebtedness, to an amount not exceeding two per centum, including the sworn statement to be filed,\u201d etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-3\">The language of this act of assembly appears clear and intelligible. We cannot see that it needs any other interpretation than what the language plainly imports. We can see no ambiguity in it. It plainly indicates when and to what amount the debt may be increased, as it expressly says, to an amount not exceeding two per centum with the assent of the electors. The act does not pretend to limit the borrowing capacity of municipalities to two per centum, and, therefore, is not in direct conflict with article 9, section 8, of the constitution, which fixes the limit at seven per centum. It simply means, therefore, in our opinion, that a municipality can only increase its indebtedness at any one time, at any one election, to an amount not over two per centum, by a vote of the people. We are unable to see that any other construction of the law could be put upon this act, without ignoring the plain intention of the legislature.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-4\">Nor are we permitted to assume in our interpretation of this act of assembly, as contended by the learned counsel for the defendant, that the draughtsman, in his attempt to repeat the entire section proposed for amendment, accidentally dropped the two lines commencing with the eighteenth line of section 4 of the act of 1874. This would be a violent presumption; for statutes cannot be construed in that way. On the contrary, in our opinion, the presumption would be that the legislature purposely intended to leave the matter out; and, perhaps, they did so wisely, having in view the purpose of checking municipal extravagance and expenditures, which have grown to enormous limits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-5\">If we are correct in our view of the law, the proposed increase of indebtedness and issue of bonds for f30,000 is illegal ; because the increase, of indebtedness, as is admitted by the defendant, will exceed three per centum. A.s we have said before, the act of 1895 was intended to repeal, as it says in section 2, all acts or parts of acts inconsistent therewith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b105-6\">We feel disposed to give the borough defendant the benefit of all other defenses, and confine our decision simply to the interpretation of the act o\u2018f 1895. We, therefore, treat the amended ordinance as regular, and permit the defendant to file <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>the sworn statement required by the acts of 1874 and 1895, in ca\u00a7e the appellate court should not meet our view in the interpretation of the act of 1895. In pursuance of this opinion we have handed down a decree, making the injunction in this case perpetual, which we order to be filed with this opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-4\">Now, April 23,1896, this cause came on to be heard and was. argued by counsel at the March term, 1896, equity court, and thereupon it is ordered, adjudged and decreed as follows, viz :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b106-5\">That the corporation of the borough of Ephrata, William K.

The act of 1895 is plainly expressed, is definite in its directions, and free from ambiguity. We cannot reform it to meet a supposed legislative intent not expressed and not apparent on its face. The conclusions of law drawn by the learned judge are an adequate discussion of the subject, and justify the decree appealed from. It is affirmed upon these conclusions.
