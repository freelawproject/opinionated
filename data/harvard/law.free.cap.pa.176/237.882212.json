Gray, called by defendant, testified, under objection and exception, that he was a real estate agent of twenty years\u2019 experience, acquainted with values of property along Crum creek in the vicinity of plaintiff\u2019s property, the price at which they were sometimes held, and for which they were sometimes sold; had made an examination of this property for the purpose of obtaining an idea of its value as affected and unaffected; that he knew one property on the creek which was sold, and he proposed to fix his value of plaintiff\u2019s property from that one, and the general condition of things. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-9\">Chas. Roberts, a witness called by defendant, testified, under objection and exception, that he had been a manufacturer for some thirty years in the vicinity, had examined plaintiff\u2019s property with a view of forming an estimate as to its value so closely as to give the value according to his judgment; had rented steam power; knew of but one mill property along Crum creek which had been sold, the date of which he could not fix; at one time had occasion to value mill properties; knew the rental value of water power which he considered the same as steam power. His knowledge of rental value was obtained by the rental of properties on other streams. [6]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-10\">Samuel Greenwood, called by defendant, testified, under objection and exception, that he was a real estate agent of eighteen years\u2019 experience; had worked in plaintiff\u2019s mill when he was nine years old; had a knowledge of the value of lands in the vicinity; had examined mill properties on Crum creek; was about as much acquainted with their values as any real estate man; had sold mill properties with steam power, but none with water power. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b258-11\">The court charged the jury, among other things, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AEg\">If you can arrive at the value of the property as unaffected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>by tbe exercise of tbe right of the state, then the next step will be to ascertain what it was worth in the market after the right had been exercised, and the difference between the two values would be the correct measure of damage. Now that is the rule. ...</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-3\">There are certain elements that the law permits you to consider ; it permits you to consider all the elements that would increase or diminish the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property by the taking of this water. It is said that the stream furnished him with thirty-five horse power to run this machinery, \u2014 that is an element in the cause, but you are not confined, gentlemen, to that. If there never had been a mill there; if this water never had been used, yet he would be entitled to compensation, if it could be used for any profitable purpose, for instance, what the defendants are using the water for, the purpose of supplying water to the neighborhood, or any legitimate use the plaintiff could put that water to he is entitled to. There is no legal value in water, it is an uncertain and unreliable element. The water that flows down that stream to-day, flowed in that stream above, a day before, and it will be in the river to-morrow;. There is no property in water, and the water that flows from your neighbor above then flows down upon you to the neighbor below, it is only yours while it is on your premises, and though you may use it, it is only yours so far as your present use is concerned, according to law. You have the right to use it while it is on your land, but then you must let it go down to your neighbor below. The right to water, therefore, is its value to the lands through which it flows. Mr. Lewis, therefore, had the right to use this water, while it flowed through his lands, for any legitimate purpose, that is the property he had in the water. He could use it to turn machinery or for any purpose for which he has been using it or for propelling machinery, that is one of the elements in the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b259-4\">Another element in the case is the amount of. water taken. [Well, you have pretty accurate testimony that the amount of water that the defendants have taken is two million gallons a day. By the calculations presented to you upon that subject two million gallons a day at that place would develop three and one sixteenth horse power. A horse power means the force necessary to raise thirty-three thousand pounds one foot in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>minute.] [9] That is power sufficient to raise thirty-three thousand pounds one foot in one minute. It has been demonstrated that power increases according to speed in certain proportions. That is illustrated by the weight of the hand on the \u2022end of the long lever. A lever ten feet long with a bite of an inch from the fulcrum will raise one thousand pounds, but the full radius from the end of the long lever would not raise the given weight more than one sixteenth of an inch.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b260-4\">Old Archimedes demonstrated that he could raise the earth if you would give him the time and a foundation for the fulcrum of his lever. It would take about a million years to do it, but give him the time and good machinery and he could do it. [A horse power, therefore, means the force necessary to raise thirty-three thousand pounds one foot in one minute. It was the result of a series of experiments, made in London, by two celebrated machinists, Bolton &amp; Watts. Now, there are three of such items of power taken from this stream, three and one sixth, and the question is, how much did that diminish the value of the land that had the right to such water. That is the question now before you. You have heard the evidence, steam power can be produced, they say, with a steam engine, properly constructed, of sufficient capacity for about 120.00 per horse power. This does not include the cost of the engine and machinery. If, therefore, you are to consider the uses to which this water could have been put, and find that steam power was necessary for its profitable use, you may consider all of these questions.] [10] You are not bound to confine yourselves to any particular use of this water, the plaintiff had the right to any legitimate use to which this water can be put. All that the law requires is your closest attention and the exercise of your best judgment, and I have no doubt that, if you will take all the testimony, consider the case calmly and thoroughly, that you will' have no insuperable trouble in arriving at a fair and honest verdict. It is not for me to decide the questions of fact. They are to be decided by the jury. You have the right to consider all of these elements, the amount of water taken, the amount of force or power that that water had developed. All these elements are to be considered by you, and then, in connection with the testimony, you are to say, as well as you can, what damages Mr. Lewis has suffered by means of the taking of these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>two million gallons of water. It may be, gentlemen, that it would not pay Mr. Lewis to have a steam engine there for the purpose of supplying these three horse power. You may consider that. The questions are to be decided by the value of the property before this water was taken and its value after, and the difference must be the proper damages. It may be a little difficult for you to ascertain all the proper uses to which the water could be applied, you should review the testimony. [The selling value before the injury seems to be settled at from $10,000 to $12,000, or from $9,000 to $12,000. Some of the witnesses say that a steam engine would be necessary whether this water had been taken or not; and, assuming that fact, then th\u00e9y calculated what three and one sixteenth additional horse power could be furnished for. Mr. Roberts, I think, is nearer correct in his statement than the other witnesses upon that point. He makes the damages $1,660.] [11] The loss is about $1,000, say some of the witnesses for the defendant. The plaintiff\u2019s witnesses take a different view of the value of the land. They think the value depends upon the water power alone, and the property is worth $12,000 without the addition of steam. That is their idea, and to reduce the power by taking these two million gallons a day, they have reduced the value one half or one third, as the case may be.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-3\">Defendant\u2019s point and answer were as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-4\">1. If the jury believe that the waters of Crum creek cannot be made available for power at the plaintiff\u2019s mill site without a reconstruction of the water power plant, and that a water power plant would be of no value to him, except in connection \u25a0 with a steam plant, they should consider the question of damages with reference to the plant after such reconstruction, and the best measure of damages is the cost of reproducing by steam the amount of loss of power caused by the condemnation of two millions of gallons of water every twenty-four hours. <em>Ansioer: </em>As I have already said, if the water power is only available for propelling machinery and only valuable in connection with steam power, then this point would seem to be correct, that is to say, if the only value this water has to the plaintiff is its combined use with steam power, and only three horse power has been taken, then the correct measure of damages might be the cost of supplying the three horse power by steam. You may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>therefore consider this element, and if you find the facts as-stated in this point, and find no other element of damage, and no other use to winch the water taken could be profitably applied, you may find the difference in value before and after to-be the cost of producing- the additional horse power to supply the power taken. Still you must confine yourselves to the value-before and after the taking and the difference is the damage. But if you find the water taken was in other respects valuable to the plaintiff, then the only safe rule would be the one I have given you, that is to say, the difference in value of the whole-property, before and after the taking, and as affected and unaffected by the taking of this two million gallons daily.

The defendants had seized under-the right of eminent domain two millions of gallons per day of' the water which was not returned again to the stream. The plaintiff used the stream to aid in propelling their machinery, and the withdrawal of two millions of gallons had the effect of\" reducing the value of the stream as a water power by about two and a half horse power. The question before the jury was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>extent to which, this action of the water company had reduced the actual value of the plaintiff\u2019s property. The evidence offered bore directly upon that question, and we think the witnesses were properly admitted. They showed upon the examination to which they were severally subjected a sufficient knowledge of the subject to which their attention was called to qualify them to speak upon it. The value of their testimony was for the jury to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\">The eighth assignment of error complains of the answer of the learned judge to the defendant\u2019s first point. It is contended that the answer was calculated to leave the jury under the impression that the plaintiff\u2019s damages were simply so much money as would replace with steam the two and a half horse power previously furnished by the water taken by the defendant company. We do not think the answer justifies the criticism thus made upon it. On the other hand, the learned judge instructed the jury to ascertain the difference in value of plaintiff\u2019s property, considering it first as it was before the appropriation of the water by the defendant and then considering it as it was affected by that appropriation. This is the true rule to apply. It fixes the loss of the party affected by the exercise of the right of eminent domain, and for that reason correctly measures the damages to which he is entitled. The ninth, tenth and eleventh assignments are directed to certain portions of the charge which it was alleged were harmful to the plaintiff. They contain statements, .explanations and remarks that were not necessary and that it might have been in better form to omit, but we are unable to see that they could have misled the jury or been injurious to the case of the plaintiff. These assignments are not sustained. We see no other subject raised by the assignments not already referred to that requires discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
