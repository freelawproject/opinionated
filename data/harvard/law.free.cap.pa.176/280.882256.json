He died in four months after the policy was taken out, and by plaintiff\u2019s own showing in the proofs of death, the remote cause of death was intemperance, and the immediate cause delirium tremens.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">The defendant\u2019s second point was : \u201c The insured having in his application in answer to question 23 \u2018 Plow long since you have consulted any physician ? For what disease ? Give name and residence ? \u2019 answered \u2018 About one year, for light influenza, Dr. Jas. W. Keiser, Beading, Pa.,\u2019 and the plaintiff having, in the proof of death by the affidavit of Dr. Jas. W. Keiser, shown that during the five years preceding applicant\u2019s death, he attended said applicant for \u2018 vomiting and nausea, the effects of overdrinking, the duration being from 12 to 36 hours,\u2019 and it being the uncontradicted evidence of said .James W. Keiser that he had attended the said applicant within four months prior to the application and prescribed for vomiting and nausea induced by drunkenness, there can be no recovery in this case and the verdict must be for the defendant,\u201d and the facts being substantially undisputed, the learned judge reserved the point, but subsequently entered judgment on the verdict. Without going into the other matters assigned for error, the facts admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>ted in this point show snch a breach of a material warranty as to require the court to pronounce upon it as matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">Judgment reversed, and judgment directed to be entered for the defendant on the points reserved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
