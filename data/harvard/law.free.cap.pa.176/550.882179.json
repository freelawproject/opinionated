Martha and her husband went into possession of the property about the 1st day of April, 1846. On July 4, 1846, Samuel Tate conveyed the same land in trust to James L.

Juris, sec. 972.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b571-7\">In 1846 and down to the 11th day of April, 1848, a conveyance of land to a married woman, whether in fee tail or fee simple, was in effect a conveyance to the husband, for his life, and then to the wife if she survived him. The husband became entitled to the possession and to the rents and profits, and these might be \u201c swept away, through the improvidence, misfortune, or even vice of the husband, and she left to destitution: \u201d Bear\u2019s Adm. v.

There can be no delivery without an acceptance. Both delivery and acceptance, are matters of fact. The court could not say in this case, as a matter of law, that there was a good delivery, when the whole context of the recitals in the trust deed shows that there was no acceptance: Van Amringe v. Morton, 4 Wharton, 381; Dayton v. Newman, 19 Pa. 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-4\">A recital in a deed under which the party offering the recital does not claim is not evidence for him: Jack v. Woods, 29 Pa. 375; Dean v. Connelly, 6 Pa. 239; James v. Letzler, 8 W. &amp; S. 192. The assertion of an alleged fact in a deed dated in July, 1846, could not affect parties whose interest and whose right to object could not be determined for more than forty years afterwards; especially would this be true where the parties to be bound are minors : Osborne v.

The act does not provide for any other than record notice. Proof of acknowledgment is absolutely necessary, and the recital in this case does not furnish it: 1 Purd. Dig. 583; Penna. Salt Co. v.

Sutton, 1 Gr. 120; Rhoads\u2019 Est., 3 R. 420. A recorded deed in Pennsylvania will be construed as a feoffment with livery of seizin: Eckman v. Eckman, 68 Pa. 460. If a former owner neglects to record his title, every presumption is to be made in favor of a subsequent purchaser: Boggs v. Varner, 6 W. &amp; S. 469.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b572-8\">The possession of Martha L. Tate avails nothing for defendants in this case. It is in fact against them. The title of a person in possession is always presumed to be under his title on record and not under some other title which is. not recorded: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>Woods v.

It becomes null and void by virtue of the recording acts alone, independent of any question that could be raised respecting conveyances by married women: Poth v. Anstatt, 4 W. &amp; S. 307; Ebner v.

Where, therefore, there is nothing to qualify the act, the law will presume the acceptance of the deed, and delivery becomes complete.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AvW-\">Mr. Justice Mitchell,</author>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">The learned judge below directed the verdict for the defendants, and there is no claim that there was any material question of fact in dispute which required submission to the jury. Both sides having agreed that the issue was one of law for the court, the only question before us is whether the court decided it rightly.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">Of this we entertain no doubt. The plaintiffs\u2019 own case showed that they had no title. They claimed under a deed from Samuel Tate, made in July, 1846, and this deed showed of itself that the grantor had at that time no estate in the land to convey. It recites that whereas the grantor being seized, etc., and being desirous to convey, etc., \u201cdid on the 27th day of February last past seal and deliver to the said Martha L. Tate a deed therefor in fee,\u201d and whereas the said parties had been advised, etc., \u201cwherefore the said deed of conveyance has been by the consent of the said parties withdrawn, annulled and cancelled,\u201d and thereupon it proceeds to convey the same land to a trustee upon a separate use trust for the said Martha L. Tate, with contingent remainders over to her husband and children, etc., under which it must be conceded that the plaintiffs would have a good title if their ancestor was then seized of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>the land. Bnt as already said his own recital shows that he had previously parted with all his estate. He had sealed and delivered a deed in fee to his daughter-in-law Martha, and the estate had therefore vested in her. An estate once vested cannot be divested by the mere annulment and cancellation of the deed. That as was well said by the learned judge below was but the destruction of the evidence of the title, not the annulment of the title itself. No title can be divested by a mere recital in a deed, or by any form of deed to which the holder of the title is not a party. A fortiori is this the case where the title sought to be divested is in a married woman and can only be conveyed in accordance with the prescribed statutory forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The appellant argues that the deed was not accepted, and that the recital shows that the delivery must have been for examination, and the subsequent grant indicates that there was no acceptance. But the words used by the grantor are \u201c did seal and deliver,\u201d and delivery implies acceptance. There may be delivery in escrow, and there may be transfer of manual possession for examination or other purposes, but without acceptance there is merely a tender. Delivery implies both tender and acceptance, and there is nothing in this case to support any other than the ordinary construction of the word.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">The appellant further argues that the deed of February, 1846, not having been recorded cannot prevail against the later deed which was duly put on record. But the grantee in the later deed was not a bona fide purchaser without notice. It is doubtful if in equity he could be treated as anything more than a volunteer, but in any case he took with notice in his deed itself, that his' grantor, as against the prior conveyance, had no estate to convey.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">It is further argued that Martha L. Tate\u2019s deed to Clement was only a conveyance of her title under the trust deed of July, 1846, and therefore Clement took no more than an estate for her fife. But this is a misreading of the deed. It is a conveyance to Clement, his heirs and assigns, of all the grantors\u2019 estate, right, title, etc., with special warranty, and the only reference to the deed of July, 1846, is in the description of the property as part of the land described in that deed. The granting portions of the deed to Clement passed all the estate of the grantors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>whatever it was, and whencesoever derived, and the grant cannot be diminished by a mere recital in the description.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">So far we have considered the case solely as it was presented by the plaintiffs. But when we turn to the defendant\u2019s side we find the uncontradicted testimony of Col. J. W. Tate, that Martha took possession of this land in April, 1846, after the conveyance to her and before the conveyance to Black as trustee. And she retained the possession except of the portion she sold until she died in 1893. In addition therefore to the presumptions from the recital in the deed of July, 1846, she is thus shown to have been a grantee in actual possession when that deed was made to Black, and her possession was notice to him of her title.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">There is no doubt that the result thus arrived at defeats the intentions of Samuel Tate if they are to be gathered strictly from the language of his deed. And it may be that it defeats also the intentions of Martha L. Tate as they may be inferred-from her failure to take any active steps to set aside the trust. But the latter is by no means clear. If we are to draw inferences as to her actual intentions it is hardly open to question that she regarded herself the tenant for life and her son the remainder-man as jointly owning the entire fee, and intending to convey it to Clement. They were probably not informed as to the subject of contingent remainders, and did not contemplate the contingency of her surviving her son. But the case cannot be decided on inference or conjecture as to actual intentions. The evidence shows that the legal title and possession were in Martha Tate; there is no evidence that would enable the court to say that the title ever passed out of her by her own act; and it could not be taken out of her by the act of any other person.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
