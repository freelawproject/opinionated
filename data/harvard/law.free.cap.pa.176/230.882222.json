[4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-14\">The defendant\u2019s sixth point and answer were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-15\">6. The water company, defendant, in addition to its right by statute to the appropriation of the water stipulated for, has the right as a riparian owner to the reasonable use of the waters of the creek and has a right to dam the water and discharge it at such times as is consistent with a reasonable exercise of its rights as a riparian owner. The discharge of the retained water at night is either a legal or illegal exercise of such right. If legal, then such use of the waters must not be considered by the jury in estimating damages. If illegal, the plaintiff has his remedy hereafter either to prevent it or' to obtain compensation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>in damages by snit, and this question must not enter into the calculation of damages in this case. <em>Answer: </em>We cannot affirm or negative this point without qualification. If we affirm it, it would have no bearing upon the issue, unless we go a step further and say whether it is legal or illegal to dam up the waters during the daytime and discharge them by night.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b252-4\">If the proper exercise of this defendant\u2019s franchise requires it to store the water during the day that it may pump a necessary quantity during the night, and if the necessary storing of the water is injurious to the plaintiff, then the jury may consider this an element of damage. The jury may undoubtedly consider the effect this storage in the daytime will have, and has had, upon the stream, as tending to harmonize the testimony. While the pumping of two million gallons of water might not visibly affect the stream, the storing during the day might have some effect. The point, with tins qualification, is affirmed.

The plaintiff is the owner of a cotton mill situated on Crum creek and employs both water and steam power to propel his machinery. These are used in about the same proportions as in the mill of Lee et al., which was about forty-five horse power from his water wheel, and three or four times as much power from his steam engine.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The water company by taking two millions of gallons of water from Crum creek daily, reduces its capacity to the extent of two and one half horse power; and this during the dry season, or much of it, reduces to that extent the effective power of the plaintiff\u2019s water wheel. This is a proceeding to ascertain the damages which the appropriation of this water inflicts upon the plaintiff. The proper measure of damages is the actual depreciation in the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property caused by the loss of water. This is ascertained by finding out its value before the water was taken, and its value after it was taken, and as affected by such taking. When a witness is called to express an opinion upon this subject, it is entirely proper in a preliminary or upon cross-examination to explore the extent of his knowledge and to test his judgment by requiring him to particularize, and state the elements of his calculation. His examination should show that he has some knowledge of the value of property in that neighborhood. The value of his opinions will be likely to depend in the minds of jurors, upon the extent and thoroughness of the knowledge he is shown to possess, and for tins reason such a line of examination is entirely proper. The several assignments of error relating to the admission of the testimony of witnesses called to testify as to the value of the plaintiff\u2019s property before and after the taking of the water by ' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the defendant are not sustained. The reasons urged in support of them go rather to the value or credibility of the testimony than to its admissibility. The testimony was, as it looks on this record, extravagant, and some of it seems quite incredible, but that was for the jury. No injury was alleged except that resulting from the loss of power, and that the loss of two and a half horse power from the efficiency of the water wheel during the dry weather of summer could have taken from $20,000 to $85,000 from the value of this property is a statement that neither the court nor jury could believe. But a witness cannot be excluded from the witness stand because his testimony is absurd or contradictory or false. If he is competent his evidence goes to the jury to be considered and weighed, with the other evidence in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Nor do we see anything in the answer of the learned judge to the defendants\u2019 sixth point that requires the reversal of this judgment. It seems to have been urged as one element of damage that the water company stored the water of the stream to some extent in the daytime and used it at night. The point asked an instruction that if this was found to be so, such user of the water was either a lawful exercise of its franchise by the defendant, or it was an unlawful use of the stream ; and that in neither case could it be considered in this proceeding. The answer was a practical affirmance of the point.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">The learned judge said if the proper exercise of the franchise of the defendant required the storing of the water during the day and its use during the night, and if such storing was injurious to the plaintiff\u2019s property, then they should consider the manner, as well as the fact, of the taking of the water in making up their estimate of the plaintiffs\u2019 injury. If the proper exercise of the franchise did not require this, then the subject was not to be considered in this proceeding. This was a correct instruction. The jury were not left to treat this element of damage, if they found it to exist, as a separate item to be estimated by itself, but were carefully instructed that the plaintiff should recover only for the actual difference in value of his property caused by the appropriation of the water. This question which was apparently lost sight of in Lee et al. against the same defendant, was on the trial of this case kept prominently before the jury. Their verdict may have done the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>injustice, but if so tbe remedy was in the court below. On the whole case we see no sufficient reason for disturbing the judgment. The assignments of error are overruled and the judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
