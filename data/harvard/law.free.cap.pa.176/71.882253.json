He was called upon by the banker to draw up such an instrument of revocation. He went to the recorder\u2019s office, and found the deed of trust there on record; he examined it, and he \u201c drew up the revocation,\u201d as he was directed to do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-5\">After the banker had seen his attorney and directed him to prepare the deed of revocation, and without seeing the deed of trust, he went to see Mr. Fraley and \u201c explained to him what he (Fraley) had done. He was very much surprised and said that wasn\u2019t Iris intention, that he didn\u2019t want anybody to have Ms money.\u201d \u201cHe called on Mr. Fraley to see what he had to say about it. He was very much surprised that that was what he had done, disposing of his property, as his property was being disposed of pretty freely by the folks around the house.\u201d \u201c His tools and material he had in his shop had all been carried off and he didn\u2019t want anybody to have anything further to do with' his affairs but himself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">The banker \u201c explained to him that he could revoke that deed of trust made to Mr. Ryan, and he said he wished to do it.\u201d The banker then left Mm and again called on his counsel, and took him up, and he explained it to Mr. Fraley, and the deed of revocation was, as we have stated, executed, and placed on record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-7\">The banker\u2019s counsel had prepared, or there prepared, the following notice, which was signed by Mr. Fraley:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-8\">\u201c To I.

Ascertaining that there was an account at the banker\u2019s, but not knowing whether Mr. Fraley had credit or not, and not being able to ascertain, brought suit against the banker and obtained a judgment of over $3,000 in his favor, which the banker paid to him as trustee, the money having been deposited by Mr. Fraley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-12\">After the death of Mr. Fraley, a will which he had executed on October 23, A. D. 1886, came to the possession of his son-in-law George Stockett, the executor therein named, who proceeded to have it probated and letters testamentary issued to him by the register of wills of the county of Lancaster.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-13\">He then, as executor, demanded of Mr. Ryan, the trustee, the money, deeds, title papers, notes and all the property belonging to the estate of Joseph Fraley. Mr. Ryan, the trustee, declined to deliver them to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-14\">After which, on September 15, 1894, complainants entered and filed their bill of complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-15\">From the bill, answer, papers presented and testimony taken, we find the following facts :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-16\">1. That Joseph Fraley executed the deed of trust dated July 10, 1890, and marked \u201c exhibit A \u201d in defendant\u2019s answer, voluntarily, without any coercion, intelligently and with a full knowledge of its contents and of the legal effect and operation of the same, and that it was to be irrevocable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-17\">2. That Joseph Fraley was a man of intemperate habits, and prior to the execution of the said deed of trust was by reason thereof wasting and mismanaging his estate and permitting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>same to be wasted by others, and that he executed this deed of trust for the purpose of protecting himself and his estate from the consequences of his improvident and intemperate habits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">3. We find no evidence of any fraud, neglect, undue influence or intimidation being used to secure the making or execution of the deed of trust by Joseph Fraley to I. H. Ryan.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">4. We find that the creation of a trust, such as is contained in this deed of trust, was rendered necessary by the intemperance of the settler, Joseph Fraley, and that it was executed by him for the purpose of preserving his estate for his own benefit during life, and of disposing of it among his family, in accordance with his wishes, after-his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">5. We find that the execution of this deed was not connected with any suspicious circumstances, was wholly uninfluenced, actually, presumptively or otherwise, by any relations existing between the maker and the trustee, and that the only parties to be benefited by it were the settler and his children, being the same parties named as the beneficiaries of his will, and conveying to them substantially the same interest as they would have taken and received under his last will and testament.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-8\">6. We find that the deed of trust was executed by Joseph Fraley in the presence of a member of the bar and also of an alderman, both of whom explained to him the contents of said deed and its full force and effect, and to whom and in whose presence he declared that he was fully satisfied therewith, that lie understood the force and effect thereof, and desired that its provision^ s.hould be carried out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-9\">7. We find that Joseph Fraley was induced to execute the deed, or power of revocation, dated July 10, 1890, not by any of his family or relatives, but by the representation of Charles H. Locher (who had not then seen the deed of trust) ; that he, Joseph Fraley, by the deed of trust, had disposed of his estate and had put it out of his hands, when at that time Locher had not examined the deed of trust, nor was he acquainted with its contents, had no knowledge thereof, except that he had been told that Mr. Ryan had been appointed as trustee and had called at his bank to inquire about Mr. Fraley\u2019s bank account; and that after the execution of the said deed of revocation thus obtained, neither Joseph Fraley nor I. H. Ryan, the trustee, paid any attention to or took any notice of its contents, or in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>manner recognized, its existence, but proceeded with tire business required by the trust, under and by virtue of the deed of trust, until the death of said Joseph Fraley.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-4\">We find the law to be that where, as in the present case, Joseph Fraley being an aged man, a widower, residing alone, his family having left him, having complete ownership and dominion over his own property, had the undoubted right to assign, transfer and convey the whole of it, real, personal and mixed, or any part thereof, unto I. H. Ryan, the defendant, as trustee, without reservation, and without any consideration whatever, upon such uses and trusts as to him might seem proper for the benefit of himself and his children, provided it be not prejudicial to the rights of his creditors : Merriman v. Munson, 134 Pa. 114.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b96-5\">That the title of the trustee, I. H. Ryan, under the deed of trust is complete and was irrevocable by Joseph Fraley, the settler, although the transaction was purely voluntary, and the fact that the grantee reserved an interest during life in the proceeds of the property, and gave a future benefit to other persons lie named, gives no implied right to revocation. It contravenes no rule or policy of law, but executes the intention of the grantor. That when the creation of such a trust as the present has been rendered necessary by the folly and extravagance of the settler, and he has voluntarily and intelligently executed such a deed, equity will not set it aside, though it convey practically his whole estate, without reserving any power of revocation, or of support for himself beyond his incidental rights as a member of his wife\u2019s family. It appearing from the deed of trust in this case that it vested in Mary Brillhart a right to $10.00 per year, during the lifetime of said Joseph Fraley, such interest operated to make this deed of trust irrevocable. And where a deed conveys, as this one does, a present interest for life to the grantee, the fact that it contain provisions to take effect by way of contingent remainder upon the death of the grantor, during the life of the grantee, does not convert it into a will or make it testamentary. Such limitation cannot be revoked by the grantor, or by operation of law for life, even upon his subsequent marriage: Fellows\u2019 App., 98 Pa. <em>470; </em>Merriman v. Munson, 134 Pa. 114; Ritter\u2019s App., 59 Pa. 9; Brown v.
