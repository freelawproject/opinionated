After the decedent\u2019s death execution was issued on a junior judgment against the son, and the property worth about $1,000 was levied on. P., another of the decedent\u2019s sons paid the executor $200, and with this sum the executor bought in the property, taking title to himself as executor. Shortly after this, P. entered into possession of the land. Ten years after decedent\u2019s death and seven years after the executor received a deed for the property, the executor sold it at public sale for $50.00 to S., who conveyed it to plaintiff. In an action of ejectment against P., <em>held, </em>(1) that there could be no resulting trust in favor of P. for more than a one fifth interest in the land, and whether he acquired any claim upon or interest in it, except as heir or creditor, depended upon the intention with which the money was furnished; (2) that it was for the jury to determine with what intention the land was bought, and the purchase money furnished; (3) that it was competent for either party to show the assets and liabilities of the estate of the decedent at the time of the sale, and subsequent conversations between the executor and P. in reference to the transaction consummated by the sale; (4j that these matters were proper for the consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>of the jury in determining whether it was the intention of the parties that tlie executor should receive and hold the title to the land as trustee for the heirs, or for the benefit of the estate; (5) that the delay and manner of making the sale by the executor being inconsistent with the existence of any valid claim against the estate and it not appearing that any heir or creditor demanded the sale, and as the heirs, who were the only ones apparently interested in it, were not consulted, it is for the court and jury to consider and determine whether in any aspect of the case the sale by the executor to S. divested the interest of the heirs or of the estate.</syllabus>\n<otherdate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b20-4\">Argued Feb. 28, 1896.</otherdate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ah\">Appeal, No. 198, Jan.

D. 1868, Williams Barber conveyed to Ira T. Barber, his son, in fee, inter alia the piece of land in dispute in this case for the sum of $1,437, and took, as security for part of the purchase money, three several judgment notes, amounting in all to $l,0'58.58j,upon which judgments were severally entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-8\">On the 15th day of May, 1875, the said Williams Barber died testate, having appointed Coleman Wells his sole executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-9\">By the terms of the said will the whole estale of the decedent was bequeathed to his widow, Mary M. Barber, during her natural life, and after her death to be divided among his children, share and share alike.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-10\">The estate of said Williams Barber consisted exclusively of personal properly, the largest portion of which were the judgments against Ira T. Barber aforesaid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b20-11\">The said Williams Barber left to survive Mm a widow, Mary M.

At this time the judgments held by Coleman Wells, executor of the estate of Williams Barber, against Ira T. Barber, amounting to $1,654.77, were first liens against Ira T. Barber\u2019s real estate. Coleman Wells, the executor in order to protect the judgments which he held, was obliged to become the purchaser of the real estate, paying therefor the sum of $201.56, being the amount of costs on the Finn judgment, but, not having any money in his hands belonging to the estate, with which to make the payment, he borrowed the sum of $201.56 from Pardon T. Barber, one of the heirs, and gave him a receipt or certificate to that effect, a copy of which is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-5\">Luzerne County, ss: Sidney Finn vs. Ira T.

Pardon T. Barber, sometime after the sale, took possession of the land, the use of which belonged to the widow, who had a life interest in the whole estate, and remained in possession until the death of the widow.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-13\">On the 7th day of April, 1885, without any order of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>orphans\u2019 court, Coleman Wells, the executor, exposed the land at public sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">The heirs were then at swords\u2019 points with one another. The boys claimed that the property belonged to Pardon, to whom several of them had sold their interest. The girls claimed it belonged to the estate. On the day of the sale Pardon T. Barber appeared and claimed to be the owner of the land, because he had paid all the purchase money. It was also claimed by Charles H. Soper, attorney for the boys, that the property could not be sold because no order of the orphans\u2019 court had been obtained. He further objected because the boys did not want the money to go into the hands of Coleman Wells. In addition to the oral notices above mentioned, Mr. Soper read a written notice, under which he claimed the property belonged to Pardon T. Barber and the other heirs of Williams Barber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">The girls and George F. Barber, who was not present at' the sale, were not opposed to the sale, but, on the contrary, two of the girls Mary L. Gumaer and Esther J. Wallace desired that the land be sold by the executor and the surplus, after the payment of costs and debts, be divided among the heirs. Consequently, at the time of the sale, three of the heirs made no claim of title, one other became a bidder at the sale, and a son of one of the consenting heirs became a purchaser of one piece of land, and S. J. Strauss, an attorney at Wilkes-Barre, Pa., purchased the other piece.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-8\">By reason of this want of harmony among the heirs, and the \u25a0 threatened cloud on the title that would result, the properties were struck down for less than their real value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-9\">B. A. Zimmerman, the plaintiff in this case, purchased the interest of Mr. Strauss in the piece of land in dispute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-10\">When William Gumaer was on the stand, plaintiff offered to prove by him that in conversation with Pardon Barber and Coleman Wells, executor of the estate of Williams Barber, Pardon Barber demanded that the $200 he had advanced for the purchase of the property at Wilkes-Barre be paid to him by Coleman Wells; Wells stated that he would pay the money as soon as he could turn the property into cash. This offer was objected to as immaterial and irrelevant, and the objection was overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-11\">By Mr. Watson, for plaintiff: Q. Did you meet Pardon Bar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>ber and Coleman Wells at any time after the sheriff\u2019s sale at Wilkes-Barre together? A. I met them there at Coleman\u2019s house. Q. At what time was that ? A. It was after the sale, quite a bit; couldn\u2019t tell exactly just ]jow. Q. What sale ? A. The sale at Wilkes-Barre. Q. Did you have any conversation with them, or hear them in conversation ? A. Did I have any conversation with them? Q. Yes? A. Not any particular. The conversation that they had was concerning the money that he owed to Pardon. Q. Who owed? A. Coleman Wells. He borrowed money at Wilkes-Barre to hold this property. Q. Who said that ? A. Coleman Wells. Q. What did Barber say? A. Barber said he ought to have a deed for it. Q. For the property? A. For the property. Q. What did Wells say? A. Wells said, \u201c I can\u2019t give you a deed because I want to save it for the heirs, and the old lady had to have her interest out of it.\u201d Q. Then what did Wells say, or Barber? A. Barber said he either ought to have his money or the land, and Coleman says, \u201c I will pay the money back after the old lady gets done with it.\u201d Q. What else was said? A. He said that when he sold the property, after the old lady\u2019s death, when he sold the property he would furnish that money back. Q. You have stated this was at Wells\u2019s house? A. This was at Wells\u2019s, near Wells\u2019s house. It wasn\u2019t in the house. Q. Do you remember the time ? A. It was after the sale, I don\u2019t remember the time to a day. Q. About how long, could you give us an idea ? A. Oh, it might have been two weeks, or it might have been a month. It was a short time after the sale. Q. At Wilkes-Barre? A. At Wilkes-Barre.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-5\">On motion of defendant the court struck out this testimony, and sealed a bill for the plaintiff. [1]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b23-6\">When Mary Gumaer was on the stand, plaintiff offered to prove by her that she is a sister of Pardon T. Barber, and that she was aware that the property was advertised at sheriff\u2019s sale at Wilkes-Barre; that she was the owner or assignee of one of the purchase money judgments; that she never had any conversation with Pardon T. Barber in which she authorized him to appear for her or in anywise to protect her interests, or to purchase the property for her as trustee; that she has never received any interest from the property since the purchase by Pardon T. Barber, and that he has claimed to her that he owns <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>it in his own right. This for the purpose of contradicting Pardon T. Barber in his testimony wherein he says he appeared for his sisters and acted for them in furnishing the purchase money to Coleman Wells for the purpose of buying the estate for the heirs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">The offer was objected to as irrelevant and immaterial; the objections sustained, and exception noted for plaintiff, at whose request a bill is sealed. [2]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-7\">Plaintiff offered to prove by this witness that she is one of the heirs of Williams Barber, and never did agree or elect to take the property purchased by Coleman Wells, as executor, at Wilkes-Barre, for the estate as real estate, but, as one of the heirs, desired it should be sold and the proceeds divided among the heirs and the debts of the estate paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-8\">Objected to as immaterial and irrelevant; objection sustained, and exception noted for plaintiff, at whose request a bill is sealed. [3]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-9\">Plaintiff offered to prove by this witness that she is an heir of Williams Barber, and that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale in Wilkes-Barre there were many debts against the estate, a considerable amount owing to her and to other persons; this for the purpose of showing that Coleman Wells, as executor, was bound to bid upon the property and buy it for the purpose of protecting the creditors of the estate, and that he could not, as executor, enter into any secret trust that rvould defeat the honest creditors of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-10\">Objected to as immaterial and irrelevant; objections sustained and exception noted for plaintiff, at whose request a bill is sealed. [4]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-11\">Plaintiff offered to prove by Levi Gumaer that he is a son-in-law of Williams Barber, and that at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale of this property the estate was indebted to him in a large amount of money advanced to the decedent during his lifetime, and for the payment of debts subsequent to his death; that Coleman Wells knew of the existence of these debts at the time of the sale, and, therefore, was bound to protect the estate so that it might be sufficient to discharge all liabilities against it; that the estate at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale was worth about $1,500, and would have been sufficient to have paid all the debts of the estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>Objected to as immaterial and irrelevant; objections sustained, and exception noted for plaintiff, at whose request a bill is sealed. [5]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-5\">Defendant\u2019s point was as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-6\">1. That the payment of the purchase money, by Pardon T. Barber, the defendant, at the sheriff\u2019s sale of the land in dispute, in 1877, by operation of law raised a resulting trust in favor of Pardon T. Barber individually, or in favor of the persons in whose interest and for whose benefit he paid the money; and, though the title was taken in the name of Coleman Wells, executor, the land so purchased became the property of Pardon Barber, and the persons for whose benefit he paid the purchase money; and the verdict of the jury must be for the defendant. <em>Answer: </em>I affirm that proposition. That is, substantially, as I have already told you; because Pardon Barber paid this purchase money, the property belonged to him and those whom he acted for, and not to Coleman Wells, as executor of the estate of Williams Barber.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">Plaintiff\u2019s points were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-8\">4. That, as a matter of law, Coleman Wells, as \u2019executor of Williams Barber, bought the property, the piece of land in dispute, together with another piece, at the sheriff\u2019s sale in Wilkes-Barre in 1877, in order to protect the estate for which he held judgments against said real estate, and as' such took the title as trustee for the estate of Williams Barber, and had the right to sell the same, at public or private sale, pay the indebtedness of the estate and distribute the balance according to the terms of the will, and that the purchaser at said sale would take a good title to said land. <em>Ansiver: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition, gentlemen of the jury. I do not believe it is the law. [7]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-9\">5. That Coleman Wells, as executor of Williams Barber, could not enter into any trust agreement with any person, either an heir or beneficiary in the will, or stranger, by which said estate would pass to the said cestui que trust to the prejudice of a beneficiary under the will, or to the creditors of the estate of the decedent. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition. If Mr. Coleman Wells could protect the interests of the parties interested in any other way, that was simply a matter of judgment. It was not absolutely necessary for him to protect the interests of the estate just in one way, by attending the sheriff's <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>sale. If he could protect the interests of these parties in the w\u00e1y lie did, he, no doubt, had the right to do so. But he was obliged, under his duty as executor of the estate, to use due diligence in protecting the interests of the parties; and, as I have already said to you before, if he failed to do that, then they had the right to surcharge him to the extent of the law, by reason of his negligence. [8]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-5\">6. That, as a matter of law, the money which Pardon Barber furnished to Coleman Wells, executor of Williams Barber, at the time of the sheriff\u2019s sale at Wilkes-Barre, was a loan to him, to enable him, the said Coleman Wells, as executor, to purchase the real estate which was being sold, and against which he held judgments belonging to his testator\u2019s estate, in order to protect the estate, and was not furnished as purchase money, and hence Coleman Wells took'the property as trustee for the estate, and did not take the property as trustee by virtue of Pardon Barber furnishing the purchase money, either for himself or anybody else. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition, gentlemen of the jury, because the certificate, or receipt, which Mr. Wells himself signed, states expressly, upon its face, that tiffs money was furnished to him by Pardon Barber solely, and it was not his property, that is, it was not Mr. Wells\u2019s property, or the property of the estate of Williams Barber. We must give these papers a fair and reasonable construction. [9]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-6\">8. That, as a matter of law, the purchase money of the property at the sheriff\u2019s sale, sold under the Finn judgment, was not only the \u00a1$200 paid to the sheriff, but the judgments held by the executor for the estate, and which were discharged by said sale and rendered valueless. <em>Answer: </em>I decline to affirm that proposition. [10]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-7\">The court charged in part as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-8\">[As I understand the evidence, it has been admitted, and, as counsel freely admit, the evidence leaves no questions of fact in dispute for the jury to pass upon. There is no conflict in the evidence, that has been admitted, as to what the facts in the case are.] [11] . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b26-9\">[It appearing, therefore, from the undisputed evidence in the case, gentlemen of the jury, that by vffitue of the payment of this purchase money by Mr. Barber, at the time of the sheriffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>sale, a trust resulted in Ms favor and those whom he represented, the executor had no title in himself; he simply represented Pardon T. Barber, and those whom Barber represented, and he had no right to sell against their will;] [12] and parties who had notice of what the Barber claim was, or reasonable cause of notice, took no title under that sale, whatever. [And, for that reason, gentlemen of the jury, the facts not being in dispute, the question in the case being simply one of law, the law casts upon me the burden of deciding that question. It is, no doubt, an important question, but I am satisfied, in my own mind, I can reach no further conclusion. Counsel have failed to show me any law to the contrary; and, under the evidence, therefore, it is my duty to say to you that your verdict must be in favor of the defendant.] [13]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\">Yerdict and judgment for defendant.

It was contended by the plaintiff that Wells held the land in trust for the estate, and by the defendant that he held it in trust for the heirs. It was also contended by the plaintiff that if he held it for the estate it was to be regarded as personalty, and he could sell it as such without the aid of the orphans\u2019 court. The learned trial judge conceded that if he held the land for the estate his sale of it in 1885 to Strauss, who conveyed it to the plaintiff, entitled the latter to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">The conveyance of the land to Wells as executor was prima facie evidence that he held it for the estate, and his sale of it to Strauss was an indication that he supposed he so held it. It was conceded that the money paid for the land was furnished to Wells as stated in Ms written acknowledgment or receipt to which we have already referred. The learned trial judge thought this fact, considered by itself, raised a resulting trust in favor of the defendant, and as the plaintiff admitted that he purchased with notice of the defendant\u2019s claim he was not entitled to recover. The jury were therefore instructed to find for the defendant. This instruction was obviously based on the familiar principle that, where in a purchase of land the consideration is paid by one and the conveyance is made to another, the presumption is that the latter holds the title in trust for the former. But tMs presumption is not conclusive. It may be rebutted by evidence which satisfactorily shows that it was not the intention of either party that the beneficial interest should be in the party paying: 10 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, p. 13, and cases cited; Lynch v. Cox, 23 Pa. 265, and Hays v. Quay, 68 Pa. 263. In other words the presumption may be overcome by proof that it is at variance with the mutual intention or understanding of the parties, and any circumstance which throws light on the transaction or explains its true character is admissible for the purpose of strengthening or rebutting it: Strimpfler v. Roberts, 18 Pa. 283.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">In our case the money that was paid to the sheriff by the executor was furnished to him by a son of Wms. Barber, deceased, whose estate held three judgments against the land, amounting at the time of the sale to over $1,600. The judgments were first liens. The land once belonged to Williams Barber, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>sold, it iii April, 1868, to his son Ira T. Barber for $1,437. The judgments were entered oh Ira T. Barber\u2019s notes and represented the unpaid purchase money. The land was worth at least a thousand dollars at the time of the sale, and it was the only property out of which the estate could realize anything on the judgments. Under these circumstances we would naturally expect an executor who was faithful to his trust to do what he reasonably could to prevent the loss to the estate which would result from the sale of the land to another for one fifth of its value, and that the parties interested in the estate would cooperate with him. Presumably with this object in view the executor and Pardon Barber attended the sale and agreed with the execution creditor that the land should be sold to the executor for a sum sufficient to pay the costs incurred in selling it. The executor had no money and Pardon Barber furnished him the amount necessary to carry out the agreement. The effect of this arrangement upon the interests of the estate was precisely the same as if the land had been sold to the executor for a thousand dollars and he had paid four fifths of this stun by a credit upon the judgments and the other fifth of it with the money furnished to him by Pardon Barber. Under such circumstances there could be no resulting trust in favor of the latter for more than a one fifth interest in the land, and whether he acquired any claim upon or interest in it except as heir or creditor depended upon the intention with which the money was furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">It seems to us that this is a case in which something more was required to sustain the defendant\u2019s contention than the furnishing of the money as stated in the receipt given by Wells. It is evident that he so regarded it because he supplemented the receipt with testimony tending to show that the money was furnished under an agreement that Wells was to hold the land in trust for the heirs. If anything was made clear by this testimony it was that Pardon Barber desired to have the deed of the land, that Coleman Wells as executor desired to have the deed of it, and that each distrusted the other. It also appeared from the testimony that while there was mutual distrust there was mutual profession of anxiety to protect the interests of the heirs. While Nicholson, who represented Wells and Barber in effecting the arrangement with the execution creditor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>under which the land was sold, testified that he understood it was their intention that \u201c Coleman Wells should hold the legal title for the heirs or family of Williams Barber,\u201d he also testified \u201c that there was some talk as to what disposition Coleman Wells\u2019s executor should make of it in case we were successful at the sheriff\u2019s sale in his being the purchaser, and I told them that would be settled in the orphans\u2019 court. That was assented to.\u201d In his cross-examination he said, \u201c When I told them it would probably go through the orphans\u2019 court, I meant it would have to be sold to pay debts. I don\u2019t remember whether anything was said about the debts of the estate at that time. It occurs to me there was.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-5\">We think that in view of the evidence in the case, oral and documentary, it was for the jury to find under proper instructions from the court with what intention the land was bought, and the money required in the purchase of it was furnished. We think too, that it was competent for either party to show the assets and liabilities of the estate of Williams Barber at the time of the sale, and subsequent conversations between Wells and Pardon Barber in reference to the transaction consummated by it. These were matters proper for the consideration of the jury in determining whether it was the intention of the parties that Wells should receive and hold the title to the land as trustee for the heirs, or for the benefit of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-6\">There is another matter to which attention should be directed in tins case. Wells sold the land for 150.00 seven years after he received the deed for it, and ten years after the death of Williams Barber. It does not appear that any heir or creditor demanded that he should sell it. His delay in and manner of making the sale were not consistent with the existence of any valid claim against the estate. If he held the land for the estate there was apparently no one interested in it except the heirs, and they were not consulted. The undisputed evidence shows that the sale of the land was conducted by the attorney of the estate, who bid it off for Strauss on the latter\u2019s instruction to do so \u201cas cheaply as possible.\u201d Under these and other circumstances surrounding and connected with the sale, it is for the court and jury to consider and determine on a retrial whether, in any aspect of the case, the sale made by Wells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to Strauss divested tbe interest of tbe heirs, or the estate, in the land in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\">To the extent that the rulings complained of are in conflict with this opinion the specifications of error are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"AZ\">Judgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
