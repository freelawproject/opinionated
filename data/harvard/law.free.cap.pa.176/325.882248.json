The date of his birth, as ascertained by the public records of the town, was November 10, 1831. In some way, during the progress of the journey westward, which was performed in wagons, the child disappeared, and his history thenceforth was a blank although his parents survived until 1868. In this instance, even the slight clue which was furnished by the daguerreotype was wanting \u2014 the child of two or three years being hardly discernible in the man of thirty-five. The claimants rested their case upon what they term record evidence\u2014 the town register and, the United States certificate. It was unfortunate for them that these papers were mutually destructive of the theory of identity, because the person described in the certificate must have been at least eight years, older than the person named in the register. The claim is dismissed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-11\">The other facts sufficiently appear in Bryant\u2019s Est., ante, p. 309.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b343-12\"><em>Hrrors </em>assigned, among others, were dismissing claim of the appellants and awarding balance of the distribution to the English claimants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b343-13\"><em>J.
