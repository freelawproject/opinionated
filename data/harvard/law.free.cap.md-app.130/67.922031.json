It is undisputed that the Maryland Yacht Club is a private club, \u201csurrounded by an electronic security fence, and conspicuously posted with \u2018Trespassers will be Prosecuted\u2019 signs.\u201d In addition, \u201cthe gate to the club can only be opened by a magnetic card.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">Appellants filed a complaint in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, asserting that on September 20, 1997, appellee <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hubert Austin Sheppard (1) drove to the yacht club, (2) waited until a club member opened the gate, (3) then drove onto the grounds before the gate closed, (4) \u201cparked his vehicle in a separate parking lot reserved for guests, overlooking the member parking lot and pier areas,\u201d and (5) videotaped the appellants without their consent. Copies of the videotapes were sent to the other appellees. According to appellants, \u201cthe tape was also published and circulated to parties unknown in the court system, and to various individuals at the [appellees\u2019] various offices.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Appellants alleged that appellees had (1) intruded upon their seclusion; (2) placed them in a false light; and (3) publicized private facts about them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellees filed motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>to dismiss each count of the complaint. After a hearing, those motions were granted and this appeal followed, in which appellants contend that the complaint contained enough facts to survive a motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">I. Invasion of Privacy Claims</p>\n<p id=\"Afi\">A. Intrusion Upon Seclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">According to appellants, because (1) the yacht club was not a public place, and (2) the investigator trespassed onto an area in which the appellants had a reasonable expectation of privacy, an actionable intrusion occurred. We disagree. Maryland has adopted the following definition of intrusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">The intentional intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion of another or his private affairs or concerns that would be highly offensive to a reasonable person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-9\"><em>Pemberton v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>66 Md.App. 133, 163, 502 A.2d 1101 (1986), <em>citing </em>Restatement of Torts 2d, \u00a7 652B. To determine whether the surveillance constituted an actionable intrusion under Maryland law, we ask whether there has been an</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">intrusion into a private place or the invasion of a private seclusion that the plaintiff has thrown about his person or affairs. There is no liability for observing him in public places since he is not then in seclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-11\"><em>Id. </em>If surveillance is \u201cconducted in a reasonable and non-obtrusive manner, it is not actionable.\u201d <em>Id., citing McLain v. Boise Cascade Corporation, </em>271 Or. 549, 533 P.2d 343 (1975); <em>Forster v. Manchester, </em>410 Pa. 192, 189 A.2d 147 (1963); <em>Ellenberg v. Pinkerton\u2019s, Inc., </em>130 Ga.App. 254, 202 S.E.2d 701 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>The fact that Mr. Sheppard made the observations while trespassing at appellants\u2019 private club does not establish a violation of any reasonable expectation of privacy. Not every trespass constitutes an unreasonable search or intrusion. A trespass \u201cbecomes relevant only when it invades a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>McMillian v. State, </em>85 Md.App. 367, 394, 584 A.2d 88 (1991), vacated on other grounds, 325 Md. 272, 600 A.2d 430 (1992). The <em>McMillian </em>Court noted that \u201can individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy reaches its zenith in the home.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">business and commercial enterprises generally are not as private as a residence ... although a club operated for a select clientele may not be public, the fact that the premises are maintained as a club with a membership policy is not conclusive in favor of the club. Failure to enforce limitations on admittance would warrant the conclusion that the persons operating the club had no reasonable expectations of privacy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">In <em>Dye v. State, </em>650 P.2d 418 (Alaska App.1982), a fish biologist trespassed onto a ship to observe Dye\u2019s commission of alleged- illegal acts. The Alaskan appellate court accepted the appellant\u2019s arguments that (1) this trespass <em>did </em>constitute a search, and (2) appellant had a subjective expectation of privacy in the boat. The court held, however, that the appellant\u2019s subjective expectation of privacy was not one that society was prepared to accept as objectively reasonable because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-8\">the only evidence observed ... was in the process of being moved onto the deck where it would have been in plain view.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 421-422. <em>Dye </em>was cited with approval in <em>Burnett v. Municipality of Anchorage, </em>678 P.2d 1364 (Alaska App.1984), which in turn was cited with approval in <em>Pemberton v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>66 Md.App. 133, 502 A.2d 1101.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>Appellant\u2019s involvement in a personal injury lawsuit further lessened his expectation of privacy.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> A personal injury claimant should reasonably</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-4\">expect reasonable inquiry and investigation to be made of her claim and to this extent her interest in privacy is circumscribed ... there is much social utility to be gained from these investigations. It is in the best interests of society that valid claims be ascertained and fabricated claims be exposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\"><em>Forster v. Manchester, </em>410 Pa. 192, 197, 189 A.2d 147 (1963). The appellant in <em>Manchester </em>was the plaintiff in a personal injury suit, whose actions on a boat were in the public view. The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az8\">appellant\u2019s activities could be observed by passers by. To this extent appellant has exposed herself to public observation and therefore is not entitled to the same degree of privacy that she would enjoy within the confines of her own home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-6\"><em>Id. </em>The surveillance conducted by Mr. Sheppard involved nothing more than observations of appellants while they were on or near a yacht situated in a public waterway and in open view of the public. As the circuit court noted, appellants</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ais-dedup-0\">were performing acts which were in public view to other members of the club and to people boating in the water. Working on a boat may be important to a tort suit, when the ability of Plaintiff to do heavy work is at issue, but it is scarcely such as would be an intrusion on Plaintiffs right to seclusion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">In <em>McLain v. Boise Cascade Corporation, </em>271 Or. 549, 533 P.2d 343 (1975), the appellant sued his employer for invasion of privacy and trespass because, after appellant had asserted a worker\u2019s compensation claim, the employer hired an investigator who trespassed onto plaintiffs property and</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>conducted surveillance without plaintiffs knowledge. The surveillance produced film and photos that were used against appellant at the worker\u2019s compensation hearing. After noting that appellant\u2019s involvement in the worker\u2019s compensation suit lessened his expectation of privacy \u201cto the extent of a reasonable investigation,\u201d the Supreme Court of Oregon rejected the argument that trespass constituted an invasion of privacy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ak-dedup-0\">[1] the surveillance and picture taking were done in such an unobtrusive manner that plaintiff was not aware that he was being watched and filmed ... [2] plaintiff conceded that his activities which were filmed could have been observed by his neighbors or passers by on the road running in front of his property. [3] undoubtedly the investigators trespassed on plaintiffs land while watching and taking pictures of him, but ... [the trespass] did not constitute an unreasonable surveillance \u201chighly offensive to a reasonable man ...\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJB\">We think that trespass is only one factor to be considered in determining whether the surveillance was unreasonable. Trespass to peer in windows and to annoy or harass the occupant may be unreasonable. Trespass alone cannot automatically change an otherwise reasonable surveillance into an unreasonable one. The one trespass which was observed by plaintiff did not alert him to the fact that he was being watched or that his activities were being filmed. The record is clear that the trespass was confined to a narrow strip along the east boundary of plaintiffs property. All the surveillance in this case was done during daylight hours and when plaintiff was exposed to public view by his neighbors and passers by.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b100-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 346-347. In this case, because appellants were seen doing things that could be observed by non-trespassing members of the general public, the circuit court correctly dismissed their intrusion claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">B. False Light</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Appellants also claim that the circuit court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the false light claim. False light invasion of privacy has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>One who gives publicity to a matter concerning another that places the other before the public in a false light is subject to liability to the other for invasion of privacy, if (a) the false light in which the other person was placed would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) the actor had knowledge of or acted in reckless disregard as to the falsity of the publicized matter and the false light in which the other would be placed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-4\"><em>Bagwell v. Peninsula Regional Medical Center, </em>106 Md.App. 470, 513-514, 665 A.2d 297 (1995), citing Restatement (2d) Torts \u00a7 652E. This tort requires publicity, meaning that \u201cthe disclosure of the private facts must be a public disclosure, and not a private one.\u201d <em>Hollander v. Lubow, </em>277 Md. 47, 57, 351 A.2d 421 (1976). Complete defenses exist where (1) the statement is true, or (2) the plaintiff consented to the publication. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">The circuit court correctly granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss because the information was true. The video showed (1) Mr. Furman conducting activities that he did indeed perform; and (2) appellants spending a day on their yacht. Because these activities were admittedly true, publication of them is not actionable under a false light theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">C. Publicizing Private Facts About Appellants</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">Appellants further allege that the circuit court erred in granting the motion to dismiss the claim that appellees publicized private facts about appellants. The tort of publicity given to private life has been defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"All\">One who gives publicity to a matter concerning the private life of another is subject to liability to the other for unreasonable invasion of his privacy, if the matter publicized is of a kind which (a) would be highly offensive to a reasonable person, and (b) is not of legitimate concern to the public.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AcE\"><em>Klipa v. Board of Educ. Of Anne Arundel County, </em>54 Md.App. 644, 654-655, 460 A.2d 601 (1983), citing Restatement (2d) Torts \u00a7 652D. In order to succeed on a claim of this nature, the \u201cmatter disclosed must be a private fact and it must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>made public.\u201d <em>Pemberton v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>66 Md. App. at 166, 502 A.2d 1101. The publication element required is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\">It is not an invasion of the right of privacy ... to communicate a fact concerning the plaintiffs private life to a single person or even to a small group of persons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><em>Id. </em>The public matter, however, must be one that is \u201coffensive and objectionable to a reasonable man of ordinary sensibilities.\u201d <em>Klipa, </em>54 Md.App. at 655, 460 A.2d 601. There is an obvious reason for this requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-6\">The law is not for the protection of the hypersensitive, and all of us must, to some reasonable extent, lead lives exposed to the public gaze.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\"><em>Id. </em>In examining a claim of this nature, courts have held that \u201creasonableness under the facts presented is the determining factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 460 A.2d 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">The circuit court correctly granted the motion to dismiss this claim. The surveillance films and photos would have been admissible at trial had Mr. Furman\u2019s personal injury claim not been settled. Thus, the information recovered was not private in nature. While appellants did belong to a \u201cprivate\u201d yacht club, their'yacht was in navigable water in open view to the public. There is simply \u201cno liability when the defendant merely gives further publicity to information about the plaintiff that is already public.\u201d <em>Pemberton, </em>66 Md.App. at 167, 502 A.2d 1101, citing Restatement 2d \u00a7 652D, comment b. Thus, the circuit court correctly granted appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">II. Punitive Damage &amp; Respondeat Superior Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Appellants also complain about the dismissal of their punitive damage and respondeat superior claims. For the reasons stated above, these issues are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-11\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b95-13\">. Trespassing on \u201cposted\u201d property is a misdemeanor. <em>See </em>Md.Code Ann., Art. 27, \u00a7 577 (1999 Supp.). Trespassing may also give rise to a civil action in which, when no particular amount of damages has been proven, nominal damages are to be awarded. <em>Timanus </em>v. <em>Leonard, </em>121 Md. 583, 589, 89 A. 99 (1913).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b96-9\">. The appellees are Mr. Sheppard (the investigator), The Premier Group (the investigator\u2019s employer), James X. Crogan and Timothy E.
