Darvish had made false and defamatory statements about appellee Shariar Gohari. The evidence was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict, but appellant contends that he is entitled to a new trial at which he can (1) assert a \u201cqualified privilege\u201d defense, and (2) introduce evidence that his statements about appellee were true.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For the reasons that follow, we agree with those contentions and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Appellant is the owner and chief executive officer of Darcars automotive franchise group. In January 1987, he hired appel-lee as a comptroller trainee at the Darcars Toyota dealership. In 1988, appellee became vice president of Darcars Toyota, and in 1992 was named senior vice president of Darcars automotive group. In August of 1996, appellee quit his job with Darcars.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">In November of 1996, appellee entered into an agreement with James Kline for the purchase of Kline\u2019s Toyota franchise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>Appellee needed Toyota\u2019s approval in order to own/operate that franchise, and he submitted a franchise application to Central Atlantic Toyota Distributors, Inc. (\u201cCATD\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On December 2, appellee met with Dennis Clements and Roy Arminger of CATD. Appellee authorized CATD to \u201cinquire, through outside sources, about [his] character, general reputation and credit history\u201d and to \u201cobtain and share information from and with any of its affiliated entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The jurors were entitled to accept the following testimony. On December 10, 1996, Clements met with appellant and inquired about appellee\u2019s qualifications to own the Toyota franchise. Following that meeting, Clements drafted a memorandum stating that appellant had told him, among other things, that (1) appellee \u201cdid not have the experience or background to be considered qualified to operate a dealership;\u201d (2) \u201cMr. Gohari had suddenly left the DARCARS organization several months ago in an unprofessional manner and with no notice;\u201d and (3) \u201cthere was a questionable financial manipulation by Mr. Gohari to inflate his compensation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">When Clements told Arminger about that December 10 meeting, Arminger prepared a memorandum summarizing Clement\u2019s recollections of appellant\u2019s comments about appel-lee. On December 12, 1996, Arminger called appellant and read to him several \u201cbullets\u201d from the Arminger memorandum. The bullets summarized the statements that appellant had purportedly made to Clements, including appellant\u2019s opinion that appellee was \u201cdishonest\u201d and had \u201cmanipulated financial statements.\u201d Appellant made no response when Arming-er read through the series of bullets and Arminger considered appellant\u2019s silence to be a confirmation that appellant had made the statements at issue.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Arminger requested that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>appellant provide a letter confirming the statements appellant made to Clements, and told appellant that Gohari\u2019s approval \u201cwould be dependent upon what was contained in the letter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On December 13, 1996, appellant sent a confirmation letter to CATD. The letter provided in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-6\">Mr. Gohari was employed at DARCARS ... through August 12,1996, as in house controller ... He had responsibility for overseeing day-to day accounting issues and coordinating all accounting issues with ... DARCARS\u2019 outside accounting firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-7\">Mr. Gohari\u2019s responsibilities did not include, however, involvement in or supervision over other dealership departments, including New and Used Car Sales, Service and Parts, Leasing, Body Shop, Customer Relations, or Finance and Insurance Programs ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">Unfortunately, Mr. Gohari left his employment in a most unprofessional manner ... As a result, there are many unanswered questions concerning the proper allocation of expenses in the dealership and pay plan applications.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">After reviewing information that it had gathered with respect to appellee\u2019s application, CATD informed appellee that he would have to nominate a qualified general manager in order to be approved as a dealer. Appellee submitted several names but was unable to procure CATD approval before his contract with Kline expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Appellee filed an amended complaint alleging that appellant had defamed him and tortiously interfered with his contract to purchase the Toyota dealership.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Prior to and during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>trial, the circuit court made three rulings that are now the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">First, appellee moved in limine to preclude appellant from asserting a qualified privilege defense. According to appellee, because CATD was not appellee\u2019s prospective employer, neither the Maryland Code nor common law afforded appellant a privilege. Appellant argued that the qualified privilege defense was applicable because the communications arose out of the employer-employee relationship. The circuit court ultimately ruled that appellant was not entitled to assert a qualified privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Second, appellant moved to exclude Arminger\u2019s memorandum on the ground that it was inadmissable hearsay. Appel-lee opposed that motion and argued that the memorandum should have been admitted as a business record pursuant to Maryland Rule 5-803(b)(d). Appellee also argued that the bullets contained within the memorandum were admissible under Maryland Rule 5-803(a)(2). The circuit court excluded \u201cthe portion referring to Mr. Clements\u2019 alleged comments, on the ground that [they were] hearsay,\u201d but ultimately allowed Arminger to testify about the bullets he had read to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">Finally, appellee moved to preclude appellant from attempting to prove that the statements attributed to appellant were actually true. Appellee argued that appellant could not prove the truth of those statements because appellant had consistently denied making any defamatory statements. Appellant countered that appellee was required to persuade the jury that the statements were false and that appellant was therefore entitled to introduce evidence that would support a different conclusion. At the motions argument, appellant directed the circuit court to a complaint DARCARS had filed against appellee, alleging that appellee had defrauded the dealership and abused his power by extending interest free loans.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">After a six day trial the jury found that appellant made false and defamatory statements and deliberately interfered with appellee\u2019s contract. The jury awarded appellee $500,000 in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>damages for defamation, and $2,120,000 damages for tortious interference with contract, but declined to award punitive damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The circuit court determined that the following statements were at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-7\">THE COURT: Bullet 1. \u201c[Appellee] never had operational authority over the dealership even at the time of [appellant\u2019s] illness.\u201d Are you claiming that to be defamatory?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azq\">[APPELLEE\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-8\">THE COURT: Okay. \u201cHe manipulated financial statement figures to inflate his personal compensation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7o\">[APPELLEE\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">THE COURT: \u201cHe was dishonest.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-10\">[APPELLEE\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-11\">THE COURT: All right. \u201cPeople did not like him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4S\">[APPELLEE\u2019S TRIAL COUNSEL]: Yes, I think that is because I think that does really go to the heart of being the operator of a dealership. I think it is borderline, ... it is not something that I am going to spend a lot of time on ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Appellant contends that whatever statements he made were protected by a qualified privilege, and that appellee was never defamed because each statement attributed to appellant was true.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">A party is entitled to have his or her theory of the case presented to the jury, provided that the theory is legally and factually supported. Therefore, provided there is evi-dentiary support for an instruction requested by a party, the court must instruct the jury on the law, either by giving particular instructions offered by the parties, by crafting its own instructions, or by combining elements of both.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhQ\"><em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric v. Flippo, </em>112 Md.App. 75, 92, 684 A.2d 456 (1996), aff'd. 348 Md. 680, 705 A.2d 1144 (1998)(inter-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>nal citations omitted). We are persuaded that appellant was entitled to assert the qualified privilege defense, and to present evidence that the statements attributed to him were true.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Under Maryland law, to establish a prima facie case for defamation,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-7\">a plaintiff must ordinarily establish that the defendant made a defamatory statement to a third person; that the defamatory statement was false; that the defendant was legally at fault for making the statement; and that the plaintiff thereby suffered harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-8\"><em>Rosenberg v. Helinski, </em>328 Md. 664, 675, 616 A.2d 866 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>509 U.S. 924, 113 S.Ct. 3041, 125 L.Ed.2d 727 (1993). Even where those elements are satisfied, a defendant will not be liable if \u201cacting \u2018in furtherance of some interest of social importance, which is entitled to protection ... \u2019 \u201d <em>Woodruff v. Trepel, </em>125 Md.App. 381, 391, 725 A.2d 612 <em>(1999)(quoting, </em>W. Page Keeton et al., <em>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts </em>\u00a7 114, at 815 (5th ed.1984)). Conditional or qualified privileges</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-9\">rest upon the notion that a defendant may escape liability for an otherwise actionable defamatory statement, if publication of the utterance advances social policies of greater importance than the vindication of a plaintiffs reputational interest ... [T]he common law recognized that a person ought to be shielded against civil liability for defamation where, in good faith, he publishes a statement in the furtherance of his own legitimate interest, or those shared in common with the recipient or third parties ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-10\"><em>Marchesi v. Franchino, </em>283 Md. 131, 135, 387 A.2d 1129 (1978)(internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">Communications arising \u201cout of the employer-employee relationship clearly enjoy a qualified privilege.\u201d <em>McDermott v. Hughley, </em>317 Md. 12, 28, 561 A.2d 1038 (1989). That privilege is set forth in Maryland Code (1998 RephVol.), Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 5-423, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b299-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>(\u0430) <em>Liability of employer. </em>\u2014 An employer acting in good faith may not be held liable for disclosing any information about the job performance or the reason for termination of employment of an employee or former employee of the employer: (1) To a prospective employer of the employee or former employee at the request of the prospective employer, the employee, or the former employee ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">Because CATD is a prospective franchisor and not a prospective employer, appellant\u2019s statements do not fall within the letter of this statutory protection. This statute, however, did not abrogate the common law, and appellant asserts that the circuit court should have found that his statements were protected by the common law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">According to the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 595(1), a qualified privilege may be claimed where the defendant believes \u201cthere is information that affects a sufficiently important interest of the recipient,\u201d and where the publication may be made \u201cwithin the generally accepted standards of decent conduct.\u201d It is obvious that appellee\u2019s ability to operate in a franchise was of importance to CATD. One factor to be considered in determining whether the publication falls within the standards of decent conduct is whether the publication was made \u201cin response to a request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 595(2). In this case, appellee expressly authorized CATD to seek information about his \u201ccharacter, general reputation and credit history\u201d and to \u201cobtain and share information from and with any of its affiliated entities.\u201d Pursuant to that grant of authority, CATD approached appellant and solicited information about appellee. Because appellant\u2019s offending publication was made \u201cin response to an [authorized] inquiry and not volunteered,\u201d we are persuaded that he enjoyed \u201cgreater latitude about what he may say about [appellee] without incurring liability.\u201d <em>Happy 40, Inc. v. Miller, </em>63 Md.App. 24, 35, 491 A.2d 1210 <em>cert. denied, </em>304 Md. 299, 498 A.2d 1185 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Moreover, a qualified privilege may arise where the speaker and the recipient have a \u201ccommon interest in the subject matter,\u201d including \u201cinterests in property, business and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>professional dealings.\u201d <em>Hanrahan v. Kelly, </em>269 Md. 21, 28, 305 A.2d 151 (1973). The Court of Appeals has \u201crecognized that qualified privilege arising by reason of common interest in the subject matter can inhere in business dealings between the publisher and the recipient.\u201d <em>Id. </em>n. 2 (citing <em>Deckelman v. Lake, </em>149 Md. 533, 131 A. 762 (1926)). When a franchisor asks one of its franchisees about a former employee,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b300-5\">\u201cthe circumstances are such as to lead ... persons having a common interest in a particular subject matter correctly or reasonably to believe that facts exist which another sharing such common interest is entitled to know.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement of Torts \u00a7 596 (1938)).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Based on 1) appellee\u2019s express consent authorizing CATD to solicit information from appellant and 2) the business relationship between CATD-franchisor, and appellant-franchisee, we hold the circuit court erred in concluding that appellant was not entitled to a qualified privilege. <em>See Jacron Sales Co. v. Sindorf, </em>276 Md. 580, 600, 350 A.2d 688 (1976)(The question of whether a defamatory statement is entitled to a qualified privilege is a question of law for the circuit court).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">We do not overlook appellant\u2019s potential competitive interest in \u201cdestroying [appellee\u2019s] chances of acquiring a Toyota dealership.\u201d That interest, however, is not grounds for prohibiting a qualified privilege, and appellee</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6DX\">\u201chas the right notwithstanding the privileged character of the communication to go to the jury, if there be evidence tending to show actual malice, as where the words unreasonably impute crime, or the occasion of their utterance is such as to indicate, by its unnecessary publicity or otherwise, a purpose wrongfully to defame the plaintiff____ Or, malice may be established by showing that the publication contained matter not relevant to the occasion.... Expressions in excess of what the occasion warrants do not <em>per se </em>take away the privilege, but such evidence may be excess of malice.... \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b300-10\"><em>Hanrahan, </em>269 Md. at 29, 305 A.2d 151 (quoting <em>Fresh v.

State, </em>349 Md. 811, 816, 709 A.2d 1305 (1998)(inter-nal citations omitted). Rule 5-803(a)(2) permits the admission of a statement made to or about a party who \u201chas manifested an adoption or belief in its truth.\u201d A tacit or adoptive admission</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>occurs when one remains silent in the face of an accusation that, if untrue, would naturally rouse the accused to speak in his or her defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-5\"><em>Henry v. State, 324 </em>Md. 204, 241, 596 A.2d 1024 (1991).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-6\">As a threshold question for the trial court, the admissibility of such silence should depend on an evaluation of the required prerequisites for the use of the tacit admission that have been established over the years by this Court, i.e., did the defendant hear and understand the other party\u2019s statement, did the defendant have the opportunity to respond; and under the circumstances would a reasonable person in the defendant\u2019s position, who disagreed with the statement, have voiced that disagreement. These same factors would then be evaluated by the jury and the tacit admission given the weight that the jury believes it to be worth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b302-7\"><em>Key-El, </em>349 Md. at 818-19, 709 A.2d 1305. The circuit court concluded that the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that appellant had heard the statements at issue.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Appellant asserts that the circuit court committed error, however, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-8\">a \u2018reasonable person\u2019 in Darvish\u2019s position \u2014 even if he <em>had </em>heard and understood the statements \u2014 would <em>not </em>have felt compelled to Voice [] his disagreement\u2019 with Arminger\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>paraphrasing of the statements that Arminger reported Clements had purportedly attributed to [appellant].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">We disagree and concur with the circuit court\u2019s opinion</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-6\">that a reasonable person under the circumstances, having heard what was said to him, even in rapid fire circumstances, understood the importance of the call with regard to the Toyota actions, understood why he was being called by Mr. Arminger, and understood that there were some concerns that Toyota had about the application of Mr. Gohari, and ... [that] a reasonable person ... in this gentleman\u2019s position that day listening to the things of that importance about the application on the telephone, if you heard someone say that you said he was dishonest or you said he manipulated funds, that that would have caught his attention or her attention and they would have denied it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">The circuit court expressly stated that its decision to admit Arminger\u2019s testimony did not amount to a judicial determination that appellant had adopted the same:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b303-8\">Before we bring the jury in, I just want to clarify so it is clearly understood that what the Court ruled simply was that the testimony was admissible, not that it was conclusive, and of course you are free to rebut in any way you think, including your client testifying that he didn\u2019t hear it or whatever.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b303-9\">The jurors were entitled to conclude that a reasonable person would have denied making the statements and thereby assign the \u201cweight\u201d they believed appellant\u2019s silence \u201cto be worth.\u201d <em>Key-El, </em>349 Md. at 819, 709 A.2d 1305. The circuit court\u2019s decision allowing Arminger to testify about the statements at issue was not erroneous. Appellant was entitled to a jury instruction that his silence could not be used against him unless the jurors were persuaded that (1) he heard and understood what Arminger said to him, and (2) if the statements attributed to him by Clements were incorrect, he would have corrected the errors. Appellant was not, however, entitled to the exclusion of that testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Maryland Rule 2-303(c) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">A party may set forth two or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively or hypothetically ... A party may also state as many separate claims as the party has, regardless of consistency and whether based on legal or equitable grounds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Although appellant denied having published defamatory statements about appellee, he asserted in his answer that even if he had, \u201cany and all\u201d statements were \u201ctruthful, privileged and justified.\u201d During the hearing on Gohari\u2019s motion in limine, appellant\u2019s counsel argued as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-8\">The only two places in the record where dishonesty \u2014 the Court should consider the two together: dishonesty and manipulation of financial statements ... The only place they appear are in two memoranda: one of Clements and one of Arminger, [appellant] has denied making any statement that Gohari was dishonest or manipulated financial statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-9\">Arminger and Clements have denied that Darvish ever used the language \u201cdishonest\u201d or \u201cmanipulated financial statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-10\">However, if Mr. Gohari intends to prove the falsity of the statements [appellant] made, it is our position that [appellant] is entitled, because his state of mind is in issue, to rebut or undercut any claim of falsity by showing that indeed there were instances of Mr. Darvish\u2019s dishonesty and manipulation of false statements ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Appellant\u2019s denial that he made defamatory statements does not prevent him from asserting that those statements are substantially correct. Rule 2-303 expressly authorizes a party to plead alternative defenses. It follows that appellant should be able to put on evidence in support of each defense that he asserted. <em>See Alpar v. Weyerhaeuser Co., </em>20 N.C.App. 340, 201 S.E.2d 503, 506, <em>cert. denied, 285 </em>N.C. 85, 203 S.E.2d 57 (1974)(denying defendants right to pursue expressly permitted alternative defenses would place the court \u201cin the incongruous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>position of saying that you can plead inconsistent defenses but you cannot prove the same.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In light of our conclusion that appellant is entitled to a new trial on the qualified privilege issue, it is of no consequence whether appellant did or did not make a proffer necessary to preserve this issue for our review.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On remand, appellee will bear the burden of proving that appellant made the statements attributed to him, that those statements were false, and that appellant knew that those statements were false. <em>Jacron Sales Co. v.

Did the Circuit Court err in ruling that appellant\u2019s communications with CATD representatives regarding appellee\u2019s fitness to own and operate a Toyota dealership were not subject to a qualified privilege, when the communications arose from appellant's lengthy employment relationship with appellee, were solicited by the CATD representatives with appellee\u2019s consent, and were statements which CATD was justifiably entitled to receive?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-11\">II. Did the Circuit Court err in ruling that appellant had adopted by silence statements attributed to him by CATD representatives, when the court did not find that appellant heard and understood the statements and a reasonable person in appellant\u2019s circumstances would not have been expected to deny the statements?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b293-12\">III. Did the Circuit Court err in ruling that appellant could not introduce evidence to prove the truth of allegedly defamatory statements the publication of which he denied, when the rules of procedure specifically allow appellant to plead alternative and inconsistent defenses?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b294-7\">. The jurors heard testimony that CATD was responsible for examining \"the credentials of the individual to determine whether or not they\u2019re qualified to be a dealer and/or operator.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-8\">. Appellant testified that he did not hear Arminger attributing those statements to him, and thought that Arminger had only called to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>request a written confirmation of what appellant had said to Clements during lunch.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b295-13\">. Appellee\u2019s initial complaint was filed against appellant, Kline, Toyota, CATD, and Clements. The circuit court dismissed the claims against all of the defendants except appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b302-9\">. Appellant testified that he had interrupted a meeting in order return a call from Arminger. Appellant admitted that he heard, understood, and remembered various details from the telephone call, including the fact that Clements was going out of town. Appellant heard and complied with Arminger\u2019s request that he produce a written confirmation of comments he had made during the December 10 meeting with Clements. Appellant denies, however, that he heard Arminger read \"bullet-ed items\u201d summarizing the details of the December 10 meeting. The circuit court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b302-10\">\"Had that been the only testimony I heard on the matter, I might have a different view, I don\u2019t know, but I have to take into consideration as well the testimony of Mr. Arminger at his deposition where he said without equivocation that he believed as a result of what he said to the defendant on the telephone that day that the defendant confirmed what was said to him.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b305-12\">. When the circuit court granted appellee\u2019s motion in limine, it advised appellant\u2019s counsel that if \"there comes a time at the rebuttal stage you can make an appropriate motion.\u201d Appellant made no motion to revisit this issue at the close of appellee\u2019s evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
