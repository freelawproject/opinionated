(\u201cPeterson\u201d) to build a waterfront entertainment and retail complex, to be known as National Harbor, along the Potomac River in the Smoot Bay area of Prince George\u2019s County. The County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, sitting as the District Council (\u201cthe District Council\u201d) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> approved a conceptual site plan for the project, and the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County affirmed in part and reversed in part the District Council\u2019s decision. The court ruled that, with one exception, the District Council properly determined that the conceptual site plan conformed to the applicable zoning ordinances. In the court\u2019s view, the record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>did not reflect that Peterson had conducted adequate study into potential noise problems and noise abatement plans. The court therefore remanded the case to the District Council for the sole purpose of requiring Peterson to present \u201ca proper noise study.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Appellants/cross-appellees Karen Egloff (\u201cEgloff\u2019), Bonnie Bick, Jon W. Robinson, the Sierra Club, Inc., and the Anacos-tia Watershed Society, Inc. now contend that the trial court erred in affirming any part of the District Council\u2019s decision. They argue, in essence, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-6\">\u2014 The conceptual site plan did not conform to the applicable zoning ordinances in a number of ways, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-7\">\u2014 In approving the conceptual site plan, the District Council failed to set forth sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">Peterson and the District Council, the appellees/cross-appellants, have incorporated in their separate briefs motions to dismiss the appeal on the grounds that (i) Karen Egloff did not have standing to petition for circuit court review and, (ii) the remaining appellants/cross-appellees (\u201cthe Bick group\u201d) did not properly petition for circuit court review.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Peterson and the District Council have further filed a cross-appeal, in which they argue, in essence, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-9\">\u2014 The trial court erred in reversing that portion of the District Council\u2019s decision regarding the adequacy of Peterson\u2019s noise study, and by remanding the case to the District Council for the presentation of additional evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-10\">We find merit in both arguments made by the appel-lees/cross-appellants in their motion to dismiss. We thus agree that the trial court should not have reviewed the case, in that Egloff did not have standing to petition for judicial review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>and the Bick group did not properly petition for judicial review. Although the appellees/cross-appellants present their arguments within a motion to dismiss incorporated in their appellate briefs, it is apparent that they are seeking not merely dismissal of the appeal of the appellants/cross-appellees but also vacation of the trial court\u2019s judgment \u2014 including its reversal and remand of that portion of the District Council\u2019s decision regarding the noise study. We shall therefore elevate substance over form and shall vacate the judgment of the trial court.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In light of our decision to vacate, we need not address the cross-appeal as to that judgment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Peterson\u2019s attempt to develop property in the Smoot Bay area into a waterfront complex follows three unsuccessful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>attempts by other developers. In the mid-1960s, an effort was launched to build the \u201cSmoot Bay Waterfront Center.\u201d After that project failed, another effort was made in 1983 to transform the property into \u201cBay of Americas.\u201d In 1986, that plan was replaced by a plan to develop \u201cPort of America.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">In the mid-1990s, Peterson initiated its plan to develop National Harbor on 533.9 acres of land in Smoot Bay. Peterson sought and obtained from the District Council several zoning changes that would permit the contemplated use. Peterson then submitted a conceptual site plan \u2014 a \u201cvery general concept for developing a parcel of land before subdivision plans or final engineering designs are begun\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 to the Prince George\u2019s County Planning Board of the Maryland National Capital Park and Planning Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On April 23, 1998, the Planning Board conducted a public hearing at which more than 30 persons testified. That same day, the Planning Board issued a lengthy written decision by which it approved Peterson\u2019s conceptual site plan, subject to 35 specific conditions. The final condition was that the plan be reviewed and approved by the District Council.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On June 17, 1998, after reviewing the record of the proceedings before the Planning Board, the District Council affirmed the Planning Board\u2019s decision to approve the conceptual site plan, subject to the conditions imposed by the Planning Board as well as four additional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Karen Egloff and John O\u2019Loughlin, jointly and <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for judicial review on July 17, 1998. Both Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin had appeared before the Planning Board and the District Council in opposition to Peterson\u2019s plans to develop National Harbor. At the start of her testimony before the Planning Board, Egloff had stated that her family had a home near the proposed development, and asserted: \u201cWe have lived there for 41 years.\u201d Egloff further informed the Planning Board that she was representing her family and \u201csome of the residents\u201d of the neighborhood. The chairperson of the Planning Board asked Egloff if she was an attorney and Egloff responded in the negative. The chairperson then informed Egloff: \u201c[Y]ou can represent your family if you live there and you want to represent you family ... but you can\u2019t represent other citizens.\u201d Egloff responded simply: \u201cAll right. Fine.\u201d She then presented her position to the Planning Board. O\u2019Loughlin told the Planning Board that he personally lived near the proposed development. He stated that he had \u201clived in Prince George\u2019s County for over 40 years\u201d and \u201cown[ed] a business in this County.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Although the address listed for O\u2019Loughlin on the petition for judicial review indicated that he did, indeed, live near the proposed development, a Calvert County address was given for Egloff. Both Peterson and the District Council filed responses to the petition indicating their intention to participate in the action<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>, and the District Council promptly sent notice of the petition to all parties to the proceeding before it.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Subsequently, on September 3, 1998, Peterson and the District Council jointly moved to dismiss Egloff from the case. They asserted that Egloff had represented to both the District Council and the trial court that her address was \u201c2950 Holland <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Cliffs Road, Huntingtown, Maryland 20639,\u201d and urged the court to take judicial notice of the fact that \u201cHuntingtown, Maryland is located entirely within the geographic boundaries of Calvert County, Maryland.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">On September 4, 1998, the day after the motion to dismiss Egloff from the case was filed, attorney Thomas Dernoga filed a line with the court entering his appearance on behalf of Egloff, O\u2019Loughlin, and the members of the Bick group, all of whom he identified as \u201cPetitioners.\u201d Dernoga also filed a document entitled \u201cResponse to Petition for Judicial Review,\u201d which reflected the intentions of the members of the Bick group to participate in the action but did not specify in what capacity they intended to participate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> On October 13, 1998, Dernoga filed a \u201cPetitioners\u2019 Memorandum of Law\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and a \u201cResponse to Joint Motion to Dismiss\u201d on behalf of \u201cKaren Egloff, et al.\u201d In the response to the motion to dismiss, \u201cKaren Egloff, et al.\u201d asserted that, \u201cWhile Karen Egloff does presently reside in Calvert County,\u201d she \u201cgrew up\u201d and \u201cspent 19 years residing in\u201d her family\u2019s home near the proposed development. The response asserted that Egloff \u201cspends substantial time\u201d at the family home, \u201cincluding occasional residence,\u201d in order to care for her aging mother, Susan Egloff.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It added that Susan Egloff had devised the family home to Karen Egloff, and that Karen Egloff \u201cintends to resume residence,\u201d apparently upon her mother\u2019s death. Also in the response, \u201cKaren Egloff, et al.\u201d asserted that \u201cbecause John 0\u2019L[o]uglin\u2019s standing has not been challenged, the ... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Motion to Dismiss will accomplish nothing more than trying to silence one more voice speaking out against the artificial and arbitrary zoning process under which the District Council approved The Peterson Companies, Ine.\u2019s entertainment/retail complex.\u201d interestingly, the response to the motion made no mention of the Bick group or the standing of its members.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Peterson and the District Council timely filed separate memoranda in support of the District Council\u2019s decision, and a hearing on the petition for judicial review was scheduled for November 12, 1998. Two days before the hearing, O\u2019Lough-lin, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed documents dismissing Dernoga as his counsel and dismissing with prejudice the petition for judicial review as to himself only.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">At the hearing on November 12, counsel for Peterson and the District Council contended that the entire case should be dismissed because O\u2019Loughlin was no longer a petitioner and, as urged in the earlier-filed written motion, Egloff did not have standing. No mention was made of the Bick group by either party. Dernoga represented to the court that both Egloff and her mother were present in the courtroom. He proffered that they would testify to the effect that Susan Egloff had, in her will, devised the family home to Karen Egloff. Based on the proffer, the court determined that Karen Egloff had a \u201cvalid vested remainder that is an equitable interest\u201d in the property. It therefore concluded that Egloff had standing, and the hearing proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In its opinion affirming in part and reversing in part the District Council\u2019s decision, the trial court noted that the members of the Bick group entered the case as petitioners after Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin filed their petition, and that O\u2019Loughlin discharged Dernoga prior to the hearing and did not appear to represent himself. In response to a post-trial motion filed by Peterson <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>the court amended its opinion to clarify that the members of the Bick group were respondents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>rather than petitioners, and that O\u2019Loughlin had dismissed his case with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">Egloff s Lack of Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">Section 8-106(e) of art. 28 of the Annotated Code of Maryland authorizes judicial review of decisions of the District Council of Prince George\u2019s County and sets forth the requirements for standing. The section provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-2\">In Prince George\u2019s County, any incorporated municipality located in Prince George\u2019s County, <em>any person or taxpayer in Prince George\u2019s County, </em>any civic or homeowners association representing property owners affected by a final district council decision, and, if aggrieved, the applicant may have judicial review of any final decision of the district council. Proceedings for review shall be instituted by filing a petition in the Circuit Court of Prince George\u2019s County within 30 days after service of the final decision of the district council....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">Code (1975, 1997 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 8-106(e) of art. 28 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Peterson and the District Council argued in the trial court, as they argue on appeal, that Egloff was not a \u201cperson or taxpayer in Prince George\u2019s County\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 8-106(e) and therefore did not have standing to petition for judicial review of the District Court\u2019s approval of Peterson\u2019s conceptual site plan. Peterson and the District Council also argued below and reiterate on appeal that Egloff was not \u201caggrieved\u201d by the District Council\u2019s decision. In denying the motion to dismiss, the trial court did not address the argument that Egloff was not a person or taxpayer in Prince George\u2019s County. Rather, the court focused on whether Egloff was aggrieved and determined that she was. As we have observed, the court concluded that because Egloff s family home, which was located near the proposed development, was devised to Egloff in her mother\u2019s will, Egloff had a \u201cvalid vested remainder interest\u201d in the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">There is simply no requirement under \u00a7 8-106(e) that a petitioner be aggrieved in order to have standing unless the petitioner is the applicant for approval of the conceptual site plan \u2014 in this case Peterson.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> By 1994 Laws of Maryland, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Chapter 405, the Legislature amended \u00a7 8-106(e) for the specific purpose of \u201cclarifying that the aggrievement standard required to appeal to the circuit court only applies to the applicant.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The key inquiry, therefore, was not whether Egloff was aggrieved but whether she was a person or taxpayer in Prince George\u2019s County.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">The parties agree that, pursuant to the plain language of \u00a7 8-106(e), in order to have had standing Egloff must have been either a person in Prince George\u2019s County or a taxpayer in Prince George\u2019s County. They further agree that Egloff was not a taxpayer in the County. The appellants/cross-appellees contend that Egloff was nevertheless a person in Prince George\u2019s County. In support of their position, the appellants/cross-appellees point to the assertions in the petitioner\u2019s response to the motion to dismiss Egloff from the case, to the effect that Egloff spent a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of time at the family home and occasionally resided there in order to take care of her mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">No evidence in the record supports the assertion that Egloff resided in the family home, occasionally or otherwise. At the hearing before the Planning Board, Egloff cryptically stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>... I am mostly representing my family. <em>They </em>have a home at 229 Panorama Drive. <em>We </em>have lived there for 41 years. I also represent some of the residents that I\u2019ve had a chance to speak with. They share some of my views and my family\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">(Emphasis added.) When the chairperson informed Egloff that she could represent her family only if she lived in the family home and could not represent other area residents at all, she responded only: \u201cAll right. Fine.\u201d Egloff did not state that she did, in fact, reside in the family home. Indeed, the assertions made in the response to the motion to dismiss and, later, in the brief of the appellants/cross-appellees filed in this Court make clear that Egloff left the Planning Board with a misimpression. While other members of her family may have lived in the home for 41 years, Egloff herself lived there for only 19 years, apparently during her youth. Her address at the time of the hearing was in Calvert County. At the hearing before the trial court, .the petitioners offered no evidence regarding Egloffs residence. Although counsel for the petitioners told the court that Egloff and her mother were in the courtroom and available to testify, that statement was made in the course of discussion of Susan Egloff s will. Counsel did not proffer that Egloff or her mother would testify that Egloff resided in the family home.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Even if the evidence did establish that Egloff occasionally resided in the family home \u2014 and we find that it does not \u2014 we would not conclude that Egloff was therefore a \u201cperson ... in Prince George\u2019s County\u201d within the contemplation of \u00a7 8-106(e). Section 8-106(e) confers a benefit on persons in Prince George\u2019s County \u2014 the right to petition for judicial review of a decision of the District Council in a zoning case. In arguing that Egloff occasionally resided at the family home, the appellants/cross-appellees implicitly posit that a person in Prince George\u2019s County is a resident of Prince George\u2019s County. The Court of Appeals has explained that, where a constitutional or statutory provision confers a benefit based on residency, a person\u2019s residence is deemed to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>place where he or she is domiciled, not merely where he or she is physically present. <em>See Bainum v. Kalen, </em>272 Md. 490, 496-99, 325 A.2d 392 (1974) (where State Constitutional provision required candidate to reside in Maryland for three years immediately prior to running for State Senate or House of Delegates, person who was raised in Montgomery County but was domiciled in Michigan for portion of required period was not qualified to run, even though he occasionally visited and resided with parents in Montgomery County during period).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAd\">A person may have several places of abode or dwelling but \u201c[h]e can have only one domicile at a time.\u201d ... A person\u2019s domicile has been defined as the place \u201cwith which he has a settled connection for legal purposes\u201d and the \u201cplace where a man has his true, fixed, permanent home, habitation and principal establishment, without any present intention[<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>] of removing therefrom, and to which place he has, whenever he is absent, the intention of returning.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b151-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 497, 325 A.2d 392 (citations omitted). \u201c \u2018It is a fundamental rule that, in order to effect a change of domicile, there must be an actual removal to another habitation, coupled with an intention of remaining there permanently or at least for an unlimited time.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 498, 325 A.2d 392 (citation omitted). <em>See also Best Drywall, Inc. v. Berry, </em>108 Md.App. 381, 392-93, 672 A.2d 116 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">In short, the argument that Egloff is a person in Prince George\u2019s County because she occasionally resides in Prince George\u2019s County must fail because it runs afoul of the established rule that a statute that confers a benefit based on residency confers that benefit only on those persons who maintain a principal, fixed, and permanent home in the designated place. To hold otherwise would open the door for any person who occasionally visits Prince George\u2019s County over<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>night to challenge a decision of the District Council. Challenges could be lodged by tourists from other states who stay in Prince George\u2019s County hotels or campgrounds, or by persons who spend holidays visiting friends or relatives in Prince George\u2019s County. It defies common sense to believe that the Legislature intended to create such a free-for-all when it enacted the standing requirements set forth in \u00a7 8-106(e). \u201c[A] statute must be construed to effectuate the real and actual intention of the legislature.\u201d <em>Blandon v. State, </em>304 Md. 316, 319, 498 A.2d 1195 (1985). \u201c[W]e approach the analysis of the language from a \u2018commonsensical,\u2019 rather than a technical perspective.... \u201d <em>Richmond v. State, </em>326 Md. 257, 262, 604 A.2d 483 (1992) (citation omitted). The \u201crules of statutory construction require us to avoid construing a statute in a way that would lead to absurd results.\u201d <em>Blandon, </em>304 Md. at 319, 498 A.2d 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">The appellants/cross-appellees point to nothing, other than Egloffs \u201coccasional residence\u201d in Prince George\u2019s County, to support their contention that Egloff had standing. We therefore conclude that Egloff did not have standing to petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">Members of Bick Group as Petitioners</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">Peterson and the District Council further contend that, while members of the Bick group may have had standing to petition for judicial review of the District Council\u2019s decision, they did not file a proper petition. The appellees/cross-appellants contend that since O\u2019Loughlin dismissed his case, Egloff did not have standing, and the Bick group did not file a proper petition, there was nothing before the trial court to review. The appellants/cross-appellees respond that, while the Bick group did not file a petition, its members properly secured their status as petitioners and joined in the petition filed by Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin when the group filed its response to that petition before O\u2019Loughlin dismissed his case. The appellants/cross-appellees seemingly ignore that the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>court granted Peterson\u2019s post trial motion to clarify that the members of the Bick group were respondents and not petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">Preliminarily, we observe that Peterson and the District Council did not move below to dismiss the Bick group from the case. Nothing in the record persuades us, however, that the appellees/cross-appellants were required to file such a motion to dismiss. The Bick group did not specify its status in its response to the petition for review filed by Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin. In the headings of the documents filed by Derno-ga on behalf of the petitioners after the Bick group entered the case, the petitioners were identified simply as \u201cKaren Egloff, et al.\u201d The response to the motion to dismiss asserted that O\u2019Loughlin had standing to petition for judicial review even if Egloff did not. It made no mention of the standing of the members of the Bick group. Dernoga identified Egloff, O\u2019Loughlin, and the members of the Bick group as \u201cPetitioners\u201d when he entered his appearance as counsel on their behalves, on the same day that he filed the Bick group\u2019s response to Egloffs and O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s petition. While Peterson and the District Council might have discerned from this that the members of the Bick group believed themselves to be aligned with Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin as petitioners, Peterson and the District Council were not required to conduct such detective work in order to ascertain the identities of the opposing parties. Nor were they required to proceed as if the members of the Bick group had properly entered the case as a petitioners if they had not actually done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">The question of whether the members of the Bick group properly entered the case as petitioners, with respect to the petition filed by Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin, when they filed a response to that petition is therefore properly before this Court. Such an entry would have been necessary in order for this Court to conclude that proper petitioners remained in the case even after O\u2019Loughlin dismissed his case and even though Egloff did not have standing. To resolve the question, we look first to the plain language of the applicable rules of procedure. As the Court of Appeals has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>To interpret rules of procedure and statutes we use the same canons and principles of construction, beginning our analysis by looking at the plain language \u2014 looking to the words of the rule and giving them their ordinary and natural meaning; if the words of the rule are clear and unambiguous, our analysis ordinarily ends.... When the language is ambiguous, we may look to the intent behind the statute or rule, but \u201cour mission is to give the rule a reasonable interpretation in tune with logic and common sense.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b154-4\"><em>Lerman v. Heeman, </em>347 Md. 439, 443, 701 A.2d 426 (1997) (interpreting Md. Rule 2-614) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">The rules governing judicial review of administrative decisions are set forth in Title 7, Chapter 200 of the Maryland Rules of Procedure. Significantly, Md. Rule 7-202(a) provides: \u201cA person seeking judicial review under this chapter <em>shall </em>file a petition for judicial review in a circuit court authorized to provide the review.\u201d (Emphasis added.) \u201c \u2018Under settled principles of statutory construction, the word \u201cshall\u201d is ordinarily presumed to have a mandatory meaning.\u2019 \u201d <em>In Re James S., </em>286 Md. 702, 708, 410 A.2d 586 (1980) (citation omitted). Under section (c) of the Rule, the petition need only \u201crequest judicial review, identify the order or action of which review is sought, and state whether the petitioner was a party to the agency proceeding,\u201d or, if the petitioner was not a party to the agency proceeding, \u201cstate the basis of the petitioner\u2019s standing. No other allegations are' necessary.\u201d Section (d)(3) provides that, once the petition has been filed, the agency must notify all other parties to the agency proceeding that the petition has been filed and that <em>\u201ca party wishing to oppose the petition must file a response </em>within 30 days after the date the agency\u2019s notice was mailed----\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">Rule 7-203 provides, in turn:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-7\">(a) <em>Generally. </em>Except as otherwise provided in this Rule or by statute, a petition for judicial review shall be filed within 30 days after the latest of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>(1) the date of the order or action of which review is sought;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-4\">(2) the date the administrative agency sent notice of the order or action to the petitioner, if notice was required by law to be sent to the petitioner; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-5\">(3) the date the petitioner received notice of the agency\u2019s order or action, if notice was required by law to be received by the petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b155-6\">(b) <em>Petition by other party. </em>If one party files a timely petition, any other person may file a petition within 10 days after the date the agency mailed notice of the filing of the first petition, or within the period set forth in section (a), whichever is later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">Responses to petitions for judicial review are addressed by Md. Rule 7-204. It is that rule on which the appellants/cross-appellees base their contention that the members of the Bick group had only to file a timely response in order to enter the case as petitioners. Section (a) of Rule 7-204 states: \u201cAny person, including the agency, who is entitled by law to be a party and who wishes to participate as a party shall file a response to the petition. The response shall state the intent to participate in the action for judicial review. No other allegations are necessary.\u201d Section (b) provides that the person may file with the response a preliminary motion addressed to \u201cany ... matter that would defeat a petitioner\u2019s right to judicial review.\u201d Section (c) states that the response \u201cshall be filed within 30 days after the date the agency mails notice of the filing of the petition\u201d and \u201cneed be served only on the petitioner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">Finally, Rule 7-207(a) directs that petitioners \u201cshall file a memorandum setting forth a concise statement of the questions presented for review, a statement of facts material to those questions, and argument on each question.... \u201d Any person who has filed a response may then file \u201can answering memorandum in similar form.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">The plain language of the rules, read together, makes clear that Chapter 200 of Title 7 contemplates that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>person who files a response is a person who opposes the petition for judicial review. Md. Rule 7-203 sets forth the time limitations for participating in a case as a petitioner. A person who seeks to challenge an administrative agency decision must file a petition either within 30 days after the triggering event or within 10 days after the date the agency mails notice that another person has filed a petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Within 30 days after the date the agency mails notice that a petition has been filed, any responses must be filed. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7 \u2014 204(c). Md. Rule 7-204(a), which addresses who may file a response, does not expressly provide that such a person must be one who opposes the petition. Such a provision would merely state the obvious, however, as by common parlance, a respondent is \u201cthe party against whom a motion or petition is filed.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 313 (7th ed.1999). Rules 7-202(d)(3)(B) and 7-207(a) make clear, moreover, that a person who files a response is a person who opposes the petition. Rule 7-202(d)(3)(b) states that the agency must notify all parties to the agency proceeding that \u201ca party <em>wishing to oppose the petition </em>must file a response within 30 days after the agency\u2019s notice was mailed____\u201d (Emphasis added.) Rule 7-207(a) provides that \u201cany person who has filed a response ... may file an <em>answering </em>memorandum\u201d after the petitioner has filed its memorandum. It is axiomatic that an answer is \u201ca defendant\u2019s first pleading that addresses the merits of the case, [usually] by denying the plaintiffs allegations. An answer [usually] sets forth the defendant\u2019s defenses and counterclaims.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">The appellants/cross-appellees suggest that because the members of the Bick group sought only to ride on the coat tails of Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin it would be nonsensical to require them to file a separate petition. The filing of a petition is no more burdensome than the filing of a response. As we have indicated, the petition need only request judicial review, apprise the court of the agency order for which review is sought, and set forth the basis of the petitioner\u2019s standing. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-202(e). It is not until the memorandum is filed that the petitioner is required to present questions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>review, summarize the facts, and set forth argument. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 7-207(a). Had the Bick group filed a proper petition and expressly indicated its intent to proceed jointly with Egloff and O\u2019Loughlin, it would not have been required to file a separate memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-4\">Even if we believed that the applicable rules were ambiguous \u2014 and we do not \u2014 the history of Title 7, Chapter 200 establishes beyond cavil that a petitioner must timely file a petition for review within the time constraints of Md. Rule 7-203, and that a person who may later file a response to the petition under Rule 7-204 is a person who opposes the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Chapter 200 of Title 7 replaced former Subtitle B of Chapter 1100 of the Maryland Rules effective July 1,1993. Rule 7-203 is based on former Rule B4, which permitted a trial court to alter or waive the requirement that a petition be filed within 30 days of the triggering event. A note by the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure accompanies Rule 7-203 and states: \u201cThe provisions of former Rule B4 concerning the shortening and extending of time are not carried forward. <em>The time for initiating an action is in the nature of a statute of limitations </em>.... \u201d Committee note to Md. Rule 7-203, Maryland Rules, Vol. 1 at 805 (emphasis added.) <em>See Kim v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>350 Md. 527, 535-36, 714 A.2d 176 (1998) (explaining that the 30-day requirement of Md. Rule 7-203(a) is not jurisdictional but, rather, is in the nature of a statute of limitations); <em>Colao v. County Council of Prince George\u2019s County, </em>346 Md. 342, 361-62, 697 A.2d 96 (1997) (discussing Md. Rule 7-203(a) as a statute of limitations). Any suggestion that a petitioner need not actually file a petition but need only make his intention to participate in the case known within 30 days after receiving notice that a petition has been filed by someone else flies in the face of the Court\u2019s intent that Rule 7-203 serve as a strict time limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">A note by the Reporter for the Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, which accom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>panied proposed Rule 7-204 when it was submitted by the Committee to the Court of Appeals for approval, explained that the term \u201cresponse\u201d as used in that rule is shorthand for \u201canswer\u201d or \u201cpreliminary motion.\u201d Reporter\u2019s note to proposed Md. Rule 7-204, 19 Md. Reg. 26 at 2278 (Dec. 23, 1992). As we have explained, an answer generally denies the plaintiffs allegations and sets forth defenses or counterclaims. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 90.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">The Standing Committee held numerous meetings regarding Title 7, Chapter 200 before the rules were adopted to replace Subtitle B. Minutes of the meetings similarly reflect that the Committee intended that a response would be filed by a person who opposes a petition. At one meeting, a committee member explained that a response is the equivalent of \u201ca notice of participation as an appellee.\u201d <em>See </em>Minutes of Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure for September 6 &amp; 7, 1991 at 70. At a later meeting, the Honorable Alan M. Wilner, then Chairman of the Committee, explained that even though proposed Rule 7-204(a) states that a response may be filed by any person who wishes to participate as a party, that does not mean that \u201canother <em>petitioner </em>can wait for 30 days.\u201d Minutes of Court of Appeals Standing Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure for March 13, 1992 at 11 (emphasis added). The Committee agreed that it was \u201ca party wishing to oppose the petition [who was entitled to] file a response within 30 days.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">As the trial court determined in granting Peterson\u2019s post trial motion for clarification, the members of the Bick group did not file a proper petition and did not enter the case as petitioners when they filed a response. O\u2019Loughlin dismissed his case prior to the hearing on his petition and, as we have explained, Egloff did not have standing to file a petition. Under the circumstances, there was no basis for the trial court to review the District Court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">JUDGMENT VACATED; APPELLANTS/CROSS-AP-PELLEES TO PAY THE COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\">.

Peterson included certain documents in the appendices to its brief and reply brief, and the appellants/cross-appellees have moved to assess the costs of reproduction of those documents against Peterson. The appellants/cross-appellees contend that the documents are unnecessary to the appeal and, therefore, under Md. Rule 8-501, were improperly included in the appendices. We disagree with the appellants/cross-appellees that the documents would be wholly unnecessary were we to reach the merits of the case. We further observe that, in moving to assess costs against Peterson, the appellants/cross-appellees failed to attach to their motion an affidavit as required by Md. Rule 8-431(c). The appellants/cross-appellees have attached to their motion letters between counsel that indicate disagreement as to whether the documents should have been included in the record extract. The letters do not reflect, however, that counsel for the appellants/cross-appellees ever demanded, under Md. Rule 8-5 01 (d)(4), that Peterson pay in advance for inclusion of the documents in the record extract or risk exclusion of the documents from the extract. In addition, counsel for Peterson wrote to counsel for the appellants/cross-appellees nearly two months before the record extract was due to be filed, explaining his position regarding inclusion of the documents and asking counsel for the appellants/cross-appellees to contact him if he still disagreed. Counsel for the appellants/cross-appellees did not contact counsel for Peterson until five days before the record extract was to be filed. Under the circumstances, we shall deny the motion to assess against Peterson the costs of reproducing the documents in the appendices.

Arguably, the language of \u00a7 701(e) does not expressly <em>exclude </em>from being a \"person of record\u201d a person who appeared at a Planning Board hearing but had no other real connection with the case or County. Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that such a person could be a \"person of record,\u201d and therefore have standing within the contemplation of \u00a7 713 of the Charter, however, such a person could not petition for judicial review from a District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Council decision involving land within the Maryland-National Regional District unless the person also had standing under \u00a7 8-106(e) of art. 28.
