Timothy Blair, appellant, John Fleig, and James Fitzpatrick were all charged with the murder. Pursuant to a plea agreement, Fleig pleaded guilty on October 15, 1997, to the charge of accessory after the murder, and he agreed to testify against Blair and Fitzpatrick. Beginning on September 28, 1998, appellant was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Blair was acquitted of first degree murder, but he was convicted of second degree murder, use of a handgun in the commission of a felony, and use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence. He was subsequently sentenced to thirty years of incarceration ,for the murder conviction and to a consecutive eight year term for the felony handgun offense. The other handgun offense merged for sentencing purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">On appeal, all of the issues raised by appellant relate to Fleig and Fleig\u2019s attorney. Blair presents three questions for our consideration, which we have rephrased and reordered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">I. Did the court err by permitting Fleig\u2019s lawyer to testify that Fleig\u2019s statements to him during client interviews were consistent with Fleig\u2019s subsequent statements to the police and with his testimony at Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">II. Did the court err by permitting the State to rehabilitate Fleig\u2019s testimony by introducing the entire transcript of his interview with the State?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">III. When Fleig\u2019s attorney testified, did the court err in refusing to permit defense counsel to review, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>purposes of cross-examination, the notes that Fleig\u2019s lawyer had taken during interviews of his client?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">For the reasons discussed below, we shall vacate the convictions and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">At the time of the killing, Fissell was living in a trailer located on land that abuts the Back River in Edgemere. A small home is also situated on the property (collectively, the \u201cShore Property\u201d). The Shore Property served as a summer retreat for members of an extended family that included Fissell, Blair, and Fitzpatrick. Blair\u2019s father and Fitpatriek\u2019s father are half brothers; both were Fissell\u2019s stepbrothers. Blair and Fitzpatrick referred to Fissell as \u201cUncle Eddie.\u201d Fissell lived at the Shore Property year-round, maintaining it and supporting himself through various odd jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">Animosity existed between Fissell and several of the younger adult members of the family, including appellant, who was about 28 years old at the time of trial. Indeed, Blair and Fissell argued on a number of occasions. Moreover, evidence was presented at trial that some of the young adult family members had harassed Fissell and vandalized the Shore Property. Consequently, the family\u2019s older members instituted a rule that Blair, Fitzpatrick, and the other younger adult family members could not visit the Shore Property without the older adults. Despite this prohibition, Blair and Fitzpatrick went to the Shore Property on the morning of the murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">Mahlon Thomas lived next door to Fissell. He testified that he was awakened at approximately 1:45 a.m. on January 27, 1997, by his dog\u2019s barking. Although it was too dark for him to see what was happening, Thomas stated that he heard a commotion outside. He then heard Fissell shout the name \u201cTimmey,\u201d followed by two gunshots. Thomas\u2019s son, Forrest, discovered Fissell\u2019s body later that morning. According to Dr. David Fowler, a deputy chief medical examiner, Fissell had been shot once in the head and once in the neck. The gunshot wound to the neck revealed stippling, indicating that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>the gun had been fired at close range. Fissell had also suffered various blunt force contusions and abrasions shortly before his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Fleig\u2019s testimony is central to the issues raised by appellant. According to Fleig, at approximately 4:30 p.m. on January 26, 1997, he picked Blair up at a house in Dundalk that Blah-shared with his cousin, Rose Perry. The two men then drove to Essex to attend a Super Bowl party in the basement den of Fitzpatrick\u2019s home. Toward the end of the party, Blair began to argue with Edwin Schwinn, another guest. The argument quickly escalated into a shouting match. Fitzpatrick subsequently \u201cput them out in the yard,\u201d where Blair and Schwinn continued to quarrel. Soon thereafter, Blair struck Schwinn in the face, knocking him to the ground, and delivered several more blows.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">After the fight, Fleig, Blair, and Fitzpatrick returned to the basement. Blair then left the den for a short time to call Fissell. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">[FLEIG:] ... Blair came downstairs highly agitated and slammed something down on the table that had the buffet food on it and just started ranting and raving about his uncle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">[PROSECUTOR:] Well, what did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">[FLEIG:] That he had gone too far this time and he was fed up with him and he was an MF\u2019r and they began to go on and on about some of the things that they would repeatedly say about their uncle, that he was gay and that he was worthless and he was a drunk and he was crazy and didn\u2019t deserve to live anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">[PROSECUTOR:] What did he say that caused him to be so agitated?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-11\">[FLEIG: Appellant] said something about that Uncle Eddie had said he couldn\u2019t go to the shore anymore and that [appellant] caused too much trouble and that his uncle had spoken to [appellant\u2019s] father and [appellant\u2019s] father said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>that if there was any more problems to just call the police because he washed his hands of the whole thing, he was just tired of the fighting between [appellant] and the uncle....[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">A discussion ensued between Blair and Fitzpatrick that eventually degenerated into a series of insults about Fissell. Blair was determined to go down to the Shore Property and \u201cget even.\u201d According to Fleig, Fitzpatrick and Blair devised a plan whereby Fitzpatrick would bang on the door to Fissell\u2019s trailer to lure him outside. Blair would then \u201chit [Fissell] from behind over the head with a shovel or whatever they could find,\u201d driving Fissell to the ground, and Fitzpatrick would take the shovel and decapitate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Fleig agreed to drive Blair and Fitzpatrick to the Shore Property. He testified that he did not think either Blair or Fitzpatrick \u201cwere all that serious,\u201d and he hoped to \u201cdiffuse the situation.\u201d Blair rode in the front passenger seat with Fitzpatrick immediately behind him.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">During the fifteen-minute ride to the Shore Property, Blair and Fitzpatrick discussed their plan. In response to a question from the State as to what comments Fleig added to the discussion, Fleig said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">[T]he conversation was just going on and on, going on, rehashing \u2014 it was just rude and it was tacky, it was disgusting, I was sick of hearing about it and I said, look, you know, what if he doesn\u2019t die right away. You can\u2019t be doing that to that old man. I said you all just getting too disgusting [sic]. You could at least have enough respect for him to shoot him....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">Blair then asked Fleig whether he had his gun with him, and began to lean toward the driver\u2019s seat. Fleig owned a .380 Davis Semi-Automatic handgun that he ordinarily kept under the driver\u2019s seat. Fleig reached down and grabbed the gun and held it out to Blair, who took it and tossed it around. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>Blair then gave it to Fitzpatrick, who attempted to fire it out of the rear window. When the attempt failed, Fitzpatrick tossed the gun into the front seat and Blair picked it up. Fleig testified that he took the gun from Blair, engaged the clip, returned it to Blair, and Blair then handed the gun to Fitzpatrick, who fired it. The plan to kill Fissell then came to include Fleig\u2019s gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">\u201cAbout a city block\u201d from the Shore Property, Fleig turned off the car\u2019s headlights and backed into a small enclave. According to Fleig, after the three men sat in silence \u201cfor a minute,\u201d Blair said \u201clet\u2019s do it.\u201d Blair and Fitzpatrick left the car; Fitzpatrick was holding the gun. Fleig lost sight of the men in the darkness. Several minutes later, Fleig heard gunshots. Blair and Fitzpatrick subsequently returned to the car; Fitzpatrick still had the gun. Fleig testified that Blair \u201cwas just really hyper and full of \u2014 lot of energy. He said, did you see me, did you see me, I can\u2019t believe we did it, we did it.... \u201d Fleig then began to drive back to Fitzpatrick\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">During the return trip, \u201cBlair was just repeating himself, ... then he turned to his cousin, he says did you see me, did you see me, I kicked him, I knocked him down, I hit him.\u201d Fleig stated that Fitzpatrick remained quiet. After some coaxing from Blair, Fitzpatrick gave the gun back to Fleig. Fleig claimed that he hid the gun in several places and ultimately threw it off a highway overpass. At some point during the ride, Blair threw his sneakers out of the car for fear that they had \u201cblood or mud or something on them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">Once back at Fitzpatrick\u2019s home, Fitzpatrick instructed Blair and Fleig to wash their hands in white wine vinegar in order to remove any gunpowder residue. They also agreed, if questioned, to maintain that they had been together all night and had never left Fitzpatrick\u2019s house. At 2:40 a.m., Fleig dropped Blair off at his house in Dundalk and returned home.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">Information surrounding the murder quickly surfaced, and the police brought Fleig in for questioning on the day of the shooting. The State elicited the following testimony from Fleig:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>[PROSECUTOR:] Did [the police] ask you if you drove Mr. Blair that night?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-4\">[FLEIG:] They asked me a lot of questions about whether he had left the house and if he did, did I take him, did I know about it and things like that at that point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASX\">[PROSECUTOR:] What did you tell the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-5\">[FLEIG:] No, no, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-6\">[PROSECUTOR:] Were you being truthful with the police?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZT\">[FLEIG:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did they ask you if you had an idea of who might have committed this crime?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">[FLEIG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] What did you tell them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">[FLEIG:] I didn\u2019t tell them anything. I told them no, I didn\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b605-11\">Fleig maintained that he was scared to tell the police the truth because Fitzpatrick had threatened his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-12\">Blair and Fleig were later arrested and scheduled to be tried together on murder charges. After the circuit court denied a defense motion to sever the trials, Fleig agreed to cooperate with the State in the prosecution of Blair, in exchange for a plea to accessory after the murder and the State\u2019s nol prosse of all other charges. On September 4,1997, Fleig and his attorney, Timothy Gunning, executed a written plea agreement to this effect, which was supplemented with an \u201cAddendum\u201d on October 15, 1997. As part of the plea agreement, Fleig agreed to submit to a tape-recorded interview conducted by the prosecutor and detectives from the Homicide Unit of the Baltimore County Police Department concerning the events surrounding the murder (the \u201cSeptember interview\u201d). He also agreed, <em>inter alia, </em>to wear a body wire to record conversations with Fitzpatrick, and agreed to direct police to his gun and Blair\u2019s discarded sneakers. Neither the sneakers nor the gun was recovered, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-13\">Sometime after Fleig negotiated the plea agreement with the State, Fleig visited Blair, on his own initiative, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>Baltimore County Detention Center. Fleig testified that he suggested to Blair that he \u201ccut a deal.\u201d Appellant responded that \u201cblood was thicker than water,\u201d and that he was sticking to the agreed-upon alibi.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">On cross-examination, appellant\u2019s counsel established that Fleig pleaded guilty on October 15, 1997, to a reduced charge and was testifying pursuant to a plea agreement with the State. Under the terms of the plea agreement, as amended, the State agreed to drop the murder and handgun charges against Fleig, and Fleig\u2019s sentencing was postponed until after the completion of Blair\u2019s trial. Further, pursuant to the terms of the Addendum, the court agreed to impose a sentence of five years of incarceration, with all but eighteen months suspended, provided Fleig complied with his obligations under the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">At the request of appellant\u2019s counsel, Fleig read the following paragraph from the agreement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">If after the [September] interview the State is satisfied that the Defendant\u2019s testimony will assist them in the prosecution of Timothy Blair and/or any heretofore unnamed eo-defendant(s) and that the contents of the taped statement are truthful, then the State will be bound by the Plea Agreement at all times thereafter unless the Defendant subsequently refuses to continue to cooperate or changes his statement or otherwise becomes untruthful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-8\">That excerpt from the agreement prompted the following line of questioning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] ... And you knew that the agreement said that the State had to be satisfied that your testimony would assist them before your murder charges are dropped, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-10\">[FLEIG:] I would guess so, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] The only way to get your murder charges dropped was to assist them in the prosecution of Timothy Blair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-12\">[FLEIG:] Definitely seemed that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>[FLEIG:] At the time I signed it, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">Fleig also testified about the addendum to the plea agreement, which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-6\">If ... the Defendant continues in full cooperation under the provisions of the [agreement], to the State\u2019s full satisfaction, as he has to date, the State will consider recommending that any incarceration imposed upon the Defendant to be served in the Home Detention Program of the Baltimore County Detention Center.[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">He explained that he understood this language to mean that \u201cas long as I\u2019m not caught in a lie during my interviews with the prosecution, that they would not be so hard on me when I went to my own sentencing and I would be eligible for home detention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Appellant\u2019s counsel also endeavored to question Fleig about several other matters, including whether Fleig (1) knew that he was violating the law by transporting a gun in his car; (2) told police about the fight at Fitzpatrick\u2019s home; (3) was honest when he told police on the day of the murder that he did not know who killed Fissell; (4) purposefully misled police about the location of his gun; (5) was being forthright with police about where he, Blair, and Fitzpatrick were at the time of the murder; (6) lied to the court at his bail review hearing as to whether he was at the Shore Property; and (7) would \u201csay anything to get out of jail.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">Additionally, defense counsel questioned Fleig about the September 1997 interview. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Okay. My question to you is do you remember what you told [the prosecutor] when he asked you [during the September interview] the question, did you ever \u2014 did you ever suggest [Blair and Fitzpatrick] not do this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-11\">[FLEIG:] I don\u2019t recall off hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Let me play for you what you told [the prosecutor].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-5\">(Tape played).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Is that you on that tape, Mr. Fleig?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-7\">[FLEIG:] Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] When he asked you directly did you ever suggest that they not do this, you didn\u2019t give him a straight answer, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-9\">[FLEIG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-10\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Is that because you didn\u2019t or because you didn\u2019t want to give him a straight answer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArvT\">[FLEIG:] No, just didn\u2019t remember. It was \u2014 I just \u2014 it was too close to the situation still and I was still pretty much upset over everything. At the time that tape was made, I just didn\u2019t remember....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-11\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] ... [The prosecutor] asked you why you didn\u2019t tell the police everything that you knew when they asked you, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-13\">[FLEIG:] I would assume so. It\u2019s a logical question to ask someone in that position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] You have testified here today that the reason you didn\u2019t tell the police everything you knew is your fear of James Fitzpatrick?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">[FLEIG:] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] That\u2019s not what you told [the prosecutor] when he asked you that question on September 4th, isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-17\">[FLEIG:] I don\u2019t know. Frankly, I was still suffering from shock at that point. I had been arrested, I had been accused, I had been splattered all over the newspapers, I had lost my motion as to severed trials, now I was cutting a deal, I was still in shock. I don\u2019t recall every single comment that was made. Luckily it was taped.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Let me play you your response to that question....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AtF\">(Tape played)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Conversation happens before you get into an automobile to go to Mr. Fissell\u2019s home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A14\">[FLEIG:] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-7\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] So when he asked you what you were afraid of, you didn\u2019t say it was Fitzpatrick, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-8\">[FLEIG:] Not specifically because I knew that it was understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] You knew it was understood?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-10\">[FLEIG:] Yes, I had already told them prior to that statement that he had threatened to kill me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Well, when he asked you specifically what you were \u2014 when he sought clarification, when he asked you what you were afraid of, you didn\u2019t tell him Mr. Fitzpatrick, you told him that you didn\u2019t know exactly how, what kind of trouble you were \u2014 I was in, how deep I was into it, how I was going to get out of it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8yl\">[FLEIG:] Uh-huh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] So that was your fear, isn\u2019t that true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-13\">[FLEIG:] Certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-14\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Your fear was how to get out of the trouble that you were in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-15\">[FLEIG:] That was certainly part of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-16\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] The State gave you a way out?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b609-17\">[FLEIG:] Yes, they did.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-18\">Appellant\u2019s counsel then proceeded to question Fleig about the \u201cStatement of Facts\u201d that summarized the evening prior to and the morning of the shooting, as well as Fleig\u2019s involvement in the incident and subsequent investigation (the \u201cStatement\u201d). The Statement was prepared and submitted to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>circuit court in connection with the hearing on October 15, 1997, at which Fleig tendered his guilty plea. Fleig testified that he reviewed the Statement \u201cbriefly\u201d and that he and his attorney, Timothy Gunning, signed it. Fleig also acknowledged that he \u201cwas present\u201d while Gunning \u201cwent over\u201d the Statement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">When appellant\u2019s counsel confronted Fleig with the Statement, the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Now, page 2 of your [Statement] you wrote that Fitzpatrick suggested beating Edward Fissell to death with a shovel, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-7\">[FLEIG:] Yes, he had made those comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"atp-dedup-0\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Yeah. Well, today you have testified that Mr. Blair was the one who suggested beating him with a shovel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">[FLEIG:] He did make those comments.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Okay. \u25a0 In [the Statement] is there any statement as to whether or not Mr. Blair suggested beating Mr. Fissell with a shovel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">[FLEIG:] They both said it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">. [APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] And in [the- Statement] you say this suggestion occurred on the way down to the shore property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">[FLEIG:] Huh-uh.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] Prior sentence that you signed says, on the way Blair and Fitzpatrick began to talk about killing Uncle Eddie, Fitzpatrick suggested beating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Edward Fissell to death with a shovel. What did you mean on the way?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-4\">[FLEIG:] They did talk about it on the way. Almost the same conversation at the house was reiterated in the car.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-5\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL:] In the [Statement] you never say \u2014 mention any discussion of a shovel back at the house, isn\u2019t that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-6\">[FLEIG:] According to [the Statement], the first mention is \u2014 well, the statement, there\u2019s one statement that says simply, Fleig agreed to drive them down to the shore property. Two statements later it brings up the fact that Fitzpatrick suggested beating Edward Fissell to death with a shovel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">This line of questioning led to a bench conference, at which the following ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-8\">THE COURT: You know, fair is fair here. He did adopt that [Statement but he didn\u2019t prepare it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: Judge, I can tell you since you brought it up, we intend now based on cross examination and your comment fair is fair to introduce [the tape of the September interview] and let the jury listen to it, because he is clearly testifying he\u2019s doing all this in response to the advice of counsel---- Now counsel is trying to suggest that this summary ... is somehow [a] flagrant lie when I think that fairly the jury should have the opportunity to listen to the taped statement....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b611-12\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: If there is a portion in the [recording of the September interview that is consistent with Fleig\u2019s present testimony], they can introduce it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>rehabilitate him as a prior consistent statement.

Appellant\u2019s counsel then attempted to impeach Fleig with excerpts from his earlier testimony at Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On redirect, the State elicited further testimony from Fleig concerning the Statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">[PROSECUTOR:] This is ... the [Statement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-8\">[FLEIG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-9\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you write that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-10\">[FLEIG:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-11\">[PROSECUTOR:] Is that a detailed synopsis of every thing [sic] that you have ever told police or the State in this case?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"av-dedup-0\">[FLEIG:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-12\">[PROSECUTOR:] Do you know who wrote that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-13\">[FLEIG:] No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-14\">[PROSECUTOR:] You signed that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-15\">[FLEIG:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-16\">[PROSECUTOR:] Was that document for purposes of your guilty plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-17\">[FLEIG:] I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-18\">[PROSECUTOR:] And on whose advice did you sign it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKx\">[FLEIG:] My attorney\u2019s.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-19\">[PROSECUTOR:] Did you trust your attorney\u2019s advice?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Asv\">[FLEIG:] Oh, yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-20\">We will include additional facts in our discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">Appellant\u2019s first contention centers on the testimony of Gunning, Fleig\u2019s attorney. On the final day of the State\u2019s case, Fleig waived his attorney-client privilege in order to enable his attorney to testify for the State. Without objection, the prosecution called Gunning to the stand. At that point, the court instructed the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">As you will shortly hear, Mr. Gunning is Mr. Fleig\u2019s lawyer. His testimony this morning is for the purpose of rehabilitating Mr. Fleig\u2019s testimony the other day. State will ask him certain questions about \u2014 well, I\u2019ll just let them ask the questions. You will hear them. It\u2019s really not being offered for the truth of it but to rehabilitate Mr. Fleig. If you think you need to rehabilitate him, I\u2019m not suggesting that he does one way or the other. That\u2019s for you to decide, not me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">On direct examination, Gunning testified that Fleig retained him around February 1997 and that they discussed the incident on several occasions. Subsequently, the State communicated a tentative plea agreement. Gunning advised Fleig not to pursue an agreement until after the circuit court ruled on the severance motion. Following the denial of that motion on July 7, 1997, Gunning initiated plea negotiations with the State. According to Gunning, he and Fleig reached an agreement with the State on September 4, 1997, and Gunning was present when the State conducted the September interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">In questioning Gunning, the State sought to show that Fleig\u2019s comments at the September interview were consistent with Fleig\u2019s comments to Gunning during counsel\u2019s interviews, and with Fleig\u2019s testimony at the earlier trial of Blair\u2019s co-defendant, Fitzpatrick. Apparently, the State wanted to establish inferentially that Fleig\u2019s pre-trial statements to Gunning and at Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial were consistent with Fleig\u2019s testimony at Blair\u2019s trial. The following testimony is at the heart of appellant\u2019s first complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>[PROSECUTOR:] During [the September 4th] interview, Mr. Gunning, is what your client told the State concerning facts of that night consistent with the initial conversations that you had with him when he retained you, whenever that was in February of 1997?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-5\">[GUNNING:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection, Your Honor. He\u2019s asked\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">THE COURT: No, overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-8\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: He\u2019s asking him to draw a conclusion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-9\">THE COURT: No. Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-10\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-11\">[GUNNING:] Yes, it\u2019s consistent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">The State also sought to bolster Fleig\u2019s credibility with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-13\">[PROSECUTOR:] Mr. Gunning, were you present when your client testified at the James Fitzpatrick trial?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkN\">[GUNNING:] Yes, I was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-14\">[PROSECUTOR:] In substance what he said concerning the facts of that night, were they consistent with what he told you when he first \u2014 were those facts about what happened on the night of the murder consistent with what he told you when he first retained you concerning the facts of the night of the murder?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-15\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-16\">THE COURT: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-17\">[GUNNING:] Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-18\">Appellant argues that the court erred in allowing the State to adduce such \u201cconsistency\u201d testimony from Gunning. At oral argument, appellant indicated that he does not dispute the State\u2019s right to call Gunning as a witness once Fleig waived his attorney-client privilege. Rather, as articulated in appellant\u2019s brief and at argument, appellant\u2019s objection is to the conclusory content of Gunning\u2019s testimony. He complains that Gunning never articulated what Fleig actually said in his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>discussions with Gunning, and he maintains that the State invaded the province of the jury with Gunning\u2019s general description of Fleig\u2019s pre-trial statements as consistent.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The State claims that it was proper to call Gunning to testify, because appellant previously sought to impeach Fleig with the Statement, which had been offered in connection with Fleig\u2019s guilty plea. Therefore, the State wanted to introduce the September interview through Gunning, in an \u201cattempt to point out omissions from the [Statement] that may have been otherwise covered in the transcript of the [September interview].\u201d The State posits that Gunning\u2019s testimony properly rehabilitated Fleig by detracting from the attack on Fleig\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Both parties rely on Md. Rule 5 \u2014 616(c)(2) to validate their respective positions. That rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-7\">(c) Rehabilitation. A witness whose credibility has been attacked may be rehabilitated by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">(2) Except as provided by statute[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] evidence of the witness\u2019s prior statements that are consistent with the witness\u2019s present testimony, when their having been made detracts from the impeachment[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">At the outset, we note that it is ordinarily within the sound discretion of the trial court to determine the admissibility of evidence. <em>See Conyers v. State, </em>354 Md. 132, 176, 729 A.2d 910, <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 120 S.Ct. 258, 145 L.Ed.2d 216 (1999); <em>Hopkins v.

State, </em>130 Md.App. 408, 446-27, 746 A.2d 954 (2000).

Chapter 600 of that title governs witnesses and, with one exception, is modeled after Article VI of the Federal Rules. <em>See </em>Alan D. Hornstein, <em>The New Maryland Rules of Evidence: Survey, Analysis and Critique, </em>54 Md. L.Rev. 1032, 1037 (1995). \u201cThe exception, Maryland Rule 5-616, is an omnibus impeachment rule for which there is no federal counterpart.\u201d <em>Id.; see </em>Lynn McLain, <em>Maryland Rules of Evidence, in </em>7 <em>Maryland Practice </em>\u00a7 2.616.4(a), at 183-84 (1994 ed.). Section (c) of Rule 5-616 lists, but does not proscribe, methods of rehabilitation. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-616 Committee Note; McLain, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 2.616.1(d), at 182. The seminal opinion explaining the meaning and application of subsection (c)(2) is <em>Holmes v. State, </em>350 Md. 412, 712 A.2d 554 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">In that case, Ellouise Thompson was asked to identify the individual who shot and killed her roommate. On the day of the shooting, Thompson gave the police a written statement in which she claimed that she did not see the assailant. Two days later, however, Thompson gave a second statement, in which she identified Dar\u00edan Holmes as the killer. At Holmes\u2019s murder trial, Thompson testified consistent with her second statement. On direct examination, she explained that, because of fear for her safety, she had initially decided not to provide the police with the killer\u2019s identity. On cross-examination, the defense impeached Thompson with her first statement. Thereafter, on redirect, the State successfully moved Thompson\u2019s second statement into evidence, over the defendant\u2019s objection. On appeal, the defendant asked the \u201cCourt to determine whether a witness\u2019s prior consistent statement is admissible under Maryland Rule 5-802.1(b) to rebut a charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>of fabrication where the statement was made after a motive to fabricate arose.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 415, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">Maryland Rule 5-802.1(b) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">The following statements previously made by a witness who testifies at the trial or hearing and who is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement are not excluded by the hearsay rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-6\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-7\">(b) A statement that is consistent with the declarant\u2019s testimony, if the statement is offered to rebut an express or implied charge against the declarant of fabrication, or improper influence or motive[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">In addressing appellant\u2019s contention, the Court looked to Rule 5-802.1(b)\u2019s federal analogue, Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(1)(B),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of that rule in <em>Tome v. United States, </em>513 U.S. 150, 115 S.Ct. 696, 130 L.Ed.2d 574 (1995). <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 418-22, 712 A.2d 554. The Court of Appeals explained that <em>Tome </em>interpreted the federal rule to require that \u201ca prior consistent statement, introduced \u2018to rebut a charge of recent fabrication or improper influence or motive\u2019 ... [must be] made before the alleged fabrication or improper influence or motive came into existence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 418, 712 A.2d 554 (citing <em>Tome, </em>513 U.S. at 167, 115 S.Ct. 696). The Court of Appeals adopted that construction with respect to the Maryland counterpart to the federal rule. <em>Id. </em>at 422, 712 A.2d 554. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held \u201cthat, in order to be admissible under Md. Rule 5-802.1(b), a prior consistent statement must have been made before the alleged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>fabrication or improper influence or motive arose.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">Applying this reasoning to Holmes\u2019s appeal, the Court concluded that Thompson\u2019s prior consistent statement was not admissible under Rule 5-802.1(b), because it was offered to rebut her prior inconsistent statement, not to rebut a motive to fabricate. <em>Id. </em>at 424-25, 712 A.2d 554. Nevertheless, the prior consistent second statement was found to be admissible through application of Rule 5-616(c)(2). <em>Id. </em>at 427-428, 712 A.2d 554. The Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Under Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2), a prior consistent statement is admissible to rehabilitate a witness as long as the fact that the witness has made a consistent statement detracts from the impeachment. Prior consistent statements used for rehabilitation of a witness whose credibility is attacked are relevant not for their truth since they are repetitions of the witness\u2019s trial testimony. They are relevant because the circumstances under which they are made rebut an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility. Thus, such statements by definition are not offered as hearsay and logically do not have to meet the same requirements as hearsay statements falling within an exception to the hearsay rule, <em>e.g., </em>Md. Rule 5-802.1(b). We therefore conclude that a relevant consistent statement admitted solely for the purpose of rehabilitation is not required to meet the stringent premo-tive requirement of Md. Rule 5-802.1(b).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-7\">Turning to the circumstances of this case, <em>the fact that Thompson made a consistent statement must be relevant to diminish the impeachment of Thompson in order for her consistent statement to be admissible under Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2). </em>At trial, Thompson explained on direct examination that she initially was reluctant to give any statement to police because Petitioner knew that she had witnessed the murder and she was frightened for her safety. Although Thompson told one of her sons what Petitioner had done, Thompson\u2019s first statement to the police indicated that she did not see who committed the murder. Thompson also testified that Petitioner visited her the day after the murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>and that the next day she told the police that Petitioner murdered the victim. On cross-examination, defense counsel impeached Thompson with her prior inconsistent statement that she did not see who shot Harris, and during closing arguments, he further questioned the credibility of Thompson\u2019s statement implicating Petitioner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b620-5\">... Thompson\u2019s consistent statement detracted from the impeachment by rebutting her initial inconsistent statement to police that she did not see who shot Harris. It also put in perspective that her inconsistent statement was made because she was frightened of what Petitioner would do to her. Thompson\u2019s consistent statement therefore detracted from the impeachment by Thompson\u2019s inconsistent statement that was elicited by defense counsel and was admissible for rehabilitative purposes under Md. Rule 5 \u2014 616(c)(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"axu-dedup-0\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">As <em>Holmes </em>makes clear, Md. Rule 5-616(c)(2) does not relieve a party seeking to admit a statement under that rule of the obligation to show the statement\u2019s relevance. As a general rule, in order for evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant. <em>See Conyers, </em>354 Md. at 176, 729 A.2d 910; <em>Williams v. State, </em>342 Md. 724, 736, 679 A.2d 1106 (1996); <em>State v. Joynes, </em>314 Md. 113, 119, 549 A.2d 380 (1988); <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 643, 350 A.2d 665 (1976). Under Md. Rule 5-401, evidence is relevant if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d In the context of Rule 5-616(c)(2), a -witness\u2019s rehabilitative prior consistent statement is relevant if it tends to detract from an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 427-28, 712 A.2d 554.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">We are not satisfied that Gunning\u2019s so called consistency testimony was relevant for purposes of Rule 5-616(c)(2). As noted, Fleig was impeached with specific portions of the Statement, as well as with his testimony from Fitzpatrick\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>trial. In <em>Holmes, </em>the State chose to rehabilitate its witness by rebutting a pre-trial inconsistent statement with a subsequent pre-trial statement that was consistent with the witness\u2019s trial testimony. Here, the State attempted to rehabilitate Fleig by rebutting allegedly inconsistent pre-trial statements and omissions, made at Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial and in the Statement, with conclusory testimony from Fleig\u2019s lawyer that Fleig made other pre-trial statements during attorney-client interviews that were consistent with his pre-trial statements and trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The State\u2019s effort was evidently aimed at establishing a consistency \u201cchain\u201d: (1) Fleig told Gunning of the events surrounding the killing; (2) Fleig told the State during the September interview of the events surrounding the killing; and (3) Fleig testified at the Fitzpatrick trial as to events surrounding the killing. According to Gunning, all of these pre-trial statements were consistent with one another. The net result of the State\u2019s effort was to demonstrate through Gunning\u2019s testimony that Fleig\u2019s statements during the September interview and at Fitzpatrick\u2019s trial were consistent with Fleig\u2019s testimony at appellant\u2019s trial. Without the actual statements <em>themselves, </em>however, Gunning\u2019s conclusory remarks left the jury with nothing to consider. In essence, the jury was offered an opinion by one State\u2019s witness that another State\u2019s witness said the same thing on three different, prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">The vague, conclusory assertions and characterizations of the statements Fleig made to Gunning prior to Blair\u2019s trial failed to detract from the specific attacks appellant made on Fleig\u2019s credibility. Conclusions as to whether one, two, or ten pre-trial statements were consistent with one another may well differ according to who is asked. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court erred in admitting Gunning\u2019s so called consistency testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">As we intimated, during its direct examination of Gunning, the State moved to admit, over appellant\u2019s objection, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>transcript of the audio recording of the September interview. Initially, the court reserved ruling on the motion and the State continued its questioning. After Gunning answered' several questions about Fleig\u2019s statements during the September interview, however, the court summoned the parties to the bench. The following colloquy ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">THE COURT: Tell me what parts shouldn\u2019t come in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEE\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Your Honor\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-6\">THE COURT: The Court has handed defense counsel [the transcript of the September interview] and suggested that he tell me what parts of [the transcript] should not come in.... I need specific objections to specific questions. I\u2019m not going to do the work for you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-8\">THE COURT: I\u2019m going to take a little recess, give you a chance to look at it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-9\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Okay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">After a short recess, the discussion resumed concerning the admissibility of the transcript and tape of the September interview:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-11\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... Your Honor, I am of the position that under Maryland Rule 5-616[ (c) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-12\">THE COURT: Which one?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-13\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: 5-616[ (c) ].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-14\">THE COURT: Yes, rehabilitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-15\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: Rehabilitation, which is what we are here for, and under the Holmes case and it\u2019s [sic] explanation of the purposes of rehabilitation \u2014 I mean, the point is is that rehabilitation is not a vehicle to subsequently go over a witness\u2019 [sic] testimony. If there are specific points that I impeached Mr. Fleig about concerning, you know, what he said about who was the one who brought up the conversation with the shovel, that\u2019s clearly an instance. You know, I cross examined him about the [State<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>ment] where he said it\u2019s Fitzpatrick. If there is something that is prior consistent\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-4\">THE COURT: Here\u2019s the whole problem. You didn\u2019t cross examine him with respect to the [September interview]. That is the rub. That\u2019s the problem with this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlQ\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: I\u2019m sorry sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-5\">THE COURT: You didn\u2019t cross[-]examine him with [the interview]. You cross examined him with a summary of [the September interview, i.e., the Statement].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-6\">[APPELLANT\u2019S COUNSEL]: ... I played two portions of the tape [of the September interview]. And certainly if there is something that explains or otherwise rehabilitates those portions of the tape, the State can do it. If there is something in [the transcript of the September interview] that is inconsistent with the issue regarding like who brought up the shovel, that they can ask him about. But there is so much in [the transcript] that is just a rehash of testimony. There is stuff in [the transcript] that was never testified to as to trial such as his conversations with Fitzpatrick subsequent to the night of this particular offense. There is just so much, so much stuff here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-7\">I mean, again, Your Honor, if there is a specific \u2014 a specific line that they want Mr. Gunning to read and they want to argue to you that that somehow rehabilitates, I got no problem with that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b623-8\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... [W]hat [appellant\u2019s counsel is] trying to do is persuade you that the State should only be allowed to specifically introduce evidence of prior consistent statements where \u2014 on subjects that have been the subject of cross examination, but that\u2019s not the situation, Your Honor, I believe. Although counsel did identify specific areas of the [Statement] to support Mr. Fleig\u2019s guilty plea, he crossed the line \u2014 I won\u2019t say crossed the line \u2014 he measured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>that against some limited statements that he played for the Defendant. So his attack, his whole attack is on credibility. These prior consistent statements, although not offered substantively, are for the purpose of rehabilitating that credibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">... I think in essence [appellant\u2019s counsel] has opened the door because he has attacked the entire credibility of Mr. Fleig, and all we are attempting to do is show that what he has now testified to before this jury was the same thing he told Mr. Gunning prior to gaining a benefit, that being the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The court ruled that it would admit the transcript of the September interview subject to redactions, and noted that the jury had previously been informed that \u201cthe whole purpose of this is not as substantive evidence, but rather it\u2019s to rehabilitate Mr. Fleig.\u201d Defense counsel then voiced the following objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-7\">Your Honor, although I\u2019ve argued the point of Maryland Rule 5-616[ (c) ], and I believe that the introduction of the entire tape and transcript is violative of that rule, I just want to make it clear that my objection is larger than that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-8\">I believe that the introduction of this entire transcript also, number one, violates the hearsay rule; number two, violates my client\u2019s rights to confront and cross examine witnesses, and his rights under the 6th and 14th Amendments of the Constitution of the United States in Article 21, 22 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. I just want to make clear, that my objection is much larger than the specific point that we are arguing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">Appellant also argued that redacting certain portions of the transcript was insufficient to render the transcript admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">On appeal, appellant avers that the State improperly used the transcript of the September interview to rehabilitate Fleig pursuant to Rule 5-802.1(b). Alternatively, appellant urges that, even if we conclude that the transcript was not inherently inadmissible, the court erred because its prejudicial nature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>\u201cgreatly outweighed any marginal relevance it might have had on the issue of Fleig\u2019s credibility.\u201d <em>See </em>Md. Rule 5-403 (\u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d). The State responds that the transcript was properly admitted pursuant to Rule 5-616(c)(2), and that appellant\u2019s allegations of prejudice are not preserved for our review.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">We are satisfied that these issues are preserved. Moreover, we are of the view that neither Rule 5-802.1(b) nor Rule 5-616(c)(2) supports the trial court\u2019s decision to admit the entire transcript. The decision in <em>Holmes, supra, </em>350 Md. 412, 712 A.2d 554, is instructive on both points. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">In <em>Holmes, </em>as we noted earlier, the Court said: \u201c[I]n order to be admissible under Md. Rule 5-802.1(b), a prior consistent statement must have been made before the alleged fabrication or improper influence or motive arose.\u201d <em>Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 424, 712 A.2d 554. Here, Fleig\u2019s motive to fabricate arose at the moment Fissell was killed, if not earlier. <em>See McCray v. State, </em>122 Md.App. 598, 609-10, 716 A.2d 302 (1998) (acknowledging that a criminal defendant\u2019s motive to fabricate exists from the time of the crime). Thus, the September interview was inadmissible under Rule 5-802.1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">Moreover, the September interview was not admissible under Rule 5-616(c)(2), because it does not detract from the impeachment. As we stated earlier, a witness\u2019s prior consistent statement is relevant, and therefore admissible under Rule 5-616(c)(2), if it tends to rebut an attack on the witness\u2019s credibility. <em>See Holmes, </em>350 Md. at 427-28, 712 A.2d 554. Our review of the transcript of the September interview revealed several excerpts that could have been useful to rehabilitate Fleig. We do not agree with the State, however, that appellant\u2019s cross-examination of Fleig \u201copened the door\u201d to the use or admission of the entire transcript of the Septem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ber interview as the remedy to counteract appellant\u2019s use of the Statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">The attack lodged against Fleig\u2019s credibility was directed at specific alleged omissions in the Statement, and inconsistencies between that Statement and Fleig\u2019s trial testimony. In contrast, the transcript of the September interview contained material wholly collateral to matters relating to the impeachment or the rehabilitation of Fleig\u2019s credibility. The September interview was conducted after Fleig had agreed to plead guilty to a lesser charge, and clearly was cast in a light useful to the State. In large measure, the thirty-five page transcript of the September interview consisted of a repetition of Fleig\u2019s testimony as well as various hearsay statements. Consequently, when the jury adjourned to deliberate, it had a copy of what was tantamount to a written version of Fleig\u2019s trial testimony, wholly beneficial to the State. It was fundamentally unfair to appellant to permit the jury to deliberate with written remarks of only one witness, who happened arguably to be the State\u2019s single most critical witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Appellant challenges the court\u2019s refusal to permit him to inspect Gunning\u2019s notes of his interviews of Fleig, because Gunning\u2019s testimony focused on Fleig\u2019s statements during those interviews. In our consideration of this issue, we observe that the attorney\u2019s notes were not reviewed by the trial judge, nor did the trial judge permit defense counsel to include them as a sealed exhibit. Therefore, we do not have any information as to the contents of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">On cross-examination of Gunning, defense counsel inquired whether Gunning had his notes with him from his initial interviews with Fleig. When Gunning indicated that he did, defense counsel asked if he could see them. The State objected, the court sustained the objection, and the following bench conference ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, the State has sought to rehabilitate Mr. Gunning by saying that in September\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-5\">THE COURT: Mr. Gunning[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Rehabilitate Mr. Fleig through Mr. Gunning by saying that, well, he gave consistent statements during this taped interview of September 4th, 1997. Mr. Fleig has waived his right to attorney/client privilege. I think that at this point I would like to know and review Mr. Fleig\u2019s statements to Mr. Gunning prior to that date to see whether or not that there are other inconsistencies in those statements. I mean, the bottom line is, is that Mr. Fleig\u2019s conversation about what happened in this case just didn\u2019t start on September 4th. I would like to know, and [the prosecutor] was asking Mr. Gunning several questions concerning, well, this was done because you know you \u2014 Mr. Fleig talked to you, Gunning, and gave you the full account of the case. I\u2019d like to know what Mr. Gunning\u2019s notes reflect, what those conversations involved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">[PROSECUTOR]: ... The point is if he wants to cross examine him about that, he has the right to do that but he doesn\u2019t have the right to all his notes. It\u2019s no discovery process here merely because a witness has waived a privilege. I\u2019m sure he\u2019d love to have them but he\u2019s not entitled to them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-8\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t know. It would seem to me you could get this from Mr. Gunning. I mean, you can ask him whether what was told to him from February of \u201997 onward, has it always been consistent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-9\">[PROSECUTOR]: I think that he has the right to ask him that question. But to merely go through his file to get information I think is prohibitive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-10\">THE COURT: ... My ruling will stand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Your Honor, just to preserve the record, may I ask that Mr. Gunning\u2019s notes of his conversation with Mr. Fleig be sealed and made a part of the record?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL2\">THE COURT: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On appeal, appellant reinvigorates his argument that he was entitled to review Gunning\u2019s notes of his interviews of Fleig for purposes of cross-examination. Appellant largely focuses on the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine. He contends that, once Fleig waived his attorney-client privilege, neither the privilege nor the doctrine precluded access to Gunning\u2019s notes. Moreover, he contends that the due process principles adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. 455, 472-73, 397 A.2d 606 (1979), and its progeny govern disclosure of the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Appellant also refers us to Maryland Rule 5-612, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-7\">If, while testifying, a witness uses a writing or other item to refresh memory, any party is entitled to inspect it, to examine the witness about it, and to introduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the witness for the limited purpose of impeaching the witness as to whether the item in fact refreshes the witness\u2019s recollection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKv\">In this regard, appellant comments that \u201c[i]t is interesting that although Gunning informed the court that he had reviewed his file prior to his testimony, he was able to protect his notes from disclosure simply by declining to refer to those notes to refresh his recollection on the stand.\u201d (Footnote omitted). He does not suggest that Rule 5-612 gave him access to Gunning\u2019s notes, however. Moreover, although Blair points out that the corresponding federal rule, Fed.R.Evid. 612, would likely have allowed him that access, he offers no other authority to support his argument as to Md. Rule 5-612.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">In response to appellant\u2019s contentions, the State addresses each of appellant\u2019s points, with the exception of the work product doctrine. Interestingly, it has not referred us to any rule of law that clearly prohibited appellant\u2019s access to the notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>By statute, \u201c[a] person may not be compelled to testify in violation of the attorney-client privilege.\u201d C.J. \u00a7 9-108. As we explained in <em>Levitsky v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>50 Md.App. 484, 491, 439 A.2d 600 (1982), the attorney-client privilege \u201cis a rule of evidence which prohibits the disclosure of the substance of a communication made <em>in confidence </em>by a client to his attorney for the purpose of obtaining <em>legal advice.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added); <em>see State v. Pratt, </em>284 Md. 516, 519-20, 398 A.2d 421 (1979). It is undisputed that here the privilege was waived; obviously, absent a waiver, the State could not have called Gunning as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">Although the attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine \u201cappear to embrace the same concepts of confidentiality and zealous client advocacy, the work product doctrine is separate and distinct from the attorney-client privilege.\u201d <em>E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. v. Forma-Pack, Inc., </em>351 Md. 396, 406, 718 A.2d 1129 (1998); <em>see Pratt v. State, </em>39 Md.App. 442, 446 n. 2, 387 A.2d 779 (1978) (\u201cThe work product doctrine ... is separate from the attorney-client privilege and serves to protect materials from discovery that are not subject to another privilege.\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>284 Md. 516, 398 A.2d 421 (1979). Moreover, the attorney-client privilege is held by the client while the protections associated with the work product doctrine belong to the lawyer. <em>See Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 406, 718 A.2d 1129.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">Fleig told Gunning about the events surrounding Fissell\u2019s murder in order to obtain legal advice. Similarly, at the time Fleig relayed that information, he intended his communication to be confidential, i.e., not disclosed to third persons. <em>See Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 416, 718 A.2d 1129 (citing <em>United States v. (Under Seal), </em>748 F.2d 871 (4th Cir.1984)); <em>see also Ashcraft &amp; Gerel v. Shaw, </em>126 Md.App. 325, 351, 728 A.2d 798 (1999); <em>Trupp v. Wolff, </em>24 Md.App. 588, 608-09, 335 A.2d 171, <em>cert. denied, </em>275 Md. 757 (1975). As noted, however, Fleig waived his privilege. The following colloquy is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b630-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>[PROSECUTOR:] Mr. Fleig, you were asked to come back here today for the purpose of making a legal ruling concerning what [sic] you may have a privilege with Mr. Gunning.

Consequently, we turn to consider whether the work product doctrine has any applicability in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">The work product doctrine is broader than the attorney-client privilege. It protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from disclosure. <em>See generally United States v. Pollard (In re Martin Marietta Corp.), </em>856 F.2d 619, 624 (4th Cir.1988), <em>cert. denied, </em>490 U.S. 1011, 109 S.Ct. 1655, 104 L.Ed.2d 169 (1989); <em>Nutramax Lab., Inc. v. Twin Lab.

Fact work product generally consists of \u201cmaterials gathered by counsel (or at counsel\u2019s instructions) in preparation of trial.\u201d Joseph F. Murphy, Jr., <em>Maryland Evidence Handbook </em>\u00a7 904(A) (3d ed.1999).

Neither fact nor opinion work product is ordinarily discoverable, but opinion work product, in particular, \u201cis almost always completely protected form disclosure.\u201d <em>Forma-Pack, </em>351 Md. at 408, 718 A.2d 1129; <em>cf.

The notes themselves reveal which of the client\u2019s remarks the lawyer \u201c \u2018saw fit to write down\u2019 \u201d and are likely \u201c \u2018permeated with [the lawyer\u2019s] inferences.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hickman, </em>329 U.S. at 513, 67 S.Ct. 385; <em>id. </em>at 517, 67 S.Ct. 385 (Jackson, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The Supreme Court was careful to limit the doctrine\u2019s protections in the landmark decision of <em>Hickman, </em>329 U.S. at 511, 67 S.Ct. 385:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-7\">We do not mean to say that all written materials obtained or prepared by an adversary\u2019s counsel with an eye toward litigation are necessarily free from discovery in all cases. <em>Where relevant and non-privileged facts remain hidden in an attorney\u2019s file and where production of those facts is essential to the preparation of one\u2019s case, discovery may properly be had. </em>Such written statements and documents might, under certain circumstances, be admissible in evidence or give clues as to the existence or location of relevant facts. <em>Or they might be useful for purposes of impeachment or corroboration. </em>And production might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>justified where the witnesses are no longer available or can be reached only with difficulty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">(Emphasis added); <em>cf. Morris, </em>59 Md.App. at 669, 477 A.2d 1206 (concluding that the doctrine \u201cwas never intended to be an evidentiary privilege\u201d). The Supreme Court further elucidated the doctrine\u2019s protections in <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 225, 95 S.Ct. 2160. There, Robert Nobles was convicted on charges stemming from a bank robbery. The only evidence of consequence that linked Nobles to the crime was the identification testimony of two witnesses. \u201c[A]n investigator for the defense interviewed both witnesses and preserved the essence of those conversations in a written report.\u201d <em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 227, 95 S.Ct. 2160.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">At Nobles\u2019s subsequent trial, his counsel attempted to impeach the two eye-witnesses with information contained in the investigator\u2019s report. The prosecution sought disclosure of the relevant portions of the report. The district court ruled that it would only require disclosure of a court-edited report \u201cif the investigator testified as to the witnesses\u2019 alleged statements from the witness stand.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 228, 95 S.Ct. 2160. At the close of the Government\u2019s case, the defense called the investigator to the stand. When the defense indicated that it did not intend to produce the report, the court refused to allow the investigator to testify about his interviews with the witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">The Supreme Court upheld the lower court\u2019s ruling. <em>See id. </em>at 240, 95 S.Ct. 2160. The following discussion is relevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"afe-dedup-0\">[T]he defense proposed to call its investigator to impeach the identification testimony of the prosecution\u2019s eyewitnesses. It was evident from cross-examination that the investigator would testify that each witness\u2019 recollection of the appearance of the individual identified as respondent was considerably less clear at an earlier time than it was at trial. It also appeared that the investigator and one witness differed even as to what the witness told him during the interview. The investigator\u2019s contemporaneous report might provide critical insight into the issues of credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>that the investigator\u2019s testimony would raise. It could assist the jury in determining the extent to which the investigator\u2019s testimony actually discredited the prosecution\u2019s witnesses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-5\">It was therefore apparent to the trial judge that the investigator\u2019s report was highly relevant to the critical issue of credibility. In this context, production of the report might substantially enhance \u201cthe search for truth.\u201d We must determine whether compelling its production was precluded by some privilege available to the defense in the circumstances of this case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-6\"><em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 231-32, 95 S.Ct. 2160 (quoting <em>Williams v. Florida, </em>399 U.S. 78, 82, 90 S.Ct. 1893, 26 L.Ed.2d 446 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">Nobles argued that the work product doctrine protected the report from disclosure. In concluding that the doctrine\u2019s protection was unavailable, the Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-8\">[T]he work-product doctrine shelters the mental processes of the attorney, providing a privileged area within which he can analyze and prepare his client\u2019s case. But the doctrine is an intensely practical one, grounded in the realities of litigation in our adversary system.... [T]he concerns reflected in the work-product doctrine do not disappear once the trial has begun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-10\">The privilege derived from the work-product doctrine is not absolute. Like other qualified privileges, it may be waived. Here [Nobles] sought to adduce the testimony of the investigator and contrast his recollection of the contested statements with that of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses. [Nobles], by electing to present the investigator as a witness, waived the privilege with respect to the matters covered in his testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-11\"><em>Nobles, </em>422 U.S. at 238-39, 95 S.Ct. 2160. The Court subsequently stated in a footnote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>What constitutes a waiver with respect to work-product materials depends, of course, upon the circumstances. Counsel necessarily makes use throughout trial of the notes, documents, and other internal materials prepared to present adequately his client\u2019s case, and often relies on them in examining witnesses. When so used, there normally is no waiver. <em>But where, as here, counsel attempts to make a testimonial use of these materials the normal rules of evidence come into play with respect to cross-examination and production of documents.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 239 n. 14, 95 S.Ct. 2160 (emphasis added); <em>accord Martin Marietta, </em>856 F.2d at 624; <em>cf.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has stated that actions that are consistent with a \u201cconscious disregard of the advantage that is otherwise protected by the work product rule,\u201d may waive the doctrine\u2019s immunity. <em>Doe v. United States (In re John </em>Doe), 662 F.2d 1073, 1081 (4th Cir.1981) (stating also that \u201cto effect a forfeiture of the work product protection by waiver, disclosure must occur in circumstances in which the attorney cannot reasonably expect to limit the future use of the otherwise protected material\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>455 U.S. 1000, 102 S.Ct. 1632, 71 L.Ed.2d 867 (1982); <em>see Nutramax Lab., </em>183 F.R.D. at 463-64. The Fourth Circuit has interpreted <em>Nobles </em>to control situations involving \u201cnon-opinion work-product\u201d and \u201cheld that subject matter waiver applies to non-opinion work-product when testimonial use of non-opinion work-product is made.\u201d <em>Martin Marietta, </em>856 F.2d at 625 (discussing <em>Duplan Corp. v. Deering Milliken, Inc., </em>540 F.2d 1215, 1222-23 (4th Cir.1976)). The Court defined \u201csubject matter waiver\u201d as \u201cany disclosure of a confidential communication outside a privileged relationship,\u201d concluding that such disclosure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>waives \u201cthe privilege as to all information related to the same subject matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">In this case, appellant did not ask the court to allow him to fish through Gunning\u2019s files. Rather, his request was narrowly tailored; he sought production of those notes that were potentially important to effective cross-examination, and perhaps impeachment, of Gunning. The State cannot have it both ways. It cannot call Gunning to testify as to the consistency between Fleig\u2019s statements made during attorney-client interviews and Fleig\u2019s other statements, and then turn around and suggest that appellant was not entitled to see the witness\u2019s notes that contained the substance of the statements made during the interviews. Accordingly, we are of the view that any protection the work product doctrine may have afforded to Gunning\u2019s notes was waived when Gunning gave his so called consistency testimony about Fleig\u2019s statements during attorney-client interviews. Thus, under the circumstances attendant here, we conclude that the trial court erred in not allowing appellant to review the portions of Gunning\u2019s notes that pertained to statements Fleig made to Gunning about the occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">As noted, appellant also contends that the due process principles contained in <em>Carr v. State, </em>284 Md. at 472-73, 397 A.2d 606, bolster his claim that he was entitled to review Gunning\u2019s notes. In <em>Carr, </em>the Court of Appeals adopted tenets espoused in the Supreme Court\u2019s decision of <em>Jencks v. United States, </em>353 U.S. 657, 77 S.Ct. 1007, 1 L.Ed.2d 1103 (1957). \u201cThose principles relate to the importance of cross examination and the significance, to an accused, of determining whether a witness\u2019 trial testimony is inconsistent with the witness\u2019 prior written statement on the subject.\u201d <em>Robinson v. State, </em>354 Md. 287, 301, 730 A.2d 181 (1999); <em>see Butler v. State, </em>107 Md.App. 345, 356, 667 A.2d 999 (1995) (stating that in <em>Carr, </em>the Court \u201c \u2018first held that at trial, upon request, defense counsel must be permitted the opportunity to inspect prior statements of the State\u2019s witnesses for purposes of cross-examination\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Leonard v. State, </em>46 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Md.App. 631, 637, 421 A.2d 85 (1980) (concluding that under <em>Carr, </em>\u201ca defendant\u2019s right, at trial, to inspect the prior statement of a State\u2019s witness who has testified is not necessarily-limited (1) by the rules pertaining to pretrial discovery, or (2) to statements that are merely exculpatory\u201d), <em>aff'd, </em>290 Md. 295, 429 A.2d 538 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The State correctly points out that access to the prior statements of a State\u2019s witness under <em>Jencks-Carr </em>principles is contingent on the fact that the prosecutorial arm of the government possesses the statement. <em>See Robinson, </em>354 Md. at 304, 730 A.2d 181. It contends that \u201cthe notes kept in the file of Fleig\u2019s attorney, Gunning, were never in the possession of the State, constructively or otherwise.\u201d In view of our resolution of the work product issue, we need not resolve whether the State \u201cpossessed\u201d Gunning\u2019s notes for purposes of <em>Jencks-Carr </em>principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">IV. Harmless Error</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">The State argues expressly in its discussion of appellant\u2019s access to Gunning\u2019s notes, and implicitly in its analysis of the other issues, that any error in this case was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Appellant contends that the court erred on each of his three points and that each error individually requires reversal. As to whether the trial court\u2019s errors were harmless, we turn to the oft-cited standard provided in <em>Dorsey v. State, </em>276 Md. 638, 350 A.2d 665 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b637-8\">[W]hen an appellant, in a criminal case, establishes error, unless a reviewing court, upon its own independent review of the record, is able to declare a belief, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the error in no way influenced the verdict, such error cannot be deemed \u201charmless\u201d and a reversal is mandated. Such reviewing court must thus be satisfied that there is no reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of \u2014 whether erroneously admitted or excluded\u2014 may have contributed to the rendition of the guilty verdict.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b638-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 659, 350 A.2d 665; <em>see Jensen v. State, </em>355 Md. 692, 708-09, 736 A.2d 307 (1999); <em>Corbett, </em>130 Md.App. at 428-29, 746 A.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">The cumulative error in this case is not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Gunning\u2019s consistency testimony impermis-sibly bolstered Fleig\u2019s testimony. Admission of the transcript allowed for the reproduction to the jury of many \u201cprior consistent statements\u201d supporting Fleig\u2019s testimony. Finally, we are unable to determine the level of harm associated with the failure to allow appellant to review Gunning\u2019s interview notes, because the trial court denied appellant\u2019s request to place them in the record. Thus, we are constrained to vacate the judgment in this case and remand the matter to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">JUDGMENTS OF CONVICTION VACATED; CASE REMANDED TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE COUNTY FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.
