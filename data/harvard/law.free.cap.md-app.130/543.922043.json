We must decide whether the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County erred in issuing an injunction against Frank Lewis El Bey, appellant, based on a complaint by the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc. (the \u201cCorporation\u201d), appellee, seeking to enjoin appellant from holding himself out as an officer, director, agent or trustee of the Corporation. For the reasons that follow, we see no error, and affirm the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">Appellee is a religious corporation organized and incorporated in 1928 under the laws of the State of Illinois. Its founder, Noble Drew Ali, filed articles of incorporation with the appropriate department of the State of Illinois. In the articles, he designated certain named individuals as \u201csheiks,\u201d to serve in lieu of trastees. The Constitution and Bylaws, adopted in 1928, provided that the Grand Sheik and Chairman of the Corporation had the \u201cpower to make law and enforce laws with assistance of the Prophet[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] and Grand Body of the Moorish Science Temple of America.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b571-8\">In 1934, after the death of Drew Ali, the Corporation adopted rules and regulations for governance and succession of officers in the organization. These were embodied in a document titled \u201cRules and Regulations of the Moorish Science Temple of America and the Moorish Holy Temple of Science\u201d as set forth by \u201cThe Grand Body at the Seventh Annual Convention held at ... Chicago, Illinois, from September 15th to the 20th, 1934\u201d (\u201cRegulations\u201d). The Regulations designated fifteen persons as officers, including a \u201cSupreme Grand Advisor and Moderator,\u201d \u201cGrand Governors\u201d of several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>temples located in several different states, a treasurer, secretary and others.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The Regulations provided that: (1) \u201cAll Offices shall be declared vacant during each Annual Convention, which shall be held from September 15 th to the 20 th (inclusive) each year;\u201d (2) \u201cno one shall serve in an office after an Annual Convention unless he or she has been duly elected or reelected to such office,\u201d and (3) \u201cno official is eligible to fill an office unless he has proper Credentials; same having been issued by the Supreme Grand Advisor.\u201d The Regulations also declared that \u201c[t]he assemblage of the representatives of the various Temples through-out the United States; said assemblage being on the date set forth [herein] may be termed \u2018The Grand Body\u2019 or \u2018The Grand Major Temple.\u2019\u201d The Regulations further provided that \u201c[t]he Supreme Grand Advisor and Moderator alone shall issue Charters, Ordination Papers and Credentials.\u201d The Corporation continued to operate and be governed by these Regulations from 1934 to the present.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">On September 10, 1996, appellant sent a written memorandum (\u201cAnnouncement\u201d) to \u201cAll Governors, Grand Sheiks and Head Official [sic] of All Temples of America\u201d announcing, <em>inter alia, </em>that he had been</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-6\">appointed] as Trustee of the Express Trust created by the Prophet Noble Drew Ali; through fulfillment of that appointment, I have been vested with all authority and power of The Moorish Science Temple of America ... Accordingly, my office as Chief Executive Officer of The Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc. is effective immediately.... I will appoint by January 8, 1997, an Executive Council (Rulers) of which I will act as Chairman.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">In his written notification, appellant also stated that \u201ca similar Memorandum will be prepared and circulated among all\u201d members of the Corporation. He advised the recipients of the Announcement to \u201cconsult with your attorney concerning the issue of the trust ... or The Corporation\u2019s attorney, to get an informed, legal opinion and understanding of the trustor, trustee, and trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>On January 24, 1997, the Corporation filed a complaint seeking <em>ex parte, </em>interlocutory and permanent injunctions against appellant. Specifically, the Corporation sought to enjoin appellant from referring to himself as an officer, director, agent or trustee of the Corporation. Appellee alleged that appellant was fraudulently collecting money in the name of the Corporation, disseminating false and misleading information about his status as a trustee of the Corporation, and attempting to recruit others from the church base with the intent to cause the Corporation embarrassment and to tarnish its reputation and good name.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The circuit court issued the <em>ex parte </em>injunction based on the complaint and supporting documents. The court also issued a show cause order and set a hearing date.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">When appellant did not appear at the hearing on March 26, 1997, the court issued an interlocutory injunction that enjoined appellant \u201cfrom referring to himself as an officer, director, agent or trustee for or of\u2019 the Corporation during the pen-dency of the case. Appellant\u2019s first pleading in the case was a motion to dissolve the interlocutory injunction filed on April 25, 1997. After a trial on the merits on January 6, 1999, the court granted a permanent injunction against appellant, \u201crestraining and enjoining him from representing himself as an agent, officer and/or trustee for or of the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc.\u201d This appeal was timely noted.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">Appellant asks us to decide: 1) whether the circuit court had authority to resolve the religious dispute presented in light of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution; 2) whether the requisite likelihood of damage to appellee in order to justify an injunction against appellant was demonstrated; and 3) whether the court, in ordering the injunction, failed to properly apply the term \u201ctrustee\u201d in the sense the term was used by appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The circuit court had authority to resolve this legal dispute involving a religious organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">Appellant first argues that the circuit court lacked authority to resolve the dispute presented because of its ecclesiastical nature. We disagree that the conflict is purely ecclesiastical and hold that the order issued by the circuit court addressed only the secular aspects of the dispute between the parties, which were resolved by neutral, secular principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">i.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">General Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">It is well established that generally courts have no authority to resolve religious disputes. <em>See Mount Olive African Methodist Episcopal Church of Fruitland, Inc. v. Board of Incorporators of the African Methodist Episcopal Church Inc., </em>348 Md. 299, 309, 703 A.2d 194 (1997). \u201c \u2018Such matters \u201cmust be left with the authorities of the church or denomination who have the power ... to consider and determine upon them.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Polen v. Cox, </em>259 Md. 25, 31-32, 267 A.2d 201 (1970), in turn quoting <em>Shaeffer v. Klee, </em>100 Md. 264, 271, 59 A. 850 (1905)). We recognize, however, that \u201cthere might be some circumstances in which marginal civil court review of ecclesiastical determinations would be appropriate.\u201d <em>Presbyterian Church in the U.S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Mem\u2019l Presbyterian Church, </em>393 U.S. 440, 447, 89 S.Ct. 601, 605, 21 L.Ed.2d 658 (1969); <em>Mount Olive, </em>348 Md. at 310, 703 A.2d 194 (holding that although Maryland courts should not enter into a \u2018theological thicket,\u2019 \u201c[t]his does not mean ... that the courts may not resolve any issue in which a church or denomination is a party.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-10\">In avoiding the \u201creligious thicket\u201d we must be cautious not to deprive religious organizations of <em>all </em>recourse which is available to all others. This would leave religious organizations at the mercy of anyone who appropriated their property with an assertion of religious right to it. <em>See Maryland and Virginia Eldership of the Churches of God v. Church of God at </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number><em>Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>249 Md. 650, 661, 241 A.2d 691 (1968) <em>(Eldership I </em>).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The Supreme Court has held that a court may resolve property disputes by applying secular principles of property, trust, and corporate law when the instruments upon which those principles operate are at hand. <em>See Maryland and Virginia Eldership of the Churches of God v. Church of God at Sharpsburg, Inc., </em>396 U.S. 367, 90 S.Ct. 499, 24 L.Ed.2d 582 (1970). The Supreme Court has explained several advantages of this approach:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-6\">The primary advantages of the neutral-principles approach are that it is completely secular in operation, and yet flexible enough to accommodate all forms of religious organization and polity. The method relies exclusively on objective, well-established concepts of ... law familiar to lawyers and judges. It thereby promises to free civil courts completely from entanglements in questions of religious doctrine, polity, and practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b575-7\"><em>Jones v. Wolf, </em>443 U.S. 595, 603, 99 S.Ct. 3020, 3025, 61 L.Ed.2d 775 (1979). These advantages were deemed substantial enough in <em>Jones </em>to permit the state court to decide the property dispute by neutral principles even though the outcome might contravene the decision of the hierarchical church. <em>See id. </em>at 604-06, 99 S.Ct. at 3026-27.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">In the instant case, the relief ordered by the circuit court required no inquiry into religious doctrine, and could be resolved by neutral secular principles because it addressed the protection of a property interest of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-9\">ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-10\">Threshold Requirement: Judicially-Protectable Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">The threshold requirement for application of the neutral-principles doctrine is that there be a \u201cjudicially-protecta-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>ble interest.\u201d <em>Ardito v. Board of Trustees, Our Lady of Fatima Chapel, </em>281 N.J.Super. 459, 658 A.2d 827, 331 (1995)(quoting <em>Chavis v. Rowe, </em>93 N.J. 103, 459 A.2d 674 (1983)). The property interest at issue here is appellee\u2019s interest in its name and the good will associated with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Although the record does not reflect whether appellee owned specific real or tangible personal property, a property interest entitled to protection is not limited to real or tangible personal property. The leading case of <em>American Gold Star Mothers, Inc., v. National Gold Star Mothers, Inc., </em>191 F.2d 488 (D.C.Cir.1951) explained that the property interest of a nonprofit corporation entitled to protection includes the corporation\u2019s interest in its good name:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b576-6\">Source, reputation, and good will are as important to eleemosynary institutions as they are to business organizations. \u2018Anything which tends to divert membership or gifts of members from them injures them with respect to their financial condition in the same way that a business corporation is injured by diversion of trade or custom.\u2019 \u2018Distinct identity is just as important to such an organization, oftentimes, as it is to a commercial company. Its financial credit \u2014 its ability to raise funds, its general reputation, the reputation of those managing and supporting it, are all at stake if its name is used by some other organization and the two become confused in the minds of the public.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b576-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 489 (citations omitted). <em>Accord, Pilgrim Holiness Church v. First Pilgrim Holiness Church, </em>115 Ill.App.2d 448, 252 N.E.2d 1, 7 (1969) (the right to protection of the good will in one\u2019s name extends to nonprofit organizations); <em>see also Purcell v. Summers, </em>126 F.2d 390, 394 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>317 U.S. 640, 63 S.Ct. 32, 87 L.Ed. 516 (1942); <em>National Board of the Young Women\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n v. Young Women\u2019s Christian Ass\u2019n of Charleston, S.C., </em>335 F.Supp. 615, 621 (D.S.C.1971); 37 A.L.R.3d 277, 27 A.L.R.2d 954.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">In the present case, appellee has an interest in protecting its good name as a stable religious organization with an orderly mode of government and succession of leaders. Testi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>mony at the hearing revealed that appellee had maintained continuous corporate existence since 1928, and had followed specific procedures for election of officers since 1934. It operates more than 300 temples located in various cities in the United States. Mr. Robert Love El, the representative of the Corporation at the hearing, testified that he had been its chief executive officer for twenty-seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">iii.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Threatened Injury to Property Interest</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">Appellant\u2019s actions and threatened actions jeopardized the continuation of appellee\u2019s good name in several ways. He proclaimed himself to be the chief executive officer of the Corporation, when the Regulations and established custom since 1934 required that all officers be elected at the Corporation\u2019s annual convention. He announced that the Regulations, although adopted more than fifty years ago, were invalid because they deviated from the true intent of the original prophet, who died in 1929.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">Appellant sent his Announcement to Corporation leaders throughout the country, and threatened to send it to all members, who, presumably, constitute the ongoing financial support for the Corporation. All of these actions had the potential for destroying the Corporation\u2019s name as a stable religious organization with an orderly government and succession process. Such reputation was significant to the Corporation\u2019s ability to retain its members, and raise money from its membership for its continued operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-10\">Application of Neutral Secular Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">We held in <em>Seat Pleasant Baptist Church Bd. of Trustees v. Long, </em>114 Md.App. 660, 676, 691 A.2d 721 (1997), that a court may, under the neutral-principles doctrine, interpret the bylaws and constitution of a church in determining whether an election of a board of trustees occurred. A similar judicial process is required in this case. The order issued by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>circuit court did not purport to resolve any dispute over religious doctrine. It simply restrained appellant from holding himself out as an officer, trustee, or agent of the Corporation. Corporate and contract law principles can be applied to determine whether appellant had been selected as a director or trustee of the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Although appellant disputes the validity, on ecclesiastical grounds, of the 1934 Regulations, he does not dispute that these Regulations were, in fact, adopted by the members of the Corporation in 1934. Nor does he dispute that these Regulations were the method utilized by the members since 1934 as the means for electing the successor to the prophet and other officers. Specifically, appellant testified that the presidency of Love El \u201cevolved out of a system that was created, adopted and imposed upon the Moorish Science Temple of America, Inc. in 1934.\u201d The basis of appellant\u2019s attack on the Regulations is best expressed by quoting his Memorandum filed in support of his Motion to Dissolve Injunction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIJ\">[Love El] has no \u2018real authority.\u2019 The rules and regulations of 1934 do not supersede, add to, or alter the founder\u2019s structure or authority established in 1928.... The system adopted in 1934 to select R. Love El to that office was not prescribed by the founder ... nor was it arrived at from the original structure established by the founder.... R. Love El\u2019s office was born out of misunderstanding. (It was makeshift, despite existing for over 60 years; a system to make do until the truth regarding the founder\u2019s structure was revealed ...). That process has been maintained from 1934 until the present primarily by customs....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">The validity of appellant\u2019s claim to the status of a corporate officer can be determined on secular grounds based on the historical adoption, consistent use, and actual text of the Regulations. The Regulations, in \u201cAct I,\u201d provide that all \u201c[o]ffices shall be declared vacant during each Annual convention,\u201d which was to be held between September 15 and 20 of each year. \u201cAct 2\u201d provides that officers must be \u201cduly elected.\u201d The Grand Body, which includes \u201cthe assemblage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>the representatives of the various Temples throughout the United States\u201d, would elect the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Appellant makes no claim that he was <em>elected </em>as an officer, trustee, or agent of appellee. Rather, he claims that his power as the chief executive officer is derived from an \u201cexpress trust\u201d created by the Corporation\u2019s founder, Drew Ali, who died in 1929, years before appellant was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The trial court asked appellant repeatedly for documentary evidence of this \u201cexpress trust\u201d or any tangible evidence that such trust had been created, but appellant was not able to produce any supporting documents. Nor did he explain how the \u201cexpress trust\u201d was communicated to him by Drew Ali. Nor did he present any witness other than himself to testify in support of the existence of an \u201cexpress trust\u201d giving him all secular power over the Corporation and its assets. When the court questioned him as to his standing and the basis of his position that he is a trustee, appellant answered \u201c[b]ecause the trust that was created by the prophet in 1928 was reposed in me and I received the trust, deeds, and rudiments of title in 1978.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>Because appellee is an Illinois corporation, issues involving its internal corporate affairs are governed by Illinois law. <em>See </em>W. Fletcher, <em>Cyclopedia of the Law of Private Corporations </em>\u00a7 5:03 at 561-62 (1988 Rev. Vol.). The Illinois Religious Corporation Act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\">The successor of the presiding officer of any ecclesiastical body ... shall, by virtue of his office, be for the time being a trustee of such corporation in place of his predecessor, and when the office of any other trustee becomes vacant, his successor shall be appointed in the manner provided for in the original selection. The number, term of office, and the qualifications of the trustees of any such corporation, may be determined by the usages, customs, rules, regulations, articles of association, constitution, bylaws or canons of the ecclesiastical body....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">805 Ill. Comp. Stat. 110/46c (West 1999). Another section of the Illinois statute provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-7\">All elections of trustees after the first, and elections to fill vacancies, may be called and conducted upon such notice and in such manner as may be provided by the rules, usages or by-laws of the congregation, church or society.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 110/39.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">The Illinois statute provides the neutral principles upon which to base a decision in this case. Applying that statute, we see that appellant can readily be determined not to qualify as the chief executive officer of the Corporation because he was not selected by election, as called for in the Regulations and by undisputed custom since 1934. Further, appellant does not qualify as a trustee of the Corporation because both the Regulations and the historical customs of appellee dictate that sheiks, the Corporation\u2019s name for its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>trustees, shall be elected at the annual convention of the Corporation by representatives of each temple. In the absence of any evidence that appellant was elected to the offices that he claims to hold, the trial court was justified in concluding, based on neutral secular principles, that he was not an officer, trustee, or agent of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">v.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">The Trial Court\u2019s Examination of Religious Documents</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Appellant argues that the court improperly entered the \u201ctheological thicket\u201d when it examined religious documents to determine whether the prophet Drew Ali had intended the creation of any trust in favor of appellant, and concluded that he had, not. We do not agree. After examining the record, we conclude that, while the trial court examined and evaluated various documents that were the writings of the founder and prophet, Drew Ali, it did so only for a secular purpose: to determine whether Drew Ali had expressed in those documents the intent to create a trust in appellant, as that term is used in a secular context.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Appellant introduced certain documents for the court to consider as evidence of a trust in appellee. The first item was the articles of incorporation for the Corporation. The court observed that the articles indicated the same information that Mr. Love El had testified to \u2014 that there were no trustees and that the founder of the Temple did not name any trustees\u2014 expressly contradicting what appellant was arguing. The court characterized the founder\u2019s action as taking \u201cthe form of this deed and expressly lin[ing] out [the word] trustee and put[ting] in its place the word \u2018sheik.\u2019 \u201d The court concluded that this document \u201cexpressly eliminates trustee[s].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The second document appellant offered to prove that there is a trust and he is the trustee was the <em>Holy Koran. </em>The court read the specific sections designated by appellant into the record and stated: \u201cThere isn\u2019t a word in those 10 verses that says anything or indicates anything about a trustee.\u201d Appellant next offered a religious pamphlet and directed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>court to read a specific section, which the <em>court </em>did, on the record. Again the court pointed out that there was no evidence of any sort of a trust in the document. Appellant then introduced several other pieces of literature, all of which pertinent portions the court read into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">In its oral opinion, the court first defined an express trust, \u201cbecause there seems to be a misunderstanding as to exactly what an express trust is.\u201d The court then found that \u201cthere is absolutely no indication that the founder of this movement ever intended a trust of anything. To me, his writings are clear, lucid, plain to the understanding for anyone who wants to read them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">Both the court\u2019s observations as it examined the documents and the narrow order that it signed, convince us that the trial court, in its analysis of the religious documents, was looking to see whether Drew Ali had created a secular property interest in appellant by the use of the term \u201ctrust\u201d or \u201ctrustee.\u201d The order was narrowly drafted, and contained no directive regarding ecclesiastical doctrine. It simply determined that appellant was not a trustee, director, or agent of the Corporation in the secular context of the law governing the organization. There is no indication in the record that the trial court examined these documents in order to make any ecclesiastical interpretation, or intended any ecclesiastical interpretation or directive by its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">The circuit court did not abuse its discretion in granting injunctive relief to the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">Appellant argues that the trial court abused its discretion in entering an injunction because no evidence was presented that his actions caused any damage or injury to the Corporation. Appellee counters this, and contends that the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that appellant was fraudulently holding himself out as an officer or \u201ctrustee\u201d of the Corporation and that this caused irreparable harm to the good will and good name of the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>The granting or denying of a request for injunctive relief rests within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>See Lerner v. Lerner, </em>306 Md. 771, 776, 511 A.2d 501 (1986). Injunctive relief will not be granted unless there is a finding of irreparable harm or threat thereof. <em>See Campbell v. Mayor &amp; Aldermen of City of Annapolis, </em>44 Md.App. 525, 536, 409 A.2d 1111 (1980), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>289 Md. 300, 424 A.2d 738 (1981). \u201c[Ijrreparable injury is suffered whenever monetary damages are difficult to ascertain or are otherwise inadequate.\u201d Mary<em>land\u2014N</em>at\u2019l <em>Capital Park and Planning Comm\u2019n v. Washington Nat\u2019l Arena, </em>282 Md. 588, 616, 386 A.2d 1216 (1978). Furthermore, courts have the power to grant injunctive relief to prevent or prohibit a threat of harm that has not yet occurred. <em>See Leatherbury v. Peters, </em>24 Md.App. 410, 412, 332 A.2d 41, <em>aff\u2019d, </em>276 Md. 367, 347 A.2d 826 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">Issuance of an injunction is reviewed by this Court under the abuse of discretion standard. <em>See State Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Mental Hygiene v. Baltimore County, </em>281 Md. 548, 554, 383 A.2d 51 (1977); <em>Antwerpen Dodge, Ltd. v. Herb Gordon Auto World, Inc., </em>117 Md.App. 290, 305, 699 A.2d 1209, <em>cert. denied, </em>347 Md. 681, 702 A.2d 290 (1997). This standard applies to the trial court\u2019s determinations of legal questions or conclusions of law based upon its findings of fact. Those rulings will not be disturbed absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion. <em>See Maryland Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Downey Communications, Inc., </em>110 Md.App. 493, 521, 678 A.2d 55 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">As indicated previously, when questioned directly by the court as to his standing and the basis of his position that he was named as trustee by an express trust created by Drew Ali, appellant was unable to identify any writing to support this claim, or even explain how, in the absence of a writing, the trust was communicated to him over sixty years after the founder\u2019s death. Nor did any other witness testify in support of the existence of such trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Mr. Love El testified that he held the title of the \u201cGrand Sheik\u201d of the Corporation, and had been in this position for the last twenty-seven years. He said that the prophet, Drew Ali, incorporated the Corporation in Illinois and appointed officials whom he designated as \u201csheiks and sheikess[es]\u201d \u201cinstead of calling them \u2018trustees.\u2019 \u201d He further testified that the title \u201ctrustee\u201d was not used, had never been used, and in fact there was absolutely no provision for a \u201ctrustee\u201d in the organization. Mr. Love El explained that he is the fourth successor of the head of the organization, and that his position is an elected position. Elections are held annually. He testified that appellant had never held any office in the organization. He testified that appellant\u2019s actions continue to damage the Corporation\u2019s reputation. He further stated that the \u201cprophet didn\u2019t transfer any land by deed ... and that [any] property was to be in the name of [the Corporation] and no individual\u2019s name.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We addressed in section I the nature of the property interest in its good name and reputation that appellee sought to protect by requesting an injunction in this case. The principles mentioned there regarding the value to a nonprofit corporation of its name and good will also refute appellant\u2019s argument that there was no sufficient injury or threatened injury to appellee to justify the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">Appellant argues that appellee never proved that appellant had actually solicited funds in the name of the Corporation. While we agree that there was no proof of actual solicitation, there was proof that he threatened to do so. In his Announcement, appellant specifically requested of the recipients: \u201cI pray that you join in and support our actions morally, [and] financially____\u201d By stating that he intended to send a similar announcement to the members of the Corporation, he thus threatened to solicit funds from the Corporation\u2019s membership. This threat by appellant to solicit funds in the name of the Corporation was in itself a sufficient basis to justify the injunction entered against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>For these reasons, we conclude that the court acted within its discretion in determining that the Corporation has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable harm from appellant\u2019s false representation of himself as the chief executive officer of the Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">The circuit court did not err in refusing to consider the religious meaning of \u201ctrustee\u201d when determining the merits of appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Lastly, appellant argues that the circuit court erred in refusing to consider the religious meaning of the term \u201ctrustee\u201d that he relied upon in asserting his right to serve as the chief executive and presiding officer of appellee. Appellant, by this argument, complains about the court failing to do precisely what he simultaneously asserts that court cannot do. As previously discussed in section I, <em>supra, </em>\u201cMaryland courts ... have no authority to resolve religious disputes.\u201d <em>Mount Olive, </em>348 Md. at 309, 703 A.2d 194. The trial judge neither was legally permitted nor required to review the documents in evidence to discern the existence of a religious meaning for the term \u201ctrustee.\u201d It did not do so in its analysis or in its order. Accordingly, the circuit court acted properly in refraining from any ruling on any religious doctrine which may have been implicated under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY APPELLANT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-9\">. The term \"prophet\u201d apparently has been used since 1928 to refer to Noble Drew Ali.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-12\">. The Supreme Court vacated the judgment in <em>Maryland and Virginia Eldership, </em>and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals.
