He was sentenced to concurrent terms of ten years, to be served without the possibility of parole, for each of the possession with intent to distribute convictions. The remaining convictions were merged. Appellant noted a timely appeal and presents the following questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>I. Was the evidence sufficient to support appellant\u2019s convictions for possession with intent to distribute?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-5\">II. Did the trial court impose an illegal sentence?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">On the morning of August 1, 1997, Baltimore City Police Officer Mark Holmen and his partner, Kurt Roepke, were on uniformed bicycle patrol. At approximately 10:00 a.m., the officers were in the 1900 block of Castle Street when Officer Holmen observed a group of about five people in the backyard area of the 2000 block of Cliftwood, which faces Castle Street. At trial, the officer described it as \u201ca high drug area.\u201d The individuals he saw were yelling \u201cFive-O,\u201d which he explained was \u201ca street term used to notify the criminal element that the police are in the area.\u201d As the officers traveled down the street, Officer Holmen observed twenty-five to thirty individuals \u201cscattering\u201d and \u201c[dispersing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">When Officer Holmen looked down the street, he observed a man, later identified as appellant, standing in front of 1909 North Castle Street and holding a plastic bag that contained a white substance. The officer estimated that he was thirty feet from appellant at that time. Officer Holmen pointed out appellant to Officer Roepke, and the officers proceeded toward him. As the officers approached appellant, he got on his hands and knees and reached into the basement window, which was missing the glass, of the vacant house located at 1909 North Castle Street. When the officers were only several feet from appellant, Officer Holmen observed that appellant\u2019s left hand was inside the basement window of the vacant house.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Officer Roepke, who testified as an expert in narcotics enforcement investigation, stated that he observed appellant \u201cput his hand on the corner and then reach[ ] both hands through the window.\u201d The officer further stated that the vacant house was full of trash and debris and that he saw appellant pull up a carpet and place a plastic bag underneath it. From underneath the carpet, Officer Roepke recovered a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>plastic bag containing two green-topped vials of a white rock-like substance that the officers suspected was cocaine. Officer Roepke then checked where appellant had placed his hand \u201cup in the window sill\u201d at the corner and recovered a bag that contained forty-three gel capsules and fifty red-topped vials. Subsequent laboratory analysis determined that the gel capsules contained heroin and that the green-topped and red-topped vials contained cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Officer Roepke further testified that the different colors on the vial tops could indicate a different seller or different tester. He explained that, on the first of the month, when individuals receive their paychecks, distributors may give out a small sample of their product. The officer further stated that the quantities of forty-three gel capsules and fifty-two vials were consistent with distribution and not personal use.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">In the defense case, Angela Proctor testified that she was with appellant on the morning in question. According to Ms. Proctor, she was standing with appellant when the police rode by two times on their bikes. On the third trip, the police stopped, got off their bikes, and looked in the window at 1909 Castle Street. One of the officers then approached appellant and escorted him up the street. An officer pulled the bags out of the window and appellant was arrested. Ms. Proctor testified that she had not seen appellant go to the window.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">Appellant first contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his convictions for possession with intent to distribute, as the State failed to establish that he was aware of the second bag of drugs that contained forty-three gel capsules of heroin and fifty red-topped vials of cocaine. He stresses that Officer Roepke did not see him in possession of that bag, that the area is known for a high concentration of drugs, that the vacant house was full of trash and debris, and that the drugs were not in plain view. Appellant also relies on Officer Roepke\u2019s testimony that different sellers use different colored <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>vials and emphasizes that, although the officers observed him in possession of the baggie containing two green-topped vials, the second bag contained red-topped vials. Appellant concedes his possession of the two green-topped vials of cocaine but claims there was no evidence that he was attempting to sell or distribute them because the officers did not observe him engaging in any hand-to-hand transactions and no money, pager, or tally sheets were found on his person when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">At the close of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for judgment of acquittal, stating only: \u201cWe\u2019ll make a motion on all counts, Your Honor, and submit.\u201d At the close of all the evidence, defense counsel again moved for judgment and stated: \u201cWe would renew the motion and submit.\u201d No argument was presented in support of the motion; therefore, the sufficiency of the evidence is not properly before us. <em>See Johnson v. State, </em>90 Md.App. 638, 649, 602 A.2d 255 (1992) (citing <em>Brooks v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 604, 611, 515 A.2d 225 (1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>308 Md. 382, 519 A.2d 1283 (1987)) (\u201ca motion which merely asserts that evidence is insufficient to support a conviction, without specifying the deficiency, does not comply with Rule 4-324, and thus does not preserve the issue of sufficiency for appellate review\u201d); <em>Parker v. State, </em>72 Md.App. 610, 615, 531 A.2d 1313 (1987) (\u201c[Mjoving for judgment of acquittal on the grounds of insufficiency of the evidence, without argument, does not preserve the issue for appellate review.\u201d). Nonetheless, we briefly address appellant\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The standard for our review of the sufficiency of the evidence is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979); <em>Wilson v. State, </em>319 Md. 530, 535, 573 A.2d 831 (1990). The jury, as the trier of fact, may \u201c \u2018draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Barnhard v. State, </em>86 Md.App. 518, 532, 587 A.2d 561 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>(1991), <em>aff'd, </em>325 Md. 602, 602 A.2d 701 (1992) (quoting <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979)). Weighing the credibility of the witnesses and resolving any conflicts in the evidence are tasks proper for the fact finder. <em>See Binnie v. State, </em>321 Md. 572, 580, 583 A.2d 1037 (1991). In performing its fact finding role, the jury is free to accept the evidence that it believes and reject that which it does not. <em>See Muir v. State, </em>64 Md.App. 648, 654, 498 A.2d 666 (1985), <em>aff'd, </em>308 Md. 208, 517 A.2d 1105 (1986). \u201cIn this regard, it may believe one witness\u2019s testimony, but disbelieve another witness\u2019s testimony.\u201d <em>Shand v. State, </em>103 Md. App. 465, 489, 653 A.2d 1000 (1995), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>341 Md. 661, 672 A.2d 630 (1996); <em>see also Snyder v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 533, 549-50, 657 A.2d 342, <em>cert. denied, </em>340 Md. 216, 665 A.2d 1058 (1995) (stating that a jury resolves conflicts in evidence and evaluates witness\u2019s credibility).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\"> To support a conviction for a possessory offense, the \u201c \u2018evidence must show directly or support a rational inference that the accused did in fact exercise some dominion or control over the prohibited ... drug in the sense contemplated by the statute, <em>i.e., </em>that [the accused] exercised some restraining or directing influence over it.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Leach, </em>296 Md. 591, 595-96, 463 A.2d 872 (1983) (quoting <em>Garrison v. State, </em>272 Md. 123, 142, 321 A.2d 767 (1974)). \u201cThe accused, in order to be found guilty, must know of both the presence and the general character or illicit nature of the substance. Of course, such knowledge can be proven by circumstantial evidence and by inferences drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 651, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The following factors may be considered in determining whether appellant possessed the second bag of drugs:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A1T\">\u201c1) proximity between the defendant and the contraband; 2) the fact that the contraband was within the plain view or otherwise within the knowledge of the defendant; 3) ownership or some possessory right in the premises or automobile in which the contraband is found; and 4) the presence of circumstances from which a reasonable inference could be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>drawn that the defendant was participating with others in the mutual enjoyment of the contraband.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b168-6\"><em>Kostelec v. State, 112 </em>Md.App. 656, 672, 685 A.2d 1222 (1996), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>348 Md. 230, 703 A.2d 160 (1997) (quoting <em>Rich v. State, </em>93 Md.App. 142, 150, 611 A.2d 1034 (1992), <em>vacated and remanded on other grounds, </em>331 Md. 195, 627 A.2d 537 (1993) (citing <em>Folk v. State, </em>11 Md.App. 508, 514, 275 A.2d 184 (1971))).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">In the present case, the officers observed appellant in close proximity to the second bag of drugs. Officer Roepke testified that he recovered the second bag from the area where appellant had placed his hand at the corner of the window sill. This evidence sufficiently connected appellant to the second bag of drugs. In addition, although the vials in the bag that the officers observed in appellant\u2019s hand and that they found in the second bag had different colored tops, Officer Roepke testified that the color change may indicate a different tester as distributors give out samples of their product. It was adequately demonstrated that appellant was aware of the second bag of drugs and that the quantity of drugs recovered was consistent with distribution and not personal use; therefore, the evidence was sufficient to sustain appellant\u2019s convictions for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and heroin. <em>See Hippler v. State, </em>83 Md.App. 325, 338, 574 A.2d 348, <em>cert. denied, </em>321 Md. 67, 580 A.2d 1077 (1990) (quoting <em>Salzman v. State, </em>49 Md.App. 25, 55, 430 A.2d 847, <em>cert. denied, </em>291 Md. 781 (1981)) (\u201c[ijntent to distribute controlled dangerous substances is \u2018seldom proved directly, but is more often found by drawing inferences from facts proved which reasonably indicate under all the circumstances the existence of the required intent.\u2019 Likewise, an intent to distribute may be indicated by the very quantity of narcotics possessed.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">Appellant next claims that the trial court erred in imposing sentences of ten years without the possibility of parole under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl.Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c), for each of the possession with intent to distribute convictions. Appellant was convicted of violating a controlled dangerous substance law in 1991. Appellant contends that under <em>Thomas v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 461, 656 A.2d 799 (1995), he could be sentenced to an enhanced penalty for his second conviction only and, thus, only one 10-year non-parolable sentence could be imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The State claims that imposition of an enhanced sentence for each of the possession with intent to distribute convictions is permissible under the dictates of <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995), and that <em>Thomas </em>is factually distinguishable from appellant\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Although appellant did not object to thfe sentence imposed, we may reach this question as an enhanced penalty imposed improperly is an illegal sentence. <em>See Bowman v. State, </em>314 Md. 725, 727, 738, 552 A.2d 1303 (1989) (erroneous mandatory sentence that fails for a lack of proof of prior conviction is illegal); <em>Walczak v. State, </em>302 Md. 422, 427, 488 A.2d 949 (1985) (\u201cwhen the trial court has allegedly imposed a sentence not permitted by law, the issue should ordinarily be reviewed on direct appeal even if no objection was made in the trial court\u201d); <em>see also Butler v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 317, 322, 416 A.2d 773, <em>cert. denied, </em>288 Md. 743 (1980) (finding that although appellant did not object to proof at sentencing or findings of trial court that he fell within ambit of \u00a7 643B(c), \u201cmanifest injustice would result if we do not review the issue\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">Appellant was sentenced under Md.Code (1957, 1996 Repl. Vol., 1999 Cum.Supp.), Art. 27, \u00a7 286(c)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(c) <em>Sentencing. </em>\u2014 (1) A person who is convicted under subsection (b)(l)[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] or subsection (b)(2)[3] of this section, or of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 10 years and subject to a fine not exceeding $100,000 if the person previously has been convicted:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-4\">(i) Under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">(ii) Of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-6\">(iii) Of an offense under the laws of another state, the District of Columbia, or the United States that would be a violation of subsection(b)(l) or subsection (b)(2) of this section if committed in this State.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-7\">(2) The prison sentence of a person sentenced under subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section, or of conspiracy to violate subsection (b)(1) or subsection (b)(2) of this section or any combination of these offenses, as a second offender may not be suspended to less than 10 years, and the person may be paroled during that period only in accordance with \u00a7 4-305 of the Correctional Services Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent. <em>Montgomery County v. Buckman, </em>333 Md. 516, 523, 636 A.2d 448 (1994); <em>Comptroller v. Jameson, </em>332 Md. 723, 732, 633 A.2d 93 (1993). \u201cThe starting point in statutory interpretation is with an examination of the language of the statute. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d <em>Jones v. State, </em>336 Md. 255, 261, 647 A.2d 1204 (1994) (citations omitted). Stated another way, \u201c[w]hen the words of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>statute are clear and unambiguous, we need not go further.\u201d <em>State v. Thompson, </em>332 Md. 1, 7, 629 A.2d 731 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\u201cLanguage can be regarded as ambiguous in two different respects: 1) it may be intrinsically unclear ...; or 2) its intrinsic meaning may be fairly clear, but its application to a particular object or circumstance may be uncertain.\u201d <em>Town &amp; Country v. Comcast Cablevision, </em>70 Md.App. 272, 280, 520 A.2d 1129, <em>cert. denied, </em>310 Md. 2, 526 A.2d 954 (1987). \u201cThat a term may be free from ambiguity when used in one context but of doubtful application in another context is well settled.\u201d <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 74, 517 A.2d 730 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Section 286(c)(1) requires imposition of a sentence of not less than 10 years upon a person \u201cconvicted\u201d under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) or for conspiracy to violate those subsections if the person has the required predicate conviction. Dropping down to subsection (c)(2), we are informed that the 10-year sentence may not be suspended and that it is, in essence, without parole.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Subsection (c)(2) begins with the words, \u201cThe sentence of a person.... \u201d The \u201csentence\u201d is singular even though it may apply to \u201cany combination\u201d of the applicable \u201coffenses.\u201d In common everyday language, \u201csentence\u201d may refer to a sentence imposed on a single count or the number of years to be served when all sentences are totaled. Furthermore, the enhanced penalty applies only to a \u201csecond offender.\u201d The phrase is not defined, and we are left to question whether it covers only <em>the </em>second conviction or all convictions arising from a course of conduct that happens to be the defendant\u2019s second criminal episode involving the relevant drug charges. Accordingly, we must conclude that the statute, as applied to the circumstances before us, is unclear and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>\u201cIf a statute is clouded by ambiguity or obscurity, ... we must consider \u2018not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives and purpose of the enactment,\u2019 in our attempt to discern the construction that will best further the legislative objectives or goals.\u201d <em>Gargliano v. State, </em>334 Md. 428, 436, 639 A.2d 675 (1994) (quoting <em>Tucker v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co., </em>308 Md. 69, 75, 517 A.2d 730 (1986)). In addition, \u201ccourts must read all parts of a statute together, with a view toward harmonizing the various parts and avoiding both inconsistencies and senseless results that could not reasonably have been intended by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Barr v. State, </em>101 Md.App. 681, 687, 647 A.2d 1293 (1994); <em>see also Williams v. State, </em>329 Md. 1, 15-16, 616 A.2d 1275 (1992) (stating that the court must discern \u201clegislative intent from the entire statutory scheme, as opposed to scrutinizing parts of a statute in isolation\u201d); <em>Calhoun v.

Section 286(c) must also be considered in light of the construction the appellate courts of this State \u201chave previously given to similarly worded enhanced penalty statutes, as \u2018statutes that deal with the same subject matter, share a common purpose, and form part of the same system are <em>in pari materia </em>and must be construed harmoniously in order to give full effect to each enactment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gargliano, </em>334 Md. at 436, 639 A.2d 675 (quoting <em>State v.

State, </em>324 Md. 163, 172, 596 A.2d 648 (1991)). \u201cAn ambiguous penal statute is subject to the \u2018rule of lenity,\u2019 which requires that such statutes be strictly construed against the State and in favor of the defendant.\u201d <em>Gardner v. State, </em>344 Md. 642, 651, 689 A.2d 610 (1997); <em>see also Calhoun, </em>46 Md.App. at 488, 418 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>A.2d 1241 (\u201cIn construing a penal statute and in resolving a dispute over the severity of the penalty, a presumption arises in favor of the lesser penalty over the greater one.\u201d). \u201cIn the area of statutory enhanced penalties ... when we are uncertain whether the Legislature intended to authorize the imposition of an enhanced penalty in a particular situation, the presumption must be that the Legislature did not intend to do so.\u201d <em>Gargliano, </em>334 Md. at 449, 639 A.2d 675; <em>see also Gardner, </em>344 Md. at 651, 689 A.2d 610 (1997) (quoting <em>Monoker v.

Under the rule of lenity, only one enhanced penalty may be imposed under \u00a7 286(c) when there are multiple convictions arising from a single indictment or case.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">The enhanced penalty may only be imposed upon the second conviction, and while either of appellant\u2019s possession with intent to distribute convictions so qualify, we conclude that both do not qualify. Prior cases addressing the imposition of enhanced penalties support this conclusion and lead us to believe that, although the statute is inartfully worded, the Legislature intended to impose only one enhanced penalty per criminal episode.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">We begin by examining the meaning of \u201csecond offender.\u201d In <em>Calhoun v. State, </em>46 Md.App. 478, 418 A.2d 1241 (1980), this Court addressed the meaning of \u201cthird conviction\u201d in \u00a7 643B(c), which allows for a term of not less than twenty-five years, none of which may be suspended, upon conviction of a third crime of violence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Calhoun had been convicted of two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>counts of robbery with a deadly weapon and two counts of use of a handgun in commission of a crime of violence arising from two separate grocery store robberies. Although each of the offenses was a crime of violence, this Court concluded that \u00a7 643B(c) \u201cmandates the imposition of one, and only one, sentence of not less than twenty-five years\u201d upon proof of the predicate convictions and prior incarceration. <em>Id. </em>at 488, 418 A.2d 1241. We reached that conclusion, in part, because the plain language of the statute did not purport to cover third or subsequent offenses, that is, \u201cthird conviction\u201d meant only <em>the </em>third conviction. <em>Id.; see also Jones, </em>336 Md. at 257, 263, 647 A.2d 1204 (stating that in determining that, when defendant is convicted of more than one crime of violence arising from a single incident, sentencing court may select any one of the crime of violence convictions to enhance under \u00a7 643B(c), Court noted that \u201cany one of those crimes could have been considered the defendant\u2019s third crime of violence conviction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">More recently, in <em>Thomas v. State, </em>104 Md.App. 461, 656 A.2d 799 (1995), this Court answered the question of whether \u201csecond\u201d as used in \u00a7 286(c) \u201creally means \u2018second,\u2019 <em>i.e., </em>\u2018next in order after the first in time or place; the ordinal of two\u2019 or whether it means anything more than \u2018first\u2019 and thus includes \u2018third.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 466, 656 A.2d 799 (citation omitted). Although, as the State argues, <em>Thomas </em>is factually distinguishable, it is nonetheless instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In that case, Thomas was sentenced under \u00a7 286(c) as a second offender. He had a prior conviction dating from 1992. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>His arrest on the charge leading to the conviction that was on appeal occurred in 1993, \u201cwithin weeks\u201d of another arrest on drug charges. Thomas was convicted and sentenced under the other 1993 charge to a non-suspendable, non-parolable 10 years before he was sentenced on the conviction on appeal. The imposition of another enhanced 10-year sentence for the conviction on appeal constituted his second sentence under \u00a7 286(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The genesis of \u00a7 286(c) was thoroughly set forth by then Chief Judge Wilner. Included in the discussion of legislative history was an acknowledgment in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee Report \u201cthat subsection (c) applies to a person \u2018convicted for the second time\u2019.... \u201d 104 Md.App. at 468, 656 A.2d 799. This Court concluded that \u00a7 286(c) applied only to a sentence as a \u201csecond offender\u201d and not a third. <em>Id. </em>at 469, 656 A.2d 799. Chief Judge Wilner wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-6\">There can be little doubt here as to the legislative intent. The General Assembly in 1988 repealed a statute that provided a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence upon a finding of any previous conviction in favor of a more structured approach of increasing mandatory sentences for a second, third, and fourth conviction. It was presumably aware of our holding in <em>Calhoun </em>that, where a statute prescribes an enhanced penalty for a \u201cthird\u201d conviction, as opposed to a \u201csecond or subsequent\u201d conviction, it allows that penalty only upon the one conviction that constitutes the third, and not upon any conviction beyond the second. The Legislature had a variety of language to choose from, in existing enhanced punishment statutes, and it chose specificity over generality. In 1991, when it amended \u00a7 286(c)(1) to include certain foreign convictions, it left unchanged the specific language \u201cas a second offender\u201d in the provision mandating a non-suspendable, essentially non-parolable sentence for persons previously convicted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">104 Md.App. at 470, 656 A.2d 799.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">Now that it is clear second means, in fact, second, we are left to question what is meant by use of the word \u201coffender,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>as opposed to \u201cconviction,\u201d because in <em>Thomas </em>we were not confronted with multiple convictions arising out of a single case. To answer this question, we turn to our recent decision in <em>Diaz v. State, </em>129 Md.App. 51, 740 A.2d 81 (1999). In that case, the trial court used \u00a7 293 to double Diaz\u2019s sentences on three counts.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Judge Thieme, writing for the Court, stated that \u201cthe statute is unambiguous given a straightforward application in a case involving a single count indictment, but, when the court is faced with a multi-count indictment, <em>ie., </em>when multiple infractions springing from a single course of conduct are tried together, the picture becomes obfuscated.\u201d (Op. at 81, 740 A.2d 81). This Court held that as the statute was ambiguous, multiple convictions arising from a single course of conduct may not each be enhanced under \u00a7 293. (Op. at 82, 740 A.2d 81). Judge Thieme then went on to discuss the statute, noting that the use of the word \u201coffense\u201d in \u00a7 293 \u201cimplies a single criminal drama, not the enhancement of each of the individual scenes as set forth in the particular counts of the indictment.\u201d (Op. at 83, 740 A.2d 81). When \u00a7 293 was examined in context with the rest of the controlled dangerous substance statute, it \u201cappeared] that the scheme defines an \u2018offense\u2019 for the purpose of enhanced penalties as one indictable criminal episode. Enhancement is not available until a subsequent episode occurs on a subsequent date.\u201d (Op. at 85, 740 A.2d 81). In \u00a7 286(c), \u201coffender\u201d should be read in the same context.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The statutory scheme of \u00a7 286, as discussed in <em>Thomas, </em>also leads to the conclusion that only one enhanced sentence may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>be imposed. Under \u00a7 286(d), if certain conditions are met, a non-suspendable, non-parolable 25-year term must be imposed upon a third conviction under subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) or for conspiracy to violate those subsections. Section 286(e) requires imposition of a non-suspendable, non-parolable, 40-year sentence upon a fourth conviction \u201cif the person previously has served 3 separate terms of confinement as a result of 3 separate convictions[.]\u201d Under the interpretation proposed by the State, if a person is convicted of several crimes as a second offender, the resulting combined sentences, if run consecutively, could total a non-suspendable, non-parolable, term of incarceration greater than that permitted under \u00a7\u00a7 286(d) <em>&amp; </em>(e). In <em>Gargliano, </em>the Court of Appeals noted that \u201c[t]he clear import of the language used throughout \u00a7 286 is that the Legislature sought to impose more stringent penalties on certain offenders who repeatedly persist in a pattern of criminal conduct.\u201d 334 Md. at 442, 639 A.2d 675. Allowing for a sentence of a second offender to be greater than that permitted for a third or fourth offender runs contrary to the purposes of enhanced penalty statutes. <em>See Calhoun, </em>46 Md.App. at 489, 418 A.2d 1241 (\u201cCommon sense dictates that the sentence under \u00a7 643B(c) should be less severe than the mandatory life sentence under \u00a7 643B(b) wherein the predicates are more stringent.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">The State claims that under appellant\u2019s position, if appellant\u2019s conviction for possession with intent to distribute cocaine is considered his \u201csecond\u201d conviction, then logically, his conviction for possession with intent to distribute heroin must be his \u201cthird\u201d conviction, for which it could seek an enhanced penalty under \u00a7 286(d). The State bases its position on <em>Melgar v. State, </em>355 Md. 339, 734 A.2d 712 (1999). In that case, Melgar was sentenced as a third offender under \u00a7 286(d).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals determined that three predi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>cates must be met for imposition of the mandatory penalty under \u00a7 286(d): 1) the defendant \u201cis presently convicted of violating or conspiring to violate \u00a7 286(b)(1) or (b)(2)\u201d; 2) the defendant \u201chas two prior convictions, not arising out of a single incident, for violating or conspiring to violate \u00a7 286(b)(1) or (b)(2) \u2014 or like offenses within another American jurisdiction\u201d; and 3) the defendant \u201chas served at least one term of confinement of at least 180 days in a correctional institution as a result of conviction of a previous violation of \u00a7 286 or \u00a7 286A.\u201d <em>Melgar, </em>355 Md. at 344, 734 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Melgar conceded that he had two prior convictions and that he had served more than 180 days of confinement. His term of confinement was 248 days, but he had served only 141 days in the Maryland Division of Correction and received credit for the 107 days he had spent in the county detention center during pretrial incarceration. Accordingly, he claimed that he had not served 180 days \u201cas a result of conviction\u201d as required by \u00a7 286(d). The Court of Appeals agreed, as the plain language of the statute required, that the minimum of 180 days be served as a result of a conviction. <em>Melgar, </em>355 Md. at 348, 353, 734 A.2d 712. The Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>[T]he public policy goal of affording criminal offenders a meaningful chance at rehabilitation before subjecting them to mandatory, enhanced penalties and the incomplete availability of rehabilitative services to pretrial detainees underscore the purposefulness of the Legislature\u2019s choice of the phrase \u201cas a result of conviction.\u201d In our view, this distinct statutory phrase reflects the legislative intent that time in pretrial detention neither suffice nor in any degree supplement the statutory prerequisite of a minimum 180 day term of prior confinement for imposing an enhanced penalty upon a three-time drug offender under \u00a7 286.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 352, 734 A.2d 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">At first glance, the State\u2019s position, that under <em>Melgar, </em>one of appellant\u2019s convictions could serve as his \u201cthird\u201d conviction and thus result in the imposition of the enhanced 25-year term under \u00a7 286(d), is appealing. Nonetheless, we note that in <em>Melgar, </em>the Court was not required to address the impact of subsection (3), which states: \u201cA separate occasion shall be considered one in which the second or succeeding offense is committed after there has been a charging document filed for the preceding offense.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 286(d)(3). In addition, labeling one of appellant\u2019s convictions as his \u201cthird,\u201d as the state claims would occur, would run contrary to the purposes of enhanced penalty statutes. The means for achieving the deterrent effect of enhanced penalty statutes \u201cis the provision of fair warning to previous offenders that if they continue to commit criminal acts after having had the opportunity to reform after one or more prior contacts with the criminal justice system, they will be imprisoned for a considerably longer period of time than they were subject to as first offenders.\u201d <em>Gargliano, </em>334 Md. at 444, 639 A.2d 675. Imposing the enhanced 25-year sentence upon appellant as a \u201cthird\u201d offender would have afforded him no opportunity to alter his behavior before imposition of the harsher sentence. In any event, we are not called upon to construe the impact of \u00a7 286(d) upon appellant\u2019s case. We merely note that we do not view <em>Melgar </em>as requiring the imposition of an enhanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>25-year term upon appellant as the State argues would be the result under our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Finally, the State\u2019s argument that <em>Whack v. State, </em>338 Md. 665, 659 A.2d 1347 (1995), controls the present case is untenable. In that case, Whack\u2019s sentence on one count was enhanced under \u00a7 286(c) and under \u00a7 293 on another count. The Court of Appeals held that <em>\u201c </em>\u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 may be applied in the same case to enhance the sentences on different counts.\u201d 338 Md. at 681-82, 659 A.2d 1347. In reaching that conclusion, the Court commented that \u201c[t]he provisions of \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 each enhance a repeat drug offender\u2019s sentence in different ways.\u201d 338 Md. at 682, 659 A.2d 1347.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">In the present case, the State seeks application of \u00a7 286(c) twice to appellant\u2019s sentences. <em>Whack </em>addressed only the application of \u00a7 286(c) and \u00a7 293 to a single case. We can discern nothing in <em>Whack </em>that endorses enhancement of separate counts under a single statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">JUDGMENTS AFFIRMED; SENTENCES FOR POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE COCAINE AND POSSESSION WITH INTENT TO DISTRIBUTE HEROIN VACATED.
