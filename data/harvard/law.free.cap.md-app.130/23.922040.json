For our review, the Commission presents the following questions, which we have rephrased slightly:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-11\">I. Did the circuit court err in reversing the decision of the Maryland Racing Commission to disqualify a horse from its first place finish after the horse participated in the race while carrying an impermissible drug in its body?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b50-12\">II. Was it reversible error not to provide notice of a Stewards\u2019<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> hearing to the owner of the horse?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>This case concerns the Commission\u2019s response to the presence of an impermissible drug, Lasix, found in a post-race urine sample taken from a horse who had won its race at Laurel Park. We reverse the circuit court because the decision to disqualify the horse lay squarely within the discretion of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The Maryland Racing Commission and its Control of the Administration of Drugs to Horses in Thoroughbred Racing</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">The Commission is provided for in title 11 of the Business Regulation Article of the Maryland Code. Subtitle 2 establishes the Commission, provides for its membership and staff, and sets forth its general powers. The powers of the Commission are not particularized; instead, section 11-210 authorizes the Commission to \u201cadopt regulations and conditions to govern racing and betting on racing in the State[.]\u201d In <em>Jacobson v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>261 Md. 180, 274 A.2d 102 (1971), the Court of Appeals discussed the broad powers delegated to the Commission:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-7\">Horse racing is an endeavor and undertaking that necessarily must be the subject of intensive, extensive and minute regulation. It exists only because it is financed by the receipts from controlled legalized gambling which must be kept as far above suspicion as possible, not only to sustain and profit the racing fraternity but to feed substantial ... millions to the State\u2019s revenues. Not surprisingly the legislature has given the Commission full power to control racing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 183, 274 A.2d 102 (citation omitted). \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s purpose in granting to the Racing Commission the authority to promulgate rules was to assure that horse races in Maryland are \u2018conducted fairly, decently and clean[ly].\u2019 \u201d <em>Heft v.

They are also precise rubrics, intended to ensure the integrity of the industry and to protect the public against fraud and corruption. They do this, in part, by establishing certain specific procedures to be followed in the running of races, by requiring nearly everyone participating in the conduct of racing to be licensed, and by placing specific responsibility on the various licensees to follow the mandated procedures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b52-6\"><em>Sanders v.

In general, the administration of a drug<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to a horse prior to a race is not permitted. COMAR 09.10.03.03A(19) &amp; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>.04A-B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Indeed, COMAR 09.10.03.04B flatly states, \u201cA horse participating in a race may not carry a drug in its body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AjD\">To enforce the drug prohibition, the Stewards may order the \u201c[p]ost-race taking of urine, blood, or other samples for testing purposes from any horse which participated in a race[J\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.04E(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">The presence of a drug in the post-race urine, blood, or other sample taken from a horse is prima facie evidence that the:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-6\">(1) Horse was administered a drug and carried the drug in its body during the race; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b53-7\">(2) Drug was administered by the person or persons having control, care, or custody of the horse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">COMAR 09.10.03.04C. In addition, the \u201ctrainer is the absolute insurer of, and responsible for, the condition of each horse the trainer enters in a race, regardless of the acts of third parties.\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.04D. This is so as \u201c[tjrainers having charge, custody, or care of horses are obligated to protect properly the horses and guard against any violation of the Corrupt Practices Rules.\u201d COMAR 09.10.01.57Q. If a horse is found to have carried a drug in its body, the stewards may order the ... \u201c[d]enial, forfeiture, and prompt return of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>purse ... received by the owner....\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.04E(l)(b). The stewards may also order \u201cRedistribution of the items denied, forfeited, and returned, resulting from the disqualification of a horse found to have carried a drug in its body during a race, to those owners whose horses were advanced ' by the disqualification.\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.04E(l)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">One exception to the drug prohibition is provided for \u201cbleeders\u201d \u2014 horses that suffer from exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhaging (EIPH).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lasix may be administered to a horse, <em>ie., </em>a \u201cbleeder,\u201d only if the horse has qualified for its use.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> COMAR 09.10.03.08A. To qualify for the use of Lasix, any one of three conditions must be satisfied: (1) the horse has been observed to have bled from at least one nostril during or after a race or workout; (2) the horse has exhibited exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhaging resulting in a clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>flow of blood in the lumen of the respiratory tract; and (3) the horse has qualified for the use of Lasix in another jurisdiction in accordance with criteria comparable to that required by the Commission. COMAR 09.10.03.08B.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Only a veterinarian licensed by the Commission may administer Lasix to a horse qualified to receive the drug. COMAR 09.10.03.08G(1). In addition, \u201c[t]he veterinarian who administers Lasix to a horse scheduled to race shall prepare a written certification indicating that Lasix was administered.\u201d CO-MAR 09.10.03.08G(3)(a). \u201cThe written certification shall be in the possession of a designated Commission representative at least 1 hour before the horse is scheduled to race.\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.08G(3)(b). \u201cThe stewards ... shall order a horse scratched if the written certification is not received in a timely manner.\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.08G(3)(c). Any horse racing on Lasix shall be so denoted in the official program, which must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>also include a specific indication that a horse is racing on Lasix for the first time.

Finally, a post-race quantification limits the amount of Lasix a horse may carry in its body during a race. COMAR 09.10.03.08G(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">\u201cLa Beau,\u201d \u201cNorthern Nights,\u201d and \u201cMocefis\u201d were three horses trained by James Lawrence, II. On July 30, 1997, Mr. Lawrence telephoned Laurel Park and entered the horses in three different races that were to be run on August 2, 1997. The entry blanks for \u201cLa Beau,\u201d who is owned by Barbara Belotti, and \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d indicated that they were qualified to receive Lasix prior to running in their respective races. The third horse, \u201cMocefis,\u201d was not listed as being Lasix qualified. When Mr. Lawrence had called to enter the horses, however, he indicated that \u201cLa Beau\u201d should not be given Lasix.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">The night before the race in question, Dr. David Zipf, a state veterinarian, reviewed the list of horses scheduled to race the following day to determine their eligibility to receive Lasix. \u201cLa Beau\u201d was designated to receive Lasix, but he was not Lasix qualified.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Dr. Zipf wrote \u201cno\u201d alongside the name \u201cLa Beau\u201d and informed the Lasix clerk, George Russell, that the horse was not eligible to receive Lasix.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">On the morning of August 2, 1997, Mr. Lawrence and an assistant, Howard Peyton, prepared the horses for their races. While at Mr. Lawrence\u2019s training center in Cecil County, the horses were fed a commercial feed that contained no additives. The horses were then loaded onto a van and driven by Mr. Peyton to Laurel Park. Peyton arrived at the Park between 9:00 and 9:30 a.m. and the horses were placed in their respective stalls at the receiving barn. Shortly thereafter, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Morgan Dove, a veterinarian employed by Mr. Lawrence, met with Mr. Peyton and informed him of the respective times he would return to treat \u201cLa Beau\u201d and \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d with Lasix. Mr. Peyton questioned the administration of Lasix to \u201cLa Beau\u201d and Dr. Dove showed him a slip made out by Racing Commission personnel indicating that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was to be treated with Lasix.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">Mr. Lawrence arrived at Laurel Park at approximately 11:00 a.m. and Mr. Peyton told him of Dr. Dove\u2019s information that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was to receive Lasix. Mr. Lawrence went to the Lasix Office where he informed Mr. Russell that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not to receive Lasix. Russell told Lawrence that only Dr. Zipf was authorized to take a horse off the Lasix list. Mr. Lawrence then located Dr. Zipf, who stated that he had already told Mr. Russell that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not a Lasix horse. Lawrence returned to Russell, informed him of his conversation with Zipf, and Russell stated that he would take care of the matter. Lawrence and Peyton then prepared \u201cMocefis\u201d for the third race and led the horse to the paddock. An unidentified groom, who spoke little English, was left with \u201cLa Beau\u201d and \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d to hold \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d when Dr. Dove came to treat the horse with Lasix.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In the meantime, Dr. Dove was informed by Dr. Peacock, another state veterinarian, that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not to receive Lasix, so Dove squirted out the syringe of Lasix he had intended to give \u201cLa Beau.\u201d Dr. Dove was also called to the Lasix office, where he was again informed that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not to receive Lasix. At that time, Dr. Dove\u2019s assistant, Joshua Shofrogh, crumpled up the Lasix slip for \u201cLa Beau\u201d and threw it in the trash.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Later, Dr. Dove and Mr. Shofrogh returned to the barn to treat \u201cNorthern Nights,\u201d who was running in the ninth race. Dr. Dove read the horse\u2019s lip tatoo<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> while Shofrogh matched it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>to the number written on the Lasix slip. Dr. Dove then treated \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d with Lasix.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u201cLa Beau\u201d ran in the eighth race and finished first in a field of nine, earning $22,000 in purse monies. Following the race, a urine sample was collected from \u201cLa Beau.\u201d Five days later, the analysis was returned from the Commission laboratory. It revealed the presence of the drug furosemide (Lasix) and/or a derivative thereof. \u201cNorthern Nights\u201d ran in the ninth race, but finished out of the money so no testing was done on that horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">On August 8, 1997, the Stewards notified Mr. Lawrence by telephone of the positive test. Mr. Lawrence declined his right to have the split sample tested.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A Stewards\u2019 hearing was held on August 20, 1997. Following the hearing, the Stewards found that: (1) \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not qualified for the use of Lasix under COMAR 09.10.03.08A; (2) the presence of Lasix in \u201cLa Beau\u2019s\u201d post-race urine sample constituted a violation of COMAR 09.10.03.04B &amp; C; and (3) Mr. Lawrence, as the trainer, was responsible for this violation under CO-MAR 09.10.03.04C(2) &amp; .04D. In light of those findings, the Stewards ordered that: (1) Mr. Lawrence pay a fine of $500; (2) \u201cLa Beau\u201d be disqualified from all purse monies; and (3) the purse from the eighth race be redistributed. Mrs. Belotti received no notice of the Stewards\u2019 hearing and was not in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Mr. Lawrence and Mrs. Belotti appealed the Stewards\u2019 decision to the Commission. In its written memorandum and order, the Commission made the following conclusions of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AA6\">1. \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not qualified for the use of Lasix as required under COMAR 09.10.03.08(A).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>2. \u201cLa Beau\u201d participated in the eighth race at Laurel Park on August 2, 1997 while carrying a drug (Lasix) in its body in violation of COMAR 09.10.03.04(B).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">3. Although it is unclear as to the method or means by which Lasix was in the body of \u201cLa Beau\u201d, James L. Lawrence II, as the trainer of the horse, is the absolute insurer of, and was responsible for, the condition of the horse, regardless of the acts of third parties. COMAR 09.10.03.04(D).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">4. Considering that \u201cLa Beau\u201d participated in the race while carrying a drug in its body, the horse should be disqualified from its first place finish and placed last.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">5. Considering the extenuating circumstances attendant to this matter, the absence of bad faith, and the licensing history of trainer Lawrence, the imposition of a fine is not warranted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">The Commission then ordered that \u201cLa Beau\u201d be disqualified and the purse monies distributed accordingly, but that no other sanction be imposed upon the trainer, Mr. Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Mrs. Belotti appealed to the circuit court. It reversed the Commission\u2019s decision and ordered that the first place purse be distributed to her. The court\u2019s decision was based on two grounds. First, the court concluded that although the Commission claimed that the absolute insurer rule did not apply to Mrs. Belotti, that was precisely the rule applied by the Commission. The court concluded that the rule could only be applied to a \u201cconcededly innocent owner\u201d through the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior. </em>The court explained that if the Commission\u2019s unstated reason was that the trainer is the absolute insurer of the horse and the horse was disqualified irrespective of the lack of culpability of the trainer and owner, then the absolute insurer rule would create an irrebuttable presumption, which, in light of <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A.2d 600 (1946), was unconstitutional. The court determined that \u201c[t]he Racing Commission may not sanction a trainer or forfeit the purse of an owner without some evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>in the record that they were in some degree culpable, no matter how slight that degree might be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Second, the court determined that reversal was required as the hearing before the Stewards was conducted without notice to Mrs. Belotti and, thus, without her presence. The court wrote: \u201cFor the Stewards to forfeit an owner\u2019s purse without notifying the owner of the right to be present at a hearing, is clearly violative of due process.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">In reviewing the decision of the Racing Commission, our role is the same as that of the circuit court. <em>Department of Health and Mental Hygiene v. Shrieves, </em>100 Md.App. 283, 303-304, 641 A.2d 899 (1994). As such, we do not directly review the decision of the lower court and, instead, review the administrative decision itself. <em>Public Serv. Comm\u2019n of Md. v. Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec.

As to Mrs. Belotti, the question was whether \u201cLa Beau\u201d raced with an impermissible drug in its body and the resultant redistribution of purse monies after the horse was disqualified. The question regarding Mr. Lawrence was what, if any, sanction should be imposed as he was responsible for the horse\u2019s participating in the race while carrying the impermissible drug. The Commission alleges that the absolute insurer rule does not apply to Mrs. Belotti, that it did not apply the rule to her, and that the circuit court erred in determining that the Commission had, in actuality, applied the rule through the doctrine of <em>respondeat superior, </em>thus creating an irrebuttable presumption violative of <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A.2d 600 (1946).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">The Commission also alleges that the circuit court misstated the facts of the case in its decision, including: (1) that Lasix is not a performance enhancing drug; (2) that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was qualified to receive Lasix subsequent to the incident in question; and (3) that the Commission was responsible for \u201ca <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>virtual comedy of errors\u201d that allegedly resulted in the erroneous administration of Lasix to \u201cLa Beau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We agree with the Commission that it did not apply the absolute insurer rule to Mrs. Belotti and that it could disqualify \u201cLa Beau\u201d and deny Mrs. Belotti the purse monies since the horse raced with an impermissible drug in its body, regardless of how the drug was administered to the horse.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">We first note that although the actions regarding Mrs. Belotti and Mr. Lawrence were based on separate COMAR regulations, they both arose from the presence of Lasix in \u201cLa Beau\u2019s\u201d body as discovered by the post-race urinalysis. From that point, the application of the regulations diverged with different consequences for the two parties. We stress, however, that Mr. Lawrence is not a party to this appeal and we do not discuss the Commission\u2019s decision as it affected Mr. Lawrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">In <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A.2d 600 (1946), Benzedrine was found in the post-race saliva sample taken from a horse and the Commission suspended the trainer\u2019s license for one year. The applicable section of the Commission\u2019s rules provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-8\">(a) No person shall administer, or knowingly or carelessly permit to be administered to any horse entered for a race, any drug in any way within forty-eight (48) hours before the time of the race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-9\">&gt;\u25a0&lt; <em>% % </em>$ #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-10\">(d) If the Commission finds from analysis of the saliva or urine, or blood taken from a horse on the day of a race in which the horse ran, or from other competent evidence, that any drug has been administered to the horse within forty-eight (48) hours before the race, the trainer shall be subject to the penalties prescribed in subsection (e) hereof, whether or not he administered the drug, or knowingly or carelessly permitted it to be administered. <em>The fact that the analysis shows the presence of a drug shall be conclusive evidence either that there was knowledge of the fact on the part of the trainer or that he was guilty of carelessness in permitting it to be administered. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>The Court of Appeals held that the irrebuttable presumption established in the above quoted rule was unconstitutional. 187 Md. at 87, 48 A.2d 600. The Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-4\">From the fact that benzedrine was found in the saliva taken from the horse after the race, this irrebuttable presumption is substituted for facts necessary to find the appellee guilty under paragraph (d) of the rule. No facts or circumstances surrounding the stabling, care and attention given the horse after it arrived at Pimlico is to be considered. The appel-lee\u2019s reputation as a clean, straight, decent jockey and trainer, which he has borne among the racing world for years, and which was attested to by many witnesses of high standing, is not to be considered in determining his guilt or innocence. In fact, the Commission attested to appellee\u2019s fine record, as will appear from the remarks made by its chairman, contained in the record. All this, like so much chaff, is to be blown away as waste in the operation of the machinery set up under this paragraph. This irrebuttable presumption destroyed the right of appellee to offer evidence to establish his innocence. If this is \u201cjust,\u201d then the term \u201cunjust\u201d is without meaning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-5\">The Commission is a creature of the Legislature and the Legislature does not possess the power under the State Constitution to prevent one from making a defense to a charge brought against him by substituting an irrebuttable presumption for facts. Such a law would be arbitrary, illegal, capricious and hence unconstitutional. \u201cThat the trial of facts, where they arise, is one of the greatest securities of the lives, liberties and estate of the People.\u201d Art. 20, Md. Declaration of Rights. This rule prevents the trial of facts and calls for the revocation of the license without cause shown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">187 Md. at 86-87, 48 A.2d 600.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Years later, the Court of Appeals was confronted with the validity of a similar rule in <em>Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n v. McGee, </em>212 Md. 69, 128 A.2d 419 (1957). There, a horse won the sixth race at Bowie, but a post-race urinalysis showed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>drug in the nature of caffeine, which could embrace amphetamine, benzedrine, cocaine, and morphine. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 128 A.2d 419. The rule in question stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b65-5\">No person shall administer, or cause or knowingly permit to be administered, or connive at the administration of, any drug to any horse entered for a race. Every owner, trainer, or groom must guard, or cause to be guarded, each horse owned, trained or attended by him in such manner as to prevent any person or persons from administering to the horse, by any method, any drug prior to the time of the start of the race which is of such character as to affect the racing condition of the horse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Relying on this rule, the Commission suspended the trainer\u2019s license for six months. The Court of Appeals determined that the evidence presented to the Commission demonstrated that the trainer had engaged a night watchman to guard his many horses, including the horse in question. Nonetheless, the horses were housed in separate barns, the watchman had to travel between the barns to feed the horse, and the lighting conditions were inadequate in the barn where the horse in question was kept. In addition, the watchman was aged and was prevented from spending the night in the barn due to extreme weather. The trainer was also aware that a former employee, who the trainer had barred from the track and refused a day\u2019s pay, was working in the barn where the horse in question was stabled. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 128 A.2d 419. As a result, there was ample evidence before the Commission that the trainer had failed to adequately guard the horse in question. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 79, 128 A.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">The trainer argued that the rule \u201cmakes the trainer the insurer of the fact that the horse has not been given drugs before a race, because if drugs have been given, it follows that the trainer either gave them himself or was derelict in his duty under the Rule in preventing someone else from giving them, and that so construed, the Rule is unconstitutional and void under the holding of this Court in <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81 [48 A.2d 600].\u201d 212 Md. at 74, 128 A.2d 419. The Court rejected that argument. It stated that <em>Byers </em>had held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>\u201cthat an irrebuttable presumption was substituted for proof of the fact that the trainer administered the drug or was careless in allowing it to be administered and that the substitution of an irrebuttable presumption for the facts was arbitrary and unconstitutional.\u201d 212 Md. at 75, 128 A.2d 419. The Court commented that cases from other jurisdictions had held \u201cthat a rule making a trainer of race horses an insurer of the fact that the horse has not been given a drug before a race, is a valid rule which the authorities in charge of regulation of racing can make without affront to the constitutional rights of the trainer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75, 128 A.2d 419 (citing <em>Sandstrom v. California Horse Racing Bd., </em>31 Cal.2d 401, 189 P.2d 17, <em>cert. denied, </em>335 U.S. 814, 69 S.Ct. 31, 93 L.Ed. 369 (1948), and <em>State v. West Virginia Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>133 W.Va. 179, 55 S.E.2d 263). The Court of Appeals noted that those decisions \u201cfind support in many instances where responsibility or liability without fault has been held not to infringe constitutional rights.\u201d 212 Md. at 76, 128 A.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The Court concluded that the rule imposing a duty on the trainer to guard the horse against administration of drugs was valid. <em>Id. </em>at 78, 128 A.2d 419. The Court then distinguished <em>Byers:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">The <em>Byers </em>case rejected the argument that failure to guard was carelessness within the meaning of the rule then before the Court because the Commission at that time imposed no specific requirement to guard. The <em>Byers </em>decision permits the inference that the Court felt such a requirement would not be unreasonable. Here there was evidence permitting the Commission to find that McGee failed to guard the horse adequately under the circumstances, and that, as a result, a drug could have been given the horse. For this reason, we see no necessity to decide whether the rule could be validly applied to a case where the trainer proved that he had taken every possible precaution and, nevertheless, a drug was detected in the system of the horse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 78, 128 A.2d 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">The most recent case involving the absolute insurer rule is <em>Goldman v. Maryland Racing Comm\u2019n, </em>85 Md.App. 544, 584 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>A.2d 709 (1991). The incantation of the rule in effect at that time provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">(4) The presence of a drug in the post-race saliva, urine, or other sample taken from the horse shall be prima facie evidence that the horse had been administered and carried the drug in its body during the race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-5\">(5) Whenever the post-race sample taken from a horse discloses the presence of a drug, it shall be presumed that the drug was administered by the person or persons having control, care, or custody of the horse. The presence of any drug in a post-race sample is prohibited....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">(7) The trainer shall be the absolute insurer of, and responsible for, the condition of each horse he enters in a race, regardless of the acts of third parties. A trainer may not start a horse or permit a horse in his custody to be started if he knows, or if by the exercise of reasonable care he might have known or have cause to believe, that the horse has received any drug that could result in a positive test. Every trainer shall guard or cause to be guarded each horse trained by him in such manner and for such period as to prevent any person from administering a drug to the horse that could result in a positive test. If the post-race test reveals the presence of a drug, the trainer may be disciplined.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">In that case, horses of two trainers finished in the money. Each tested positive for the drug phenylbutazone. At oral argument, the trainers admitted that they had administered the drug to their respective horses. Nonetheless, they attacked the validity of the provision declaring the trainer to be the \u201cabsolute insurer\u201d of the condition of the horse. Relying primarily on <em>Mahoney v. Byers, </em>187 Md. 81, 48 A.2d 600 (1946), the trainers argued that the provision was unconstitutional as it created an irrebuttable presumption. In upholding the absolute insurer rule, then Chief Judge Wilner noted for this Court that it was not a free-standing provision. 85 Md.App. at 552, 584 A.2d 709. Also included in the absolute insurer provision were the duties \u201cnot to allow a horse in his custody to be started if he has reason to believe that the horse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>has received a drug that could result in a positive test and to guard the horse \u2018in such manner and for such period of time before racing the horse so as to prevent any person from administering a drug to the horse that could result in a positive test.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 552-53, 584 A.2d 709. Accordingly, the absolute insurer rule \u201cdoes not really impose liability without fault[J\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553, 584 A.2d 709. Chief Judge Wilner continued: \u201c[A]bsent some extraordinary circumstances, of which there is no evidence in this case, the presence of a drug in a horse immediately following a race permits a fair inference either that the trainer administered the drug or allowed it to be administered or failed in his mandatory duty to guard the horse.\u201d <em>Id. Byers </em>was not controlling; in fact, it was irrelevant. <em>Id. McGee </em>was the controlling precedent. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, this Court concluded that the absolute insurer rule, which reflects the nearly universal rule throughout the country, was a valid regulation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Based on <em>McGee </em>and <em>Goldman, </em>although the precise wording of the absolute insurer rule has been altered slightly, any challenge to the rule, as applied to a trainer, must fail. However, Mrs. Belotti claims the rule was applied to her, an owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The \u201cabsolute insurer rule,\u201d COMAR 09.10.03.04D, <em>supra, </em>by its very terms applies only to the trainer and imposes responsibility for the condition of the horse only upon the trainer. We can discern no indication from the record before us that the Commission applied this rule to Mrs. Belotti. Indeed, no responsibility for the presence of Lasix in the horse was imposed upon Mrs. Belotti; that burden rested solely with Mr. Lawrence, albeit without a penalty as the Commission determined that the imposition of a fine was not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Under COMAR 09.10.03.04E(l)(b) &amp; (c), the Stewards <em>may </em>order the forfeiture and redistribution of purse monies awarded to the owner of a horse found to have carried a drug in its body. That section, however, does not assign responsibility to any individual for the presence of the drug in the horse\u2019s body. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>It merely responds to the fact that a drug was present. In the case before us, the presence of Lasix in the post-race urine sample taken from \u201cLa Beau\u201d was <em>prima, facie </em>evidence the horse carried the drug in its body during the race. COMAR 09.10.03.04C(1). The purse monies awarded to Mrs. Belotti were then forfeited and redistributed without any blame or responsibility being imposed upon her. Such action by the Commission was the consequence of \u201cLa Beau\u2019s\u201d racing with Lasix in its body. Although this ruling had a great impact on Mrs. Belotti, in light of the broad powers delegated to the Commission to regulate, protect, and ensure the integrity of racing, it is a decision squarely within the expertise and discretion of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\"> The patrons at Laurel Park on the date in question had no indication that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was racing with Lasix in its body as the race program did not denote \u201cLa Beau\u201d as a Lasix horse, nor did the owners, trainers, and jockeys of the other horses in the race. The Commission must also protect the public, the horses, the other owners, and the jockeys. The fact that \u201cLa Beau\u201d raced with an impermissible drug in its body has implications beyond those affecting Mrs. Belotti. It is these interests, individuals, and the sport of Thoroughbred racing that the Commission must also consider in its decision. In such circumstances, a reviewing court should not substitute its judgment for that of the Commission. We decline to do so and the circuit court erred in so doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Mrs. Belotti\u2019s position is an example of the cases cited in <em>McGee </em>\u2014 \u201cwhere responsibility or liability without fault has been held not to infringe constitutional rights.\u201d 212 Md. at 76-77, 128 A.2d 419. <em>See, e.g., Ford v. State, </em>85 Md. 465, 480-81, 37 A. 172 (1897) (statute making possession of lottery tickets a crime, without knowledge as to nature of the tickets, upheld); <em>State v. Baltimore &amp; Susquehanna Steam, Co., </em>13 Md. 181 (1859) (steamship company held liable for illegal transportation of slaves over the defense that the company and its agents had no knowledge that a slave was on board). <em>See also McBriety v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>219 Md. 223, 240, 148 A.2d 408 (1959) (argument that ordinance imposing criminal liability for sale of liquor to under age minors without proof of knowledge or guilt of the person in actual charge, management, or control of the licensed premises was denial of due process was rejected). More recently, in <em>Rucker v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>315 Md. 559, 555 A.2d 1060 (1989), the Court of Appeals determined that substantive due process was not violated by a statute imposing a tax liability on a corporate officer who had no responsibility for the payment of the taxes. <em>Id. </em>at 566-67, 555 A.2d 1060. The Court determined, in part, that the statute had a rational basis for holding officers liable for the payment of taxes \u2014 \u201cthe collection of taxes due and owing which might otherwise go unpaid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 567, 555 A.2d 1060. <em>See also Fox v. Comptroller of the Treasury, </em>126 Md.App. 279, 290-93, 728 A.2d 776, <em>cert. denied, </em>355 Md. 612, 735 A.2d 1106 (1999) (corporate officer liable for unpaid sales and use taxes even though he was not responsible for the collection and payment of those taxes under the corporation\u2019s by-laws). Although Lasix appears to have been administered to \u201cLa Beau\u201d because of confusion and/or misidentification of the horse, and no responsibility rests with Mrs. Belotti, we are reminded that regulations like those at issue \u201c \u2018may produce mischief in individual cases\u2019 but that the general good justified and made valid the strictness of the law.\u201d <em>McGee, </em>212 Md. at 77, 128 A.2d 419 (quoting <em>Baltimore &amp; Susquehanna Steam Co., </em>13 Md. at 187).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">The circuit court was outraged over the circumstances under which Lasix was apparently administered to \u201cLa Beau.\u201d The court labeled the events \u201ca virtual true comedy of errors\u201d and believed it would be \u201ca true comedy of errors\u201d if it had not cost Mrs. Belotti $22,000 in purse monies. Even if we were to agree with this characterization, as discussed above, we cannot ignore the broad powers granted to the Commission to regulate and protect the integrity of the racing industry, along with its responsibility to the individuals who patronize the race tracks in this State. It serves as no basis for the circuit court to substitute its judgment for that of the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Finally, the circuit court determined that Lasix was not a performance enhancing drug, that the parties had conceded that Lasix was not a performance enhancing drug, that seven of the other eight horses in the race were running on Lasix, and that \u201cLa Beau\u201d had qualified for the use of Lasix subsequent to the race in question.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In our review of the record, we cannot locate any concession on the part of the Commission that Lasix is not a performance enhancing drug. In its memorandum to the circuit court, the Commission conceded that \u201cat the hearing before the Commission, there was no evidence to demonstrate that the presence of Lasix enhances the performance of a horse.... \u201d This is merely a recognition of the absence of such evidence before the Commission and not a concession to an allegedly disputed fact. .In contrast, before this Court, the Commission argues that it never agreed that Lasix is not a performance enhancing drug and that \u201cconsidering that Lasix is used to eliminate the phenomenon of \u2018exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhaging\u2019 ... if a horse is enabled to race with clear lungs, it certainly will perform in a manner superior to the horse racing with blood-congested lungs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Near the close of the hearing before the Commission, Dale Lucas, the owner of the horse that placed fourth in the contested race, although not under oath, was asked if he had \u201canything to add to [the hearing.]\u201d Mr. Lucas contended that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was \u201coutrunning what his real ability is without Lasix.\u201d Mr. Lucas further stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">\u201cAs everybody knows, a horse on first time Lasix, it\u2019s noted in the programs and in the forms that they have first time Lasix because it enhances their performance. So, we were really running against something that we had no idea we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>could be contending with -without knowing this horse was on first time Lasix.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">Mr. Lawrence countered that Lasix is not a performance enhancing drug. Ultimately, the Commission made no finding as to whether Lasix is a performance enhancing drug.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This absence of a finding is of no consequence because the regulations prohibit a horse from racing with \u201ca drug\u201d in its body. COMAR 09.10.03.04B. There is no requirement that the drug be performance enhancing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Furthermore, that many horses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>race on Lasix and that \u201cLa Beau\u201d may have qualified for Lasix subsequent to this race is irrelevant to the fact that \u201cLa Beau\u201d was not qualified for Lasix on the date in question. In determining that the exception swallows the rule, the circuit court, in effect, negated the rulemaking authority of the Commission. The circuit court lacks the expertise to determine that since a large number of horses race on Lasix, they no longer need to qualify for its use.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The Commission next contends that the notice of the Stewards\u2019 hearing provided to Mr. Lawrence, the trainer, was sufficient notice to Mrs. Belotti as Lawrence was her agent. In the alternative, the Commission contends that as the hearing before it was conducted <em>de novo, </em>any defect in the prior proceeding was cured by the full hearing before the Commission. Finally, the Commission alleges that any failure to notify Mrs. Belotti of the positive urinalysis was harmless as Belotti did not testify or present any evidence to the Commission regarding the presence of the impermissible drug in \u201cLa Beau.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Before we address these contentions, we must first decide if there is a decision by the Commission for us to review. During the hearing before the Commission, the Assistant Attorney General, who was representing the Commission, proffered evidence of the notice provided to Mrs. Belotti of the current hearing and Mrs. Belotti\u2019s counsel objected \u201cbecause Mrs. Belotti never received notice of the initial Steward\u2019s hearing.\u201d The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b73-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION]: Mr. Chairman, I would note that certainly the record shows and there\u2019s no dispute that Mr. Lawrence obviously was aware of the steward\u2019s hearing and participated in the steward\u2019s hearing and certainly he can be reasonably deemed to be acting as Ms. Belotti\u2019s agent as, as the licensed trainer for Ms. Belotti, and, and I think it\u2019s further reasonable for the, for the Commission to infer that Ms. Belotti knew or should have known through her trainer of this pending matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>before the stewards. Further, the issue \u2014 I\u2019m not sure of the relevance of the issue to today\u2019s hearing. She is\u2014 there\u2019s no contention that this notice has not been properly provided to her for today\u2019s hearing so I think that the \u2014 and the notice\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-4\">MEMBER: Counsel is saying the defective part to the notice to this hearing because it references the fact of a steward\u2019s hearing and she was not notified. Is that what that says because\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION]: Well, it references the steward\u2019s, it references the steward\u2019s hearing, that\u2019s correct, and the decision of the stewards on October 22 nd, 1997[sic]. Now, [Counsel for Mrs. Belotti] has entered an appearance in this proceeding on behalf of both Mr. Lawrence and Ms. Belotti. So, she is \u2014 she\u2019s been notified, she\u2019s present through her counsel today to participate in this hearing. Now, I presume she\u2019ll I\u2019ll presume she\u2019ll have\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-6\">MEMBER: Assuming what you\u2019ve been told is correct, it\u2019s not a perfect procedure but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s affected to the, to the point where \u2014 I mean, what would you want to do, go back and have a, have a steward\u2019s hearing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">[COUNSEL FOR MRS. BELOTTI]: Mr. Chairman, I\u2014 issue only on Mrs. Belotti\u2019s behalf in the event that further appeal became necessary. I wanted to make a record of the fact that she didn\u2019t receive notice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-8\">[COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION]: Well, I\u2019d note an objection since a record is being made on this matter that certainly Ms. Belotti has notice of today\u2019s proceeding. She had every opportunity to appear here, testify under oath as to any alleged problem with notice of the steward\u2019s hearing. So ... I question the appropriateness of, of making a record simply through proffers. If Ms. Belotti wished to testify she could have done so today regarding the steward\u2019s hearing or any other relevant issue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-9\">CHAIRMAN: There\u2019s an objection to part of what that notice contains. We, we can admit that into evidence sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>ject to [that] objection. The record will note that the objection was made.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-5\">[COUNSEL FOR THE COMMISSION]: Thank you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-6\">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: If I could also state along those lines, Mr. Chairman, that this is a de novo hearing before the Maryland Racing Commission. It\u2019s not a decision of this Commission as to whether it wishes to affirm or, or reverse a steward\u2019s decision, but it is in fact a de novo hearing before the Maryland Racing Commission\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-7\">CHAIRMAN: I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-8\">UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: \u2014 and as a result the notice of today\u2019s hearing I think without question was provided to Mrs. Belotti.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-9\">CHAIRMAN: That\u2019s not even questioned, but there is some technical question as to whether Ms. Belotti was entitled to attend the steward\u2019s hearing. As I say, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a fatal error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-10\">There was no further discussion of this question and the Commission proceeded with the hearing. In its memorandum and order, the Commission did not address the lack of notice to Mrs. Belotti. It made no findings and reached no conclusions on that issue.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">It is clear that the Commission, as recognized by its Chairman, believed that there had been a defect in the procedure, but that the defect was not fatal. Indeed, how else could the Commission proceed with the hearing if it did not so conclude? Nonetheless, we are left to ask on what ground or grounds did the Commission proceed? Was it based upon the determination that Mr. Lawrence was Mrs. Belotti\u2019s agent and that notice to Lawrence was notice to Belotti? Or was it based upon the conclusion that the proceedings before the Commission were <em>de novo </em>and would thus cure any earlier defect? Or was it based on another reason?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>The importance of this question turns upon our standard of review, which is limited to the findings made by the Commission and its stated reasons. In <em>United Steelworkers v.

In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency. \u201cThe courts may not accept appellate counsel\u2019s <em>post hoc </em>rationalizations for agency action.... \u201d <em>Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v.

First, we look to the exchange between the unidentified speaker and the Chairman. There was an acceptance by the Chairman of the position taken by the speaker, <em>i. e., </em>that it was a <em>de novo </em>hearing. Second, we look to the actual action taken by the Commission, which did, in fact, proceed with a <em>de novo </em>hearing. <em>See generally United Parcel Serv. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, </em>336 Md. 569, 585-87, 650 A.2d 226 (1994) (in determining that Board of Appeals did not exercise original jurisdiction, Court considered, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Board did, in fact, treat case as an appeal). Although the regulations do not expressly provide that the hearing is <em>de novo, </em>it is apparent based upon the actual proceeding that this was the case.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-4\">\u201cA trial or hearing \u2018de novo\u2019 means trying the matter anew the same as if it had not been heard before and as if no decision had been previously rendered. Thus, it is said that where a statute provides that an appeal shall be heard de novo such a hearing is in no sense a review of the hearing previously held, but is a complete trial of the controversy, the same as if no previous hearing had ever been held....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AaG\"><em>Boehm v.

Drs. Zipf and Dove were initially called as witnesses, but were excused as they concurred with Mr. Lawrence\u2019s statement. Athough the Commission had the same exhibits before it as the Stewards did, there is no evidence that a recording was made of the Stewards\u2019s hearing or a transcript produced. The Stewards reached their conclusions based upon \u201cthe testimony they received and evidence presented at the hearing.... \u201d Accordingly, the Commission could not review the basis of the Stewards\u2019 decision because they did not have a complete record of all the evidence presented to the Stewards. At the close of the hearing before the Commission, the Chairman commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b78-6\">Mr. Lawrence, we can find no way in the world to change the decision of the steward with regard to redistribution of the purse. We all feel however that from a penalty standpoint, the $500 fine, that you were the victim of a mix-up and that you did everything you did to correct it and therefore we\u2019re going to waive the penalty of $500.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">This is merely a recognition that the Stewards had reached the correct decision. In its memorandum and order, the Commission made its own findings of fact, conclusions of law, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>and issued an order enforcing the decision. It did not refer to any findings by the Stewards, did not purport to affirm their decision to disqualify \u201cLa Beau,\u201d and did not act as if it was reversing the sanction imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">We agree with Mrs. Belotti that due process requires that she be given notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See LaChance v.

In that case, Hill sustained an injury when he fell from a truck while employed as a maintenance worker with the Baltimore County Department of Recreation and Parks. He applied to the Board of Trustees of the Employees\u2019 Retirement System of Baltimore County and the Trustees referred the case to the County Medical Board. The Medical Board concluded that Hill was not totally disabled. Based on that information, the Trustees determined that Hill was not entitled to disability retirement benefits. Hill appealed to the Board of Appeals of Baltimore County, which, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, affirmed the Trustees\u2019 decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Hill alleged that he was denied due process based on two grounds: (1) he was entitled to notice and a hearing before the Medical Board and Trustees because they made the ultimate determination; and (2) he had no input into the process at each stage. Relying on <em>Quesenberry, Opp Cotton Mills, </em>and <em>Boehm, supra, </em>this Court held \u201cthat an individual is provided due process of law even if he or she is not given notice of or a hearing at the initial administrative levels when he or she is afforded a de novo hearing at the County Board of Appeals.\u201d 86 Md.App. at 655, 587 A.2d 1155. Hill had notice of the hearing before the Board of Appeals, appeared with counsel, presented evidence, cross-examined witnesses, and had a complete record that formed the basis of the Board\u2019s decision. In addition, under its <em>de novo </em>review, the Board of Appeals could have decided the case completely, which cured any error existing in the earlier administrative decisions. <em>Id. </em>In light of <em>Hill, </em>any error committed by the lack of notice of the Stewards\u2019 hearing was cured by the <em>de novo </em>hearing held before the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>Mrs. Belotti alleges that the hearing before the Commission could not be considered <em>de novo </em>since she did not have the opportunity to request the testing of the split sample.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> She alleges that her ability to have the split sample tested was lost because she was not notified of the Stewards\u2019 hearing and the sample was disposed of before she knew of \u201cLa Beau\u2019s\u201d positive test. This claim must fail as it was never presented to the Commission. <em>See Mayor of Rockville v.

The allegation that she lacked notice of the hearing did not encompass an allegation that she was denied the ability to request confirmatory testing. The notification regarding split samples contemplated by the regulations does not include any mention of a Stewards\u2019 hearing or any required notice for such a hearing. This seems to be the only logical approach as there would be no point in having a Stewards\u2019 hearing until the trainer\u2019s or owner\u2019s decision to request or waive the confirmatory test was obtained and then, if the confirmatory test was requested, to await the results of that test.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> As Mrs. Belotti failed to allege that she was denied the ability to request confirmatory testing when it still might have been possible to conduct such a test,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> she cannot be heard to complain of this for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY REVERSED.

On August 8, 1997, Mr. Lawrence was notified by telephone that \"La Beau\u2019s\u201d urine sample tested positive for Lasix and that if he chose not to request confirmatory testing of the split sample the Stewards\u2019 hearing would be held on August 13. Mr. Lawrence did not waive his right to confirmatory testing until August 13 and the hearing was held on August 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b82-7\">. The split sample is retained in the detention barn until the Stewards direct that it should be discarded. COMAR 09.10.03.09F(1). Mr. Lawrence waived testing of the split sample on August 13, the Stewards' hearing was held on August 20, and Mrs. Belotti noted an appeal to the Commission on August 22, but we have no evidence on whether . the split sample was still available for testing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b82-9\">. We also note that Mrs. Belotti never alleged that there was any error in the sample taken from \"La Beau,\u201d that the urinalysis was erroneous, that there was any problem with the chain of custody of the sample, or that the laboratory\u2019s procedures were faulty.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
