Susan was a high school senior when she was driving her grandfather\u2019s 1983 Cadillac on the day of the accident; Miranda was a high school sophomore. She attempted to pass a slower vehicle by crossing a double yellow line and was struck head-on by an oncoming vehicle. Susan died on that day and Miranda died from her injuries on January 30, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-15\">At the time of the accident, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company had issued an insurance policy for the grandfather, Earl T. Weeks, under which Susan was a named insured. The policy limited liability coverage to $20,000 per person and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>$40,000 per accident for bodily injuries, the statutory minimum in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">Appellants, William and Linda Bushey, the girls\u2019 parents, sued Northern Assurance Company of America (\u201cNorthern\u201d) and St. Paul Insurance Company in the Circuit Court for Charles County, individually and as personal representative of Miranda Bushey\u2019s estate, for underinsured motorist coverage. Northern has a commercial insurance policy for Mr. Bushey\u2019s automotive repair business.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants sought a declaratory judgment that the Northern policy provided uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) benefits. The circuit court found that the automobile was not a \u201ccovered vehicle\u201d under Northern\u2019s policy and granted Northern\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The appellants argue that Northern\u2019s insurance policy is not limited to covered vehicles and raise three issues on appeal, which we have reworded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">1. Did the circuit court misconstrue the uninsured motorist statute in determining that insureds may be excluded from coverage when not occupying a \u201ccovered vehicle\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-8\">2. Did the circuit court misconstrue the personal and comprehensive coverage of the UM endorsement in determining that insureds may be excluded from coverage when not occupying a \u201ccovered vehicle\u201d?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-9\">3. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the doctrine of parent/child immunity barred appellants\u2019 individual wrongful death claims?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the judgment of the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Northern issued a commercial insurance policy to \u201cWilliam B. Bushey t/a Bushey\u2019s Automotive\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that provides comprehensive coverage for appellant\u2019s automotive repair business. The policy is divided into numerous \u201csections,\u201d such as a property section that insures the automotive repair business\u2019s building, a crime section that insures against employee dishonesty, and a garage and dealers section. The garage and dealers section of the commercial policy is the section at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">In the garage and dealers section, using numerical codes, there is a \u201cCoverages/Limits\u201d section that allows uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage to be elected for five types of cars:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-5\">22 = owned autos only,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-6\">23 = owned private passenger autos only,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">24 = owned autos other than private passenger autos only,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\">26 = owned autos subject to a compulsory UM law, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\">27 = specifically described autos.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">For UM coverage, appellant checked number 26 (owned autos subject to a compulsory UM law). For UIM coverage, appellant checked number 26 and wrote in number 32, which covers \u201ccompany use\u201d vehicles with transportation tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-12\">The insurance policy has a \u201cMaryland Uninsured Motorist Coverage\u201d endorsement, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\">B. WHO IS AN INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\">1. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-15\">2. If you are an individual, any \u201cfamily member\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-16\">3. Anyone else \u201coccupying\u201d a covered \u201cauto\u201d or a temporary substitute for a covered \u201cauto\u201d....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by another \u201cinsured\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">The standard of review on appeal of a trial court\u2019s granting or denying a motion for summary judgment is whether the trial court was legally correct. <em>Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 216, 221, 706 A.2d 650 (1998). We find that the trial court was correct in granting summary judgment to Northern.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">I. Maryland\u2019s Uninsured Motorist Statute</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Appellants\u2019 first argument is that Maryland\u2019s UM statute does not permit an insured to be excluded from coverage if the insured is not in a \u201ccovered vehicle.\u201d Appellants contend that the statute applies to Northern\u2019s policy, even though it is a commercial insurance policy. Therefore, appellants argue the trial court erred in concluding that UM/UIM benefits cover only vehicles owned by Bushey Automotive or vehicles used in the business with transportation tags.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Appellee contends UM/UIM . coverage under the policy extends only to owned vehicles subject to Maryland compulsory uninsured motorists law, <em>ie. </em>the three vehicles listed in the policy, and vehicles used in the business with transportation tags. Appellee argues the insurance policy should be interpreted according to the parties\u2019 intentions at the time of contracting and that Mr. Bushey had the opportunity to purchase UM/UIM coverage for vehicles not owned by the business or otherwise used in the business, but he declined.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Appellants correctly state that the primary purpose of Maryland\u2019s UM statute, Insurance Article \u00a7 19-509, is to compensate innocent victims of automobile accidents who are unable to recover from uninsured or underinsured motorists. Md.Code Ann., Ins. \u00a7 19-509(1997); <em>Pennsylvania Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 157, 416 A.2d 734 (1980); <em>Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 216, 222, 706 A.2d 650 (1998). Appellants also correctly state that the statute lists two specific exclusions and the Court of Appeals has consistently held that additional exclusions are not permit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>ted.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>West Am. Ins. Co. v. Popa et al., </em>352 Md. 455, 474-75, 723 A.2d 1 (1998)(citing ten decisions by the Maryland Court of Appeals). However, appellants rely on cases that deal with personal, rather than commercial, insurance policies. Under appellants\u2019 contentions, the garage policy at issue would expose Northern to UM/UIM liability for all of Mr. Bushey\u2019s family members in any automobile accident, a result that would ignore the intention of the parties as well as the clear language of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The primary purpose in construing an insurance contract is to effectuate the intention of the parties. <em>Schuler v. Erie Ins. Exch. et al., </em>81 Md.App. 499, 505, 568 A.2d 873 (1990). \u201cWhere there is no ambiguity in an insurance contract the court has no alternative but to enforce the policy\u2019s terms.\u201d <em>Kendall v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>348 Md. 157, 171, 702 A.2d 767 (1997) (citing <em>Howell v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>305 Md. 435, 443, 505 A.2d 109 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">In this case, the parties\u2019 clear intention was to contract for a garage policy that insured covered autos only. We can see that from several unambiguous terms in the contract. First, in the \u201cCoverages/Limits\u201d section of the Garage and Dealers Section, appellant clearly understood that only those vehicles that were checked were covered for underinsured motorist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>coverage because not only did he check number 26 (owned autos subject to UM law), but he wrote in number 32 (company use). Second, the UM endorsement emphasizes that UM coverage exists only for covered autos by explicitly stating that it modifies the Garage Coverage Form <em>\u201c[j]or a covered \u2018auto\u2019 </em>licensed or principally garaged in, or \u2018garage operations\u2019 conducted in Maryland.\u201d Finally, it is clear the insurance was for business purposes. Under the \u201cDriver Information\u201d section of the Garage and Dealers Section, the insurance application states, \u201cList all drivers, including family members that will drive company vehicles, and employees who drive own vehicles on company business.\u201d Only Mr. Bushey and two of his employees are listed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">Furthermore, appellants had the option to purchase insurance coverage that covered vehicles not owned by the automotive repair business, but opted not to purchase it. As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">The fundamental problem with the Petitioners\u2019 arguments is that they are asking this Court to declare that they are entitled to something they did not elect to purchase.... [Ijnsureds are only entitled to the coverage that they pay for, and no more____ The Petitioners had the option of purchasing higher uninsured/underinsured limits of coverage for each vehicle by paying the associated higher premiums. They chose not to do this for two of the three vehicles insured under the same policy, and now they seek the benefits of a bargain they did not make.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-8\"><em>Kendall v. Nationwide Ins. Co., </em>348 Md. 157, 172, 174, 702 A.2d 767 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b200-9\">In a similar case, <em>Schuler v. Erie Ins. Exch., et al., </em>81 Md.App. 499, 504, 568 A.2d 873 (1990), this court considered whether the injured party, the spouse of the owner of a car insured by the owner\u2019s employer, was an insured under the commercial insurance policy at issue for purposes of UM and personal injury protection (PIP) coverage. The insurance company argued that only covered vehicles involved in accidents were insured under the policy, whereas the injured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>party argued that the owners of the cars and their spouses and relatives were covered despite the fact that the employer paid for the insurance. <em>Id. </em>at 502, 568 A.2d 873. A plain reading of the parties\u2019 insurance policy led this Court to conclude that the injured spouse was not an insured under the policy. <em>Id. </em>at 508, 568 A.2d 873. However, this Court also rejected the insurance company\u2019s argument that only covered vehicles were insured because the language of the policy did not so limit the coverage. <em>Id. </em>at 506-07, 568 A.2d 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In contrast to <em>Schuler, </em>the clear language of the policy at issue limits UM coverage to covered autos. The parties clearly understood they were contracting only for covered autos. We therefore reject appellants\u2019 argument that the policy\u2019s language does not restrict coverage only to vehicles used in the context of the Busheys\u2019 garage operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">II. The Uninsured Motorist Endorsement</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">Appellants contend the definitions of an insured in the UM endorsement extends coverage to family members even when not in covered autos. The UM endorsement defines an insured as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">B. WHO IS AN INSURED</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">1. You.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">2. <em>If </em>you are an individual, any \u201cfamily member\u201d.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-10\">3. Anyone else \u201coccupying\u201d a covered \u201cauto\u201d or a temporary substitute for a covered \u201cauto\u201d....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-11\">4. Anyone for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of \u201cbodily injury\u201d sustained by another \u201cinsured\u201d.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-12\">(Emphasis added). Appellants interpret this definition of an insured to mean that Miranda was an insured and covered under the policy regardless of what vehicle she was traveling in because there is no language in the first two definitions that specifically limits coverage to accidents in covered vehicles. Appellees contend that a plain reading of the UM endorsement and the policy as a whole shows that Miranda is not an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>insured at all and that UM/UIM coverage is limited only to covered autos.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">We agree with the trial court in its reading of the UM endorsement that the <em>commercial </em>insurance policy insured Bushey Automotive, which is a business entity, not an individual. Therefore, the second definition does not apply and family members are not insured under this commercial policy. <em>See Jensen v. United Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>524 N.W.2d 536 (Minn.Ct.App.1994)(holding daughter was not insured under commercial insurance policy because the named insured was a business, not an individual).</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Furthermore, as described above, the policy as a whole embraces covered autos only. In fact, even the UM endorsement states that it modifies the policy for covered autos only. The first sentence of the UM endorsement states, <em>\u201cFor a covered \u2018auto\u2019 </em>licensed or principally garaged in, or \u2018garage operations\u2019 conducted in Maryland, this endorsement modifies insurance provided under the [garage coverage form].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">Appellants primarily rely on <em>Young v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>120 Md.App. 216, 706 A.2d 650 (1998), for the proposition that the proper analysis in determining UM coverage begins and ends with the question of who is an insured, not whether an insured was in a covered auto. In <em>Young, </em>because the policy at issue had no limiting language regarding covered autos, this Court held that the insured was covered. <em>Id. </em>at 224, 706 A.2d 650. However, in this case, we find that the policy has limiting language that explicitly states that UM/UIM coverage applies only to covered autos. Thus, we conclude that Miranda was not an insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">We note that there is a dispute regarding whether Miranda met the definition of \u201cfamily member\u201d because she stayed with her grandparents during the week and may not be considered \u201ca resident of your household.\u201d However, this factual dispute is not material to the outcome of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">III. Parent-child Immunity</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">The circuit court concluded the doctrine of parent/child immunity barred appellants\u2019 individual wrongful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>death claims. Northern argued below that under the underin-sured motorist provision, the appellants have to be legally-entitled to recovery. Therefore, the parents would have to sue their daughter, Susan, and prove she was negligent, which is barred by parent/child immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Appellants argue that there is no authority in Maryland saying a parent cannot sue a child. We disagree. The Court of Appeals has applied the parent-child doctrine to preclude claims by a minor child against the parent as well as claims by a parent against the minor child. <em>See Schneider v. Schneider, </em>160 Md. 18, 152 A. 498 (1930)(mother could not sue her minor child for injuries sustained in an automobile accident in which she was a passenger and the child was the driver); <em>Latz v. Latz a/k/a Schafer, </em>10 Md.App. 720, 272 A.2d 485, <em>cert. denied, </em>261 Md. 726 (1971)(father may not sue his minor child individually or as administrator of his wife\u2019s estate where mother was killed while a passenger in an automobile accident in which her minor daughter was the driver). In <em>Schneider, </em>the Court of Appeals explained why a parent may not sue the minor child:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">The obstacle to the mother\u2019s recovery ... is in the fact that she sues a minor son, of whom she, jointly with the father, is the natural guardian.... The ordinary position of parent and guardian of a minor, and that of plaintiff seeking to recover from the minor, are positions which cannot both be occupied by one person at one and the same time.... [A minor is] dependent upon a parent to provide for him ... judgment and care.... In a suit against him he would ordinarily depend upon his parents to procure him an attorney, for he cannot appoint one.... [0]ne person cannot at the same time occupy the position of parent and natural guardian ... and the position of plaintiff demanding damages from the child at law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\"><em>Schneider, </em>160 Md. at 21-23, 152 A. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">Appellants argue that even if Maryland precludes claims by parents against their minor children, in this case, the parents should be permitted to sue because the liable party is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>deceased child, and the source of compensation is an insurance company. Therefore, protecting the sanctity of the family is inapplicable in this instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">We decline to allow a parent to sue a deceased child merely because the source of potential compensation is an insurance company. The Court of Appeals addressed this specific issue in <em>Frye v. Frye, </em>305 Md. 542, 562-67, 505 A.2d 826 (1986), and <em>Warren v. Warren, </em>336 Md. 618, 626-28, 650 A.2d 252 (1994), and declined to abrogate the parent-child immunity doctrine despite compulsory liability insurance laws. Rather, Maryland\u2019s highest court concluded that excluding motor torts from the parent-child immunity rule because of compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance would have an impact upon the insurance scheme and is therefore a matter for the Maryland legislature, not the judiciary. <em>Warren, </em>336 Md. at 627-28, 650 A.2d 252; <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 566-67, 505 A.2d 826.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">Whether the parent-child immunity doctrine applies in cases where the liable party is a deceased minor child appears to be one of first impression in Maryland. There have been only three exceptions to the parent-child immunity doctrine, none of which apply to this case. <em>Eagan v. Calhoun, </em>347 Md. 72, 75, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997)(citing <em>Mahnke v. Moore, </em>197 Md. 61, 77 A.2d 923 (1951), in which the court allowed a child to sue her father\u2019s estate for cruel and inhuman treatment; <em>Waltzinger v. Birsner, </em>212 Md. 107, 128 A.2d 617 (1957), in which an emancipated child could sue his parent after reaching the age of majority; and <em>Hatzinicolas v. Protopapas, </em>314 Md. 340, 550 A.2d 947 (1988), in which a child could sue his parent\u2019s business partner for negligence).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">The parent-child immunity doctrine is based on the public policy to preserve the peace and harmony of the family. <em>Frye, </em>305 Md. at 552, 505 A.2d 826. In <em>Warren v. Warren, </em>Judge Karwacki listed three additional reasons for the doctrine: the preservation of parental discipline and control, the prevention of fraud and collusion, and the threat that litigation between parents and children may deplete family resources. <em>Warren, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>336 Md. at 625, 650 A.2d 252. All of these justifications for the doctrine emphasize the family unit rather than the individual parent or child. Even though Susan, the liable party, is deceased, allowing appellants to sue their daughter for negligence goes against the public policy of preserving the peace and harmony of the family.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">The <em>Eagan </em>court specifically declined to allow for an immunity exception to acts of negligence, such as automobile accidents, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">although such tragedies may well put a serious strain on some of the family relationships, they do not generally destroy a parent-child relationship. A parent who negligently causes the death of his or her spouse or of a child can still maintain a parent-child relationship; <em>the family, even in its grief, can survive.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">347 Md. 72, 83, 698 A.2d 1097 (1997)(emphasis added). We feel constrained to follow that reasoning and do so in affirming the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">APPELLANTS TO PAY COSTS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-11\">.
