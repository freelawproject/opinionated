Plaintiff guaranteed this loan. Although denied by D. the evidence established the fact that the agreement of the parties was that D. should not be entitled to the shares so subscribed for until the indebtedness on account thereof should be fully paid, and that plaintiff was to have a lien on the shares for the sums advanced or guaranteed by him. The certificate remained in the stock book of the company from which it was taken by D. without plaintiffs knowledge, and was sold to the defendant through the negotiation of a person who was the agent and attorney both of D. and of the purchaser. Upon a bill to restrain the transfer of the shares and to enforce plaintiff\u2019s claim against the same. <em>Held, </em>that the plaintiff was entitled to a lien for the amounts advanced or guaranteed by him on the shares so issued to D.; that the attorney and agent of the purchaser from D. had knowledge of this claim; that such knowledge was notice to the purchaser, and that plaintiff\u2019s lien on the stock is consequently enforceable against such purchaser.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court No. 2, of Baltimore City (Sharp, J.), dismissing the bill of complaint.

Bansemer, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-11\">The only question which necessitated the taking of this appeal is whether the knowledge of his agent and attorney, Boyd is to be imputed to Boyce. The buying of this stock for Boyce was a commercial transaction on the part of Mr. Boyd, acting as attorney and agent. He was clothed with the broadest discretionary powers. Boyce exercised no judgment at all in the matter. His object was to make a profitable deal and Mr. Boyd was to handle the stock in the best manner he should decide and was to share profits receiving a third. Boyce\u2019s money was simply placed in his agent\u2019s hands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>to be manipulated in the agent\u2019s discretion: Under such circumstances the knowledge of the agent must be imputed to the principal. Whatever may be the rule in a few other jurisdictions, the Maryland decisions lay down the rule flatly that \u201c the principal is bound and affected with notice to his agent and is equally bound by the notice.\u201d <em>Mayor and City Council of Baltimore </em>v. <em>Whittington, </em>73 Md. 237; <em>Devries v. Shumate, </em>53 Md. 215; <em>Meechem on Agency, </em>718-719; <em>Reed's Appeal, </em>34 Pa. St. 209; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>101 U. S. 326; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Palmer, </em>102 U.

A pledge not only covers the debt, but the interest upon it and all necessary expenses. <em>Dowler </em>v. <em>Cushwa, </em>27 Md. 35. We rest the case on Mr. Schwind\u2019s strong equity in the matter. The stock is worth from <em>$2,000 </em>to <em>$2,400 </em>and when Schwind satisfies his claim, Boyce will still get approximately his purchase price.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b542-8\"><em>J.

The agreement on Schwind\u2019s part to become security to the building association for the second thousand dollars with which to take up the note he held was a new agreement, voluntarily made by Schwind for his own benefit, and made more than a year subsequent to the purchase of the stock. At this time the testimony shows that not one word was said by either party in reference to a lien on the Schwind Quarry Company\u2019s stock held by Delaney.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>Testimony shows that Boyd was the agent of Delaney to sell the stock and not of Boyce to buy. it. He (Boyd) did not hold himself out as Boyce\u2019s agent nor was he so considered. The evidence shows that <em>Boyd sold to Boyce </em>and <em>Boyce bought from Boyd. </em>Mr. Boyce considered Boyd his attorney simply because he had acted in that capacity for him in various matters for six or seven years,- but at' the time of this transaction he was not acting for him in any capacity. \u2022 The statement of Boyce that Boyd was his agent was erroneous, caused by reason of the fact that Boyd had .been his attorney' for several years past. Bpyd had not been employed or au-' thorized by Boyce to act as his agent in this matter. He, Boyce, acted in person for himself, dealing with and <em>buying'from </em>Boyd, the <em>agent of Delaney. </em>Boyd did not, <em>and' legally could not </em>act as attorney for vendor and vendee. It is a general rule that a party cannot in any agency of this kind actas agent or broker for both vendor and vendee in respect to <em>same </em>transaction. <em>Rasin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>41 Md. 159; <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Stump, </em>73 Md. 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-5\">An. <em>agent </em>pf the <em>seller cannot </em>become the agent of the <em>purchaser </em>in the same transaction. <em>Story on Agency, </em>sec. 211. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Dannah, </em>2 Camp. 203; <em>Dixon </em>v.

Ency., </em>322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b543-9\">The question as to whether notice acquired prior to agency may be binding on the principal has given rise to much diversity of opinion. It is held by some authorities that t\u00f3 visit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>the principal with notice of \u00e1 fact known to the agetit, such notice should have been gained by the agent during the course of the business in which he is employed, 1 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency., </em>1150. It is also held that the principal will be affected not only by notice acquired by agent during the continuance of the' agency,\u2019 but also by knowledge previously communicated, <em>provided it be present to the agents mind during the </em>\u201etransaction\u2022 <em>of his duties.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-5\">\"The former view' is held in this State in case of <em>Devries </em>v. <em>Shumate, </em>53 Md. 211, where the Court says \u201cprincipals are affected with all knowledge acquired by agent <em>in the course of Ms' employment.\"' </em>And again in <em>Whittington </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., </em>78 Md. 238; viz: ''\u201cThe principal is bound by notice received by his attorney (as'such) <em>in same transaction.\"</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-6\">Even if the l\u00e1tter view be \"followed there is no testimony that the claim of Schwind of lien on this stock was present to Boyd\u2019s mind at the time of' sale of stock.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b544-7\">Notice to an attorney binds the client only when the notice is a part of the particular cause in which the relation exists. <em>Stewart v.

Quarry Company of the par value of one hundred dollars per share ; that being unable to make payment he borrowed the money from the Calverton Building Association, for the'repayment of which the appellant became his surety; that in- order to\u2019 protect the complainant and save- him harmless, Delaney pledged the cer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>tificate of said shares to the complainant, and the same were deposited in the safe of the quarry company \u201c for the purpose of turning it over to the control, keeping and possession of the complainant.\u201d That Delaney, who had been made Secretary of the quarry company, made default in his payments to the building association whereby the complainant\u2019s obligation on account of his suretyship became absolute, for the sum of <em>$600 </em>due to the association; and in addition thereto the said Delaney on account of money paid by him for Delaney to the association for maturing instalments was indebted to him in the sum of $248.65. That Delaney was dismissed from the service -of the quarry company and when he was about to leave the service of the company, he abstracted from its safe, without the knowledge and consent of the appellant, the certificate of the stock, and \u201c in order to wipe out the equities existing between the complainant and himself, he has recently transferred \u201d it to the appellee Boyce; that Boyce if he had not actual notice \u201c of the equities which then attached to the stock,\u201d had such notice as \u201c put him upon inquiry in regard thereto.\u201d That Boyce is not a <em>bona fide </em>holder of said stock and that Delaney has still an interest therein and that Delaney is financially irresponsible. On final hearing the Court dismissed the bill and the complainant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">The controlling questions in the case are, 1st, did the appellant have a lien on the stock and 2nd, if he had, did Boyce have actual or constructive notice of it ?</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">As to the first question. Mr. Schwind testifies that he agreed to go his security to the building association, and that to secure him Delaney was to leave his certificate in the stock book until the association was repaid or until the stock was paid for. He further testified that there never was a delivery of the stock to Delaney. This testimony is in harmony with all the facts connected with the transactions of the parties. Mr. Schwind was the owner of the quarry. He proposed to form a corporation and put the business under its control. He desired that Delaney should be the owner of a portion of its stock. Delaney did subscribe for twenty shares, for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>he agreed to pay Schwind\" two thousand dollars. To enable him to do this, -Schwind assisted him with the association. He first became his surety to the association for one thousand dollars, which Delaney subsequently paid. For the residue Delaney gave his note to Schwind, and later on made another loan from the association to effect which Schwind aided him, by \u201c hypothecating for him again.\u201d When it is borne in mind that Delaney was financially irresponsible, it is not reasonable to believe that Schwind, as a reasonably prudent business man, would voluntarily put himself in a position where he might' be subjected to considerable loss, without providing some means whereby he could be protected. He claims he did so by securing the pledge of the stock and that it was on that account that the certificate was not to be delivered until he had been made safe. In fact it was not delivered, and Delaney never obtained the possession of it, until he abstracted it from the' company\u2019s safe, after he had been discharged from its service, without Schwind\u2019s knowledge or consent. Delaney himself makes no statement with reference to the formation of the quarry company, or as to how Schwind became his surety. He was asked if anything was said to Schwind after he had left the employment of the company \u201cas to his having a lien \u201d on the stock and his reply was, \u201c he never made a claim of a lien on my stock at all to me. All I have seen about a lien was when this paper was filed. He never mentioned a word in reference to a lien to me.\u201d All the details of the transaction as testified to by Schwind goes without denial from Delaney. Being without substantial contradiction and harmonizing as it does with what we regard as the probabilities of the matter, we must accept the statement he makes, and that being so are constrained to hold that the stock was pledged as set forth in the bill. It appears from the proof that to secure the two thousand dollars, Delaney incurred a liability to the association of $2,080. Of this has been paid $1,514.51, leaving still due the sum of $565.49 for which Schwind is still liable as surety. The stock is pledged to secure the payment of this sum, as well as interest due to Schwind, and whatever sum he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>has to pay for Delaney to the association on account of fines and maturing installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The remaining question is did Boyce have actual or constructive knowledge of the lien ? It is not claimed that he had actual notice, but it is contended on the part of the appellant that Boyd, who, it is said, was his attorney and agent in the transaction, had full notice, and that Boyce is affected with notice of everything that was within the knowledge of his agent. Boyce himself states in his evidence that Boyd was his agent, \u201cwith full authority,\u201d that he had given him power to act for him \u201cin buying the stock\u201d and that he had a verbal arrangement with him, that he \u201cwas to pay Mr. Boyd for acting as my (his) agent, one-third of what I (he) made on the stock.\u201d There is nothing in the testimony to contradict this statement, and the facts as they appear in the record fully warrant the view Mr. Boyce has taken of the matter. Boyd had been counsel for Boyce for six or seven years. The first he heard of the \u201cstock transaction\u201d was from Boyd in December, when Boyd offered to sell it to him. He knew however, then or shortly after and before the purchase was made, that Boyd was not the owner of the stock and that Boyd was merely to effect the purchase from Delaney. Boyce seems to have done absolutely nothing ; he made no inquiries about the stock \u201conly through Boyd,\u201d he gave Boyd full power to \u201cact for him in the premises\u201d with Delaney, he knew absolutely nothing about it except from Boyd, and he knew nothing of the quarry company; in fact everything was done by Boyd, who agreed to receive as compensation for his services one-third of what was made on the transaction. So thoroughly complete was Boyd\u2019s agency, that Boyce during it all was never brought in contact with Delaney and never saw him until they met for the first time at the taking of the testimony in this case. Under these circumstances it would appear idle to say that Boyd was not acting as Boyce\u2019s agent. The knowledge of Boyd in reference to Schwind\u2019s claim was acquired prior to the transaction in question in this case. \u2022 He has at least derived it from Schwind\u2019s answer in the equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>case that was pending between Schwind and Delaney, in which Schwind in his answer to the bill had set forth substantially all the facts in reference to his claim. It cannot be supposed that Boyd could have forgotten or have failed to bear it hr mind during his dealings with Boyce, and if such a supposition were possible, the fact that Delaney said to him during the negotiations for the stock, that \u201cif anything came out of these cases or any trouble for Mr. Boyce, he would make it good,\u201d make it entirely clear that he had not forgotten it. Under these circumstances the law applicable to the case is clear. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>101 U. S. 325; cited in <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Whittington, </em>78 Md. 238, where the question arose as to Ayer\u2019s notice of certain claims of another person, and- it was shown that the facts respecting them were within the knowledge of his attorney on whose judgment he had relied entirely, the Court said, that \u201cthe facts brought to the knowledge of their attorney in his inquiries respecting the note and the authority of Renick to pledge, are considered in law as brought to his knowledge * *. The law considers the principal as affected with notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged to his attorney.\u201d In another case, <em>The Distilled Spirits, </em>11 Wallace, 356, the Supreme Court has made a more complete statement of the doctrine. There, the Court after stating that \u201cin England the doctrine now seems to be established that if an agent at the time of effecting a purchase, has knowledge of any prior lien, trust or fraud affecting the property, no matter when he acquired such knowledge, is affected thereby,\u201d proceeds, \u201cthe general rule that a principal is bound by the knowledge of his agent, is based on the principle of law that it is the agent\u2019s duty to communicate to his principal the knowledge which he has respecting the subject-matter of the negotiation and the presumption that he will perform that duty. When it is not the agent\u2019s duty to communicate such knowledge, when it would be unlawful for him to do so, as for example when it has been acquired confidentially as attorney for a former client in a prior transaction, the reason of the rule ceases.\u201d After further discussion of the subject, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>says: \u201cOn the whole we think that the rule as finally settled by the English Courts, with the qualification above mentioned,is the true one, and is deduced from the best consideration of the reasons on which it is founded.\u201d This view is supported by the decisions in many of the States, and seems to be the better doctrine. The cases will be found collected in 1 <em>Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, </em>2nd ed., title Agency, p. 1150, to which we now refer. There were cited at the hearing two cases decided by this Court which were supposed to be in conflict with what we have said. But we do not think so. One of them, <em>Mayor </em>v. <em>Whittington (supra), </em>decided that notice to the agent and attorney bound their principal. The words of the Court are, \u201cand he, the principal, is equally bound by notice received by his attorney in the same transaction.\u201d But it is not decided whether notice which the attorney had received otherwise than in the same transaction would bind the principal or not. It was not necessary to go farther than it did in that case. The notice chargeable to the principal was such as his agent and attorney had derived from a legal proceeding in which a petition had been filed in his name, but without his actual knowledge that the proceedings showed the particular fact. The same may be said of the other case, <em>Devries </em>v. <em>Shumate, </em>53 Md. 215. In that the Court said the principal was affected \u201cwith all the knowledge acquired by the agent in the course of his employment,\u201d a proposition not controverted in this, but not sufficiently broad to embrace the point now being considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">Here, as we have said, Boyd had full knowledge of Schwind\u2019s equity and we cannot avoid the conclusion that he must have borne it in mind during the negotiations for the sale of the stock by Delaney. Boyce testifies that he was not informed of it. We think he should have been, but though he was not, the knowledge Boyd had must be imputed to him, and he now stands in no other or better attitude, than he would .have had if he had received actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The decree below must be reversed and the cause remanded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>for a new decree in conformity with the principles set forth in this, opinion.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AKg\">(Decided January 17th, 1902.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b550-5\"><em>Decree reversed with costs to the ap- </em>.. <em>pellant and remanded.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
