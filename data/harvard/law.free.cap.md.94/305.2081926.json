After the work was begun defendants complained of the boiler that had been furnished and other alleged defects and the parties modified the contract by agreeing that the plaintiff should put in a new boiler, at an increased cost, to be made so as to pass the inspection of a casualty company and to sustain a pressure of one hundred pounds to the square inch. Plaintiff ordered a new boiler to be made and subsequently defendants required that it be made capable of sustaining 130 lbs. to the inch. To this plaintiff did not agree. The engine put in by the plaintiff did not develop the required 45 horse power, and he offered to furnish a new one without extra charge. In February, 1900, before either the new boiler or the new engine had been erected, defendants rescinded the contract alleging numerous breaches by the plaintiff and refused to allow him to proceed further. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>In an action to recover for the work already done and damages for the breach of the contract. <em>Held,</em></syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-4\">ist. That the plaintiff was bound to do the work contracted for within a reasonable time, and if he first put up an engine that was not in conformity with the contract, he was not entitled, two months after the contract was made, to take out that engine and substitute another, without defendants\u2019 consent, when to do so would so delay the work as to make its completion within a reasonable time impossible.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b336-5\">2nd.

The first raises a question of evidence; the second brings up for' review the action of the lower Court upon the prayers that were severally offered by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In the first exception, the question presented arose as follows. The plaintiff offered the written contract, which provided among other things that the boiler should bean \u201chorizontal boiler 60 inches diameter, 13 ft. long, actual 70-horse power second hand but in good condition also evidence tending to show that he had delivered on the premises such a boiler. He then offered a paper purporting on its face to be a certificate of the State Inspector to the effect that the said boiler was in good condition and capable of sustaining a pressure of 100 lbs. to the square inch. To the admission of this paper the defendants objected, \u201cunless the plaintiff proposed to follow it up by identifying the boiler furnished by the plaintiff with the boiler mentioned in the certificates.\u201d The plaintiff then offered proof tending to prove that <em>\u201c]. </em>C. Smith, the State Inspector,\u201d gave the certificate to the plaintiff and that \u201che saw, examined and tested the boiler again in the basement of the defendants\u2019 factory, and that it was the boiler covered by the certificate.\u201d The Court thereupon permitted the paper to go to the jury. After much testimony had been taken, and all the evidence on both sides was in, the defendants moved the Court to exclude the certificate from the jury for the reasons, 1st., that there was no identification of the boiler inspected with that furnished by the plaintiff, and 2nd., \u201cbecause there was no proof of the alleged signature of the State Inspector.\u201d The Court overruled the motion, and the defendants excepted. There had been no additional testimony offered between the time of its admission by the Court and that of the entering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>the motion. The motion therefore was nothing else than a request of the Court to review and reverse its previous ruling. That ruling the defendants had permitted to pass without reserving an exception, as they might have done. If they desired to raise any question as to signature of the Inspector, it was open to them at the time the paper was offered to do so. They should have done so at that time, and it was too late to make the objection after the Court had ruled upon its admission, unless something had intervened that gave them notice of objections of which prior thereto they had had no information. In <em>Dent </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>5 Gill, 127, this Court said, it was the duty of counsel, if aware of the objections to the admissibility of evidence, to object at the time it is offered, or if unapprised of such objections at the time the evidence had gone to the jury, he must raise his objections within a reasonable time thereafter. \u201cTo allow a greater latitude, as to the time of raising such objections to testimony, might be productive of much inconvenience and injustice.\u201d <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>Hendry, </em>18 Md. 188; <em>Davis and wife </em>v. <em>Patton, </em>19 Md. 128; <em>Marfield v. Davidson, </em>8 G. &amp; J. 213. We find no error in this ruling of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">The plaintiff offered five prayers, all of which were granted; the defendants, nineteen, of which eight were granted, eight rejected, and two rejected as offered but granted with modifications. The original written agreement was proved, as set forth in the <em>narr. </em>The plaintiff commenced the work and delivered on the premises a boiler and proceeded to connect it as provided in the agreement. On the 1 ith of January, 1900, the defendants wrote to the plaintiff, that \u201cthe boiler you have placed in our factory does not come up to the terms of your contract,\u201d and in the same letter proceeded to state many other things in which, they claimed, the plaintiff had not complied with the terms of his contract.' There was also evidence tending to show that prior to the date of that letter there had been complaints of the boiler, and that the plaintiff had offered to substitute therefor a new boiler, and install that in the factory at an increased cost to the defendants of three <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>hundred dollars On the tenth day of January, 1900, the defendants wrote, \u201cwe agree to this on the following conditions,\u201d viz. (among others) that the original contract of November 29th, should be still in force except \u201cso far as we now agree to change it; \u201d no rights to be surrendered under that paper ; the new boiler to be made \u201caccording to specifications furnished by the Maryland Casualty Company,\u201d copy to be furnished by the defendants ; and the \u201cwork of removing the boiler now in, not to be begun until the weather will permit us to run our business without heat in the building; and must be finished within a reasonable time, say thirty days from time you start to put boiler in,\u201d This qualified acceptance of the plaintiff\u2019s offer was in turn accepted by him, as will appear from his letter of February roth. There was also evidence tending to prove that if the plaintiff had been permitted to continue his work, he would have completed it with \u201cdue diligence and dispatch,\u201d and would have been able to make.,the alterations and corrections which were incidental to the unfinished state of the work ; and that he had offered to make such alterations and corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The defendants offered evidence tending to prove that the contract, modified as stated, was not completed by the plaintiff according to its terms ; that its completion \u201c was not waived by the defendants nor prevented by them or by their fault,\u201d and that they had stopped the work because the \u201c plaintiff knowingly failed to comply with the material terms of his contract.\u201d There was also evidence to show that the engine furnished did not come up to the requirements of the contract, in that it did not develop the requisite horse power. \u25a0 The plaintiff in his letter of the 13th of January admitted this, and proposed to install another in its place. He writes, \u201c as the ball engine does not come up to the horse power, which, I supposed it would develop, when my contract was made with you, * * * I propose to install \u201d in place of it, another (which he describes) \u201cwhich will give you under 300 revolutions 49 I. H. P. this being 4 indicated H. P. above what I originally claimed for the ball engine.\u201d It appears that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>negotiations had already been begun and were afterwards continued, having for their object the installation of the new engine ; but they do not seem to have culminated in an agreement. On February ioth the defendants write: \u201cYou wrote us a letter some time ago stating you would put us in a New Erie ball engine 9^x10. This point also should be settled.\u201d \u201c As to accepting any part of the work, and paying a consideration for the same, we cannot do this. If we give the contract to another, it must be in its entirety. We know of but two alternatives\u2014one for you to go ahead and finish your work according to the new specifications\u2014the other to rescind your contract and remove your material. Unless you select between the two in the next few days, we will <em>concede </em>that you have chosen the latter and will go ahead and give the contract to another firm.\u201d The plaintiff in his reply to this letter, on the same day, after stating his view of the matters between them, and that the defendants had agreed through Mr. James E. North and Mr. Palmer that \u201c they would only accept \u201d the new engine, subject to the acceptance of the Maryland Casualty Company, says that had he \u201c been allowed to proceed with his contract the new Ames boiler and the new ball engine would have been finished complete and turned over to you long ago\u201d On 13th February the defendants write him that they cannot accept either one of the offers of February ioth ; that the breaches of his contract are numerous; that it was then \u201cnearly three months since the work was begun, and as we cannot see that you are now any nearer a conclusion than when you started, we are compelled to cease further negotiations with you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">There was also evidence tending to show that had the plaintiff fully performed the contract as modified, and had furnished the new boiler and engine, he would have lost $300 or $400.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Upon this state of the proof, the Court by the first prayer of the plaintiff instructed the jury that if they found the original written contract, and the modification of the same with respect to the boiler, and that about the 17th January, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>1900, the plaintiff offered and agreed to furnish a new engine that would develop \u201c the horse power contracted for and asked to be permitted to telephone an order for the same and otherwise offered and agreed to finish and complete the said plant in all other respects in conformity with the contract of 29th November \u201d and that the defendants prevented him from so doing, then the plaintiff was entitled to recover, for \u201c such sum of money\u201d as was \u201claid out and expended\u201d by him, less the value of the boiler and engine, which had been returned to the plaintiff under the agreement of counsel, as appeared by the evidence in the case. Now the contract required that the plaintiff should furnish an engine with an actual horse power of forty-five and to set up the same and connect it, in the manner particularly described. This was a material part of the contract. The defendants had the right to require that it be fully performed, and were not bound to accept the work or any part of it, until such an engine had been set up. If, therefore, the plaintiff installed in the defendants' factory an engine that could not develop the requisite horse power, having failed to perform his contract, he can bring no action to recover either in general or special assumpsit, unless he have some legal excuse for his failure to do so. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>Vogeler, </em>52 Md. 666; notes to <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 Smith\u2019s Leading cases, 37; <em>Denmead </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>15 Md. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">If, on the other hand, the plaintiff, after part performance in the manner required by the contract, was without fault oh his part, but was prevented by the act of the defendants from completing his part, he might either treat the contract as still in existence and sue upon it for a breach. <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>36 Md. 583; or he might regard the contract as rescinded and recover in general <em>assumpsit </em>for what he had actually done. <em>Bull </em>v. <em>Schuberth, </em>2 Md. 57; <em>Merritt </em>v. <em>Penin. Con. Co., </em>91 Md. 453.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In the former case, the damages \u201c would include compensation for the labor done and materials furnished and such further sum in damages as might, upon legal principles, be assessed for the breach of the contract.\u201d <em>Black </em>v. <em>Woodrow, </em>39 Md. 217; <em>United States v. Behan, </em>110 U. S. 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>In the latter, where he elects to rescind the contract, and sues in general <em>assumpsit, </em>he cannot recover damages for a breach of the contract, either for outlay or for loss of profits, but merely for the value of his services actually performed as upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>If, however, the plaintiff did not put in an engine that conformed to the contract, and was then prevented from proceeding further, he would still have the right to recover in general <em>assumpsit </em>for whatever part of the work that has been accepted by the defendants. <em>Watchman &amp; Bratt </em>v. <em>Crook, </em>5 G. &amp; J. 263; <em>Pres. Church </em>v. <em>Hoopes, </em>66 Md. 603; <em>Waggaman </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>88 Md. 266; <em>Rodemer v. Hazlehurst, </em>9 Gill, 294; <em>Dermott </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>23 Howard, 220; notes to <em>Cutter </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>2 Smith\u2019s Lead. Cases, 1; <em>Denmead </em>v. <em>Coburn, </em>15 Md. 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">This prayer is based on the theory that the plaintiff has been without fault, and lays down a rule of damages applicable only to such a case. It fails, however, to require that the jury shall find that the plaintiff did furnish an engine that came up to the requirements of the contract. In lieu of that they are directed that the plaintiff may recover if they find that he <em>offered </em>to furnish another engine that would develop the horse power contracted for, upon the theory that the plaintiff, having furnished an inadequate engine, had the right to be permitted by the defendants to enter upon the premises for the purpose of removing the old engine and replacing it with the new one, and that he had this right under and by virtue of the provisions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">That question may be considered not only in connection with this prayer, but also with the plaintiff\u2019s fourth prayer, which announces substantially the same proposition. Neither of these prayers require the jury to find that the defendants ever agreed that the substitution of a new engine should be made by the plaintiff. There was evidence that the defendants had refused to make any new agreement about the matter. The hypothesis of the prayers therefore demands the assumption that it was quite immaterial whether the defendants ever so agreed or not, and that it was sufficient if they found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the plaintiff made the proposal. At the time, however, such proposal was made, there had been placed in the defendants\u2019 factory an engine that was conceded to be totally inadequate to measure up to the requirements of the contract. The contract fixed no time for the completion of the work, and in such case it is implied that it shall be within a reasonable time. <em>Coates &amp; Glenn </em>v. <em>Sangston, </em>5 Md. 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The original contract was entered into on the 29th of November, and more than two months had elapsed when the defendants were confronted with a demand that the plaintiff shall be permitted to tear out the engine and replace it with another. Was such a demand reasonable at that time ? Whether it would so delay the completion of the work as to make the time when the work could be completed so unreasonable as to authorize a recission of the contract, was matter of law for the Court and not matter of fact for the jury. <em>Ragan </em>v. Gaither, 11 G. &amp; J. 490.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">Neither of these prayers annex any limitations upon the effect of the plaintiff\u2019s offer, except the first which leaves the question of reasonableness to the jury. But aside from these considerations there is nothing in the contract nor (unless the jury find there was an agreement with respect to the substitution) anything in the letters or conversations between the parties that could authorize the plaintiff to enter upon the premises of the defendants for the purpose of tearing out anything that had been put there. The contract contemplated the installation of a steam plant, and when that was done the plaintiff\u2019s right of entry upon the premises to do work would terminate. Nor is there anything in the contract that contemplates that the plaintiff should have the right to experiment, so that if he failed at first he might make another effort. If there was a failure again would he have a right to try again, and yet again, if there was another failure ? And if it were unreasonable to hold that he might have an indefinite number of opportunities, upon what principle should he be entitled to more than one? The evidence shows that the defendants\u2019 building was used as a factory, and that the steam plant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>necessary for the conduct of the business. The defendants in a letter to the plaintiff, on February i o, say, \u201c We have two floors that have been idle since you started your work, and have not been able to formulate our plans,\u201d &amp;c. Under these circumstances it is idle to suppose that when the contract was made it was not contemplated that the plaintiff should furnish the plant within a reasonable time, without the privilege of making a second attempt in case of a failure. These prayers for the reasons we have stated were both defective, and should have been rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">The second and third and fifth prayers of the plaintiff were properly granted. If .as stated in the second the jury found that the parties agreed with respect to the substitution of the new boiler, then the original contract was waived to the extent of the modification but under the evidence no further. <em>Howard v. W. &amp; S. R. R. </em>Co., 1 Gill, 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">The defendants\u2019 first and third prayers were also properly rejected. The third presented a matter of law for the finding of the jury, in that they were required to find that the failure of the plaintiff was \u201cnot caused by a <em>legal </em>excuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The fifth prayer directs the jury that if they find the work was not completed \u201cin accordance with the terms of the contract as modified,\u201d that \u201cunder the pleadings\u201d the plaintiff could not recover, unless they find for the plaintiff under the seventh count. This prayer ignored all the evidence as to defendants\u2019 action in prevention of the work. And if there was part performance in accordance with the terms of the contract, but the plaintiff was prevented by the act or consent of the defendants from performing the residue, he may recover for the work actually done in general <em>assumpsit. Rodemer v. </em>Hazlehurst, 9 Gill, 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">The seventh, eighth and ninth prayers are open to the same objection. The eighth and ninth prayers are also objectionable because they make the condition of the second-hand boiler the test of the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover, whereas there was evidence from which the jury might find that that feature of the contract had beep modified, so that the plaintiff had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>right to furnish a new boiler, in substitution of the secondhand one that had been theretofore furnished.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b350-7\">(Decided January 16th, 1902.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">By the eleventh and twelfth prayers the jury were told that the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover if the work done was not \u201cfirst-class in every respect.\u201d It is well settled however that \u201cif there is only a partial failure of performance by one party to a contract for which there may be a compensation in damages the contract is not put an end to.\u201d <em>Warfield </em>v. <em>Booth, </em>33 Md. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">For the same reason, the modifications of the Court to the defendants\u2019 sixth, sixteenth and nineteenth prayers were proper. The fourteenth prayer was improper because of the fact that it ignored all the evidence of the prevention of the work. If without fault of the plaintiff the defendants arbitrarily stopped the work, the plaintiff could regard such conduct on their part as a \u201cviolation of the contract in omnibus\u201d and might \u201cat once treat it as a breach of the entire contract and bring his action accordingly.\u201d <em>Dugan </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>36 Md. 583. The plaintiff\u2019s first and fourth prayers having been improperly granted, the judgment will be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed with costs and new trial awarded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
