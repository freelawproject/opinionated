In the deed to the plaintiff conveying the adjoining part of the lot, it was described as having a front on the street of 46 feet. When defendant began to build on his lot, it was found that to use a front of 41 feet would encroach about eight inches on the 46 feet front claimed by the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the description in the deed to the plaintiff of 46 feet, being definite, should prevail over the description of about 41 feet in defendant\u2019s deed and that the plaintiff is entitled to a frontage of 46 feet, of which he had been in possession.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b492-10\">An injunction will be granted to restrain the defendant from building beyond the true lines of his lot of ground and on that belonging to plaintiff, an adjoining owner.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b492-11\">Appeal from a decree of the Circuit Court for Washington County, (Stake, J.)</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b492-12\">The cause was argued before McSherry, C.

The prayer of the bill, in addition to the prayer for general relief is for an injunction to restrain and enjoin the defendant from proceeding further in the erection of the house upon the plaintiff\u2019s lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>The defendant in his answer admits that the plaintiff is the owner of the lot of ground, as alleged in the bill, but denies that this lot has a frontage of forty-six feet on Washington street. The answer further denies that the defendant has trespassed on the plaintiff\u2019s property or crossed the line dividing the two lots of ground, on the lot of the plaintiff, in the building of the wall, but that he is within the lines of his own property as the same is designated on the plan of Hagerstown. It also denies that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief prayed or any relief at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The plaintiff obtained a preliminary injunction on the 19th of June, 1901, which was subsequently made perpetual, after a hearing of the case on a motion to dissolve and on answer filed and proof taken, and it is from the decree thus granted that this appeal has been taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">The main question presented on this appeal is whether the appellee has made out a case for equitable relief by writ of injunction. The law is well settled that an injunction will not issue to restrain a trespass simply as such, but it will be granted where the injury alleged is irreparable, or where full and adequate relief cannot be had at law or where the trespass is of a character to work destruction of the property as it had been held and enjoyed or where it is necessary to prevent a multiplicity of litigation. <em>White </em>v. <em>Flannigain, </em>1 Md. 525; <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Ritter, </em>7 Md. 408; <em>Clayton </em>v. <em>Shoemaker, </em>67 Md. 216; <em>Balto Belt R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>75 Md. 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">According to the testimony in this case it is impossible that each party can have the frontage on West Washington street called for in their deeds. The plaintiff\u2019s deed is dated the 31st of January, 1894, and conveys \u201c all that certain piece or parcel of ground, situate and being on the south side of West Washington street in the town of Hagerstown, being the eastern half or portion of the lot on the plan of the town as Lot No. 89, the said portion hereby sold and conveyed, measuring <em>forty-six feet front </em>and two hundred and forty feet deep,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">The defendant\u2019s deed is dated on the 7th of February, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>1901, and the property conveyed thereby is described \u201cas all that half lot or parcel of ground situate on the south side of West Washington street, in Hagerstown, adjoining on the west the property of E. V. L. Ragan, and on the east the property of Dr. J. McPherson Scott, fronting <em>forty-one feet, </em>more or less, on said Washington street and running back southwardly two hundred and forty feet to an alley, being the western half of the lot known and designated on the map of Hagerstown, as lot No. 90.\u201d In a former conveyance of the identical lot, the land therein described, is stated to be the half lot or portion of ground No. 90, fronting on Washington street, about forty-one feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">So far, then, as the deeds in the case show, the title of the appellee to a frontage of forty-six feet on the south side of West Washington street, in Hagerstown is certain and beyond any dispute, while the appellant\u2019s frontage to his lot is given by one deed at about forty-one feet, and by another forty-one feet more or less. Under this state of case, we think it is clear that the more definite and certain description in the deed calling for forty-six feet, will prevail over the. uncertain expression of \u201cabout forty-one feet\u201d or \u201cforty-one feet, more or less.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">Besides this, the proof in the case shows that the appellant has taken possession, in the erection of the new house of a portion of the appellee\u2019s lot, thereby reducing and diminishing the frontage of this lot on West Washington street, from five to eight inches.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">It is clear, we think, that a trespass of this character works a destruction of the property as it had been held and enjoyed by the owner, and that full and adequate relief could not be had at law. In <em>Herr v. Bierbower, </em>3 Md. Ch. 458, the Chancellor said : \u201cTaking possession of a portion of their lot and digging upon it a foundation for a building and erecting a building upon that foundation, thereby reducing the front of the lot so as to prevent their building upon it themselves, in the mode which would be most advantageous, surely goes to the destruction, <em>pro tanto, </em>of the estate and injures the just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>enjoyment of the property in the future. It is not a mere trespass for which a pecuniary compensation may be obtained in the ordinary course of law, but the plaintiff\u2019s estate would be destroyed to a certain extent, by rendering it unfit for the erection of two houses. And it is no answer to say that if the plaintiffs recover the land in dispute in an action of ejectment they would get the wall which the defendant put upon it, because that wall, if suffered to remain would still prevent their erecting two houses upon their lot. The wall would have to be removed and the foundation filled up, before they could have the just use and enjoyment of their property.\u201d</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"b496-7\">(Decided January 17th, 1902.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We think, therefore, upon a careful examination of this case, that there was ample ground for the injunction granted by the Court below and the order appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">\n<em>Order affirmed, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
