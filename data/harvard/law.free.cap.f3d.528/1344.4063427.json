We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b865-16\">This case reaches us after a long history, including a previous appeal to this court. The factual background was explained in our prior opinion and will not be repeated here. <em>See Consolidation Coal Co. v. United States, </em>351 F.3d 1374 (Fed.Cir.2003). Following our remand in <em>Consolidation Coal, </em>the Court of Federal Claims granted summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff coal producers on the issue of liability. <em>Consolidation Coal Co. v. United States, </em>64 Fed.Cl. 718 (2005). The court ruled that, as applied to coal that is exported, the method by which the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) collects its reclamation fee violates the Export Clause of the Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The coal producers moved for judgment in favor of Jim Walter Resources (JWR), who is one of five test plaintiffs. On February 22, 2007, the court entered judgment in favor of JWR. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b866-5\">We review the Court of Federal Claims\u2019s grant of summary judgment without deference. <em>Old Stone Corp. v. United States, </em>450 F.3d 1360, 1367 (Fed.Cir.2006). \u201cStatutory interpretation is a question of law that we review <em>de novo.\u201d Wesleyan Co. v. Harvey, </em>454 F.3d 1375, 1378 (Fed.Cir.2006). The only question before this court is one of statutory interpretation of 30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(a). Pursuant to the statute, the reclamation fee is imposed upon \u201ccoal produced\u201d in the United States:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">All operators of coal mining operations ... shall pay ... a reclamation fee of 35 cents per ton of <em>coal produced </em>by surface mining and 15 cents per ton of <em>coal produced </em>by underground mining or 10 per centum of the value of the coal at the mine, as determined by the Secretary. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-7\">30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1232(a) (emphases added). Neither the statute nor OSM\u2019s regulations specifically define the term \u201ccoal produced.\u201d OSM\u2019s regulations provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">(a) The operator shall pay a reclamation fee on each ton of <em>coal produced </em>for sale, transfer, or use, including the products of in situ mining.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">(b) The fee shall be determined by the weight and value at the time of initial bona fide sale, transfer of ownership, or use by the operator.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b866-10\">30 C.F.R. \u00a7 870.12 (emphasis added). If \u201ccoal produced\u201d in \u00a7 1232(a) refers solely to coal extracted then the disputed portion of the statute does not render the statute unconstitutional under the Export Clause. If, however, \u201ccoal produced\u201d is interpreted to include the entire process of extracting and selling coal\u2014if it is a tax on extraction <em>and </em>sale\u2014then, as it applies to sales that occur in the export process, it is an unconstitutional violation of the Export Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-11\">Where a possible construction of a statute would render the statute unconstitutional, courts must construe the statute \u201cto avoid such problems unless such construction is plainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Bldg &amp; Constr. Trades Council, </em>485 U.S. 568, 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392, 99 L.Ed.2d 645 (1988). This canon of constitutional avoidance is subject only to the qualification that the interpretation that \u201csave[s] a statute from unconstitutionality\u201d must be reasonable\u2014that is, the saving construction must not be \u201cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575, 108 S.Ct. 1392. \u201cThe elementary rule is that every reasonable construction must be resorted to, in order to save the statute from unconstitutionality.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hooper v. California, </em>155 U.S. 648, 657, 15 S.Ct. 207, 39 L.Ed. 297 (1895)).</p>\n<p id=\"b866-12\">Both sides agree the reclamation fee would be constitutional if imposed solely on coal extracted. We agree with the government that \u201ccoal produced\u201d in \u00a7 1232(a) can reasonably be interpreted to mean \u201ccoal extracted,\u201d and that this interpretation avoids a potential violation of the Export Clause. JWR argues that in <em>Drummond Coal Co. v. Hodel, </em>796 F.2d 503 (D.C.Cir.1986) this same statutory language \u201ccoal produced\u201d was interpreted as including both the extraction and sale of coal. In <em>Drummond, </em>however, the D.C. Circuit was not interpreting the statute in light of the potential conflict with the Export Clause. The issue of the constitutionality of the reclamation fee as applied to exports simply was not raised. <em>Id. </em>at 503-08. Moreover, the <em>Drummond </em>court did not conclude that the language of the statute mandated the construction, but rather it held that the statute was ambiguous: \u201cLike the district court, we do not find the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>ordinary meaning of that term unambiguous: \u2018Production could reasonably be interpreted to include the entire process of extracting and selling coal, complete from pit to buyer\u2019s door, or it could refer solely to the process of extraction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 505. <em>Drummond </em>involved the validity of a government regulation that directed that in calculating the tax on the gross weight of coal after it had been mined but before sale, the gross weight included impurities such as water that had not been removed. The court did not itself independently determine the meaning of the statutory term \u201ccoal produced,\u201d but instead gave <em>Chevron </em>deference to the regulatory definition of that term, which included water as part of the \u201ccoal produced.\u201d 796 F.2d at 507. In the present case, in contrast, the sole question is whether, in determining if the statute violates the constitutional prohibition of export taxes, \u201ccoal produced\u201d properly is defined as \u201ccoal extracted.\u201d The government asserted that the plain meaning of the statute is that \u201ccoal produced\u201d is to be interpreted as \u201ccoal extracted.\u201d Even if we were to assume that the statute is ambiguous as to the meaning of \u201ccoal produced,\u201d the government\u2019s construction must still prevail as it is the only reasonable construction which preserves the constitutionality of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\">JWR also argues that the position taken by the government in this case, that \u201ccoal produced\u201d is limited to \u201ccoal extracted,\u201d is inconsistent with the position the government took in <em>Drummond. </em>Although the government disputes the argument that it has taken inconsistent positions, either way, the government\u2019s interpretation of \u201ccoal produced\u201d in this case must prevail. Neither the government, nor this court, are bound by any contrary assertions by the government regarding the statutory interpretation of \u201ccoal produced\u201d where the canon of constitutional avoidance mandates that we adopt the reasonable construction that as applied to the SMCRA reclamation fee \u201ccoal produced\u201d is limited to \u201ccoal extracted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the grant of summary judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">\n<em>REVERSED and REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b865-9\">.
