Plaintiff also fails to sufficiently allege injury caused by the alleged fraud. It cannot allege injury because the undertaking to be posted by defendant 400 Fifth adequately secures it from the loss of its $45 million deposit <em>(see New York City Tr. Auth. v Morris J. Eisen, P.C., </em>276 AD2d 78, 85 [1st Dept 2000] [\u201ca cause of action for fraud cannot accrue until every element of the claim, including injury, can truthfully be alleged\u201d]). Plaintiffs assertion that it made material concessions during the negotiation of the terms of the third amended agreement in reliance on 400 Fifth\u2019s representation that it had invested $100 million of equity in the project is insufficient to plead injury because the alleged loss is speculative <em>(see Lama Holding Co. v Smith Barney, </em>88 NY2d 413, 422 [1996]). Absent a predicate claim for fraud, plaintiffs claim of aiding and abetting fraud also fails <em>(Vilar v Rutledge, </em>106 AD3d 489, 490 [1st Dept 2013]).</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">Because this action to foreclose on the vendee\u2019s lien is equitable in nature <em>(see Elterman v Hyman, </em>192 NY 113, 125-126 [1908]), plaintiff is not entitled as of right to the 9% statutory interest rate in the calculation of 400 Fifth\u2019s undertaking <em>(see </em>CPLR 5001 [a]; 5004, 6515 [1]). The equitable vendee\u2019s lien extended only to the $45 million that plaintiff had advanced towards that purchase money <em>(see Elterman, </em>192 NY at 125). To the extent the initial agreement provided for the crediting of interest to the purchase price of the property, and therefore to the lien <em>(see Royle Realty Co. v Juhring, </em>21 AD2d 911 [2d Dept 1964], <em>affd </em>16 NY2d 566 [1965]), the third amended agreement, which is the governing contract, does not provide for interest or credits to the purchase price aside from the $45 million that plaintiff paid.
