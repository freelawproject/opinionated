The extraordinary remedy of mandamus will lie only to compel the performance of a ministerial act and only when there exists a clear legal right to the relief sought <em>(see Matter of Legal Aid Socy. of Sullivan County v Scheinman, </em>53 NY2d 12, 16 [1981]). The petitioners have failed to demonstrate a clear legal right to the relief sought pursuant to CPLR article 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The petitioners\u2019 remaining contentions, pursuant to Election Law article 16, are without merit. Skelos, J.P, Balkin, Leventhal and Sgroi, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
