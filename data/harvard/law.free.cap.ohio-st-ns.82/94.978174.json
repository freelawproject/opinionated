In such a case the majority of directors could absolutely control forever the trust property, and make worthless and valueless anyone\u2019s stock and raise to high value another\u2019s. 2 Thompson on Corporations, Section 2360, <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-7\">Even a by-law made and properly passed, giving such power, would be void as against its own members unless authorized by express statute or charter. 2 Thompson on Corporations, Sections 2310, 2311; <em>In re Klaus, 67 </em>Wis., 401.</p>\n<p data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-8\">But even in case of express authority, while binding among each other <em>(i. e., </em>the stockholders), a different question is presented as to third persons. <em>Bank </em>v. <em>Wasson, </em>48 Ia., 336.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b182-9\">The fact that the charter of a corporation, or the general law under which it is formed, expressly confers upon it, or its directors, the power to regulate transfers of stock, does not give unlimited power to refuse to recognize transfers. It merely gives the power to prescribe such regulations as may be reasonably necessary to protect the corporation. Under the pretense of prescribing the manner of the transfer the association cannot clog <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the transfer with useless restrictions, or make it dependent upon the consent of the directors or other stockholders. <em>Bloede Co. </em>v. <em>Bloede, </em>84 Md., 129, 57 Am.

The question of doubt in the case concerns the validity of the by-law and its binding obligation upon the plaintiff. Separate analysis of the very numerous cases cited in the briefs of counsel is impracticable and unnecessary. A few generalizations will meet the requirements of most of the cases and materially narrow the field of inquiry. The \u2022 corporation being organized under the laws of the state of Delaware, although its principal place of business is in Ohio where the plaintiff resides and where these transactions in stock were conducted, he had actual knowledge that he was acquiring the stock of a Delaware corporation and l^e is deemed to know all restrictions which the laws of that state or by-laws not inconsistent with them imposed upon its alienation. <em>Relfe </em>v. <em>Rundle, </em>103 U. S., 222; <em>Hammond </em>v. <em>Hastings, </em>134 U. S., 401. Ef<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>fective regulations of the transfer of stock in a corporation must be prescribed in statutes or in by-laws of the corporation which are not inconsistent with the statutes. A corporation may not refuse to transfer stock because of the motive which may have prompted the transferee to acquire it, this being upon the well established ground that however important may be the motive ' which prompts one to the commission of a wrong, the motive which prompts him to the exercise of a legal right .can never be the subject of judicial inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">By-laws of a corporation, to be valid, must not contravene the policy defined in the statute of its creation, and this renders it entirely unnecessary to consider further the cases in which it has been held that corporations formed under the national banking laws may not provide for liens upon their stock to secure the debts of their stockholders, since the laws provide expressly that they may not loan money upon the security of their stock. When statutes under which corporations are formed authorize them to make by-laws upon specifically named subjects there is an implied denial of authority to make by-laws upon subjects not named.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In very many cases it has been held that a bylaw imposing a restrictive regulation upon the transfer of stock is invalid unless it is expressly authorized by statute. Quite uniformly when that conclusion is reached it is placed upon the ground that such regulations impose a restraint upon the alienation of property and that they are therefore inimical to public policy. It does not appear to have been deemed necessary in these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>cases to- demonstrate that the right to alienate property should be more highly regarded than the right to make contracts respecting it. By the assumption that it should be, a task of much obvious difficulty has been avoided. In a few cases the opposite conclusion has been reached and supported by reasons of much strength. In <em>New England Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Abbott, </em>162 Mass., 148 (27 L. R. A., 271), a by-law differing in no essential respect from that relied on by the defendant here was enforced although it was wholly without express- statutory sanction. The court did not consider whether the by-law was technically valid so as to impress upon property in the stock of the company a restricted alienability, but placed the decision upon the ground that the terms of the bylaw became a contract between the corporation and the subscriber for its stock. In the later case of <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>King, </em>181 Mass., 476, which arose out of the refusal of the Continental Brewing Company to enter a transfer of its stock, the refusal being' for non-compliance with a by-law not distinguishable from this, the rights of the parties were determined by the same view.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">What may be the effect of a by-law of this character upon the transferability of stock.when the question is not affected by any provision of the statute under which the corporation is formed, we need not determine in the present case. \u2022 The different conclusions with respect to that question result from different views of the policy involved. To define and establish rules of public policy is a recognized function of legislation. The statute of the state of Delaware, under which this corporation was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>formed, expressly authorized it to make by-laws \u201cfor the management of its property, the regulation and government of its affairs, and for the certification and transfer of its stock.\u201d It also provides expressly that \u201cthe shares of stock in every corporation shall be deemed personal property and transferable on the books of the corporation in such manner and under such regulations as the by-laws provide.\u201d The third section of the act further provides generally that the corporation shall have such powers not inconsistent with law as may be necessary or convenient to the attainment of the objects of the corporation. Certainly power to regulate transfers of stock could not properly be regarded as power to prohibit the transfer, and it may be that in the interpretation of acts conferring such power it would be the duty of courts to see that prohibition is not accomplished under the guise of regulation, and that restrictions would not be permitted if foreign to the purpose for which the corporation is formed. The by-law here called in question contains no suggestion of a purpose to prevent the alienation of stock nor to restrict it beyond reasons suggested by a consideration of the welfare of the corporation and the express provisions of the statute. It interposes no permanent impediment to the transfer, providing only for an option in the directors for thirty days as a reasonable opportunity to them to dispose of stock to persons deemed desirable as holders. The statute having recognized the lawfulness of the purpose for which the corporation is formed and having' empowered it to make by-laws in furtherance of that purpose, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>expressly including the issuance and transfer of stock within the subjects for regulation by by-laws, we find no reason for saying that the by-law is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b191-7\">Summers, C.
