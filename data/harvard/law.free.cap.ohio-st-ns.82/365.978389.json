But it does not charge homicide. The trial judge, however, construed the indictment as though it charged murder in the second degree. Upon what theory he arrived at this conclusion we cannot comprehend, and he did not undertake to enlighten us. In submitting the case to the jury the court submitted the question as to whether the accused was guilty of murder in the second degree and all the lesser offenses; and in that we confidently claim there was fatal error.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">If permitted to draw inferences, we might probably infer that the prosecuting attorney intended to draw an indictment for murder in the first degree, and that the grand jury intended to return such an indictment. But in criminal cases inferences are not permitted. That proposition is elementary. <em>State </em>v. <em>Graham, </em>22 So. Rep., 807; 1 Bishop Crim.

That means, of course, that the name of the person killed was Percy Stuckey, and that Frank McCormick was not his name but an <em>alias </em>under which he may have gone at some time in his life. The evidence in -the case shows that it was Frank McCormick who was killed, and not Percy Stuckey. We do not think it will be seriously controverted that the name of the person assaulted, as charged in the indictment, must correspond with the proof; otherwise the defendant is entitled to an acquittal. The reason for this rule is entirely plain. For should an accused be charged with killing John Brown and it appeared in evidence it was James Brown instead of John Brown that he killed, an acquittal would not be a bar to a prosecution for the killing of James Brown. If convicted and sent to the penitentiary, after serving his term he could be brought back and tried for the killing of James Brown. Section 10, Bill of Rights; 2 Bishop Crim.

If such were the construction it would be clearly unconstitutional as it would be in conflict with Article I, Section 10, constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">The. supreme court of Ohio has had occasion. to construe the provisions of Section 7216, to which we beg to call the court\u2019s attention. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 Ohio St., 505; <em>Pratt </em>v. <em>State, </em>35 Ohio St., 514; <em>Barber </em>v. <em>State, </em>39 Ohio St., 660; <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>58 Ohio St., 417.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b446-9\"><em>Mr. H. H. Newell, </em>prosecuting attorney, and <em>Mr.- D. C. Parker, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">It is claimed by the accused that this indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>does not charge murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree, neither does the same charge manslaughter, and if it charges anything, according to the motion of the accused, it charges shooting with intent to kill or wound.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-4\">And as we take it the law is that where one is indicted for murder in the first degree, under the section, it necessarily follows that the indictment includes all of the other degrees of murder down to assault.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">Section 7215, Revised Statutes, provides, among other things, that certain matters may be left out of an indictment and still the same shall be a good indictment. Section 7217 provides what is necessary to set forth in an indictment for manslaughter.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">But we fail to find any rule laid down by the statutes defining what formal language shall be placed in . an indictment for murder' in the first degree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">There is no question but that this indictment fully complies with the statute charging malice, deliberation and premeditation. The fault found with it by the accused is that it does not disclose the manner and means by which the crime was committed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-8\">The facts of the indictment are sufficient to notify the defendant fully what he would be expected to meet at his trial.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-9\">We find no authority in Ohio from our reports, and there is but little light thrown on this kind of an indictment, but in looking over the textbooks we think there is law to fully maintain the allegations of this indictment.

Nor can we conceive of any possible prejudice that could afise to the accused from such variance, unless it be on the question as to former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>jeopardy in case of a future indictment and hearing. <em>Mead </em>v. <em>State, </em>26 Ohio St., 505; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hunt, 4 </em>Pick, 252; <em>Walter </em>v. <em>People, </em>32 N.

Goodlove, late of said county, on the 6th day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eight, at the county of Wyandot aforesaid in and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>upon one Percy Stuckey, <em>alias </em>Frank McCormick, then and there being, did unlawfully, purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, make an assault, in a menacing manner, with intent, him, the said Frank McCormick, unlawfully, purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, to kill and murder; and that the said James F.

Goodlove, then and there in his right hand had and held, then and there, unlawfully, purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice, did discharge and shoot off to, against and upon the said Frank McCormick, with the intent aforesaid, and that the said James F. Good-love, with the leaden bullets aforesaid, out of the pistol aforesaid, by force of the gunpowder aforesaid, by the said James F. Goodlove then and there discharged and shot off as aforesaid, him, the said Frank McCormick in and upon the upper right side of the back of him, the said Frank McCormick, then and there unlawfully, purposely, and of deliberate and premeditated malice did strike, penetrate, and wound, with the intent aforesaid, so as aforesaid discharged, and shot out of the pistol aforesaid, by the said James F.

H. Newell,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-5\">\n<em>\u201cProsecuting Attorney, Wyandot county, Ohio.\u201d .</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqJ\">The defendant, James F. Goodlove, being duly arraigned upon this indictment pleaded thereto not guilty. Thereafter and during said October term, 1908, the defendant was put upon trial upon said indictment and by the verdict of the jury was convicted of the crime of manslaughter. A motion for new trial was made and overruled and thereupon the defendant was sentenced by the court to imprisonment in the Ohio penitentiary at hard labor for the period of fifteen years. This judgment of the court of common pleas was affirmed hy the circuit court. To obtain a reversal of the judgments below James F. Goodlove now prosecutes error in this court. While the petition of plaintiff in error in this case contains numerous assignments of errors alleged to have occurred on the trial of this cause in the court of common pleas the only one of these assignments material to be noticed or considered in this opinion is the alleged error of the trial court in overruling the motion of defendant, made at the close of all the evidence, to direct the jury to return a verdict of not guilty, for if this claim of error be resolved in favor of the accused, as upon this record we are of opinion it must be, it is necessarily fatal and the. other errors assigned become wholly imm'a<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>terial. That in every indictment for injury to the person the law imperatively requires that the name of the injured party shall, if known, be stated, is too well settled to admit of controversy, and it follows therefrom as d logical and necessary sequence that the name of the person injured, if known, being indispensable matter of allegation is essential matter of proof and when stated must be proved as laid unless such proof is excused by statute. The indictment in the present case charged the accused, James F. Goodlove, with having assaulted and killed one \u201cPercy Stuckey, <em>alias </em>Frank McCormick.\u201d Plehce, under the charge so made the name of the party assaulted becomes and \u00a1 is essential matter'of description and identification, and to warrant conviction upon such charge it was incumbent upon the prosecution to establish by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that the person assaulted and killed was in fact Percy Stuckey. This indictment1 does not charge, nor was it intended thereby to charge, that James F. Good-love assaulted and killed both Percy Stuckey and Frank\u2019 McCormick, but the charge is that he assaulted and killed one Percy Stuckey, called, or otherwise known as Frank McCormick. The names therein mentioned were intended to be and are, but different designations or descriptions of the same person, namely, Percy Stuckey, and the rule being well settled that no allegation in an indictment descriptive of that which is essential to the charge can be disregarded or rejected, the crime thus charged in this indictment is not made out or established by proof only that the accused assaulted and killed one Frank McCormick, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>being no evidence whatever to show that said Frank McCormick and Percy Stuckey were one and the same person. In the case now before us not only is there a total absence of evidence that Percy Stuckey and Frank McCormick were one and the same person, but there is not in this case from beginning to end a scintilla of evidence even tending to show, or that would suggest, that any such person as Percy Stuckey ever had an existence. There was, therefore, in this case a total failure of proof as to an essential allegation and material part of the offense charged in the indictment, and such defect not being one of mere variance that is excused\u201d or rendered harmless'by the curative provisions of Section 7216, Revised Statutes, it was and is necessarily fatal and the motion to direct a verdict in this case should have been sustained. The conclusion reached by us finds abundant support in the reasoning of the authorities cited in the briefs of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">\n<em>Judgments of the circuit court and of the court of common pleas reversed, and plaintiff in error discharged.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b453-5\">Summers, C.
