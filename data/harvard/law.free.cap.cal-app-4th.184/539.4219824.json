Appellant further contends that the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS) failed to provide adequate reunification services. We affirm. In the published portion of the opinion, we hold that the Hague Service Convention does not apply to service of notice of review hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">A. <em>Prior Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">This is the second time this case has been before us. As discussed in our prior opinion, appellant\u2019s three children were detained in June 2008, along with three half siblings, as a result of the alleged physical and sexual abuse of Jennifer, then 16 years old.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sustained findings under Welfare and Institutions Code section 300, subdivision (a) (serious physical harm), subdivision (b) (failure to protect), subdivision (d) (sexual abuse) and subdivision (g) (no provision for support).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under subdivision (a), the court found that Mother \u201cused a safety pin and a knife to scrape ink marks, which [Mother] believed to be tattoos, from the skin on [Jennifer\u2019s] wrist and leg\u201d and had on prior occasions \u201cinappropriately and excessively physically disciplined [Jennifer] by pulling [her] hair and striking [her] face.\u201d Under subdivision (d), the court found that the children\u2019s stepfather, Carlos, \u201cmade sexual comments and gestures toward [his stepdaughter Jennifer], causing the child to feel sexually threatened,\u201d including \u201cfondling her legs and vaginal area over her clothing.\u201d In two findings that pertained to appellant, the court found under section 300, subdivisions (b) and (g), that appellant \u201cfailed to provide the children with the necessities of life including food, clothing, shelter and medical care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In multiple interviews, Mother informed the caseworker that appellant was the father of the children and that he was living in Mexico. The caseworker located appellant in Mexico and spoke with him by telephone in July 2008. He confirmed that he was the children\u2019s father. The children referred to appellant as their father. DCFS obtained the birth certificates for the children, which identified appellant as their father. Prior to the June 23, 2008 detention hearing, Mother filled out a paternity questionnaire under penalty of perjury which stated that although appellant had not signed papers establishing paternity at the hospital and had never been married to Mother, Mother and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>appellant were living together at the time of the children\u2019s birth, and appellant held himself out as the children\u2019s father and accepted the children openly in his home.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Although the court found true that appellant had held himself out as the children\u2019s father and openly accepted the children into his home, creating a presumption of fatherhood under Family Code section 7611, subdivision (d), the court concluded the presumption had been dissipated by appellant\u2019s subsequent abandonment of the children. In <em>In re J.O. </em>(2009) 178 Cal.App.4th 139 [100 Cal.Rptr.3d 276], we concluded that the section 7611, subdivision (d) presumption had not been rebutted and reversed the juvenile court\u2019s finding that appellant was not entitled to presumed father status.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">B. <em>Current Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">1. <em>Notice to Appellant of Juvenile Proceedings</em></p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">At the time of the June 2008 detention hearing, appellant\u2019s whereabouts were unknown. Located and contacted by the caseworker in July 2008, appellant told the caseworker he was interested in obtaining custody of the children.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In time for the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing, the caseworker obtained an address for appellant in Mexico and served multiple notices of the hearing on him in English and Spanish by certified or registered mail. Copies of the section 300 petition were attached to the notices. At a hearing on July 22, the court appointed counsel for appellant and noted that although appellant had been served with notice of the hearing and a copy of the petition, notice was inadequate because the petition itself had not been translated into Spanish. Accordingly, the court continued adjudication and disposition with respect to appellant and ordered that he be renoticed. DCFS renoticed appellant in English and Spanish at his Mexican address by registered or certified mail. The proofs of service stated that copies of the petition translated into Spanish had been attached to the notices. The caseworker also called appellant\u2019s telephone number and left a detailed message concerning the upcoming court dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">At the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing on August 26, 2008, the court stated that appellant, though not present, had been properly served with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>notice. Appellant\u2019s counsel did not object or raise any issue related to notice. Counsel contended on appellant\u2019s behalf that he should be declared the presumed father. Counsel also argued that the petition should be dismissed as to appellant and that the children should be released to him.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">2. <em>Reunification Period</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">Although the court found appellant to be the alleged father only, it ordered reunification services for him. Appellant was to participate in drug testing and if he tested positive, to complete a drug rehabilitation program. Appellant was also ordered to complete a parenting course, and to visit or contact the children in order to form a relationship with them.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">On August 26, 2008, the caseworker spoke with appellant by telephone. She provided the telephone numbers where the children could be reached and advised appellant to contact DIF to obtain referrals for services and a home assessment. Caseworkers were never again able to reach appellant by telephone and appellant did not contact DCFS. In addition, DCFS received no evidence that appellant had ever contacted the children or DIF.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">In the February 2009 report prepared for the six-month review hearing, the caseworker stated that Mother had successfully completed 14 sessions of parenting education, was enrolled in a domestic violence program for anger management and a sexual abuse awareness program, and was undergoing counseling. The report stated that there would be a \u201cmoderate\u201d risk if the children (not including Jennifer) were returned to Mother and Carlos, and that DCFS would \u201cuse its discretion to liberalize visits for parents [Mother and Carlos] with [the] children [not including Jennifer] ...\u201d to unmonitored in a public setting.\u201d With respect to appellant, the caseworker reported that she had attempted to call him, but that his telephone \u201cseemed busy.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> On January 19, 2009, the caseworker sent appellant a letter at his last known address. Having heard nothing from appellant for some time and having no reason to believe he was in compliance with the reunification plan, DCFS recommended that his reunification services be terminated.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">3. <em>Six-month Review Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">At the February 2009 hearing, the court granted Mother unmonitored visitation with all the children except Jennifer. With respect to appellant, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>court continued the matter to March and asked the caseworker to provide new notice to appellant and to prepare a supplemental report concerning the efforts to provide reunification services to appellant. In the March 2009 supplemental report, the caseworker stated that she or prior caseworkers had attempted to contact appellant telephonically on the following dates: October 27, November 13 and December 3, 2008; January 5, January 7, January 27, February 17, February 18, February 24, February 25, February 26, March 1, March 4, March 5, and March 10, 2009. In addition, the caseworkers sent Spanish-language letters to appellant on October 23, November 26 and December 29, 2008 and on January 14, February 17 and March 4, 2009. The letters discussed the pending proceeding and advised appellant to contact DCFS. Spanish- and English-language notices of the upcoming six-month review hearing and the fact that DCFS recommended termination of reunification services were sent to appellant at his last known address by first-class mail on March 3 and March 10, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">The court continued the review hearing to April 2009, instructed the parents to return without further order, notice or subpoena and instructed appellant\u2019s counsel to give notice of the continuance to appellant. At the hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel raised for the first time the issue of proper notice under the Hague Service Convention. Appellant\u2019s counsel also contended that appellant had not been provided reasonable services. She conceded, however, that she had not spoken to appellant since August 2008, prior to the disposition, and that he had never complained to her about lack of services. The court found that appellant had been properly served with the petition and notice of the August 2008 jurisdictional/dispositional hearing. The court also found that notice of the six-month review hearing and of DCFS\u2019s recommendation to terminate reunification services had been properly sent. Finding the reunification services afforded adequate, the court terminated appellant\u2019s reunification services with respect to Brian and Jesus.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">A. <em>Notice of Six-month Review Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">In dependency matters, parents are entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard at every stage of the proceeding in order to protect their fundamental interest in the companionship, care, custody and management of their children. <em>(In re B. G. </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 679, 688-689 [114 Cal.Rptr. 444, 523 P.2d 244]; <em>In re DeJohn B. </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 100, 106 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 649].) But parents are not served with process in the usual sense. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>(Cf. Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7413.10 et seq. [governing service of summons and complaint on defendant in civil action].) Dependency proceedings often commence on an emergency basis with a detention hearing, and under section 290.1, notice of a detention hearing may be \u201cwritten or oral.\u201d (\u00a7 290.1, subd. (e).) If the parents were present at the detention hearing, it is permissible to thereafter serve a copy of the petition and a notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings by first-class mail. (\u00a7 291, subd. (e)(2); see <em>In re Raymond R. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 436, 441 [31 Cal.Rptr.2d 551] [\u201cA parent\u2019s general appearance at the detention hearing will be considered a waiver of the parent\u2019s right to challenge adequacy of notice of the proceedings.\u201d].) If parents were not present at the detention hearing, they must be personally served with a copy of the petition and notice of the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings served by \u201ccertified mail, return receipt requested.\u201d (\u00a7 291, subd. (e)(1).) Notice of the review hearings held under section 366.21 and 366.22, which generally follow the jurisdictional and dispositional hearings, may be provided by \u201cfirst-class mail addressed to the last known address of the person to be noticed.\u201d (\u00a7 293, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">While appellant\u2019s brief includes a heading that appears to question whether service was sufficient under section 293, he concedes that section 293 \u201conly requires service by first class mail\u201d and acknowledges that \u201cthe Spanish version of [appellant\u2019s] notice [of the six-month review hearing] was . . . sent by first class mail.\u201d With respect to service of notice of the original jurisdictional/dispositional hearing and the section 300 petition, appellant notes that \u201c[t]he court concluded service of notice . . . was proper under the Convention and under section 291\u201d and concedes that \u201c[t]he record supports the court\u2019s finding because notice was sent by registered mail and included Spanish translations of the notice and the petition.\u201d He contends, however, that the Hague Service Convention required DCFS to serve notice of the six-month review hearing by \u201cinternational registered mail, return receipt requested.\u201d We disagree.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">\u201cThe Hague Service Convention is a multilateral treaty that was formulated in 1964 by the Tenth Session of the Hague Conference of Private International Law. The Convention revised parts of the Hague Conventions on Civil Procedure of 1905 and 1954. The revision was intended to provide a simpler way to serve process abroad, to assure that defendants sued in foreign jurisdictions would receive actual and timely notice of suit, and to facilitate proof of service abroad.\u201d <em>(Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number><em>Schlunk </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 694, 698 [100 L.Ed.2d 722, 108 S.Ct. 2104] <em>(Volkswagenwerk).) </em>\u201cArticle 1 defines the scope of the Convention .... It says: \u2018The present Convention shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 699.) In <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>the Supreme Court explained that in its view, \u201cArticle I refers to service of process in the technical sense\u201d and further explained: \u201c[T]he term \u2018service of process\u2019 has a well-established technical meaning. Service of process refers to a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 700.) The court concluded that \u201c[t]he only transmittal to which the Convention applies is a transmittal abroad that is required as a necessary part of service.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 707; accord, <em>Denlingerv. Chinadotcom Corp. </em>(2003) 110 Cal.App.4th 1396, 1401 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 530] [\u201cBoth the text and context of the [Hague Service] Convention demonstrate that the Convention is meant to apply only to service of process . . . .\u201d (italics omitted)]; <em>R. Griggs Group, LTD v. Filanto Spa </em>(D.Nev. 1996) 920 ESupp. 1100, 1105 [\u201c[T]he Convention as a whole does not purport to address aspects of litigation other than service of process . . . .\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Because the Hague Service Convention governs only \u201cservice of process in the technical sense\u201d and in a dependency proceeding, there is no service of process in the technical sense, an issue exists as to whether it applies at all to dependency proceedings. The issue was addressed by two courts, in <em>In re Alyssa F. </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 846 [6 Cal.Rptr.3d 1] <em>(Alyssa F.) </em>and <em>In re Jorge G. </em>(2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 125 [78 Cal.Rptr.3d 552] <em>(Jorge G.). </em>Both courts concluded that when the parent is a resident of Mexico or other signatory nation, the petition and notice of jurisdictional and dispositional hearings must be served pursuant to the Convention\u2019s requirements. <em>(Alyssa F, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at p. 854; <em>Jorge G., supra, </em>164 Cal.App.4th at p. 134.) The courts stated that such service was required in order to acquire \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d over the nonresident parent. <em>(Alyssa F, supra, </em>112 Cal.App.4th at pp. 851-852; <em>Jorge G., supra, </em>164 Cal.App.4th at p. 133.) Neither <em>Alyssa F. </em>nor <em>Jorge G. </em>suggested that the Hague Service Convention procedures should be applied to every notice of hearing served in a dependency action or that subsequent notices must be served with the formality of the petition and notice of jurisdictional/dispositional hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">As there is no authority for the proposition that Hague Service Convention procedures must be followed whenever any judicial notice of any kind is served on a parent residing outside the United States, we turn for guidance to the general rule: a court acquires jurisdiction over a party by proper service of process or by that party\u2019s general appearance; once either occurs, jurisdiction continues throughout the action and service of subsequent pleadings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>papers can be by less formal means.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Larry P. </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 888, 895 [247 Cal.Rptr. 472], citing 2 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Jurisdiction, \u00a7 332, p. 750 [\u201cOnce jurisdiction of the subject matter and of the person is obtained in a particular action, that jurisdiction continues throughout the action and in proceedings incidental thereto.\u201d]; Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 410.50 [\u201c(a) Except as otherwise provided by statute, the court in which an action is pending has jurisdiction over a party from the time summons is served .... A general appearance by a party is equivalent to personal service of summons on such party. [][] (b) Jurisdiction of the court over the parties and the subject matter of an action continues throughout subsequent proceedings in the action.\u201d]; <em>Thierfeldt v. Marin Hosp. Dist. </em>(1973) 35 Cal.App.3d 186, 198 [110 Cal.Rptr. 791] [Code Civ. Proc. provisions permitting service by mail \u201capply to service of notices in a pending action upon a party who has appeared or has been served in that action.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Here, there can be no dispute that appellant was aware of the pendency of juvenile court proceedings involving his three children, and made a general appearance, thus permitting service of the subsequent notice of the six-month review hearing by mail. The record reflects that in August 2008, DCFS served multiple copies of the petition and notice of the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing in English and Spanish by certified or registered mail to the address reported by appellant in July 2008. The caseworker also discussed the matter with appellant over the telephone. Counsel was appointed for appellant, and appeared at the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing to argue on his behalf without raising any issue regarding the adequacy of service. Appellant filed a notice of appeal of the jurisdictional order, making another general appearance and confirming his submission to the jurisdiction of the court. Thereafter, notice of the six-month review hearing was served by mail on appellant at his last known address, which complied with California law. (\u00a7 293, subd. (e); <em>In re DeJohn B., supra, </em>84 Cal.App.4th at p. 107.) Accordingly, notice of the six-month review hearing was properly served.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>In a supplemental brief, appellant focuses on the phrase \u201c[s]ervice of the notice\u201d in section 293, subdivision (e), contending that the requirement that notice of the six-month review hearing be \u201cserved\u201d triggers the Hague Service Convention because the Convention applies by its terms to \u201call cases in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.\u201d This was resolved in <em>Volkswagenwerk, </em>where the Supreme Court held that despite the provision\u2019s broad language, the Convention applied only to service of process in the technical sense, defined as \u201cformal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action.\u201d (Volkswagenwerk; <em>supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 700.)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Appellant contends that Volkswagenwerk's definition of service of process \u201cmust be evaluated in relation to the . . . different statutory requirements and differing due process concerns\u201d applicable in a dependency action. The differing due process concerns are reflected in the statutes governing notice and service\u2014sections 290.1 to 297\u2014which have different requirements depending on the type of hearing involved and the potential consequence on parental rights. For example, section 294 requires service of notice of a section 366.26 hearing where the recommendation is to terminate parental rights to be by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested (\u00a7 294, subd. (f)(2)\u2014(5)), but permits service by first-class mail where the recommendation is legal guardianship or long-term foster care (\u00a7 294, subd. (f)(6)). Section 290.2, subdivision (c)(2), requires service of a petition and notice of hearing concerning a child who is not detained to be first served by mail and followed up, if the parent does not appear, by a new hearing noticed by personal service. As discussed, section 290.1, subdivision (e), permits notice of the detention hearing to be \u201coral,\u201d and section 291, subdivision (e)(1), requires the petition and notice of the jurisdictional/dispositional hearing to be served on a parent who was not present at the detention hearing by personal service or certified mail, return receipt requested. With respect to review hearings, including the hearing at which reunification services may be terminated, the Legislature has determined that notice by first-class mail is sufficient to comply with due process. (\u00a7 293, subd. (e).) The statutory scheme places on the parent the responsibility of keeping DCFS apprised of his or her current mailing address, so that mailed notices do not go awry. (\u00a7 316.1; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 5.534(m).)</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">While there can be no dispute that due process prohibits courts from interfering with parental rights without adequate notice, dependency procedures and statutory notice requirements are based on the principle that parents can be expected to exert some effort to keep apprised of their children and their welfare. Appellant has been an absentee father for many years, content to entrust the upbringing of his children to Mother and Carlos. Aware of the dependency proceeding and of the serious nature of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>allegations against Mother and Carlos, he did nothing to secure his custodial rights, and failed to keep DCFS informed of his whereabouts.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Service of notice on appellant of the six-month review hearing by first-class mail fully complied with California law, and we find no violation of appellant\u2019s due process rights or any rights under the Hague Service Convention.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">B. <em>Reunification </em>Services<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">The order terminating appellant\u2019s reunification services is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"An\">Epstein, P.
