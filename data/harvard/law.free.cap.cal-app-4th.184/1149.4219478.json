Code,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1), 187, subd. (a)) and found the offense was committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang within the meaning of section 186.22, subdivision (b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Roberts contends his conviction must be reversed because the evidence against him was obtained as a result of an illegal wiretap under the Presley-Felando-Eaves Wiretap Act of 1988 (\u00a7 629.50 et seq.) (Act) and in violation of his rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Roberts also contends the court erred when it did not suppress evidence obtained as a result of an illegal vehicle stop, admitted prejudicial and damaging gang-related photographs and allowed inadmissible gang expert testimony about his state of mind and conduct. He raises a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, Roberts claims the denial of his motion for separate trials constituted an abuse of discretion and resulted in a violation of his federal due process and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Notwithstanding these errors, Roberts asserts the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction for conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">Pettis contends the court erred when it denied his motion to suppress evidence obtained by wiretaps.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He asserts his conviction is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that the wiretaps were obtained legally and minimized in accordance with the relevant statutes. We do find that the court erred when it did not require the state to provide timely reports to the court under section 629.60 and to file an application to use nontargeted intercepted communications as soon as practicable as required by section 629.82, subdivision (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">As a matter of first impression, we hold that when a defendant moves to suppress evidence on the grounds the reports required under section 629.60 were inadequate or untimely, the state has the burden to show there was no error, the violation did not contravene a central purpose of the Act, or the purpose of the provision was achieved despite any error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Jackson </em>(2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 129, 146-147 [28 Cal.Rptr.3d 136] <em>{Jackson).) </em>We conclude under this framework the court did not err when it denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress wiretap evidence under section 1538.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1160\">*1160</page-number>Because of the judicially authorized intrusion into a constitutionally protected zone of privacy, the state and the court must strictly comply with statutory requirements. During the pendency of the wiretap, the supervising judge must closely monitor the state\u2019s compliance with the authorization order to ensure the intercepted communications are properly minimized and to immediately terminate the wiretap order if warranted. Section 629.60 is central to the Act because it allows the judge supervising the wiretap to ascertain the need for continued interception of private communication. The supervising judge must also maintain meticulous records of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">We also find the Act requires court approval to use intercepted communications related to certain enumerated offenses that were not the target of the wiretap order before those communications may be used in criminal court proceedings. Although we conclude the court erred when it did not consider the application and later, when the omission was brought to its attention, did not make the findings required by law, the errors were harmless. Otherwise we find no error and affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b872-6\">The criminal proceedings against Roberts and Pettis resulted from the convergence of two chains of events\u2014a history of retaliatory violence between the Deep Valley Crips (Crips) and the Deep Valley Bloods (Bloods), street gangs which operated in the same area of northern San Diego County, and a law enforcement investigation into narcotics trafficking by the Crips, which eventually involved wiretap surveillance of Roberts\u2019s and Pettis\u2019s cellular telephones. Crips members and associates were predominantly, but not exclusively, African-American. The Bloods were known as a Samoan gang and wore red to signify membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-7\">Defendants Roberts and Pettis are two of eight members of the Crips who were indicted in March 2005 on charges of conspiracy to commit murder for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang. (\u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1), 186.22, subd. (b)(1), 187, subd. (a).) Fellow Crips members Curtis Brown, Calvin Landfair, Timothy Jackson, William Bright, Jr., Arthur Harvey and Terrell Jackson were also named in the indictment. Pettis\u2019s moniker was \u201cShakes\u201d and Roberts\u2019s monikers were \u201cJ-Low\u201d and \u201cLow.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b872-8\">Beginning in the early 1990\u2019s, the Crips\u2019 and the Bloods\u2019 competing claims to the Deep Valley area in Oceanside led to a series of retaliatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1161\">*1161</page-number>murders and shootings. The violence escalated after November 2002, when a Crips gang member randomly shot into a home known to be a meeting place for the Bloods and killed Pearl Seau, an important figure to the Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">Multiple retaliatory shootings between Crips and Bloods occurred in November 2003 and March, July and September 2004. In March 2004 Bloods shot at the homes of Pettis\u2019s and Calvin Landf air\u2019s mothers while family members were present. The last shooting in this timeframe occurred on September 11, 2004, when Bloods shot at an apartment where a group of Crips was gathered and a Crips member retaliated, killing a member of the Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">In early 2004, the narcotics task force (task force), a federal, state and local multiagency unit assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), began an investigation into alleged drug trafficking by Pettis and the Crips. In November, when the investigation stalled, the task force obtained wiretaps on the cell phones used by Pettis and Curtis Brown.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">The course of the narcotics investigation changed when officers intercepted the following telephone call from Pettis to Landf air on December 13, 2004 (call 4678).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-8\">\u201c[Pettis]: Hey, I want to put something together, man.

During the next few days, Pettis spoke with Roberts and other Crips members as they tried to find leaders of the Bloods and secure guns.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-14\">On December 15, Pettis telephoned Roberts and asked if Roberts had talked with Landfair. Pettis said, \u201cI was tryin\u2019 to blow you up, man, because [Landfair] . . . had an eye on some of those cats.\u201d Roberts replied, \u201cK-Swiss [(a Crips member)] got the . . . one heat. [][] Pettis: Okay, [f] Roberts: You know what I mean? And then Crash [(a Crips member)] got the other heat. . . . [f] Pettis: [Landfair] and the other homies had a eye ball on about four of them whoppty woops .... And we had no access to no thumper.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b875-15\">Pettis telephoned Roberts on December 16 to ask if he had obtained the \u201cthumper\u201d from Crash. Pettis was worried Crash would not supply the weapon. Roberts said Crash called to tell him to pick it up. On January 3, 2005, Roberts told Brown he was able to buy guns for $200 each. Brown asked Roberts to \u201cput me in for one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1164\">*1164</page-number>The task force obtained a wiretap on Roberts\u2019s cell phone. It went into operation on January 6, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">On January 15 and 16, 2005, the task force intercepted a large number of calls to and from Pettis, Roberts, Brown and others indicating that action by the Crips against the Bloods was imminent. Roberts learned that one of the Bloods\u2019 \u201cbig homies\u201d had been released from jail and would attend a gathering at a relative\u2019s home to celebrate his release. The mother of Roberts\u2019s child, who was Samoan, had shown him the house. Roberts and others watched the home on R. street in the Deep Valley area of Oceanside. Roberts also had information that Bloods were meeting at a park.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">During a call on January 16, Pettis telephoned Arthur Harvey. Roberts was with Harvey. Pettis told Harvey, \u201cListen to what I\u2019m sayin\u2019, Harv. Those [Bloods] are havin\u2019 a meeting in the valley right now.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-6\">\u201c[Harvey]: Yeah, I know. I know. We, hey, we on it, homie. [][]... [][]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-7\">\u201c[Pettis]: I was just making sure everyone knew because.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-8\">\u201c[Harvey]: Oh, we on it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-9\">Pettis asked to speak to Roberts. He asked Roberts, \u201cHey, how many thing-things you got?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-10\">\u201c[Roberts]: Two. [][]... ffl</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-11\">\u201c[Pettis]: . . . just two? . . . Hey ... I need you to do it right now.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b876-12\">Roberts told Pettis he was looking for Brown because he wanted to \u201croll down\u201d there himself. Roberts wanted to use Brown\u2019s car because the brakes on his vehicle squealed. Less than 20 minutes later, Brown telephoned Pettis and said he and Roberts were \u201cgoing to the valley.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">The task force was conducting a rolling surveillance in Deep Valley, focusing on the areas mentioned in the intercepted calls as likely targets. When members of the task force observed Roberts and Brown driving in the neighborhood where the party was to be held, they instructed officers to use any pretext to pull them over. Officer Norton noticed Brown\u2019s car had dark tinted side windows. Brown was driving. Roberts was in the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Norton told Brown he stopped the car because of its tinted front side windows. Norton smelled alcohol. He saw a plastic cup in the center console. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1165\">*1165</page-number>When Brown admitted the cup contained alcohol, the officer asked Brown and Roberts to step out of the car. Norton found a semiautomatic handgun under the front passenger seat. The gun was loaded and its safety was off. Officers arrested Roberts and Brown.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">Roberts telephoned Pettis from jail. Roberts did not understand why there had been such a large number of police officers at the stop and why his bail had been set so high. He assured Pettis he had not been talking to the police. Pettis told Roberts he was not concerned by the arrest because Roberts had not done anything. Roberts replied, \u201cYeah, but the thing about it is I was about to. [f] Pettis: You almost did? [j[] Roberts: Yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Pettis told a friend of Brown\u2019s he expected Roberts and Brown to be released from jail within days (call 12492). Pettis explained, \u201cThey got caught before they shot the gun .... [Brown] got caught with a couple of my home boys they went to go shoot at some, some Samoans, but they got caught before they busted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Pettis was arrested on January 20, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">The task force executed search warrants on the homes of the suspected coconspirators, including the residences of Roberts and Pettis. They seized a large number of photographs. Roberts appeared in many of the photographs. Pettis appeared in some of them. Generally, the photographs showed known Crips members and associates, including convicted felons, dressed in gang attire, holding weapons and displaying hand signs and tattoos.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">At trial,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the prosecution introduced evidence of all intercepted telephone conversations between Pettis, Roberts and others in which they discussed a plan to shoot leaders of the Bloods. The court admitted the photographs and the evidence obtained as a result of the vehicle stop, including the gun found under Roberts\u2019s car seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">Detective Mike Taele, a qualified gang expert with the special enforcement unit of the Oceanside Police Department, testified about the slang terminology used in the intercepted calls. Taele testified \u201ccredible head\u201d is a reference to someone who has significant status within the set whose demise would impact and demoralize the set if taken out. He explained to \u201clay him down\u201d means to murder someone. \u201cThing-thing,\u201d \u201cthang,\u201d \u201cheat,\u201d \u201cheaters,\u201d \u201chizzy\u201d and \u201czizang\u201d are terms for a gun. A \u201cthumper\u201d is a personal weapon, possibly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1166\">*1166</page-number>a shotgun. \u201cWe heated\u201d means the men are carrying guns. \u201cSlob niggas\u201d are Blood gang members. It is a reference to the enemy. \u201cWhoppty woops\u201d has different meanings depending on context. The phrase may refer to Bloods or the men who will carry out the plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">Roberts presented evidence to show he was on good terms with his child\u2019s maternal family, who are Samoan, and the family\u2019s friends, including members and associates of the Bloods. He asked the jury to infer that because of those relationships, he would not seek to kill members of the Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Pettis testified he was not a member of the Crips. On December 13, 2003, Pettis learned the identity of the person responsible for the shooting at his mother\u2019s home and he had been venting about it to Landfair. He did not want to kill anyone. The gang detective misinterpreted some of the slang he used during the conversation. \u201cTo lay someone down\u201d did not mean to kill him. Pettis did not know that Roberts and others were planning to shoot at the Samoans until Roberts telephoned him from jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">\n<em>WIRETAP CHALLENGES</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"A7q\">A. <em>Overview of State Wiretap Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-9\">\u201c \u2018In general, California law prohibits wiretapping.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

I, \u00a7 1.) \u201cCalifornia\u2019s wiretap law subjects the authorization of electronic surveillance to a much higher degree of scrutiny than a conventional search warrant.\u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 129, 144.) The purpose of wiretap laws is twofold: \u201c \u2018 \u201c(1) protecting the privacy of wire and oral communications, and (2) delineating on a uniform basis the circumstances and conditions under which the interception of wire and oral communications may be authorized.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>(Jackson, </em>at p. 147, quoting <em>Halpin v.

Otto </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 1088, 1097 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 596, 831 P.2d 1178]; see <em>People v. Superior Court </em>(Westbrook) (1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 41, 48 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 617].) The federal wiretap act establishes minimum standards for the admissibility of evidence procured through electronic surveillance. State law cannot be less protective of privacy than the federal wiretap act. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>at p. 384; <em>Otto, supra, 2 </em>Cal.4th at p. 1098.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">A designated judge may authorize a wiretap when the judge finds there is probable cause to believe that an individual is, was, or will be committing one of the crimes specified in the statute (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (a)), particular communications about the offense will be intercepted (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (b)) and the device is used or leased by the person targeted by the wiretap (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (c)). The judge must also determine that normal investigative procedures have been tried and failed, or appear reasonably unlikely to succeed, or would be too dangerous if tried. (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (d).)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The wiretap must be conducted to minimize the interception of communications not otherwise subject to interception. (\u00a7 629.58.) A wiretap cannot be authorized longer than necessary to achieve its objective or 30 days, whichever occurs first. On new application, the court may authorize an extension of the existing wiretap. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">The wiretap authorization order requires reports in writing or otherwise to be made to the judge who issued the order. The reports must be filed with the court at intervals the judge may require, but not less than one for each six-day period. They must contain a statement about the progress that has been made toward the authorized objective, or a satisfactory explanation for the lack of progress, and the need for continued interception. If the judge finds that progress has not been made, the explanation for the lack of progress is not satisfactory, or there is no need for continued interception, the judge must order the wiretap to stop immediately.

The application, entitled \u201cWiretap No. 04-15\u201d (initial wiretap order or wiretap 04-15), was supported by an affidavit from Oceanside Police Department Detective (then Officer) Richard Anderson, who was assigned to monitor Oceanside gang activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">Anderson averred he had participated in numerous narcotics investigations during his career, including the current investigation. Based on the investigation to date, Anderson believed that Pettis managed a cocaine trafficking organization and that Pettis, Roberts, Brown and others were violating various criminal statutes with respect to the transportation and sale of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">The intercepted communications were expected to reveal the nature, extent, methods and scope of the narcotics operation; the identities, locations and roles of other participants; the location of controlled substances and records; the source of financial resources; and the transportation network. Anderson described the techniques and activities that had been used in the investigation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1169\">*1169</page-number>to date, including the use of two confidential informants who had become unmanageable, and an undercover agent who met with only limited success.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">On November 23, 2004, Judge Peter C. Deddeh issued an order in which he found there was probable cause to believe that Pettis, Brown, Roberts and others were committing and were about to commit \u201coffenses involving the importation, possession for sale, transportation, and sale of controlled substances in violation of Health and Safety Code Sections 11351, 11352, 11378, and 11379 and a conspiracy to commit said crimes, with respect to substances containing cocaine and/or methamphetamine where the substance exceeds three pounds of solid substance by weight.\u201d The court determined there was probable cause to believe that communications concerning those offenses would be obtained through wiretap interception of cellular telephones used by Pettis and Brown. The court found that normal investigative techniques had been tried and failed, and appeared to be unlikely to succeed and/or would be too dangerous.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">The order authorized interception of communications \u201cconcerning the commission of said offenses. (Penal Code Section 629.54(c).)\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-7\">The order provided the wiretap would terminate when its objective was attained, or in 30 days from the date of the order, unless the court granted an extension. The court found that because of the ongoing nature of the criminal activity, the wiretap would not automatically terminate when the described communication was first obtained. The order prescribed \u201cwritten reports to this court for every six (6) days period during the interception showing what progress had been made toward the achievement of the authorized objective, . . . each six (6) days report is to be completed and presented to this court at the earliest possible time from the end of each six (6) day period, or as this court further directs\u201d (six-day reports).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-8\">On or about December 22, 2004, the task force applied for an extension of wiretap 04-15. The affidavit incorporated by reference Anderson\u2019s affidavit in wiretap 04-15, specifically his descriptions of the investigative procedures used to date and their limitations. In the new affidavit, Anderson identified Pettis as a documented member of the Crips and described the violent rivalry between the Crips and the Bloods. In addition to the drug activity detailed in his earlier affidavit, Anderson averred Pettis and Brown and other unknown persons were engaged in criminal street gang activity prohibited by section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1170\">*1170</page-number>186.22. He described the \u201ccredible heads call\u201d and several other intercepted calls in which Pettis and Brown discussed obtaining firearms and surveilling members of the Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">The court issued an order extending wiretap 04-15 (extension). In addition to drug trafficking offenses, the court found there was probable cause to believe Pettis, Brown and others were participating in criminal street gang activities. The other provisions of the extension order were identical to those in the initial authorization order for wiretap 04-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">On January 5, 2005, the task force applied for a wiretap on Roberts\u2019s cell phone. Anderson stated Roberts was using a cell phone to actively participate in the activities of Pettis\u2019s crack cocaine trafficking organization. Anderson detailed intercepted communications between Pettis and Roberts, and Brown and Roberts, discussing drug and weapon transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Judge Deddeh authorized the wiretap on Roberts\u2019s cell phone on January 6, 2005 (wiretap 05-01). He found there was probable cause to believe Roberts and other Crips members were violating various drug statutes and participating in a criminal street gang. The other provisions of the order were identical to those in the initial order authorizing wiretap 04-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The Pettis/Brown wiretaps started November 23, 2004, and concluded on January 20, 2005, when Pettis and Brown were arrested. The wiretap on Roberts\u2019s cell phone began January 6 and concluded with his arrest on January 16. Agents intercepted approximately 12,000 calls to and from Pettis, 9,000 to and from Brown and 2,500 to and from Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-8\">None of the wiretap applications, affidavits, orders and reports was file-stamped by the clerk of court.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-9\">On August 1, 2005, the prosecution filed an application to use the nontargeted, statutorily authorized communications (application) as evidence at trial. (\u00a7\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a)(2), 629.78.) The application concerned 11 telephone calls, including the \u201ccredible heads call,\u201d that were intercepted before the court authorized the task force to intercept communications pertaining to criminal street gang activity. Notwithstanding its application to the court, the prosecution asserted the application was redundant because interception of communications involving violent crime was statutorily authorized, and the use of such communications at trial was therefore permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-10\">Pettis and Roberts moved to suppress all wiretap evidence. (\u00a7 1538.5.) They argued the wiretap applications did not meet the necessity requirements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1171\">*1171</page-number>of California\u2019s wiretap statute (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (d)), the task force did not properly minimize nontargeted intercepted communications (\u00a7 629.58), and the six-day reports were inadequate, untimely and not properly reviewed by the trial court (\u00a7 629.60). The court (Judge Harry M. Elias) denied the suppression motion. At the prosecutor\u2019s request, the court did not rule on the application made pursuant to section 629.82, subdivision (a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b883-5\">Defendants\u2019 trial was delayed two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">In August 2007, defendants renewed their motion to suppress all wiretap evidence. Defendants acknowledged Judge Elias had denied their motions to suppress, finding the wiretaps were properly minimized and the six-day reports were adequate. They argued they had not been able to fully litigate the motion because the prosecution did not produce information about the reporting process. Defendants also complained the court did not authorize the prosecution to use nontargeted intercepted communications at trial, which they identified as any intercepted conversation that did not involve drug offenses under the initial wiretap order. (\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">The court (Judge Joan R Weber) ruled defendants had a full and fair opportunity to litigate their claims before Judge Elias and declined to hear the matter anew. With respect to the use of nontargeted, statutorily authorized communications at trial, the court found that communications relating to murdering drug trafficking competitors and weapon acquisition were sufficiently related to narcotics trafficking and therefore were authorized under the initial wiretap order.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-8\">\n<em>STANDARD OF REVIEW</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b883-9\"><em>\u201c </em>\u2018[W]hile we defer to the [trial] court\u2019s express and implied factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence, we exercise our independent judgment in determining the legality of a search [based] on the facts so found.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v.

They assert the evidence seized from the wiretaps was improperly admitted because it was obtained in violation of section 629.50 and the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1172\">*1172</page-number>Section 629.52, subdivision (d) specifies that a designated judge may enter an ex parte order authorizing a wiretap if, among other requirements, \u201c[njormal investigative procedures have been tried and have failed or reasonably appear either to be unlikely to succeed if tried or to be too dangerous.\u201d This is commonly referred to as the necessity requirement. The necessity requirement ensures that wiretapping is not routinely used as an initial step in a criminal investigation or when traditional investigative techniques would expose the crime. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 385; <em>United States v. Giordano </em>(1974) 416 U.S. 505, 515 [40 L.Ed.2d 341, 94 S.Ct. 1820]; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kahn </em>(1974) 415 U.S. 143, 153, fn. 12 [39 L.Ed.2d 225, 94 S.Ct. 977].)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-4\">The necessity requirement is met if the affidavit \u201canalyze[s] with particularity the limitations of each alternative investigative technique in achieving the goals of [the] investigation\u201d and shows that ordinary investigative procedures, employed in good faith, are unlikely to be effective in the case. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 385, 389-390.) The affidavit need not exhaust all possible investigative techniques but must simply explain the retroactive or prospective failure of several techniques that reasonably suggest themselves. <em>(U.S. </em>v. <em>Van Horn </em>(11th Cir. 1986) 789 F.2d 1492, 1496, citing <em>U.S. v.

The overall burden on the government in meeting the necessity requirement for issuance of a wiretap warrant is not great. <em>(U.S. v. Verdin-Garcia, supra, </em>516 F.3d at p. 890.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-6\">A finding of necessity by the judge approving the wiretap application is entitled to substantial deference. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 385 &amp; fn. 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b884-7\">The record supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the supervising judge\u2019s finding of necessity did not contravene the Fourth Amendment or section 629.52, subdivision (d). The task force\u2019s goal was to identify members of a suspected drug conspiracy, the organization\u2019s drug sources and means of delivery, and participants. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Zapata </em>(10th Cir. 2008) 546 F.3d 1179, 1186-1188.) Purchasing drugs from Pettis was not the sole purpose of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1173\">*1173</page-number>Anderson detailed the investigative techniques used to date and the reasons why those techniques were no longer likely to be effective or safe. Investigators had analyzed pen registers and telephone tolls to corroborate the locations of Pettis\u2019s narcotics activities. Once that information was obtained, further analysis was of limited use. Two confidential informants were used with some initial success, but proved unreliable when they purchased drugs for their own use. The undercover agent successfully purchased small amounts of drags from Pettis and other Crips, but had not been able to buy larger amounts or identify suppliers. Pettis had become suspicious of the undercover agent and no longer dealt with him directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">The task force had used physical surveillance and would continue to use it. However, Pettis took measures to avoid surveillance. He abruptly changed transaction locations and met in places where background noise made it difficult to monitor the conversation. Physical surveillance rarely disclosed the substance of any communication that might lead to detection. Search warrants, interviews and grand jury proceedings would effectively terminate the investigation by alerting participants and foreclosing prosecution of some of most culpable participants in the narcotics trafficking organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">The description of the relevant investigatory techniques that had been used in the eight-month narcotics trafficking investigation was thorough, explicit and relevant to the investigation at hand. The issuing judge reasonably determined that ordinary investigative procedures, employed in good faith, were unlikely to be effective in the case and authorized the wiretaps. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at pp. 385, 389-390.) We conclude the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress based on lack of necessity is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">B. <em>Minimization</em></p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">Defendants contend the limited scope of the initial wiretap order authorized the task force to intercept conversations only about drag offenses, and the court should have suppressed all evidence relating to any alleged conspiracy to commit murder. Roberts and Pettis argue the authorization to intercept communications about drag-related offenses expired once the task force gathered sufficient evidence to charge them with drag offenses, and the breakdown in compliance with reporting requirements under section 629.60 prevented the court from exercising its oversight function to minimize intrusions into defendants\u2019 privacy. Defendants assert that if the court had reviewed complete and timely reports, it would have terminated the wiretap.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1174\">*1174</page-number>We have not located any California case addressing the minimization requirement under section 629.58; therefore, we look for guidance to cases under 18 United States Code section 2518(5). (Cf. <em>Leon, </em>supra, 40 Cal.4th at p. 384.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-4\">Under federal wiretap law, a wiretap authorization order must require the applicant to minimize communications not subject to interception and terminate the wiretap when the authorized objective is attained or when the authorization expires.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> (\u00a7 629.58.) The government is required to adopt reasonable measures to reduce the interception of conversations unrelated to the criminal activity under investigation to a practical minimum while permitting the government to pursue legitimate investigation. The standard for minimization is reasonableness. Reasonableness is determined from the facts of each case. <em>(U.S. v. Abascal </em>(9th Cir. 1977) 564 F.2d 821, 827; see also <em>Scott v. United States </em>(1978) 436 U.S. 128, 137 [56 L.Ed.2d 168, 98 S.Ct. 1717] <em>(Scott); U.S. v. Torres </em>(9th Cir. 1990) 908 F.2d 1417, 1423; <em>Reyes, supra, 111 </em>Cal.App.4th 671, 685.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-5\">To determine whether the authorities acted reasonably to minimize the interception of nontargeted communications, the court generally reviews a variety of factors relevant to the facts of the case. These factors may include whether a large number of the calls were very short, one time only, or in guarded or coded language; the breadth of the investigation underlying the need for the wiretap; whether the nonminimized calls occurred early in the surveillance; and the extent to which the authorizing judge supervised the ongoing wiretap. <em>(Scott, supra, </em>436 U.S. at pp. 140-141.) Other factors may include uncertainty as to scope of the alleged conspiracy, whether the conversations are between coconspirators, and whether the telephones used were public or private telephones. <em>(Ibid.; U.S. v. Yarbrough </em>(10th Cir. 2008) 527 F.3d 1092, 1097-1098.)</p>\n<p id=\"b886-6\">1. <em>The objective of the wiretap was not achieved before December 23, 2004; therefore, the initial wiretap order did not expire.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b886-8\">The court cannot issue an order authorizing the wiretap for any period longer than necessary to \u201cachieve the objective of the authorization.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1175\">*1175</page-number>(\u00a7 629.58.) Defendants argue the wiretap expired as soon as the task force had sufficient evidence to convict them of drug offenses. The argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">In its application for wiretap 04-15, the task force stated the purpose of its investigation was to identify the nature, extent, methods and scope of the narcotics operation; identities, locations and roles of other participants; the location of controlled substances and records; the source of financial resources; and the transportation network. (See <em>U.S. v. Zapata, supra, </em>546 F.3d at pp. 1186-1188.) The initial order specifically provided the wiretap would not automatically terminate when the described communication was first obtained because of the ongoing nature of narcotics trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The court found there was probable cause to believe Pettis, Brown, Riley, Roberts and \u201cothers as yet unknown\u201d were participating in a conspiracy to commit offenses involving possession for sale, transportation and sale of narcotics, including transporting drugs into the state. (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11351, 11352, 11378, 11379.) The initial wiretap order shows the scope of the authorized investigation was not limited to individual drug sales. The supporting affidavit detailed drug transactions between Pettis and the confidential informants, and Pettis and the undercover agents. The task force had identified Pettis and his low-level sales force, but it was engaged in ongoing efforts to identify the suppliers, financial supply and transportation routes of the narcotics trafficking scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">The factors relevant here\u2014the breadth of the narcotics trafficking investigation, uncertainty as to scope of the alleged conspiracy and the conversations between the coconspirators\u2014support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the purpose of the investigation was not yet attained and the authorization for the wiretap had not expired. <em>(Scott, supra, </em>436 U.S. at pp. 140-141; <em>U.S. v. Yarbrough, supra, </em>527 F.3d 1092 at pp. 1097-1098.) Substantial evidence supports the conclusion the purpose of the wiretap had not expired before the task force intercepted communications relating to the conspiracy to commit murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">\n<em>2. Law enforcement is not required to minimize interceptions of nontargeted communications relating to criminal activity.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b887-9\">Defendants contend the scope of the initial wiretap order authorized the task force to intercept conversations relating only to drug offenses. Defendants argue the task force was required to minimize any intercepted communication relating to an offense not specifically authorized in the wiretap orders, and the court should have suppressed all evidence relating to other crimes, specifically, conspiracy to commit murder. They argue the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1176\">*1176</page-number>specifically include murder as a targeted offense in any of its authorization orders and the court should have suppressed all wiretap evidence relating to murder. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Because defendants\u2019 contention involves an issue of statutory interpretation, our review is de novo. <em>(People ex rel. Lockyer v. Shamrock Foods Co. </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 415, 432 [101 Cal.Rptr.2d 200, 11 P.3d 956].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">Section 629.54, subdivision (c) requires the issuing court to specify a \u201cparticular description of the type of communication sought to be intercepted [(targeted communication)], and a statement of the illegal activities to which it relates\u201d in the wiretap authorization order. Although the court merely recited this language in its order authorizing wiretap 04-15 instead of following its directives, the order states the court\u2019s finding there is probable cause to believe Pettis, Roberts and others were involved in \u201coffenses involving the importation, possession for sale, transportation, and sale of controlled substances in violation of Health and Safety Code Sections 11351, 11352, 11378, and 11379 and a conspiracy to commit said crimes, with respect to substances containing cocaine and/or methamphetamine where the substance exceeds three pounds of solid substance by weight.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">We infer this language was reasonably interpreted by the task force, and later by the parties, as the type of communication sought to be intercepted, and the illegal activity to which it relates. (\u00a7 629.54, subd. (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">In construing the extent of the state\u2019s authority to intercept nontargeted communications, we look to the words of the statutes to determine legislative intent and to fulfill the purpose of the law. <em>(Gooch </em>v. <em>Hendrix </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 266, 282 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 712, 851 P.2d 1321]; <em>In re Heraclio A. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 569, 574 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 713].) The language is construed in the context of the statute as a whole and the overall statutory scheme, and courts give significance to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act in pursuing the legislative purpose. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Canty </em>(2004) 32 Cal.4th 1266, 1276 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 90 P.3d 1168].)</p>\n<p id=\"b888-8\">Section 629.58 of the Act requires the state to minimize \u201ccommunications not otherwise subject to interception under this chapter.\u201d To fully understand the scope of authorization to intercept nontargeted communications under the Act, and the state\u2019s obligation to minimize nonauthorized communications, section 629.58 must be read in conjunction with section 629.82, subdivision (a). Section 629.82, subdivision (a), specifies: \u201cIf a peace officer or federal law enforcement officer, while engaged in intercepting . . . communications in the manner authorized by this chapter, intercepts . . . communications relating to crimes other than those specified in the order of authorization, but which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1177\">*1177</page-number>are enumerated in subdivision (a) of Section 629.52, or any violent felony as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, (1) the contents thereof, and evidence derived therefrom, may be disclosed or used as provided in Sections 629.74 and 629.76 and (2) the contents and any evidence derived therefrom may be used under Section 629.78 when authorized by a judge if the judge finds, upon subsequent application, that the contents were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The application shall be made as soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b889-5\">Simply stated, targeted interceptions are those communications specified in the wiretap authorization order under section 629.54, subdivision (c). The state is not required to obtain judicial approval before it may use targeted interceptions in any criminal court or grand jury proceeding. However, the state must obtain judicial approval before it may use nontargeted, statutorily authorized interceptions of certain enumerated crimes in criminal court or grand jury proceedings. (\u00a7\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a), 629.78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-6\">Statutorily authorized interceptions are lawfully intercepted communications relating to certain enumerated crimes other than those specified in the wiretap authorization order. (\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a).) These enumerated crimes are defined as: \u201c(1) Importation, possession for sale, transportation, manufacture, or sale of controlled substances .... [1] (2) Murder, solicitation to commit murder, the commission of a felony involving a destructive device . ... [H (3) Any felony violation of Section 186.22 [(criminal street gang activity)]. [][] (4) Any felony violation . . . relating to weapons of mass destruction, . . . relating to threats to use weapons of mass destruction, or . . . relating to restricted biological agents. [][] (5) An attempt or conspiracy to commit any of the above-mentioned crimes.\u201d (\u00a7 629.52, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b889-7\">As relevant here, a \u201cpattern of criminal gang activity\u201d under section 186.22, subdivision (e) involves \u201cthe commission of, attempted commission of, conspiracy to commit, or solicitation of, . . . two or more of the following offenses, provided at least one of these offenses occurred after the effective date of this chapter and the last of those offenses occurred within three years after a prior offense, and the offenses were committed on separate occasions, or by two or more persons.\u201d At the time of the events that led to these proceedings, a short list of these offenses includes assault with a deadly weapon, unlawful homicide or manslaughter, kidnapping, mayhem, torture, possession of a pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed, and threats to commit crimes resulting in death or great bodily injury.

Contrary to defendants\u2019 argument, as one might reasonably expect, the state is not required to minimize interception of a communication involving a planned murder, or assault with a deadly weapon, or any other crime enumerated under section 629.82. The task force was not required to turn a deaf ear to defendants\u2019 discussions relating to murder, obtaining weapons, locating their targets or recruiting other Crips members to participate in the planned retaliatory attacks against the Bloods.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">We conclude that the court did not err when it denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress wiretap evidence at trial on the ground the task force did not have the authority to intercept communications relating to serious offenses other than the targeted drug offenses. The offenses enumerated in section 629.82 do not require minimization if the state is intercepting communications under a lawful, existing wiretap order.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">3. <em>The supervising judge must monitor the wiretap by promptly reviewing complete and timely reports.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">Defendants contend the court erred when it did not suppress wiretap evidence because the state did not comply with reporting requirements under section 629.60. They assert the reports lacked a progress statement or any explanation of deficiency, were generally late, one report was not signed by the court and four reports were signed by a judge who did not sign the wiretap order. Defendants claim the court erroneously stated defendants had the burden to show the reporting procedures were deficient. They argue the court erred when it ruled that defendants were required to show that any error violated the Fourth Amendment, and not a state wiretap statute, to prevail on their motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1179\">*1179</page-number>To resolve defendants\u2019 arguments, we must examine the statute as a matter of first impression under the Act. The interpretation of a statute presents a question of law subject to de novo review. <em>(CBS Broadcasting Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 892, 906 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 889].)</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Section 629.60 states; \u201cWhenever an order authorizing an interception is entered, the order shall require reports in writing or otherwise to be made to the judge who issued the order showing the number of communications intercepted pursuant to the original order, and a statement setting forth what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective, or a satisfactory explanation for its lack, and the need for continued interception. If the judge finds that progress has not been made, that the explanation for its lack is not satisfactory, or that no need exists for continued interception, he or she shall order that the interception immediately terminate. The reports shall be filed with the court at the intervals that the judge may require, but not less than one for each period of six days, and shall be made by any reasonable and reliable means, as determined by the judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Unlike other state and federal wiretap provisions, section 629.60 is not commensurate with its less restrictive federal counterpart (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518(6)).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We continue to consider federal cases where appropriate. Our analysis begins with an examination of section 629.60.  The statutory language is generally the most reliable indicator of legislative intent. <em>(Fitch </em>v. <em>Select Products Co. </em>(2005) 36 Cal.4th 812, 818 [31 Cal.Rptr.3d 591, 115 P.3d 1233] <em>(Fitch).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-8\">\u201cThe objective of statutory construction is to determine the intent of the enacting body so that the law may receive the interpretation that best effectuates that intent.\u201d <em>(Fitch, supra, </em>36 Cal.4th at p. 818.) \u201c \u2018The words of the statute should be given their ordinary and usual meaning and should be construed in their statutory context.\u2019 [Citation.] If the plain, commonsense meaning of a statute\u2019s words is unambiguous, the plain meaning controls.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cWe may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.\u201d <em>(California Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Assn. v. City of Los Angeles </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 342, 349 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 279, 902 P.2d 297] <em>(Cal Fed.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">As we have explained, California law generally prohibits wiretaps. When authorized the Act protects the privacy of wire and oral communications and delineates the circumstances under which the state may intrude into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1180\">*1180</page-number>private communications. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 383; <em>Zepeda, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1195; <em>Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 144; <em>Halpin </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>6 Cal.3d at p. 898.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-4\">The statute must be construed in consideration of the state policy and its words interpreted according to their plain meaning. <em>(Cal Fed., supra, </em>11 Cal.4th at p. 349.) Section 629.60 states that each report must be filed with the supervising judge at intervals not to exceed six days. \u201cInterval\u201d is \u201ca space of time between events.\u201d (Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Diet. (11th ed. 2006) p. 655.) The event specified here is \u201cfiled with the court.\u201d (\u00a7 629.60.) We conclude that each report must reach the court no later than every six days unless the court directs the state to file the report at a more frequent interval. We believe the Act requires attentive and considered oversight by the judge that authorized the wiretap order (supervising judge) from the initial authorization order to the termination of the wiretap. Timely and ongoing reports are an integral part of this framework. There is no other provision in the Act that allows the supervising judge to monitor the continued necessity of the wiretap. (See \u00a7 629.50 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-5\">We are not persuaded by the state\u2019s argument that because the reporting provision of the federal wiretap act is less stringent than section 629.60, and the Legislature explicitly intended to make California wiretap law \u201c ' \u201cconform to the federal law\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 151-152), section 629.60 cannot be considered a central provision in the Act. We presume the Legislature was aware of the less stringent federal reporting provision when it amended the Act to \u201c \u2018to expand California wiretap law to conform to the federal law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th at p. 383, quoting Sen. Com. on Crim. Proc., Rep. on Sen. Bill No. 1016 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) as amended Apr. 3, 1995, p. i; <em>see Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at pp. 151-152; cf. <em>People v. Strohl </em>(1976) 57 Cal.App.3d 347, 359-360 [129 Cal.Rptr. 224].) The Legislature\u2019s subsequent amendment of section 629.60 to mandate that reports are \u201cfiled with the court\u201d not less than one for each period of \u201csix days\u201d indicates that it intended the statute not conform to federal law in this regard. (Stats. 2002, ch. 605, \u00a7 8; Historical and Statutory Notes, 49 West\u2019s Ann. Pen. Code (2010 supp.) foil. \u00a7 629.60, p. 75 [\u201cStats.2002, c. 605 (A.B.74), inserted \u2018the number of communications intercepted pursuant to the original order, and a statement setting forth\u2019; substituted \u2018filed with the court\u2019 for \u2018made\u2019; and substituted \u2018six days\u2019 for \u201872 hours\u2019.\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Our belief the statute means what it says requires the state to prepare material for each report commensurate with its ability to timely file the report with the supervising judge within the specified time. At the same time, section 629.60 does not require the report to be in any particular form. The phrases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1181\">*1181</page-number>\u201cthe order shall require reports in writing or otherwise\u201d and \u201c[t]he reports . . . shall be made by any reasonable and reliable means, as determined by the judge\u201d suggest written reports are preferred but not essential. (\u00a7 629.60.) In any event, it will be necessary for the court and parties to maintain meticulous records of the proceedings, particularly if the reports are other than written.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">Here, the task force, through the San Diego County District Attorney, submitted 10 six-day reports for wiretap 04-15 and extension to the court and two reports for wiretap 05-01. The reports provide a brief summary of the wiretap orders. They state the period of time of the report and summarize, by the target telephone number, the number of outgoing, incoming and incomplete calls. The reports detail the number of pertinent, privileged and minimized calls, and pen register activity during periods when the task force did not monitor the calls. Each report refers to an attached summary of selected intercepted calls for that time period and states the summary \u201cserves as an update on the investigation regarding the progress that has been made, or an explanation for its lack, and the need for continued interception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">Each summary contains a list of selected calls in chronological order by target telephone and provides a brief description of the contents of the conversation, the participants, the caller and the person called, and the session (call) number. With few exceptions, the summaries focus on communications involving drug transactions. For example, on December 17, 2004, Roberts telephoned Pettis. The description in the report summary states: \u201c[Roberts] details his 2005 cocaine acquisition, shipment, costs and expected profit margins to [Pettis], which also involved mentioning a cousin and an out of town trip to set it all up.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">The length of time between the end of each six-day review period and the date the reports were signed by Deputy District Attorney Damon Mosler varied from one to 17 days. Judge Deddeh signed reports 1 through 7 from two to eight days after the date of Mosler\u2019s signature. Report 8 was not signed by a judge. Judge Michael D. Wellington signed reports 9 and 10 for wiretap 04-15 on February 3, 2005. Mosler signed those reports on February 1 and 3, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">On February 3, 2005, Judge Wellington signed the two six-day reports that were prepared for wiretap 05-01. Mosler had signed the reports on February 1. They covered the reporting periods January 6 through January 11, 2005, and January 12 through 17, with lag times of 23 and 17 days, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">At the suppression hearing, Detective Anderson testified the intercepted calls were monitored as they came in. If he or his partners decided there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>a pertinent call to report, they would print a synopsis of the call. At the end of the night shift, after 15 or 16 hours of monitoring telephone communications, each call was printed and placed in a binder. The following day, Anderson or the supervising agent would review the calls and set aside the calls in which narcotics, gangs, weapons and other offenses were discussed. They then would determine which calls would be included in the six-day report summary. The contents of the calls were condensed and typed. When the summary was prepared, Anderson e-mailed it to Hosier. Hosier then prepared the six-day report and attached Anderson\u2019s summary. Because of the workload and long hours, Anderson often did not complete the six-day report until the seventh or eighth day. Anderson did not know how long it took Hosier to prepare the report once he received the summary of the selected calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Hosier did not testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Judge Elias found that the six-day reports were not file-stamped and the exact date a report was filed with the court was not evident from the document itself. Judge Elias could infer the reports were filed about the date of the deputy district attorney\u2019s signature up to and including the date of the judge\u2019s signature. The exact date could not be ascertained.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">Judge Elias found that defendants did not meet their burden to show the reports were not provided to the court at the earliest possible time or as directed by the wiretap orders.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> At defense counsel\u2019s insistence the court applied the framework expounded in <em>Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at page 149, to determine whether a trial court should suppress wiretap evidence under section 1538.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">The court stated it was not convinced defendants established a violation of section 629.60. Further, even if there were a violation, it did not contravene the Fourth Amendment. The court reasoned in view of the supervising judge\u2019s discretion under the statute, the reporting provision did not play a central role in the statutory scheme. If the provision played a central role, the judges\u2019 signatures on the reports indicated the supervising court found no reason to terminate the wiretaps. The court denied defendants\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-8\">While we agree with the court\u2019s decision to deny defendants\u2019 motion to suppress, we do not completely endorse the court\u2019s legal analysis and application of section 629.60. We first address several procedural issues raised by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>Both parties urge this court to adopt the analysis set out by our colleagues in the Second District to determine whether to suppress wiretap evidence under sections 629.72 and 1538.5. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.) Under this framework, the trial court asked the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">(1) Has the defendant established a violation of the Fourth Amendment or a provision of the Act? If not, the motion is denied.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-6\">(2) Does the violated provision play a central role in the Act? \u201cIf the provision was not intended to \u2018play a central role,\u2019 failing to comply with it will not render interceptions under the wiretap order unlawful and the motion is denied.\u201d <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">(3) Was the purpose of the provision achieved despite the error? If the purpose was achieved, the motion is denied. If the purpose was not achieved, the motion is granted. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">We believe the <em>Jackson </em>framework is appropriate to apply to determine whether violations of provisions of section 629.60 merit the suppression of evidence under section 1538.5. Under this framework, the defendant has the burden to show the evidence was obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment or a provision of the Act, and that provision was intended to play a central role in the authorization and execution of wiretaps. The burden then shifts to the state to show the statutory purpose of the violated provision was achieved in spite of the error. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 160.)</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">We are not persuaded by defendants\u2019 contention the court applied an incorrect standard when it remarked that any violation of section 629.60 must contravene the Fourth Amendment before the court could suppress evidence. We agree that section 629.72 clearly states otherwise. However, the record shows the court made a step-by-step analysis of alleged violations under the <em>Jackson </em>framework, which encompasses both Fourth Amendment and state statutory violations. In addressing the section 1538.5 motion, the court did not improperly omit consideration of alleged violations of provisions of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">However, the evidence does not support the court\u2019s finding the state complied with section 629.60. The record shows several of the six-day reports did not reach the supervising judge for several weeks after the end of the reporting period, one report was not signed by the court and four reports were signed by a judge who did not sign the wiretap authorization order. This was sufficient to establish one or more violations of section 629.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Detective Anderson described the procedures he and others used to compile the summaries and the reasons the summaries might have been delayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>several days. The record supports the court\u2019s finding the procedures of Detective Anderson and his partners were reasonable, and in accord with the trial court\u2019s order. However, as we explained, <em>ante, </em>at pages 1179 to 1181, the trial court misinterpreted section 629.60.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">We infer from the district attorney\u2019s prompt review of reports 1, 2, 3 and 8 of wiretap 04-15, which the district attorney signed two, one, four and three days respectively after the end of the review period, the district attorney\u2019s office had the capability to sign and file the reports in a timely manner. (\u00a7 629.60.) However, the district attorney did not sign any other report sooner than seven days after the end of the review period, and two were not signed for 17 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">As the trial court noted, the reports were not file-stamped by the clerk of court. We cannot determine from the appellate record when the reports were received by the court. Because of Judge Wellington\u2019s prompt review of the last two reports of wiretap 04-15, and the 05-01 reports, three of which were signed by the judge on the same date as the district attorney, we infer the reports were submitted to the court on or about the date they were signed by the district attorney. Generally, Judge Deddeh\u2019s review was not as prompt. The record shows on two occasions his review was significantly delayed for eight days and one report was not signed. Even if we were to accept the court\u2019s finding the reports may not have been filed until the date of the judge\u2019s signature, the supervising judge has a responsibility to monitor the wiretap and ensure prompt delivery of the reports in compliance with section 629.60. We do not condone the lack of timely judicial oversight evinced by this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Defendants contend the reference to an attached summary of pertinent communications is inconsistent with the required \u201cstatement setting forth what progress has been made toward achievement of the authorized objective.\u201d (\u00a7 629.60.) In view of the statute\u2019s flexibility in the form of the report, and the authorization order\u2019s lack of other direction, we are not persuaded by this contention. Although the better practice is to explicitly and succinctly report the progress made toward the goals of the investigation in the body of the report, here, the supervising judge could reasonably gamer that information from the summaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">We conclude defendants established error under the first prong of the <em>Jackson </em>framework. Defendants do not argue these errors contravened the Fourth Amendment. Under <em>Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th 129, the court next determines whether the violated state provisions play a central role in the wiretap statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>Not every provision of section 629.60 plays a central role in limiting unnecessary interception of wire and oral communications. A central role is one that affects the legality of the authorization or the execution of the wiretaps. (See <em>United States v. Giordano, supra, </em>416 U.S. 505, 527 [exclusion of wiretap evidence required when there is a failure to satisfy statutory requirements that directly and substantively limit the use of wiretaps to those situations clearly calling for employment of this extraordinary investigative device].)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Contrary to defendants\u2019 assertions, we do not believe the requirement the report be signed only by the judge that issued the authorization order plays a central role in the statutory scheme. As a practical matter, a supervising judge may be unavailable. Rather than forgo prompt judicial oversight of the wiretap, a fully informed judge may review the reports. A substitute supervising judge is capable of reviewing the wiretap order, determining the goal of the investigation and the targeted offense (if not set forth in the report) and immediately terminating the wiretap if indicated. (See <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Love </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1994) 859 F.Supp. 725, 731-732.)</p>\n<p id=\"b897-6\">However, the lack of timeliness and prompt judicial review contravenes a central purpose of the Act and, as such, the timely filing requirement under section 629.60 plays a central role. California law generally prohibits wiretaps and delineates the circumstances under which the state may intrude into private communications. <em>(Leon, supra, </em>40 Cal.4th atp. 383; <em>Halpin v. Superior Court, supra, 6 </em>Cal.3d at p. 898; <em>Zepeda, supra, </em>87 Cal.App.4th at p. 1195; <em>Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 144.) Section 629.60 prescribes timely and ongoing judicial oversight of a wiretap order and mandates immediate termination of the wiretap when the judge finds that progress has not been made, the explanation for the lack of progress is not satisfactory or no need exists for continued interception.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">The third prong of the <em>Jackson </em>framework requires the state to show that the purpose of the provision was achieved despite the error. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.) Here, the evidence shows the task force continued to intercept communications relating to narcotics trafficking. The supervising court could draw the reasonable inference the task force was making progress toward the achievement of the authorized objective. (\u00a7 629.60.) With the exception of the unsigned report, the reports were approved by a supervising or substitute supervising judge. (Cf. <em>In re DeMonte </em>(7th Cir. 1982) 674 F.2d 1169, 1174.) Had the reports been timely issued, the supervising judge would not have immediately terminated the wiretap. We also note the task force informed the supervising judge about the communications relating to conspiracy to commit murder in its application for an extension of wiretap 04-15. In approving the wiretap extension and wiretap 05-01, the supervising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1186\">*1186</page-number>judge was informed of developments and, as we discussed earlier in this opinion, made the appropriate findings of necessity. We conclude that the purpose of the provision was achieved despite the errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">To summarize, we adopt the <em>Jackson </em>framework for evaluating whether a motion to suppress wiretap evidence should be granted. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.) We hold that this framework is applicable to evaluate alleged violations of section 629.60. Once the defendant has established a violation of any provision of section 629.60 and the provision plays a central role in the Act, the burden shifts to the state to show the purpose of the provision was achieved despite the error. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>at p. 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">The purpose of the reporting statute is to allow the supervising judge to promptly and effectively exercise his or her oversight responsibilities after the judge has authorized a wiretap, and to \u201cimmediately terminate\u201d the interception when progress has not been made, the explanation for the lack of progress is not satisfactory or no need exists for continued interception. (\u00a7 629.60.) The judge who authorized the wiretap, or a fully informed substitute judge, is responsible for thoroughly reviewing the reports, communicating with the state if the report lacks the specificity required under section 629.60 or are not filed as soon as practicable, and maintaining a meticulous record of all wiretap proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">4. <em>The application to use statutorily authorized, nontargeted communications in the criminal court and grand jury proceedings was not made or reviewed as soon as practicable; however, the error does not require reversal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">Defendants assert the court erred when it did not suppress 11 intercepted calls (11 calls or material), including the \u201ccredible heads call,\u201d that were made before the court approved the extension order on December 22, 2004, authorizing the task force to intercept communications relating to criminal street gang activity. They argue the court erred when it allowed the state to use this material in the criminal court and grand jury proceedings without having made the judicial findings required under sections 629.82, subdivision (a), and 629.78 within the statutory timeframe.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-9\">To determine whether the evidence was improperly seized or improperly admitted at trial, resulting in a violation of the Fourth Amendment, we exercise our independent judgment to assess the legality of the search and examine whether the evidence would have been excluded had the court ruled on the application. <em>(Reyes, supra, </em>172 Cal.App.4th at p. 683.) We keep in mind the purpose of section 629.82 is to prevent the state from fishing for information in constitutionally protected waters. (Cf. <em>U.S. v. Van Horn </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1187\">*1187</page-number>(11th Cir. 1986) 789 F.2d 1492, 1504 [the purpose of the comparable federal statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2517, is to prevent subterfuge].)</p>\n<p id=\"b899-5\">On August 1, 2005, the district attorney filed an application with the court to use the 11 calls at trial. During the suppression hearing, at the request of the district attorney, who had interpreted section 629.78 as authority to use statutorily authorized, nontargeted communications at trial without judicial approval, the court did not rule on the application. This was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-6\">On August 1, 2007, in a comprehensive suppression motion, defendants challenged the lack of judicial authorization to use the material. The trial court reasoned that although the nontargeted calls were not directly related to narcotics trafficking, the 11 calls could be used at trial because they concerned crimes enumerated in section 629.52, subdivision (a), and thus were properly intercepted. The court erred as a matter of law. This ruling was incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-7\">Section 629.52 lists offenses for which the court may authorize a wiretap order. It does not concern offenses that were not targeted in the initial order. The state acknowledges the statutory provisions that govern the use of the contents and evidence derived from interceptions of nontargeted communications are found in sections 629.82 and 629.78.</p>\n<p id=\"b899-8\">Section 629.82 states in relevant part: \u201c(a) If a peace officer or federal law enforcement officer, while engaged in intercepting . . . electronic cellular telephone communications in the manner authorized by this chapter, intercepts . . . electronic cellular telephone communications relating to crimes other than those specified in the order of authorization, but which are enumerated in subdivision (a) of Section 629.52, or any violent felony as defined in subdivision (c) of Section 667.5, ... (2) the contents and any evidence derived therefrom may be used under Section 629.78 when authorized by a judge if the judge finds, upon subsequent application, that the contents were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The application shall be made as soon as practicable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-9\">Section 629.78 states: \u201cAny person who has received, by any means authorized by this chapter, any information concerning . . . electronic cellular telephone communication, or evidence derived therefrom, intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, may, pursuant to Section 629.82, disclose the contents of that communication or derivative evidence while giving testimony under oath or affirmation in any criminal court proceeding or in any grand jury proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b899-10\">As we have discussed, <em>ante, </em>the state is not required to minimize communications relating to certain enumerated crimes. (\u00a7 629.82.) However, the Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1188\">*1188</page-number>limits the use of such intercepted communications. (\u00a7\u00a7 629.74, 629.76, 629.78, 629.82.) As relevant here, before the contents of any statutorily authorized, nontargeted communications, and any evidence derived from those communications, may be used in a criminal court proceeding, the state must apply to a judge for authorization. (\u00a7\u00a7 629.78, 629.82, subd. (a).) This application must be made \u201cas soon as practicable.\u201d (\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a)(2); see \u00a7 629.78.) The judge cannot authorize the use of the nontargeted intercepted communications at trial unless he or she finds that the nontargeted communications were otherwise intercepted in accordance with the Act. (\u00a7\u00a7 629.82, subd. (a)(2), 629.78; see \u00a7 629.54.)</p>\n<p id=\"b900-4\">Defendants were arrested in mid-January 2005. A grand jury proceeding began on March 23 and concluded on March 30, 2005. On March 30, the grand jury issued indictments. The state filed an application under section 629.82, subdivision (a)(2) on August 1. Motion hearings involving the 11 calls began on September 21, 2005. In view of the state\u2019s careful preparation of the wiretap evidence to present its case to the grand jury, the court could have inferred the application could have been filed more promptly.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-5\">A trial court has substantial discretion to deny a late application under section 629.82, subdivision (a)(1). It is not, however, required to do so. Had the trial court considered the application under section 629.82, subdivision (a)(2), we do not believe the court would have denied the prosecution the use of the nontargeted, statutorily authorized communications at trial on the ground the application was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-6\">Although the trial court did not make the required findings, the evidence clearly supports the conclusion the 11 calls \u201cwere otherwise intercepted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.\u201d (\u00a7 629.82.) The court correctly determined the initial wiretap authorization was supported by an adequate finding of necessity and the calls were properly minimized. The 11 calls related to criminal street gang activity and conspiracy to commit murder, which are enumerated crimes under section 629.52, subdivision (a). The task force legally intercepted both targeted and statutorily authorized communications. While the reports covering the period from December 13 to December 24, 2004, were not timely, the supervising judge was informed of the \u201ccredible heads call\u201d when the task force applied for an extension of the initial wiretap order on December 22. Because the material was legally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1189\">*1189</page-number>intercepted, we determine the errors did not contravene the Fourth Amendment and, with respect to the statutory violations, the purposes of the provision were achieved despite the errors. <em>(Jackson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.4th at p. 149.)</p>\n<p id=\"b901-5\">We further conclude the errors were harmless and do not require reversal. <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836-837 [299 P.2d 243].) The material was intercepted in accordance with the Act. Defendants were not surprised by the proposed use of the 11 calls at trial; they had copies of the material before the 2005 suppression hearings. The application to use the material was made in advance of trial. They had the opportunity at trial to object to the material. Defendants\u2019 rights to a fair trial were not violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b901-7\">\n<em>VEHICLE STOP</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b901-8\">Defendants contend the reason for the vehicle stop was pretextual because the police did not have reasonable suspicion the vehicle\u2019s tinted windows violated the applicable Vehicle Code. They assert the resulting search violated constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure and the court erred when it did not suppress all evidence obtained from the vehicle stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b901-9\">\u201cA detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that, considered in the light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective manifestation that the person detained may be involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Souza </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 224, 231 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 885 P.2d 982]; see also <em>In re James D. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 903, 914 [239 Cal.Rptr. 663, 741 P.2d 161] <em>(James </em>D.).) In other words, any reasonable police officer in a like position, drawing on his or her training and experience, would suspect the same criminal activity and involvement by the person in question. <em>(James D., </em>at pp. 914-915, citing <em>In re Tony C. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 888, 893 [148 Cal.Rptr. 366, 582 P.2d 957].) The officer\u2019s subjective intent or ulterior motive for the vehicle stop is not determinative of its legality. <em>(Whren v. United States </em>(1996) 517 U.S. 806, 812-813 [135 L.Ed.2d 89, 116 S.Ct. 1769] <em>(Whren).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b901-10\">The standard of review for the denial of a motion to suppress is well settled. \u201cWe defer to the trial court\u2019s factual findings, express or implied, where supported by substantial evidence. In determining whether, on the facts so found, the search or seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment, we exercise our independent judgment. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Glaser </em>(1995) 11 Cal.4th 354, 362 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 425, 902 P.2d 729].)</p>\n<p id=\"b902-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1190\">*1190</page-number>On January 16, 2005, task force officers, including the officer who stopped the vehicle, knew from recent and contemporaneous intercepted conversations that Roberts and Brown were about to carry out a planned action against the Bloods. Task force officers had reason to believe the men were armed. Officer Norton and his partner, Officer McKean (together, officers), were briefed about a possible shooting in Deep Valley. They were informed Roberts and Brown could possibly be involved in or conduct a shooting that night. Detective Anderson instructed task force officers to find any reason to stop Roberts and Brown\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-4\">Officer Norton stated, \u201cWe received direction that the vehicle was to be stopped. What it was to be stopped for, I don\u2019t recall receiving any info what to stop it for, just to find a reason to stop it.\u201d Because of the briefing earlier that night, Norton believed there was a gun in the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-5\">The officers followed the car after it passed their location. McKean testified they did not develop probable cause to stop the vehicle until they pulled alongside it. Norton noticed he could not see through the driver\u2019s tinted side window from the open passenger side window. He believed the view from the windows was obstructed by the tint in violation of Vehicle Code section 26708.5, subdivision (a). The officers stopped the vehicle. Norton smelled alcohol and saw an open container in the car. Brown confirmed there was alcohol in it. The officer asked Roberts and Brown to step out of the car. Norton then searched the car and found a handgun under the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-6\">Roberts moved to suppress evidence obtained from the automobile stop. He argued the reason for the vehicle stop was pretextual and the evidence should be excluded as the fruit of an illegal search. The motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-7\">Generally, a stop is considered \u201cpretextual\u201d when a law enforcement officer observes or suspects a minor traffic infraction, and uses it to stop the vehicle and search it for evidence even though the officer has no legal basis to suspect the vehicle contains any illegal contraband or the occupants are engaged in any criminal activity. (See, e.g., <em>Whren, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 808, <em>People </em>v. <em>Uribe </em>(1993) 12 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1435-1436 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 127]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 917, 923 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 785].) This was not the situation here.</p>\n<p id=\"b902-8\">Although the reason given to Roberts and Brown for the vehicle stop was artful, the stop was more than an investigative stop or detention predicated on mere curiosity, rumor, or hunch. (See <em>James D., supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 903, 914-915, citing <em>Terry v. Ohio </em>(1968) 392 U.S. 1, 22 [20 L.Ed.2d 889, 88 S.Ct. 1868].) The stop itself was not pretextual. \u201cIt is well settled in California <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1191\">*1191</page-number>officers can make arrests based on information and probable cause furnished by other officers.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ramirez </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 1548, 1553 [70 Cal.Rptr.2d 341] <em>(Ramirez).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b903-5\">Detective Anderson, who was the case agent and wire room monitor, testified the intercepted communications indicated Roberts and Brown were going to Deep Valley to shoot rival gang members. Anderson briefed his team about the intercepted calls. He told the officers that Roberts and Brown were in the vehicle the task force was trying to find. The facts were not imaginary. The police had compelling, articulable facts to support their suspicions that Roberts was armed and ready to carry out a retaliatory murder of one or more members of the Bloods. <em>(Whren, supra, </em>517 U.S. at p. 812.) We conclude the officers\u2019 \u201ccollective knowledge\u201d of Roberts\u2019s involvement in the planned shooting was valid and reasonable. <em>(Ramirez, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1555.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-6\">In addition, there is substantial evidence to support the court\u2019s finding that Officer Norton\u2019s belief the vehicle\u2019s tinted windows violated Vehicle Code section 26708.5, subdivision (a), was sufficient to establish probable cause for the stop. Just as \u201c[shopping defendant\u2019s vehicle for a seatbelt violation, even if done as a pretext for the narcotics investigation, was entirely legal,\u201d so too was this stop. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gomez </em>(2004) 117 Cal.App.4th 531, 537 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 398], citing <em>Arkansas v. Sullivan </em>(2001) 532 U.S. 769, 771-772 [149 L.Ed.2d 994, 121 S.Ct. 1876], <em>Whren, supra, </em>517 U.S. at pp. 812-813 and <em>Ramirez, supra, </em>59 Cal.App.4th at p. 1557, fn. 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b903-7\">We conclude the vehicle stop did not violate constitutional safeguards against unreasonable search and seizure. \u201cA detention is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment when the detaining officer can point to specific articulable facts that, considered in light of the totality of the circumstances, provide some objective manifestation that the person detained may be involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Souza, supra, 9 </em>Cal.4th 224, 231.) Here the underlying facts for the stop were specific and reliable. The court did not err when it denied the motion to suppress evidence from the vehicle stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-8\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b903-9\">\n<em>GANG EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-10\">\n<em>A. Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b903-11\">Roberts contends the trial court abused its discretion under Evidence Code section 352 when it admitted numerous photos of Roberts, Pettis and others wearing gang colors, showing gang signs, displaying weapons and visiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1192\">*1192</page-number>grave sites of murdered Crips members and associates. They argue in view of the testimonial evidence establishing their connections with the Crips, the photographs served only to paint Roberts as a dangerous gang member and inflame the jury, and to allow the jury to conclude Pettis was guilty by association.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">Evidence Code section 352 states in pertinent part the court may exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the probability its admission will create substantial danger of undue prejudice. Evidence creates \u201cundue prejudice\u201d when it \u201c \u2018uniquely tends to evoke an emotional bias against a party as an individual, while having only slight probative value with regard to the issues.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Robinson </em>(2005) 37 Cal.4th 592, 632 [36 Cal.Rptr.3d 760, 124 P.3d 363].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">\u201cThe weighing process under section 352 depends upon the trial court\u2019s consideration of the unique facts and issues of each case, rather than upon the mechanical application of automatic rules. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People v. Jennings </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1301, 1314 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 727].) \u201c\u2018The [trial] court\u2019s exercise of discretion under Evidence Code section 352 will not be disturbed on appeal unless the court clearly abused its discretion, e.g., when the prejudicial effect of the evidence clearly outweighed its probative value.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Jennings, supra, </em>at pp. 1314-1315, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 1389, 1396 [22 Cal.Rptr.2d 14].)</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">The proffered photographs were relevant to prove the crime of conspiracy to commit murder as well as the finding the offense was \u201cfor the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with a criminal street gang,\u201d and to rebut defendants\u2019 claims. (\u00a7\u00a7 182, subd. (a)(1), 186.22, subd. (b).) The defendants denied they were engaged in a conspiracy to carry out a retaliatory murder of one or more Bloods. Pettis denied he was a member of the Crips. Roberts claimed he had friendly personal relationships with Samoans, including members and associates of the Bloods, and therefore would not have sought to kill Blood members.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">The trial court was aware of its discretion to exclude evidence under Evidence Code section 352. The court required the prosecution to discuss each of the proffered photographs and explain its relevance. The prosecution explained, photograph by photograph, how the proffered evidence showed a defendant, or both defendants, in the company of other coconspirators, explained a reference made during an intercepted conversation, or demonstrated gang membership or a connection to an earlier gang event. The photographs were not gruesome or shocking. The court excluded photographs it found to be of limited relevance or whose admission would be cumulative. We find nothing in the record to indicate the trial court abused its discretion. <em>(People v. Jennings, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.4th at p. 1314.)</p>\n<p id=\"b905-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1193\">*1193</page-number>B. <em>Opinion Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">Roberts argues the gang expert impermissibly exceeded legal limitations by interpreting the meaning of four intercepted telephone calls and opining Roberts had the requisite mental state for conspiracy to commit murder. The testimony at issue concerns Detective Taele\u2019s opinion that Roberts asked his child\u2019s mother about a vehicle parked in front of a home in order to identify the home where the Bloods\u2019 party was to be held, and told her not to attend the party because he intended to return to the home to kill gang members (call 1682). In call 1874, Roberts mentioned \u201ca nigga trying to put some shit together.\u201d Taele testified he was referring to a plan. In another conversation, Roberts told Pettis the Bloods were to have a meeting at a park. Taele stated it was important to let Pettis know of the meeting to allow Pettis to coordinate simultaneous attacks on Bloods at the park and the party (call 1878). Defendants also object to Taele\u2019s interpretation of a message left for Roberts by a Crips member asking what was going on (call 1894). Taele opined the speaker was referring to the planned attacks. Defendants note the call did not contain any slang language requiring interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">Roberts argues the expert addressed ultimate issues of fact to be decided by the jury and thus violated his rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Without citation to the record, Roberts asserts he has not forfeited this claim on appeal because \u201ca general <em>in limine </em>was made by defense counsel.\u201d He argues to the extent specific objections were required and not made, he received ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">A party forfeits the right to claim error as grounds for reversal on appeal when he or she fails to raise the objection in the trial court. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3515, 3516; 9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Appeal, \u00a7 396, p. 453; <em>In re Kevin S. </em>(1996) 41 Cal.App.4th 882, 885 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 763].) A party may not assert theories on appeal which were not raised in the trial court. <em>(Fretland v. County of Humboldt </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1478, 1489 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 359].) Roberts forfeited the right to assign error on appeal. <em>(In re Dakota H. </em>(2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 212, 222 [33 Cal.Rptr.3d 337].) Further, even if Roberts did not forfeit this claim, we would find his contention to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">Evidence Code section 805 states: \u201cTestimony in the form of an opinion that is otherwise admissible is not objectionable because it embraces the ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d The objection that the opinion of an expert coincides with the \u201cultimate issue\u201d in the case is untenable. <em>(People v. Killebrew </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 644, 651 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 876] <em>(Killebrew).) </em>This rule, however, does not permit the expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1194\">*1194</page-number>to express any opinion he or she may have. <em>(Piscitelli v. Friedenberg </em>(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 953, 972 [105 Cal.Rptr.2d 88].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Roberts relies on <em>Killebrew, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th 644, for his assertion expert testimony concerning the defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge and intent is prohibited. We believe Roberts\u2019s construction of its holding is overbroad. <em>Killebrew </em>does not generally prohibit such testimony; rather, the reviewing court concluded that in view of the facts and circumstances of that case, the expert\u2019s opinion about the defendant\u2019s subjective knowledge and intent was inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">In <em>Killebrew, </em>the expert testified at length about gangs and gang psychology. He stated \u201cwhen one gang member in a car possesses a gun, every other gang member in the car knows of the gun and will constructively possess the gun.\u201d <em>(Killebrew, supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 652.) The expert\u2019s opinion was the only evidence the prosecution offered to establish the elements of the crime. As such, it was \u201cthe type of opinion that did nothing more than inform the jury how [the expert] believed the case should be decided.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 658; see <em>Summers </em>v. A. L. <em>Gilbert Co. </em>(1999) 69 Cal.App.4th 1155, 1182-1183 [82 Cal.Rptr.2d 162].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-7\">Here, in contrast, Detective Taele testified about the planned action based on defendants\u2019 prior telephone conversations. The challenged testimony includes Taele\u2019s interpretation of gang slang, his opinion Roberts confirmed that a vehicle belonged to a member of the Bloods in order to identify the correct home, locating the whereabouts of a Crips member to get everyone together, and allowing Pettis to coordinate the plan to attack Bloods meeting at the park and party. We are not persuaded the testimony of the gang expert exceeded permissible legal limits.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-8\">We observe that counsel\u2019s failure to object does not establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Roberts cannot show that had defense counsel objected to the admission of the gang expert\u2019s testimony concerning the four intercepted conversations at issue, the court would have excluded the testimony. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 353, subd. (b).) Further, even if those conversations had been excluded, Roberts cannot show there was a reasonable probability the verdict would have been different. <em>(Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 686 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 104 S.Ct. 2052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b906-9\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b906-10\">\n<em>SEVERANCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b906-11\">Roberts contends the court abused its discretion when it did not sever the trial after Pettis decided to testify. He submits the trial judge has a continuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1195\">*1195</page-number>duty at all stages of the trial to grant a motion for separate trials if a joint trial results in prejudice to a codefendant. <em>(Schaffer v. United States </em>(1960) 362 U.S. 511, 516 [4 L.Ed.2d 921, 80 S.Ct. 945].) Roberts argues the admission of previously excluded calls violated his federal due process rights. He asserts the limiting instructions to the jury could not overcome the prejudicial effect of the intercepted calls in which Pettis described Roberts\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">On July 24, 2006, Roberts filed a motion for a separate trial. He asserted the admission of Pettis\u2019s extrajudicial statements that were made before Roberts allegedly became involved in the conspiracy and after the conspiracy was terminated would violate the principles set forth in <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265] (Aranda) and <em>Bruton </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 123 [20 L.Ed.2d 476, 88 S.Ct. 1620] <em>(Bruton) </em>(together, <em>Aranda-Bruton).</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b907-6\">The trial court stated the conspiracy began on December 13, 2004, with the \u201ccredible heads call\u201d and ended on January 16, 2005, when Roberts and others were arrested. The court ruled the calls intercepted before December 13 and after January 16 (with the exception of conversations between Pettis and Roberts) were inadmissible because they were made before the conspiracy started or after it ended. (See <em>Callan v. Superior Court </em>(1962) 204 Cal.App.2d 652, 664 [22 Cal.Rptr. 508] [statements made by one defendant outside the presence of his codefendant, not in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy and after consummation or frustration of the conspiracy are hearsay as to the latter].) To avoid implicating <em>Aranda-Bruton, </em>the prosecution decided not to offer several other intercepted telephone conversations. The excluded and withdrawn calls included sessions Nos. 187, 12066, 12072, 12091, and 12492 (previously excluded calls or calls). The court ruled that because the intercepted communications implicating Roberts\u2019s confrontation rights were not to be admitted into evidence, a joint trial did not create an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1196\">*1196</page-number><em>Aranda-Bruton </em>problem. The court barred the prosecution from admitting the calls in its case-in-chief and denied the motion for severance.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">When Pettis decided to testify at trial, Roberts objected to the admission of the previously excluded calls. Roberts did not file a motion to sever the trial. The court ruled the previously excluded calls could now be used to impeach Pettis\u2019s testimony. The court ruled Roberts now had the opportunity to confront Pettis and the admission of the calls did not invoke <em>Aranda-Bruton. </em>The parties agreed the court would instruct the jury the previously excluded calls could not be used as evidence against Roberts.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In accordance with legislative preferences, the California Supreme Court has expressed a strong preference for the economy and efficiency of joint trials. <em>(People v. Soper </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 759, 771-772 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 188, 200 P.3d 816]; <em>Coffman, supra, </em>34 Cal.4th at p. 40.) Section 1098 provides in pertinent part: \u201cWhen two or more defendants are jointly charged with any public offense, whether felony or misdemeanor, they must be tried jointly, unless the court order[s] separate trials.\u201d Roberts and Pettis were charged with having committed a common crime involving common events, presenting the court with \u201ca \u2018 \u201cclassic case\u201d \u2019 for a joint trial.\u201d <em>(Coffman, supra, </em>at p. 40, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Keenan </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 478, 499-500 [250 Cal.Rptr. 550, 758 P.2d 1081].)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-6\">If certain circumstances apply, the court may order separate trials. For example, the court may sever the trials if there is an incriminating confession by one defendant that implicates a codefendant, the defendants will present conflicting defenses or when \u201c \u2018there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Lewis </em>(2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 452 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 181 P.3d 947] <em>(Lewis).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b908-7\">We review the denial of a motion for severance for abuse of discretion based upon the facts as they appeared when the trial court ruled on the motion. Even if a trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied a motion for severance, we must determine whether the joinder of defendants for trial resulted in \u201cgross unfairness depriving the defendant of due process of law.\u201d <em>(People v. Rogers </em>(2006) 39 Cal.4th 826, 851 [48 Cal.Rptr.3d 1, 141 P.3d 135] <em>(Rogers).) </em>In the case of a violation of federal due process, reversal is required unless the state can prove beyond a reasonable doubt the error did not contribute to the verdict. <em>(People v. Albarran </em>(2007) 149 Cal.App.4th 214, 229 [57 Cal.Rptr.3d 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b908-8\">Roberts contends the denial of his due process rights occurred when Pettis decided to testify at trial. He thus implicitly acknowledges the court did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1197\">*1197</page-number>abuse its discretion at the time it denied his motion for separate trials. Therefore we examine whether the admission of the previously excluded calls resulted in a violation of Roberts\u2019s due process rights to a fair trial. <em>(Rogers, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 851.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">We cannot conclude that Roberts was deprived of his due process rights to a fair trial. Roberts had the opportunity to cross-examine Pettis, the hearsay declarant; thus the admission of the previously excluded calls did not violate <em>Aranda-Bruton. </em>Although Roberts objected to the admission of the previously excluded calls as inadmissible hearsay, when the court stated the calls were admissible for impeachment purposes, Roberts agreed to the limiting instructions to the jury. When each of the previously excluded calls was admitted into evidence, the trial court directed the jury not to consider the statements Pettis made in those calls to others in assessing Roberts\u2019s guilt. We presume the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>(Greer </em>v. <em>Miller </em>(1987) 483 U.S. 756, 766, fn. 8 [97 L.Ed.2d 618, 107 S.Ct. 3102].)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Even were we to find error, we would conclude the joint trial did not prevent the jury from making a rehable judgment about Roberts\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>(Lewis, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at p. 452.) In addition to the evidence in the previously excluded calls, there was strong and ample independent evidence against Roberts. The jury heard other calls in which Roberts sought weapons, helped identify locations of rival gang members, and coordinated and participated in imminent action against the Bloods in a residential neighborhood. The jury could conclude from wiretap, photographic and testimonial evidence that Roberts was a member of the Crips. The evidence shows that officers stopped Roberts as he was preparing to carry out the planned murder or murders. When he spoke to Pettis from the jail after his arrest, Roberts asserted he had been about to act at the time he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">Roberts does not demonstrate error. The admission into evidence of the previously excluded calls did not deprive Roberts of a fair trial, nor did it prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about Roberts\u2019s guilt or innocence. <em>(Rogers, supra, </em>39 Cal.4th at p. 851; <em>Lewis, supra, </em>43 Cal.4th at p. 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">V, VI<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b910-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1198\">*1198</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-5\">McConnell, P.
