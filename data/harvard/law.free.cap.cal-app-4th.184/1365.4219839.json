J.</author>\n<p id=\"A58t\">In this robbery case, we must answer the following</p>\n<p id=\"AGF\">question: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d The answer is, \u201cyes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-13\">A jury convicted defendant Joshua Wayne Weddles of two counts of first degree residential robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7 211\u2014counts 1 and 2),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> first degree burglary (\u00a7 459\u2014count 4), making a criminal threat (\u00a7 422-\u2014count 5), and assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1)\u2014 count 6). The jury also found defendant personally used a firearm as to both robbery counts. (\u00a7 12022.53, subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1367\">*1367</page-number>Sentenced to an aggregate term of 27 years four months in state prison, defendant appeals, claiming (1) insufficient evidence supports his conviction for robbery of Armando Navarette (Armando), (2) insufficient evidence supports his conviction of making a criminal threat, (3) the trial court erred by failing to give, sua sponte, a unanimity instruction as to the criminal threat count, and (4) the trial court committed multiple sentencing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">In the published portion of the opinion, we find that sufficient evidence supports defendant\u2019s convictions for the robbery of Armando, who was forced at gunpoint to turn over to the robbers some $1,500 that belonged to Armando\u2019s brother, Alex Navarette (Alex). In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we find that the trial court committed two sentencing errors. However, we find no other prejudicial error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the convictions and remand the case for correction of the sentencing errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-6\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-7\">Paris Brown, testifying on behalf of the prosecution in hopes of receiving a lighter sentence for himself, explained that he happened to run into defendant at a liquor store in Stockton, California, on the evening of January 19, 2007. The two men decided to get some marijuana to share. A third person\u2014whom they knew as a crack cocaine addict but not by name\u2014came along. They walked several blocks to an apartment on North Commerce Street, where Brown had previously purchased marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">When the men arrived at the apartment around 11:30 p.m., Alex was inside with his girlfriend, Savannah Mowry (Savannah), their two-year-old son, and Alex\u2019s brother, Armando. Savannah and her son were asleep on a loveseat while Armando was asleep on another couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-9\">Alex heard a soft knock on the door. Not expecting anyone at that hour, Alex partially opened the door and saw defendant pointing a gun at his face. Alex attempted to grab the gun, but defendant warned him, \u201cDon\u2019t fight, . . . you\u2019re playing with a loaded gun.\u201d Defendant, Brown, and the third man forced their way into the apartment, knocking Alex to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-10\">As defendant subdued Alex and held the gun to his head, Brown and the other individual ran toward Armando on the couch and started punching him, yelling, \u201cWhere\u2019s the money, where\u2019s the money .... We\u2019ll shoot you, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1368\">*1368</page-number>we\u2019ll pop you.\u201d Armando was then taken to the bedroom by Brown and the other assailant. After showing them a container where Alex and Savannah\u2019s money was kept, Armando was taken back into the living room.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-4\">Defendant and one of his confederates then took Alex into the back bedroom. When Alex came out of the room, his lip was bleeding; he had been hit in the mouth with a fist and struck on the head with a hard object.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-5\">The three assailants fled the apartment with $1,500 in cash, two Ziploc bags containing marijuana, and several small items\u2014including Armando\u2019s car keys. Before they departed, defendant told Alex: \u201cI better not see this shit in the newspaper, don\u2019t call the police. We do this shit bare-faced. I\u2019m [something unintelligible] bandit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-6\">After the incident, Alex, Savannah, and Armando were \u201cjust kind of shaken and scared at the same time.\u201d Out of fear, they moved because they \u201cdidn\u2019t feel safe in the neighborhood any longer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-9\">Sufficiency of the Evidence\u2014Robbery of Armando</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-10\">Defendant contends the evidence was insufficient to prove that Armando was a victim of robbery. Defendant argues that Armando had no interest in or possession of the $1,500 that Alex kept hidden in his bedroom. We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-11\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-12\">In assessing claims of insufficient evidence \u201c \u2018we review the whole record in the light most favorable to the judgment to determine whether it discloses substantial evidence\u2014that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value\u2014from which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People v. Johnson </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 557, 578 [162 Cal.Rptr. 431, 606 P.2d 738]; see also <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 307, 317-320 [61 L.Ed.2d 560, 99 S.Ct. 2781].)\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Abilez </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 504 [61 Cal.Rptr.3d 526, 161 P.3d 58].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1369\">*1369</page-number>B. Evidence Presented at Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Immediately after entering the apartment, two of the assailants rushed at Armando. Armando scuffled with the assailants until defendant ordered him to stop. Defendant threatened to shoot Alex in the head if Armando continued to resist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">The assailants demanded to know where the money was kept. Armando testified that the assailants \u201cjust kept repeating, \u2018Where\u2019s the money . . . where\u2019s the money?\u2019 \u201d and, \u201c \u2018We\u2019ll shoot you, we\u2019ll pop you.\u2019 \u201d While defendant held a gun to Alex\u2019s head, Alex instructed Armando to show the assailants where the money was kept in the bedroom. Armando already knew that Alex kept his money in a decorative jar in the bedroom. He testified, \u201cI knew where my brother was holding the money \u2019cause I knew\u2014because I knew where he was saving his money at. And I knew what\u2014you know, where he put it, and so my brother\u2019s, \u2018Man, like just give it to him, you know,\u2019 \u2019cause the baby was there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-7\">Armando led two of the assailants to the bedroom, where he pointed out the jar. The robbers took $1,500 in cash from the hiding place. The assailants then ransacked the apartment and left after taking a few small items.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">C. Robbery</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Section 211 defines robbery as \u201cthe felonious taking of personal property in the possession of another, from his person or immediate presence, and against his will, accomplished by means of force or fear.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-10\">As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ugalino </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 1060, 1064-1065 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 858], \u201cCalifornia follows \u2018the traditional approach that limits victims of robbery to those persons in either actual or constructive possession of the property taken.\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Nguyen </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 756, 764 [102 Cal.Rptr.2d 548, 14 P.3d 221].) \u2018 \u201cRobbery is an offense against the person ....\u201d\u2019 <em>(People v. Miller </em>(1977) 18 Cal.3d 873, 880 [135 Cal.Rptr. 654, 558 P.2d 552].) Accordingly, a victim can be any person who shares \u2018some type of \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the owner of the property sufficient to demonstrate that the victim had authority or responsibility to protect the stolen property on behalf of the owner.\u2019 <em>(People v. Scott </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 743, 753 [89 Cal.Rptr.3d 213, 200 P.3d 837].) Persons with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1370\">*1370</page-number>just such a special relationship include business employees and parents living with their adult children. <em>(Scott, supra, </em>45 Cal.4th at pp. 752, 753-754; see <em>People v. Jones </em>(2000) 82 Cal.App.4th 485, 491 [98 Cal.Rptr.2d 329].)\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Defendant does not dispute that property was taken from the apartment or that force and fear were employed against Armando. Instead, defendant argues for reversal of the conviction for robbery of Armando by arguing that \u201cArmando had no possession of or interest in the money\u201d belonging to Alex.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">However, Armando had a special relationship with his brother that endowed Armando with constructive possession of his brother\u2019s cash. On this point, we find instructive the case of <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 519 [186 Cal.Rptr. 373] <em>(Gordon). Gordon </em>involved robbers who entered the Lopeses\u2019 home, threatened them at gunpoint, and took a bag containing cash and marijuana from their adult son\u2019s room. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 523-524.) \u201cThe only evidence in the record to support a finding of possession is the fact Mr. and Mrs. Lopes owned and lived in the residence.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 529.) Even though the evidence indicated the Lopeses had no prior knowledge of the stolen items, the convictions for robbery were affirmed. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">The <em>Gordon </em>court explained that persons responsible for protecting and preserving property are properly deemed to be robbery victims. Such persons have been held to include a purchasing agent, store clerks, a barmaid, janitors, watchmen, and gas station attendants. <em>(People v. Gordon, supra, </em>136 Cal.App.3d at p. 529.) Reasoning that if such persons \u201cwere responsible for the protection and preservation of the property entrusted to them, parents have at least the same responsibility to protect goods belonging to their son who resides with them in their home.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Consequently, the parents were victims of robbery. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">As in <em>Gordon, </em>the robbery conviction in this case may be affirmed based on constructive possession of an immediate family member\u2019s property. We reject as untenable defendant\u2019s argument that Armando had no concern about whether his brother\u2019s savings were pilfered from the apartment that he regularly visited. Armando\u2019s close familial relationship with the owner of the property, his regular presence at the apartment, and knowledge of where the property was hidden by Alex establish that Armando had constructive possession of the cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1371\">*1371</page-number>Defendant misplaces his reliance on our decision in <em>People v. Ugalino, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.4th 1060. In <em>Ugalino, </em>Joshua Johnson and Jessie Rider shared a two-bedroom apartment with several other people. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1062.) The defendant and his accomplice entered the apartment on pretense of buying marijuana from Johnson, a drug dealer. Once inside, the defendant and his cohort drew guns on Johnson, and the defendant announced, \u201cyou\u2019re getting jacked.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1062-1063.) Johnson stuffed the drugs that he had been holding into his pants and fled the apartment. The assailants followed Johnson in pursuit. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1063.) On appeal, we reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction for attempted robbery of Rider. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1065.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">In reversing the conviction, we noted that \u201cRider did not have actual possession of the marijuana, and Johnson stored the marijuana locked in a safe in his bedroom.\u201d <em>(People v. Ugalino, supra, </em>174 Cal.App.4th at p. 1065.) Rider did not have access to the safe. \u201cIn fact, Rider did not even have a key to the apartment, most of the time coming and going only when someone else was home.\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Moreover, \u201cthere was no evidence [Johnson] expected Rider to assist him . . .\u201d in protecting his belongings. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Lacking any connection to Johnson other than sharing an apartment, we held that Rider could not be deemed to have constructive possession of the personal property locked away by Johnson. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1031-6\">Although Armando did not live in Alex\u2019s apartment, he had a close connection to Alex. Not only was Armando his brother, but Armando was also sufficiently close to Alex that he knew where Alex kept his hidden savings. Armando had a special relationship with Alex that conferred him with constructive possession of Alex\u2019s personal property in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">The evidence sufficed to convict defendant of robbery against Armando because he was robbed of property over which he had constructive possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">II-V<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1372\">*1372</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Defendant\u2019s 10-year firearm enhancement on count 2 is corrected to reflect a term of three years four months. Count 4 is ordered stayed, such stay to become permanent upon completion of the sentence for robbery. The matter is remanded to the trial court for resentencing in light of the modifications set forth above. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed. Following resentencing, the court shall forward a certified copy of the amended abstract to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Nicholson, J., and Butz, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied September 15, 2010, SI83920.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-14\"> Undesignated statutory references are to the Penal Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1027-11\"> We conclude that the trial court erroneously failed to give a jury unanimity instruction but that the error is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 1365.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
