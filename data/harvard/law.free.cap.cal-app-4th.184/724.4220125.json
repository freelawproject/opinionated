J.</author>\n<p id=\"A5o\">Petitioner Robert Garber has filed a habeas corpus petition challenging a decision by the appellate division of the superior court that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>affirmed his conviction, after a jury trial, for carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle and carrying a loaded firearm in a public place or on a public street (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12025, 12031).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Garber was put on probation for five years.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The only relief to which Garber is entitled is to have his sentence modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the published portion of the opinion, we address Garber\u2019s contention that, because he lived in his trailer, the jury should have been instructed on the statutory exemptions to sections 12025 and 12031, which permit the possession of loaded and concealed firearms in \u201cplaces of residence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">We conclude there was no instructional error. The statutory place of residence exemptions did not apply in this case. At the time he committed these offenses, Garber was not using his mobilehome for residential purposes and, therefore, he was not entitled to have the jury instructed on a \u201cplace of residence\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">1. <em>Prosecution evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Between 6:30 and 6:45 p.m. on November 6, 2006, off-duty firefighter Cliff Sorensen drove his Jeep Wrangler to Hjelte Sports Center, a public park in Los Angeles, for a softball game with friends and colleagues. Hjelte park is equipped for sports and other daily activities; it has no campsites or overnight stalls with hookups for recreational vehicles or trailers. The park opens at 5:00 a.m. and closes at 10:30 p.m., when the gates surrounding the park are locked. Under the Los Angeles Municipal Code, overnight camping is prohibited and it is unlawful to remain in the park after closing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Sorensen\u2019s softball game was scheduled to begin at 7:30 p.m. The field lights had not yet been turned on, so he drove his Jeep into a dirt parking area. Not seeing anyone in the near vicinity, Sorensen began \u201cdriving around, playing in the dirt.\u201d Sorensen did see petitioner Garber\u2019s van and trailer parked about 150 to 200 feet away across the dirt parking area. Sorensen drove around, kicking up dust, for 30 or 45 seconds. Then he parked his Jeep in one of the paved parking spaces.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">Sorensen was still sitting there when he noticed Garber walking toward him. Realizing the wind must have blown some of the dust toward Garber\u2019s trailer, Sorensen put his hand up apologetically and said he was sorry. Garber did not say anything and just kept walking toward Sorensen, who said: \u201cMy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>bad. I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t see you. I didn\u2019t mean to dust you. I apologize.\u201d When Garber got closer to the Jeep, Sorensen could see he had a gun. It was a black semiautomatic handgun and Garber was holding it down at his side, pointed toward the ground. Garber was now less than 20 feet from the Jeep. Sorensen testified he felt threatened: \u201cBy the way he\u2019s coming at me, I know I may have pissed him off. And he\u2019s basically bringing a gun to a conversation.\u201d Garber kept walking toward Sorensen \u201cin an angry manner\u201d with the gun at his side. Sorensen began to drive away slowly. As he did so, he leaned out of his Jeep and yelled, \u201cYou\u2019re an idiot. Why the heck did you pull a gun on me? You\u2019re an idiot.\u201d Garber did not say anything. Sorensen drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">When Sorensen returned to the park a short time later, his teammates had started to arrive for the softball game. Noticing Garber\u2019s trailer was still there, Sorensen turned off his headlights and his engine, and rolled quietly into a parking space to avoid any further confrontation. As he got out of the Jeep, he was approached by Joseph Chervansky who yelled at him about kicking up dust. Garber was following behind Chervansky. Sorensen said, \u201cI apologize again, but your buddy pulled a gun.\u201d Sorensen\u2019s teammates got in between Sorensen and Chervansky. When one of the umpires heard about the gun, he said, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not going to work a game where there\u2019s a gun .... I\u2019ve had that problem before. We need to call the cops.\u201d Somebody called the police, who arrived 10 minutes later. By that time, Garber and Chervansky had walked away from Sorensen\u2019s Jeep.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Javier Barragan and Sean Hennessy were the officers who responded to the call. They worked for the Los Angeles General Services Police Department, which patrols municipal sites like parks and libraries. Sorensen told them about Garber\u2019s gun and indicated Garber had returned to his trailer. The officers went over to the trailer and ordered Garber to come out. Garber was upset as he left his trailer and he screamed at the officers. Told he was being detained on suspicion of brandishing a firearm, Garber said, \u201cI have a gun in the trailer. It is in a drawer.\u201d Officer Hennessy entered the trailer. He found a semiautomatic .380-caliber handgun in a drawer next to the sink area. The barrel was about four inches long and the gun was concealable. There was one bullet in the chamber and five in the magazine. Hennessy testified he could see that Garber\u2019s van and trailer were connected. Barragan testified, \u201cBoth vehicles were attached through a trailer hitch.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">2. <em>Defense evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Joseph Chervansky testified he was acquainted with Garber because they both walked their dogs at Hjelte park. On the night of the incident, Chervansky parked his car in the dirt parking area, about 20 feet behind Garber\u2019s trailer. Sorensen drove up at an excessive speed, about 50 miles per hour, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>then did six or seven \u201ccircles, or what they call donuts,\u201d creating a dust storm. Sorensen came within 10 feet of Garber\u2019s trailer. Chervansky sounded his horn because he thought Sorensen was either going to crash into his car or into Garber\u2019s trailer. When the dust cleared, he saw Garber standing in the doorway of his trailer. Chervansky did not see Garber holding a gun and he did not see Garber step outside the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Sorensen left the park and came back 15 minutes later. Chervansky told Garber the Jeep had returned. Chervansky walked over to the Jeep in order to write down its license number. Garber was following behind him. As Chervansky was writing down the license number, Sorensen said, \u201cYou don\u2019t know who you\u2019re messing with. I\u2019m L.A.P.D.\u201d Sorensen did not apologize for stirring up the dust; instead, he laughed at Garber. Garber was calm; he was not shouting. Chervansky denied yelling at Sorensen. After getting the Jeep\u2019s license number, Chervansky returned to his own car.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Frank Castillo testified he was working as security that night, guarding some film trucks parked in the dirt area at Hjelte park. He saw Garber\u2019s trailer and van parked in the dirt area. A Jeep drove up at 45 or 50 miles per hour, coming within five or 10 feet of Garber\u2019s trailer. The Jeep spun around and started \u201cdoing all kinds of crazy stuff, picking up all kinds of dirt. . . .\u201d Castillo testified: \u201c[T]here was kids playing, there was 'people walking around. I was scared for them, and I was scared for my trucks.\u201d He heard Garber shouting at Sorensen about the dust. Then Sorensen sped away while yelling, \u201cCall the cops. Call the cops,\u201d as if daring Garber to call them. Castillo never saw Garber with a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">Garber testified he went to Hjelte park at 5:00 p.m. that day to walk his dog. This was something he often did. At the time of his encounter with Sorensen, Garber\u2019s van and trailer were located in the public parking lot. He was waiting inside his trailer for the park lights to come on so he could walk his dog safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Garber described the trailer as his home: \u201cIt has a range, refrigerator. It has . . . furniture. It has a shower, a toilet. It has . . . closets and drawers, a dinette. And it\u2019s where I live.\u201d He called it a \u201ctrailer coach, a travel trailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">Garber testified Sorensen drove into the parking area at 50 or 60 miles per hour, creating dust clouds. Garber was startled and feared the Jeep was going to hit his trailer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t move the trailer, because I had first to go to the van, hook the trailer, and then drive away. That is very, very difficult, and it\u2019s impossible to do in fraction of second.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] [f] Then, the first thought, it was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>get the gun. I didn\u2019t know that person, but I know that in public park there are psychopath, there are gang member, there are all kind of criminal, the sick, the refuse of the park, because they cannot go anywhere else.\u201d \u201cNow, that gun that I have, it for self-defense. I got the gun and I stood on the doorway on my trailer, holding it alongside my body. And I\u2019m . . . holding my gun alongside my left side. I really didn\u2019t know what to do. If I were a police officer, I would shoot him\u2014. ..[!]... [f]\u20141500 time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Garber heard Chervansky honking his horn and he saw the Jeep do five or six donuts. Then Sorensen drove off. Garber claimed that during this initial encounter with Sorensen he did not leave the doorway of his trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">After the park lights came on, Chervansky knocked on Garber\u2019s trailer to say the Jeep had returned. Garber approached Sorensen and said, \u201cSir, are you on drug? Why did you do this?\u201d Sorensen ignored him, turned to another softball player and said, \u201cHe had a gun before.\u201d Chervansky took down Sorensen\u2019s license plate number. Garber told Sorensen, \u201cI am done with this. Please don\u2019t approach my vehicles no more.\u201d Garber and Chervansky turned to go, but Sorensen approached Chervansky, \u201cwent up to him, on his face like this, and told him, . . . \u2018You don\u2019t know who you\u2019re messing with. I\u2019m L.A.P.D. officer.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Garber returned to his trailer. Ten minutes later, police officers arrived and ordered him to come out. They asked if he had a gun and he told them it was in the trailer. Garber testified he never heard Chervansky yelling during the incident and that Sorensen never apologized.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">Garber was charged with three misdemeanors: brandishing a firearm (\u00a7 417, subd. (a)(2)); carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle (\u00a7 12025, subd. (a)(1)); and, carrying a loaded firearm in a public place (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)). He represented himself at trial. The jury acquitted him of brandishing, and convicted him on the other two counts. On October 21 2008, the appellate division of the Los Angeles Superior Court affirmed his convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">On November 25, 2008, Garber\u2019s application to transfer the case to this court was denied because he had failed to submit an adequate record or state facts supporting the relief he requested. On December 12, 2008, the Supreme Court struck Garber\u2019s petition for review because the decision to deny transfer of a case within the appellate jurisdiction of the superior court is not reviewable.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>On December 16, 2008, Garber filed in this court a pro se document entitled \u201cRequest for Rehearing or Writ of Mandate.\u201d We appointed counsel to represent him and subsequently issued an order to show cause which deemed Garber\u2019s pro se filing a petition for writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">CONTENTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">1. The trial court erred by not instructing the jury on the \u201cplace of residence\u201d exemptions to sections 12025 and 12031.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">2. If Garber was not entitled to the \u201cplace of residence\u201d jury instructions, his convictions violated the Second Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">3. The trial court erred by not instructing the jury on self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">4. The trial court erred by imposing a five-year probationary term.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">1. <em>Trial court did not err by refusing to give \u201cplace of residence\u201d jury instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">Garber contends the jury should have been instructed on the statutory exemptions to sections 12025 and 12031, which permit the possession of loaded and concealed firearms in \u201cplaces of residence,\u201d because he lived in his trailer. This claim is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">a. <em>The statutory scheme.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">\u201cThe general purpose of The Dangerous Weapons[] Control Law (\u00a7 12000 et seq.) is to control the threat to public safety in the indiscriminate possession and carrying about of concealed and loaded weapons.\u201d <em>(People v. Melton </em>(1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 580, 589 [253 Cal.Rptr. 661].)</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">Section 12025, subdivision (a), provides: \u201cA person is guilty of carrying a concealed firearm when he or she . . . [][] (1) [c] arries concealed within any vehicle which is under his or her control or direction any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">Section 12026, subdivision (a), in pertinent part, provides: \u201cSection 12025. shall not apply to or affect any citizen of the United States or legal resident over the age of 18 years . . . who carries, either openly or concealed, anywhere within the citizen\u2019s or legal resident\u2019s <em>place of residence, </em>place of business, or on private property owned or lawfully possessed by the citizen or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>legal resident any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Section 12026.1 provides, in pertinent part: \u201c(a) Section 12025 shall not be construed to prohibit any citizen of the United States over the age of 18 years who resides or is temporarily within this state . . . from transporting or carrying any pistol, revolver, or other firearm capable of being concealed upon the person, provided that the following applies to the firearm: [f] (1) The firearm is within a motor vehicle and it is locked in the vehicle\u2019s trunk or in a locked container in the vehicle other than the utility or glove compartment, [f] (2) The firearm is carried by the person directly to or from any motor vehicle for any lawful purpose and, while carrying the firearm, the firearm is contained within a locked container. [][]... [f] (c) As used in this section, \u2018locked container\u2019 means a secure container which is fully enclosed and locked by a padlock, key lock, combination lock, or similar locking device.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Section 12031, subdivision (a)(1), provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of carrying a loaded firearm when he or she carries a loaded firearm on his or her person or in a vehicle while in any public place or on any public street in an incorporated city . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">Section 12031, subdivision (j)(l), provides: \u201cNothing in this section is intended to preclude the carrying of any loaded firearm, under circumstances where it would otherwise be lawful, by a person who reasonably believes that the person or property of himself or herself or of another is in immediate, grave danger and that the carrying of the weapon is necessary for the preservation of that person or property. As used in this subdivision, \u2018immediate\u2019 means the brief interval before and after the local law enforcement agency, when reasonably possible, has been notified of the danger and before the arrival of its assistance, [f] . . . [f] Upon trial for violating this section, the trier of fact shall determine whether the defendant was acting out of a reasonable belief that he or she was in grave danger.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Section 12031, subdivision (/), provides: \u201cNothing in this section shall prevent any person from having a loaded weapon, if it is otherwise lawful, at his or her <em>place of residence, </em>including any temporary residence or campsite.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">b. <em>The charges against Garber.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">Garber concedes \u201chis loaded handgun was concealed in a drawer in [his] trailer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">Count 2 of the complaint charged Garber with carrying a concealed firearm in a vehicle (\u00a7 12025, subd. (a)(1)). The jury was instructed with CALCRIM <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>No. 2522: \u201cTo prove that defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that: [ft] 1. The defendant caused a firearm capable of being concealed on the person to be concealed while it was carried within a vehicle; [ft] 2. The defendant knew that (he) caused the firearm to be concealed in the vehicle; [ft] 3. The firearm was substantially concealed within the vehicle; [ft] AND [ft] 4. The defendant was in the vehicle during the time the firearm was concealed there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Count 3 of the complaint charged Garber with carrying a loaded firearm in his vehicle (\u00a7 12031, subd. (a)). The jury was instructed with CALCRIM No. 2530: \u201cThe defendant is charged . . . with unlawfully carrying a loaded firearm ... (in a vehicle), [ft] To prove that the defendant is guilty of this crime, the People must prove that: [ft] 1. The defendant carried a loaded firearm ... (in a vehicle); [ft] 2. The defendant knew that (he) was carrying a firearm; [ft] AND [ft] 3. At that time, the defendant was in a public place or on a public street . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">As to both counts, the jury was given the following definition of \u201cvehicle\u201d: \u201cA vehicle is a device by which any person or property may be propelled, moved, or drawn upon a highway, excepting a device moved exclusively by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks, [ft] A trailer qualifies as a \u2018vehicle.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Based on <em>People v. Foley </em>(1983) 149 Cal.App.3d Supp. 33 [197 Cal.Rptr. 533], the trial court also instructed the jury: \u201cA person who carries a loaded and/or concealed firearm in a vehicle on a public street or on public property is subject to prosecution under Penal Code sections 12025 and 12031 regardless of whether the vehicle has the capacity to function or does function as a \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018place of residence\u2019 when legally upon private property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Finally, although the jury was instructed on self-defense in connection with the brandishing charge (count 1), the jury was told the self-defense instructions did not apply to counts 2 and 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">c. <em>Appellate division opinion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The appellate division rejected Garber\u2019s claim he was entitled to have the jury instructed on the \u201cplace of residence\u201d statutory defense contained in sections 12026, subdivision (a), and 12031, subdivision <em>(l). </em>The appellate division held Garber was not covered by this exemption because, at the time of the offenses, he was using his trailer as a means of transportation, not as a residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">The appellate division reasoned: \u201c[T]he evidence showed that defendant drove to the park to walk his dog. Defendant\u2019s van and trailer were parked in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>a public parking lot at a city park. . . . [T]he park closes at 10:30 p.m., at which time the gates are locked. Defendant therefore could not have been camping at the park overnight. [][] Based on the foregoing, it is evident that defendant\u2019s trailer was parked in a public place that was not intended for residential use. Defendant\u2019s apparent position is that he was entitled to possess a concealed and loaded firearm in his trailer, at all times, because he actually lives in his trailer. However ... the purpose of \u2018The Dangerous Weapons Control Law\u2019 would be frustrated if a vehicle equipped for residential use, such as defendant\u2019s trailer, was exempt from the regulations of sections 12025 and 12031 while being used as a means of transportation and located on public property. The dispositive issue in these circumstances is whether defendant\u2019s trailer was located on public property designed for residential use, such as an overnight campground, and the facts clearly show that such use was not permitted at the park. Indeed, defendant\u2019s own testimony suggested that he was only temporarily at the park to walk his dog and would not be staying there overnight. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s trailer was not a \u2018place of residence\u2019 . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">d. <em>The relevant case law.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Garber\u2019s contention that his trailer falls within the \u201cplace of residence\u201d exemption is predicated on <em>People </em>v. <em>Marotta </em>(1981) 128 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1 [180 Cal.Rptr. 611], which involved a taxicab driver who was carrying a loaded handgun in his cab for protection while he was working. The defendant was convicted of the same two offenses as Garber. The majority opinion in <em>Marotta </em>said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">\u201c[W]e are presented with this question on appeal: Does the \u2018place of business\u2019 exception within Penal Code section 12026 and Penal Code Section 12031 subdivision (h)[<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>] include a taxicab?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-8\">\u201cIn any ordinary sense the taxicab here is as much a place of business as a store in a fixed location. This is where the cab driver worked and collected his fees. The driver had no other business location which the cab served to facilitate, such as a store\u2019s delivery truck, where the truck is not the location of the enterprise, but merely the means to facilitate the store\u2019s business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">\u201cThe obvious purpose of the \u2018place of business\u2019 exception in these code sections is recognition of the need of business operators to protect their property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>\u201cThe term \u2018place of business\u2019 has no set or established meaning in California case or code law. Importing into these words the limitation of a fixed geographic location is unsupported in the law. In California\u2019s highly mobile culture many business enterprises have no fixed geographic location. Even such staid institutions as banks often use mobile facilities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cA claim that our interpretation of the meaning of these statutes would present endless problems to law enforcement or grossly proliferate public possession of guns because of California\u2019s many and varied mobile places of business, ought to properly be addressed to the Legislature. . . . Had the Legislature intended to limit the \u2018place of business\u2019 exception to fixed geographic locations, or had it intended to exclude vehicles from the compass of the words \u2018place of business,\u2019 it could easily have done so.\u201d <em>(People v. Marotta, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 5-6, fn. omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">The majority, therefore, reversed Marotta\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">The dissenting opinion, however, concluded the place of business exemption did not apply to a taxicab: \u201cOne of the main thrusts of [The Dangerous Weapons Control Law] is to restrict the carrying of loaded weapons and concealed weapons on the public streets. Any exceptions to this broad general purpose should be narrowly construed. [][]... I believe that the Legislature had in mind businesses located in fixed geographical locations. While it is probably true enough, as the majority suggests, that this exception was designed to protect business property from robbers, it does not necessarily follow that such inherently \u2018mobile\u2019 enterprises as trucks, buses and taxies were meant to be included within this exception. If so, the exception would, to a large extent, emasculate the thrust of the legislation.\u201d <em>(People v. Marotta, supra, </em>128 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 9 (dis. opn. of Jones, Acting P. J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Two years later, the same appellate division faced a similar issue in <em>People v. Foley, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d Supp. 33, which again involved convictions under sections 12025 and 12031 for carrying a concealed and loaded firearm in a vehicle. A police officer made a traffic stop after watching a Dodge van go through a stop sign. The defendant had two loaded handguns inside the van. He testified the van was registered with the Department of Motor Vehicles as a motor home and that, after losing his apartment, he had been living in the van which he parked behind his business. He testified the van was equipped with sleeping, bathing, and cooking facilities. In rebuttal, an officer testified he had examined the interior of the van and did not observe most of the appliances and furniture mentioned by the defendant. The trial court ruled that, even if Foley had actually been \u201c \u2018temporarily residing in his vehicle behind his business during this period[,] ... the fact of the matter is that he was ... in transit,\u2019 \u201d \u201c \u2018he was in fact using it as a vehicle at the time ....\u2019\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>at p. Supp. 40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>On appeal, Foley cited <em>Marotta </em>in support of his argument the phrase \u201cplace of residence\u201d as used in sections 12026 and 12031 \u201ccannot be rationally interpreted to delineate a fixed geographic location.\u201d <em>(People v. Foley, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp 38.) The appellate division explained: \u201cIn <em>Marotta </em>we held that \u2018place of business\u2019 included a taxicab. The very definition of \u2018taxicab\u2019 lends credence to such a holding. Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (1971) at page 2345, defines \u2018taxicab\u2019 as follows: \u2018a chauffeur-driven automobile available on call to carry a passenger between any two points (as within a city) for a fare . . . .\u2019 In the instant case, defendant is urging our adopting a doctrine that interprets \u2018place of residence\u2019 as used in the relevant statutes before us to include motor homes, or house cars or vans. He proffers the position that the manner of design and equipment installed determines the issue, and not the use of the motor home, house car or van for transportation purposes on public streets; he presses that the controlling factor in determining whether the vehicle is or is not \u2018a place of residence\u2019 within the purview of the instant statutes rests upon whether the vehicle is utilized either permanently or partially as a place of dwelling.\u201d <em>(People v. Foley, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at p. Supp. 38.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\"><em>Foley </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s argument: \u201cDefendant\u2019s house car or van, as with any house car or van, has two essential functions: (1) to serve as a means of transportation or a motor vehicle whenever on a public street or public property or in transit, and (2) the capability to function as a \u2018home\u2019 or \u2018place of residence\u2019 when legally upon private property and being utilized as a \u2018place of residence.\u2019 In our day of ultra mobility, one may consider his jet airplane his \u2018place of residence\u2019 if he so desires, but when the plane is airborne, he is subject to FAA rules and regulations, just as he is subject to airport regulations when based at an airport; one may consider his yacht his \u2018place of residence,\u2019 but he is subject to maritime laws when upon the sea, and to harbor regulations when berthed; and one may consider his house car or van his home or \u2018place of residence,\u2019 but when he drives his car or van on the public streets or highways or causes said car or van to be thereupon while he is present, he is subject to arrest and successful prosecution for possession of concealed or loaded firearms should he be arrested with those items discovered in his car or van under circumstances similar to those before us. [f] We hold that when in transit or upon a public street or thoroughfare, as in the instant case, a house car\u2019s driver violates Penal Code sections 12025 and 12031 when having within his vehicle, without a license to so carry, concealed or loaded firearms.\u201d <em>(People v. Foley, supra, </em>149 Cal.App.3d at pp. Supp. 39-40.)</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Contrary to Garber\u2019s assertion, there is no conflict between <em>Foley </em>and <em>Marotta. </em>As the People note, <em>\u201cFoley </em>distinguished <em>Marotta </em>because there the taxicab <em>was </em>the driver\u2019s \u2018place of business.\u2019 \u201d It is also significant that Judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Bernstein, who concurred in the majority opinion in <em>Marotta, </em>joined the unanimous opinion in <em>Foley.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The last case to address this issue was <em>People v. Wooten </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 168 [214 Cal.Rptr. 36], where the defendant claimed he was carrying concealed weapons on his person and in the cab of his pickup truck \u201cfor self-protection in the course of carrying on his business as a \u2018bounty hunter.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 172.) <em>Wooten </em>rejected the defendant\u2019s reliance on Marotta:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cWe first note that <em>Marotta </em>is readily distinguishable. While taxicab drivers must do business in their cabs, bounty hunters do not. Their job is to get out of their car and arrest bail jumpers, not to run over them. The vehicle is simply a means to transport the bounty hunter. Unlike a taxi driver whose work cannot be done without a vehicle, bounty hunters may leave their own cars behind and use airplanes, buses, trains or taxis to pursue bail jumpers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">\u201cSecond, the reasoning of the <em>Marotta </em>court is not persuasive. The clear legislative purpose of section 12025 is to prohibit the carrying around of concealed weapons. Section 12026 provides an exception for possession in one\u2019s residence or place of business. The natural meaning of the term \u2018place of business\u2019 is a fixed location, simply because almost all businesses are conducted in some office, store or other building. When a business is mobile, one generally says that the business is not conducted in any particular place, but in an area. Giving Penal Code section 12026 the broad meaning advocated by defendant would render it meaningless. Salesmen, truck drivers, delivery persons\u2014in short, anyone whose business puts them in transit\u2014 could use section 12026 to justify an exemption from section 12025. The obvious result would be that even convicted felons . . . could easily set themselves up as traveling salesmen and carry a concealed weapon in their car with impunity. This would frustrate the obvious legislative purpose of section 12025.\u201d <em>(People v. Wooten, supra, </em>168 Cal.App.3d at p. 173.)</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">e. <em>Discussion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">The People argue the foregoing case law demonstrates Garber was properly convicted because \u201cthe trial court and the Appellate Division both correctly concluded that, at all relevant times, petitioner\u2019s trailer was being used as a vehicle in a public place under sections 12025 and 12031, not as his \u2018place of residence\u2019 under sections 12026 and 12031, subdivision (1). . . . Under <em>Foley, Wooten, </em>and even the <em>Marotta </em>majority, he was using his trailer as a vehicle on public streets and areas, not as a \u2018place of residence.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">In response, Garber argues none of the relevant cases has \u201cheld that the exemptions of [sections] 12026 and 12031, subdivision (1), do not apply to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>one\u2019s mobilehome or trailer coach which is used <em>exclusively </em>as his or her place of residence.\u201d But Garber did <em>not </em>use his mobilehome exclusively as a place of residence. At the time of his encounter with Sorensen, he had been using his mobilehome as a means of transportation: he had driven it to Hjelte park in order to take his dog for a walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In another place, Garber refers to the trailer as \u201chis exclusive, albeit mobile, dwelling place . . . .\u201d Assuming the trailer was in fact the only place he lived, this characterization would be more accurate but not, ultimately, helpful to Garber because Foley, too, was presumed to have been living exclusively in his van.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The only difference between Foley\u2019s vehicle and Garber\u2019s vehicle is that the latter was a van/trailer combination, with the nonmotorized trailer hitched to the motorized van, while Foley just had a simple van. We cannot see why that should make any difference in the analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The bounty hunter in <em>Wooten, </em>unlike the cab driver in <em>Marotta, </em>was not using his vehicle as his place of business. Garber, who was not using his vehicle as a place of residence when he drove to the park in order to walk his dog, is therefore like the defendant in <em>Wooten, </em>not the defendant in <em>Marotta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Garber argues that, because he sometimes used his trailer as a dwelling, he was entitled to a place of residence exemption since his trailer \u201cwould have retained its status as an inhabited dwelling, or \u2018place of residence,\u2019 for purposes of a first degree burglary prosecution had it been burglarized while parked at Hjelte Park, even if petitioner had not been inside.\u201d Garber is right about the burglary result,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> but this analogy does not help his case. The aim of the burglary statute is to protect the vehicle\u2019s owner from the burglar\u2019s malicious entry; the aim of The Dangerous Weapons Control Law is to protect the public from the vehicle owner\u2019s easy access to a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Hence, we agree with the People that, under the reasoning of <em>Foley, Wooten </em>and <em>Marotta, </em>the statutory place of residence exemptions did not apply in this case. At the time he committed these offenses, Garber was not using his mobilehome for residential purposes and, therefore, he was not entitled to have the jury instructed on a \u201cplace of residence\u201d defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>[[ ]]<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The order to show cause is discharged. The five-year probationary term is hereby vacated and a three-year probationary term is substituted therefor. The clerk of the superior court is directed to prepare and forward to the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation an amended abstract of judgment. In all other respects, Garber\u2019s habeas corpus petition is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Kitching, J., and Aldrich, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">On May 25, 2010, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.
