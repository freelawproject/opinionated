The precise legal issue, however, is relatively straightforward: the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Plaintiffs and appellants are Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison Company, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company (collectively referred to as the IOU\u2019s),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> entities that bought electricity during the crisis. Defendant and respondent is Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc. (Arizona), which sold electricity during the crisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1153-10\">In 2000, the IOU\u2019s initiated a proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the federal agency charged with regulating transmission and sale of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce. FERC found that unjust and unreasonable rates had been charged during the crisis and ordered refunds from energy sellers, including Arizona. The problem with the order was that FERC\u2019s jurisdiction extended to \u201cpublic utilities,\u201d which essentially were private sellers of energy. \u201cNonpublic entities,\u201d including governmental entities, were not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. Rural cooperatives like Arizona had historically been treated as \u201cnonpublic entities\u201d that were \u00e1lso not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. FERC nonetheless concluded that Arizona was subject to its order, not because Arizona was no longer a \u201cnonpublic entity,\u201d but because FERC had jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute. Arizona appealed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which agreed that FERC exceeded its jurisdiction when it held that Arizona was subject to its refund order. <em>(Bonneville Power Admin. v. F.E.R.C. </em>(9th Cir. 2005) 422 F.3d 908 <em>(Bonneville).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1153-11\">Unable to obtain a remedy against Arizona before FERC, and following <em>Bonneville's </em>suggestion that a remedy might be found in a contract action, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1494\">*1494</page-number>IOU\u2019s filed this state court action. Arizona demurred to the complaint on the ground, among others, that by failing to argue in the FERC proceedings that Arizona\u2019s \u201cnonpublic\u201d status should be changed, the IOU\u2019s failed to exhaust their administrative remedies. The trial court agreed and sustained the demurrer without leave to amend. The IOU\u2019s appealed. In the published portion of this opinion, we find that any failure of the IOU\u2019s to challenge Arizona\u2019s jurisdictional status did not implicate the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. It was therefore error to sustain the demurrer on this ground. In the unpublished portion of this opinion, we find that there were no valid alternative grounds for dismissal of the IOU\u2019s action on demurrer. The judgment is therefore reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1154-5\">I. <em>Factual background.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-6\">In 1996, our Legislature enacted Assembly Bill No. 1890 (1995-1996 Reg. Sess.) (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 330 et seq.), which deregulated California\u2019s electrical power markets.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The new scheme created the California Power Exchange Corporation (CalPX) and the California Independent System Operator Corporation (CallSO). (Pub. Util. Code, \u00a7 330, subd. (/)(1).)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> CalPX operated a \u201cclearinghouse\u201d for daily and hourly auctions, or trades, of electricity. CallSO managed California\u2019s transmission grid and ensured an adequate and stable supply of energy. The IOU\u2019s supplied electrical power to California residents and businesses, and the IOU\u2019s were required to buy most of their power supply through CalPX and CallSO.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1154-7\">The CalPX auctions resulted in a single market clearing price that applied to all sellers and buyers, even if some sellers would have sold power for less and some buyers would have bought it for more. In other words, all sellers received the market clearing price. <em>Bonneville </em>described the single-price auctions like this: \u201cIn a single-price auction, all of the bidders are paid the same price as was bid by the highest-priced seller whose electric energy was needed to \u2018clear the market\u2019 or balance the supply of electric energy against the demand for electric energy. As a result, all of the bidders in a particular hour in the spot market received the same price for their sales.\u201d <em>(Bonneville, supra, </em>422 F.3d at p. 912.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1495\">*1495</page-number>FERC-approved tariffs governed the sale and purchase of electricity through the CalPX and CallSO markets. Rates for such sales had to be \u201cjust and reasonable\u201d under the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 791a et seq.). (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a).) Each participant in the CalPX and CallSO markets had to execute a CalPX participation agreement and a CallSO scheduling coordinator agreement agreeing to abide by the tariffs. The CalPX participation agreement, prescribed by the CalPX tariff, provided, for example, that the market participant \u201c \u2018will abide by and will perform all of the obligations under the [Cal]PX Tariff in respect of all matters set forth therein including, without limitation, all matters relating to the trading of Energy by it through the [CaljPX markets . . . [and] billing payments.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-5\">From May 2000 to June 2001, California experienced an energy crisis caused by sustained high prices for electricity.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Rolling blackouts occurred in Northern California. Prices for electricity far exceeded prices in prior periods. Sellers, including Arizona, received these inflated market clearing prices. The unjust and unreasonable rates were passed through to the IOU\u2019s retail electric customers in California. Statutorily forced to buy power through CalPX and CallSO, some IOU\u2019s amassed crippling debt. CalPX collapsed in January 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b1155-6\">The crisis ended in June 2001, when FERC established a mitigated market clearing price, which essentially was a recalculated just and reasonable rate. <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy </em>(June 19, 2001) 95 F.E.R.C. f 61,418, p. 62,558 (hereafter <em>San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co.).)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-7\">II. <em>Procedural background.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-8\">A. <em>Proceedings before FERC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-9\">1. <em>Background concerning FERC.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1155-10\">The Federal Power Act (FPA), codified at title 16 United States Code section 824 et seq., governs FERC.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> FERC has exclusive jurisdiction over the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and the sale of electric <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1496\">*1496</page-number>energy at wholesale in interstate commerce. (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(b).) All rates and charges made, demanded, or received by any \u201cpublic utility\u201d for or in connection with such transmissions and sales shall be \u201cjust and reasonable.\u201d (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824d(a).) Any unjust and unreasonable sale is unlawful. <em>(Ibid.) </em>If FERC determines that an unjust and unreasonable rate has been charged or paid, it can determine the just and reasonable rate and order the public utility to make refunds. (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824e.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-4\">FERC\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to \u201cpublic utilities.\u201d (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(b) &amp; (e).) Confusingly, \u201cpublic utilities\u201d are essentially <em>private </em>sellers of energy. Expressly exempted from FERC\u2019s authority and jurisdiction are \u201cnonpublic utilities,\u201d such as governmental entities. (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(f); see also <em>Bonneville, supra, </em>422 F.3d at pp. 915-916.) Although not expressly exempted from FERC\u2019s authority, cooperatives such as Arizona that receive financing under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 (REA; 7 U.S.C. \u00a7 901 et seq.)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> are also outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>(Dairyland Power Cooperative </em>(1967) 37 F.P.C. 12 <em>(Dairyland).) </em>This rule is referred to as the <em>Dairyland </em>exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1156-5\">2. <em>The IOU\u2019s file a complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1156-6\">During California\u2019s energy crisis, on August 2, 2000, the IOU\u2019s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> filed a complaint with FERC against sellers of electricity in the CallSO and CalPX markets. Notice of the complaint was filed in the Federal Register. (65 Fed.Reg. 48693 (Aug. 9, 2000).) Arizona formally intervened in the FERC proceeding in June 2001. FERC opened an investigation into the \u201cjustness and reasonableness of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX\u201d and into \u201cwhether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California and need to be modified.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sellers of Energy </em>(Aug. 23, 2000) 92 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,172, p. 61,603.) After finding that California\u2019s electrical market structure and rates were flawed <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy </em>(Nov. 1, 2000) 93 F.E.R.C. <em>\u00b6 </em>61,121, p. 61,370), FERC proposed price mitigation measures and refund liability and established a methodology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1497\">*1497</page-number>for calculating refunds <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sellers of Energy </em>(Mar. 9, 2001) 94 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,245, p. 61,861).</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-5\">FERC then issued an order on July 25, 2001, establishing \u201cthe scope of and methodology for calculating refunds related to transactions in the spot markets operated by\u201d CallSO and CalPX during October 2, 2000, through June 20, 2001.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sellers of Energy </em>(July 25, 2001) 96 F.E.R.C. <em>\u00b6 </em>61,120, p. 61,499.) The order established a mitigated market clearing price, i.e., just and reasonable rates an unmanipulated market would have produced during the refund period. The order, however, did something more: transactions subject to refunds included sales by nonpublic entities. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The order thus encompassed all sellers of electricity, including sellers that were normally <em>outside </em>of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction, namely, governmental entities and rural cooperatives (Arizona) that received REA financing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-6\">FERC explained its rationale for extending its jurisdiction: \u201cThe Commission has determined that all sellers of energy in the California ISO and PX spot markets should be subject to refund liability for the period beginning October 2, 2000. We have decided to extend refund liability to public and non-public utility sellers based on our review of the controlling law, the involvement of both types of sellers in the California centralized ISO and PX spot markets, and the equities of the situation. Non-public utility sellers as well as public utility sellers of electric energy in those California markets contributed to and benefitted from the dysfunctions that offered the possibilities for the market abuse under certain conditions, on which the call for refunds are based. In these circumstances, as discussed below, we conclude that although we do not have direct regulatory rate authority over power sales by non-public utilities, we do have authority to order them to abide by the market rules we have established and to make refunds of unjust and unreasonable rates for sales pursuant to those market rules.\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy, supra, </em>96 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,120, p. 61,511.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1157-7\">FERC characterized itself as having jurisdiction over the \u201csubject matter of the affected [sales],\u201d namely, \u201cwholesale sales of electric energy in interstate commerce through a Commission-authorized and Commission-regulated centralized clearinghouse that set a market clearing price for all wholesale seller participants, including non-public utilities. Exempting transactions involving non-public utility sellers from refund scrutiny here would allow them to make such sales without regard to the just and reasonable standard that applies to the market clearing price administered . . . .\u201d <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Sellers of Energy, supra, 96 </em>F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,120, p. 61,512.) \u201cOur action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1498\">*1498</page-number>thus revises the market clearing prices that all market participants previously agreed to accept for their sales. In this context, we see no reason to treat nonpublic utility sellers differently, as they are receiving the same price, the just and reasonable market clearing price established pursuant to market rules approved by this Commission, that they expected to obtain for their wholesale sales into the centralized ISO and PX spot markets.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-4\">B. <em>Arizona appeals FERC\u2019s July 25, 2001 order to the Ninth Circuit Court of </em>Appeals\u2014Bonneville.</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-5\">Arizona and governmental entities appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed FERC\u2019s July 25, 2001 order insofar as it found it had refund authority over wholesale electric energy sales made by governmental entities and nonpublic utilities, including Arizona. <em>(Bonneville, </em>supra, 422 F.3d at p. 911.) After the court found that the FPA expressly limited FERC\u2019s authority to investigate rates and order refunds from a \u201c \u2018public utility,\u2019 \u201d the court considered the unique position of Arizona. <em>Bonneville </em>first noted that FERC had initially respected Arizona\u2019s historical status as a nonpublic entity: \u201cFERC has, until its appellate brief in this proceeding, treated [Arizona] as a non-public utility. FERC has offered nothing in the record to support its change of position nor did its refund orders single out [Arizona] for treatment as a public utility. We cannot accept FERC\u2019s post-hoc rationalization for ordering refunds from [Arizona]. Consequently, in this proceeding we treat [Arizona] as a non-public utility but without prejudice to reclassification by FERC in a different proceeding.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 917-918, fn. omitted.) <em>Bonneville </em>therefore held that the \u201cretroactive imposition of a market price that effects a refund responsibility is a regulatory action that falls outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction with respect to non-public utilities and governmental utilities.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 920.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-6\">C. <em>This state court action.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1158-7\">Before filing the state court action, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, Southern California Edison, and the California Electricity Oversight Board filed, on March 16 and 21, 2006, complaints in federal court, which were dismissed in March 2007 for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction. <em>(Pacific Gas and Electric v. Arizona Electric Power Coop. </em>(E.D.Cal. 2007) 479 F.Supp.2d 1113.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1158-8\">The IOU\u2019s then filed, in April 2007, this state court complaint containing causes of action for (1) breach of contract, (2) anticipatory breach of contract, (3) unjust enrichment, (4) money had and received, and (5) through <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1499\">*1499</page-number>(9) declaratory relief. The named defendants included Arizona.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The IOU\u2019s sought \u201cto recover ... the amounts that each Governmental Entity [(including Arizona)] received in excess of the lawful rates for its wholesale sales of electric power to the California IOUs in the [Cal]ISO and [Cal]PX markets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-5\">Arizona demurred to the complaint. In its demurrer, Arizona pointed out that its exemption from FERC jurisdiction rested on agency doctrine rather than statute. Arizona therefore argued that the IOU\u2019s could have asked FERC to revisit Arizona\u2019s exempt status, but it did not. By failing to ask for revocation of the <em>Dairyland </em>exemption, the IOU\u2019s failed to exhaust their administrative remedies, Arizona argued. The other defendants also filed a joint demurrer in which Arizona joined. They raised arguments that the action was barred by the statute of limitations, failed to state a claim, and the parties lacked privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1159-6\">The trial court largely overruled the governmental entities\u2019 joint demurrer,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> finding, as to the statute of limitations, that the IOU\u2019s had properly pled equitable tolling and that factual issues had been raised which could not be resolved on demurrer.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The trial court, however, sustained Arizona\u2019s demurrer without leave to amend for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The amended judgment of dismissal was entered on April 22, 2008. This appeal followed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1500\">*1500</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-4\">I. <em>Standard of review.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-5\"><em>A </em>demurrer tests the sufficiency of the allegations in a complaint as a matter of law. <em>(Pacifica Homeowners\u2019 Assn. v. Wesley Palms Retirement Community </em>(1986) 178 Cal.App.3d 1147, 1151 [224 Cal.Rptr. 380].) We review the sufficiency of the challenged complaint de novo. <em>(Coopers &amp; Lybrand v. Superior Court </em>(1989) 212 Cal.App.3d 524, 529 [260 Cal.Rptr. 713].) We accept as true the properly pleaded allegations of fact in the complaint, but not the contentions, deductions or conclusions of fact or law. <em>(Blank v. Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) We also accept as true facts which may be inferred from those expressly alleged. <em>(Marshall v. Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher </em>(1995) 37 Cal.App.4th 1397, 1403 [44 Cal.Rptr.2d 339].) We consider matters which may be judicially noticed, and we \u201cgive the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context.\u201d <em>(Blank, </em>at p. 318.) The interpretation of a written contract is a judicial function subject to an independent determination, unless interpretation turns on the credibility of extrinsic evidence. <em>(Coopers &amp; Lybrand, </em>at p. 529.) The complaint\u2019s \u201callegations must be liberally construed, with a view to substantial justice between the parties.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 452.) The judgment or order of dismissal entered after the demurrer is sustained must be affirmed if any of the grounds for demurrer raised by the defendant is well taken and disposes of the complaint. <em>(Aubry v. Tri-City Hospital Dist. </em>(1992) 2 Cal.4th 962, 967 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 92, 831 P.2d 317].) But it is error to sustain a general demurrer if the complaint states a cause of action under any possible legal theory. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-6\">II. <em>Exhaustion of administrative remedies.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1160-7\">Arizona\u2019s argument that the IOU\u2019s failed to exhaust their administrative remedies is premised on this: the IOU\u2019s should have tried to revoke or to limit the <em>Dairy land </em>exemption in the FERC proceedings. As we explain, we do not agree that any failure to challenge the <em>Dairyland </em>exemption in the FERC proceedings constituted a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1160-8\">Where an administrative remedy is provided by statute, relief must be sought from the administrative body and this remedy exhausted before the courts will act. <em>(Abelleira v. District Court of Appeal </em>(1941) 17 Cal.2d 280, 292 [109 P.2d 942].) Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a jurisdictional prerequisite to resort to the courts. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 293; <em>Johnson v. City of Loma Linda </em>(2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 70 [99 Cal.Rptr.2d 316, 5 P.3d 874].) Several rationales underlie the doctrine. Its primary purpose \u201c \u2018is to afford administrative tribunals the opportunity to decide in a final way matters within their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1501\">*1501</page-number>area of expertise prior to judicial review.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Citizens for Open Government v. City of Lodi </em>(2006) 144 Cal.App.4th 865, 874 [50 Cal.Rptr.3d 636].) Exhaustion of administrative remedies also facilitates the development of a complete record that draws on administrative expertise and promotes judicial efficiency. <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cThe principal purposes of exhaustion requirements include avoidance of premature interruption of administrative processes, allowing an agency to develop the necessary factual background of the case, letting the agency apply its expertise and exercise its statutory discretion, and administrative efficiency and judicial economy. [Citation.] The exhaustion doctrine is grounded on concerns favoring administrative autonomy (i.e., courts should not interfere with an agency determination until the agency has reached a final decision) and judicial efficiency (i.e., overworked courts should decline to intervene in an administrative dispute unless absolutely necessary). [Citation.]\u201d <em>(California Water Impact Network </em>v. <em>Newhall County Water Dist. </em>(2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1464, 1489-1490 [75 Cal.Rptr.3d 393].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-5\">We do not see how the way in which the IOU\u2019s pursued Arizona before FERC undermined the exhaustion of administrative remedies doctrine. Arizona does not dispute that FERC\u2019s \u201c \u2018power includes the exclusive authority to determine the reasonableness of wholesale rates.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Wholesale Electricity Antitrust Cases I &amp; II </em>(2007) 147 Cal.App.4th 1293, 1312 [55 Cal.Rptr.3d 253].) Arizona thus agrees that the IOU\u2019s had to first file a proceeding before FERC, which is exactly what the IOU\u2019s did.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The IOU\u2019s were initially <em>successful </em>in obtaining refunds from Arizona in that proceeding, although they suffered a reversal in <em>Bonneville. </em>After <em>Bonneville, </em>it then was clear that the IOU\u2019s could not seek a remedy against Arizona from FERC. The IOU\u2019s therefore pursued a judicial remedy by filing this state court action. On these facts, the IOU\u2019s exhausted any administrative process they might have been required to pursue: they sought a remedy from the agency having jurisdiction over rates and only sought judicial review after the Ninth Circuit ruled that the remedy was not available from the agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b1161-6\">Arizona, however, contends that the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies required something more of the IOU\u2019s: the IOU\u2019s should have asked FERC to revoke or to limit the <em>Dairyland </em>exemption. This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1502\">*1502</page-number>contention, it seems to us, relies on a corollary principle to the doctrine that administrative remedies must be exhausted. That principle is: a litigant must fully present its arguments and evidence at the administrative hearing. \u201c \u2018Before seeking judicial review a party must show that he has made a full presentation to the administrative agency upon all issues of the case and at all prescribed stages of the administrative proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Edgren v. Regents of University of California </em>(1984) 158 Cal.App.3d 515, 520 [205 Cal.Rptr. 6].) \u201cThe requirement that a litigant present his or her arguments and evidence fully at the administrative hearing level is analogous to 'the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies, though it is based on different policies.\u201d (1 Cal. Administrative Mandamus: Laying the Foundation at the Administrative Hearing (Cont.Ed.Bar 3d ed. 2003) \u00a7 3.49, p. 82 (Administrative Mandamus).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1162-4\">The IOU\u2019s did not fail to satisfy any presentation requirement concerning Arizona\u2019s jurisdictional status in the FERC proceedings. To recap, a \u201cpublic entity\u201d was, in simplified terms, a private seller of energy. \u201cPublic entities\u201d were subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. A \u201cnonpublic entity\u201d (e.g., a government entity) was not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. Arizona, a rural cooperative subject to a RUS-financed mortgage, was traditionally afforded \u201cnonpublic entity\u201d status, and thus was outside of FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. That exempt status was first recognized in <em>Dairyland, supra, </em>37 F.P.C. at page 26, where the commission noted that \u201cthe record over [the past 30 years] discloses not a single instance where Commission jurisdiction over cooperatives was asserted. All the indications are to the contrary. We therefore conclude that such jurisdiction does not presently exist.\u201d A year after <em>Dairyland, </em>a federal district court suggested that the status afforded cooperatives by <em>Dairyland </em>might one day change: \u201cIf the Commission had found that conditions in the power industry had so changed that generating cooperatives now did fall within its jurisdiction, this court would be faced with a different issue. For just as the Commission\u2019s determination here that it is without jurisdiction is entitled to judicial deference, ... so would be its determination that it had the requisite authority.\u201d <em>(Salt River Project Agricultural Dist. v. Federal Power Com. </em>(D.C. Cir. 1968) 129 U.S. App.D.C. 117 [391 F.2d 470, 474, fn. 8], citation omitted <em>(Salt River).) Salt River </em>thus suggested that perhaps FERC could one day exercise jurisdiction over a cooperative if changes in the industry occurred such that rural cooperatives should be considered \u201cpublic entities.\u201d There was, however, no need for the IOU\u2019s to challenge the continuing viability of <em>Dairyland. </em>FERC found that it could order refunds from Arizona under a theory having nothing to do with Arizona\u2019s traditional nonpublic entity status. The IOU\u2019s thus won in front of FERC without having to raise the jurisdictional issue.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1503\">*1503</page-number>Even if we agreed that the IOU\u2019s had a duty to argue in the FERC proceedings that the <em>Dairyland </em>exemption should be found inapplicable to Arizona, that duty was satisfied. Arizona\u2019s jurisdictional or nonjurisdictional status was before FERC. On June 19, 2001, FERC issued an order prescribing mitigation directives against all sellers of electricity. <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., supra, </em>95 F.E.R.C. <em>\u00b6 </em>61,418, p. 62,558.) On July 19, 2001, Arizona sought clarification and/or rehearing: \u201cAEPCO seeks clarification that the Commission did not intend in its June 19 Decision <em>to subject non-jurisdictional sellers located outside of California such as AEPCO to any possible refund proceedings or refunds for any sales prior to June 19.\u201d </em>(Original underscoring, italics added.) In apparent reference to <em>Dairyland, </em>Arizona noted that it was, \u201cunder established precedent, not subject to the Commission\u2019s public utility jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-5\">FERC responded with its controversial July 25, 2001 order to Arizona to pay refunds. That order can only be viewed as FERC\u2019s attempt to get around <em>Dairyland </em>by characterizing its \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over nonpublic utilities like Arizona as deriving from its broad authority over rates. Arizona then filed a request for rehearing of the July 25 order. Citing <em>Dairyland, </em>Arizona argued that it was not subject to FERC\u2019s public utility jurisdiction; accordingly, the commission was \u201cwithout authority to determine if [Arizona\u2019s] rates [were] not \u2018just and reasonable\u2019 or to order a refund based on such a determination.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thereafter, Arizona again asked FERC to clarify whether its treatment of \u201c \u2018governmental entities\u2019 \u201d extended to Arizona for the purposes of an order FERC had issued on December 19, 2001. These events show that Arizona\u2019s jurisdictional status was at issue in the FERC proceedings. But rather than address <em>Dairyland </em>head on, FERC tried to get around it by deriving its jurisdiction over Arizona from its general authority over rates and from Arizona\u2019s participation in the regulated markets.</p>\n<p id=\"b1163-6\">In any event, a failure on the part of the IOU\u2019s to challenge <em>Dairyland </em>head on in the FERC proceedings might have been excusable. \u201c \u2018[T]he doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies has not hardened into inflexible dogma. [Citation.] It contains its own exceptions ....\u2019\u201d <em>(In re Hudson </em>(2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 1, 7 [49 Cal.Rptr.3d 74].) Those exceptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1504\">*1504</page-number>include: (1) when the administrative agency cannot provide an adequate remedy; (2) when the subject of controversy lies outside the agency\u2019s jurisdiction; and (3) where it would be futile to pursue a remedy. <em>(Campbell v. Regents of University of California </em>(2005) 35 Cal.4th 311, 322 [25 Cal.Rptr.3d 320, 106 P.3d 976]; <em>Unnamed Physician v. Board of Trustees </em>(2001) 93 Cal.App.4th 607, 620 [113 Cal.Rptr.2d 309].) The IOU\u2019s could have reasonably concluded that attacking <em>Dairyland </em>would be futile. At the time the IOU\u2019s initiated the FERC proceeding in 2000, a rural cooperative had never been treated as an entity subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction\u2014or at least such an instance has not been brought to our attention by the parties. In fact, just two months before FERC issued its July 25, 2001 order, FERC affirmed, in an unrelated proceeding, that Arizona was \u201cnot subject to the Commission\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>(Sierra Southwest Cooperative Services, Inc. </em>(May 30, 2001) 95 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,310, p. 62,057.) After <em>Bonneville, </em>FERC found that Arizona\u2019s traditional nonpublic entity status should be maintained. <em>(San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. Sellers of Energy, supra, </em>125 F.E.R.C. \u00b6 61,297, p. 62,395.) And the FRA has now codified <em>Dairyland: </em>\u201cNo provision in this subchapter shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a State or any political subdivision of a State, an electric cooperative that receives financing under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936 . . . .\u201d (16 U.S.C. \u00a7 824(f).) It therefore was unlikely that attacking <em>Dairyland </em>would have been successful, notwithstanding <em>Bonneville\u2019s </em>suggestion that FERC perhaps could have revisited the status traditionally afforded Arizona, had it done so not in a \u201cpost-hoc\u201d fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-4\">Instead, the manner in which the IOU\u2019s proceeded\u2014filing a proceeding before FERC in the first instance\u2014arguably furthered the purposes of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. It allowed FERC, which was uniquely situated and had expertise over the subject matter, to develop the record. It allowed FERC to promptly address problems in the market and to establish a methodology by which to reconfigure the rates. It also led to congressional confirmation that rural cooperatives, like Arizona, were not subject to FERC\u2019s jurisdiction. Rather than inhibiting the purposes of the exhaustion doctrine, they were promoted. The demurrer therefore should not have been sustained on the ground that the IOU\u2019s failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b1164-5\">III. <em>Alternative grounds for sustaining demurrer.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1505\">*1505</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-5\">Pacific Gas and Electric Company\u2019s, Southern California Edison Company\u2019s, and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Company\u2019s supplemental request for judicial notice in support of reply brief, filed April 23, 2009, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-6\">Arizona Electric Power Cooperative, Inc.\u2019s request for judicial notice, filed January 16, 2009, is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1165-7\">The judgment is reversed.
