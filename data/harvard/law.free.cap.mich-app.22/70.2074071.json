On August 12, 1968, defendant being represented by counsel tendered a plea of guilty to the lesser included offense of attempted breaking and entering with intent to commit larceny under MCLA \u00a7 750.92 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 28.287) .</p>\n<p id=\"b109-9\">After questioning defendant Davis, the court accepted the guilty plea and on September 16, 1968, defendant was sentenced to serve four to five years in prison. Defendant now brings this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-10\">The only issue with which we are faced is whether the trial court committed reversible error in accepting defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. Defendant argues that his plea was accepted in contravention of GCR 1963, 785.3 and MCLA \u00a7 768.35 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1058). The main thrust of this argument is that the proceedings failed to establish a \u201cbreaking\u201d. A review of the record discloses that defendant, in his own words, described entering the particular business establishment on a Sunday morning by pushing open a door. Authority dictates that the slightest force is all that is necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>to constitute a breaking. See 3 Gillespie, Michigan Criminal Law and Procedure (2d ed), \u00a7 1133, p 1527; <em>People </em>v. <em>White </em>(1908), 153 Mich 617; and <em>People </em>v. <em>Lambo </em>(1967), 8 Mich App 320. Furthermore, one of Davis\u2019 codefendants testified that he removed a small plate glass window to gain entry into the business establishment. Another codefendant also described Davis\u2019 participation in these events. Davis, acting in concert with his codefendants, may be punished as if he had directly committed the offense. MCLA \u00a7 767.39 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a728.979).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">The transcript also discloses that defendant appeared with counsel, was informed of his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to jury trial. There is no question that the plea of guilty was knowingly and voluntarily made. Defendant was apprised of the maximum prison sentence he faced if proven guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">The events surrounding defendant\u2019s apprehension strongly reinforce his plea of guilty. See <em>People </em>v. <em>Curley </em>(1894), 99 Mich 238. Thus, we find no evidence that a miscarriage of justice resulted from defendant\u2019s plea of guilty. <em>People </em>v. <em>Winegar </em>(1968), 380 Mich 719, 733.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
