It is clear that the appellant, Stancavage, cannot maintain a suit under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b) and 2674. He asserts that he has been endamaged to the extent of two million dollars by reason of \u201cradioactivity\u201d, he having received treatment at the Naval Hospital at Philadelphia from September 17 to October 6, 1943. The Federal Tort Claims Act will sustain no cause of action which did not accrue on or after January 1, 1945. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b). In view of this bar to Stancavage\u2019s action it is unnecessary to discuss the applicability of any statute of limitations. The judgment appealed from will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
