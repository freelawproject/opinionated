The application had been denied by the District Court, holding a General Term, on March 8, 1951, and again by action of the District Court dated June 30, 1955, in the form of a letter from the Chief Judge. From neither the action of the court on March 8, 1951, nor June 30, 1955, was an appeal attempted to be prosecuted. Moreover, the motion for reconsideration filed July 30, 1958, was out of time because it failed to satisfy Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.P. 28 U.S.C.A. For these reasons, and without the necessity of considering other questions raised, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-24\">.
