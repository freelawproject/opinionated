The labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>board has prayed a decree enforcing its amended order in full.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">We are of opinion that the position of the board is correct. There is ample substantial evidence in the record, considered as a whole, to support the findings of fact of the board; and its conclusions of law are reasonably drawn. See 118 N.L.R.B. 317; 121 N.L.R.B. No. 154.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Accordingly, the petition of Keco Industries, Inc., to set aside the amended order of the National Labor Relations Board is denied; and the order of the board, as amended, is directed to be enforced in full.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
