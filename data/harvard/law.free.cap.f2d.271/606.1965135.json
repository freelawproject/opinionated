Wheeler, 5 Cir., 262 F.2d 97, the appellants filed a second motion to vacate the judgment. This motion, filed on March 11, 1959, was predicated on the same \u201cfacts and claims\u201d as had been asserted in the original motion. Before the entry of an order on this second motion the Fulen-widers filed, on March 27, 1959, what they denominated an \u201cindependent proceeding\u201d seeking to set aside the judgment. They here state: \u201cIt is conceded that the same facts and claims were asserted as had been asserted on all previous occasions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-19\">The trial court, on May 19, 1959, entered an order dismissing this action with prejudice. In view of the then pendency of the motion seeking the same relief, and in view of appellants\u2019 contention here that the \u201cindependent proceeding\u201d was in fact ancillary to and a part of the principal case, this order was not erroneous. It is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-20\">The trial court thereafter entered a final order denying the March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>11th motion to vacate \u201cwith prejudice. This concluded the merits of the appellants\u2019 contention that they should have a new trial on the basis of alleged false testimony which was fully discussed in the earlier opinion of this Court. Disposing of the appeal from that order on the merits, the judgment is affirmed. See 262 F.2d 97. The mandate shall issue forthwith and the stay heretofore entered is dissolved. <em>it</em></p>\n<p id=\"b677-2\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
