Adding further filip to the conflict of findings between the trial examiner and the Board is the circumstance that while the former held that a speech of respondent\u2019s general manager (Hudson) to its employees anent efforts to unionize its plant violated the provisions of the Act, the Board held that the speech was \u201cinnocent of any threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit\u201d and was therefore \u201cprivileged under Section 8(c) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">Pursuant to its determinations, as above stated, the Board ordered respondent to cease and desist from preventing its employees from distributing union literature on its parking lots; from interrogating its employees concerning membership in, or activities on behalf of the union and from threatening them with sanctions because of such membership or activities. Affirmatively, the Board\u2019s order requires respondent to post appropriate notices announcing its intention to refrain from the prohibited activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">It may be stated preliminarily that the respondent, Rockwell Manufacturing Company, is engaged in the production of a diversified line of industrial equipment sold and shipped in interstate commerce. Its Du Bois Division consists of Plants Nos. 1 and 2 in Du Bois, Pennsylvania, and a third plant in the neighboring town of Sykesville. Included as a part of Plant No. 1 is the NYA building, about two blocks away.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Plant No. 1, where most of the incidents here in issue took place, is located in an urban area. There are highways on two sides of the plant. It has broad sidewalks. Adjacent to one side of the plant is a large parking lot, owned by respondent, which accommodates some two hundred automobiles. Across from the plant, off the highway, is a smaller one-hundred car parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">Approximately eighty to eighty-five percent of the plant employees use the larger parking lot. About 400 feet from the highway entrance to this lot there is an entrance to the plant. The respondent\u2019s time clock is located at the plant entrance \u2014 off the parking lot.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">For the sake of convenience the separate issues presented will be separately discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-14\">First, as to respondent\u2019s enforcement of its no-distribution rule on its parking lot, and the testimony adduced with respect to it:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-15\">Respondent in 1951 promulgated a rule prohibiting distribution of all literature on its property without its specific prior approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-16\">In the latter part of January, 1957, Fred Mensch, an International Representative of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers, AFL-CIO, met with several Rockwell employees to discuss organization of respondent\u2019s plants.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-17\">On February 8, 1957, union advocates distributed pro-union literature to the employees of the plants on the public sidewalk as they entered the parking lot on their way to work. Later that day a notice was posted by respondent on its bulletin boards informing the employees that distribution of literature on its premises without its prior approval was prohibited by established company rules, and that violators would be subject to disciplinary action which might result in dismissal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>The respondent\u2019s no-distribution policy was complied with by all employees,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> although four employees did request permission to distribute union literature at the employees\u2019 entrance to the plant\u2014 the point at which the employees left the parking lot to \u201cpunch in\u201d. There has been no discrimination in the enforcement of the rule. Both respondent and the employees who requested permission to distribute literature recognized that any permission would have to apply equally to pro- and anti-union employees. The request was not granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">Respondent\u2019s failure to grant this request resulted in a complaint being filed with the National Labor Relations Board charging that the respondent committed an unfair labor practice in that it interfered with, restrained or coerced its employees in the exercise of their right of self-organization as guaranteed in Section 7 of the Act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> As earlier stated, the trial examiner dismissed these charges and the Board held to the contrary <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and issued an order that respondent cease and desist from preventing employees from distributing union literature in its parking lot. Respondent was given the right to establish necessary, reasonable, non-discriminatory regulations governing such distribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">The law which governs the validity of a non-discriminatory no-distribution rule has been laid down in three Supreme Court cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The first was Republic Aviation Corporation v. National Labor Relations Board (together with National Labor Relations Board v. Le Tourneau Company of Georgia), 1945, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372. In the Le Tourneau case the employer, had a broad no-distribution of literature rule which was enforced without discrimination so as to bar employees from distributing union literature on company-owned parking lots. The Board, holding that such a bar was an unfair labor practice, specifically found that because of the physical isolation of the plant and because of the widely scattered residences of employees, the distribution of literature to employees was rendered \u201cvirtually impossible\u201d, direct contact with employees away from tne plant \u201cextremely difficult\u201d and self-organization \u201cseriously impeded\u201d.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The Board, in part, relied on Matter of Pey-ton Parking Company,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where it adopted a presumption that a broad company prohibition against solicitation on company property during non-working hours was presumed invalid unless \u201cspecial circumstances make the rule necessary * * * \u201d.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The Supreme Court upheld the Board\u2019s determination, finding no error in the Board\u2019s adoption of the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">The second case was National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock <em>&amp; </em>Wilcox Co., 1956, 351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975 where the employer refused to permit distribution of union literature by non-employee union organizers on company-owned parking lots. The Board held this to be an unreasonable impediment to the employees\u2019 right to self-organization. It found that due to the .physical location of the plant the only safe and practicable place for the distribution of literature to employees was on the parking lots. The sidewalks and streets were not safe. Other means of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>communication, such as telephone, advertising, mailing and home visitations were available. The Supreme Court reversed the Board stating that the rule with respect to non-employee distributions on plant property differed from that for employees. Unless the non-employees could show that the employees were beyond the reach of reasonable union efforts to communicate with them through other means, the employer could bar the non-employees from distributing union literature so long as the bar did not discriminate against the non-employees by allowing other distributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">The third case was National Labor Relations Board v. United Steelworkers of America, 1958, 357 U.S. 357, 78 S.Ct. 1268, 2 L.Ed.2d 1383. In this case Nu-Tone, Inc. posted a series of no-solicitation rules which included a rule against the distribution of any literature on company property \u2014 company property being defined to include parking lots.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The company enforced this rule against pro- and anti-union employees but itself distributed non-coercive anti-union literature. The proceeding before the Board was instituted by the union, whose rights, as non-employees, were governed by the principles enunciated in the Bab-cock &amp; Wilcox case. The issue raised was whether enforcement of the rule\u2014 at the same time the company was violating it \u2014 constituted an unfair labor practice. The trial examiner,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Board,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> all conceded that the rule itself was valid, apparently because, as the trial examiner stated, \u201c * * * prohibiting the distribution of literature on the parking lot did not, under the circumstances shown by the record, constitute an unreasonable impediment to communication * * * since distribution was as effectively made from the sidewalk, immediately adjacent, as on the lot itself.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After stating that \u201cEmployer rules prohibiting organizational solicitation are not in and of themselves violative of the Act, for they may duly serve production, order and discipline. See Republic Aviation Corp [oration] v. National Labor Relations Board, 324 U.S. 793, 65 S.Ct. 982, 89 L.Ed. 1372; National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., 351 U.S. 105, 76 S.Ct. 679, 100 L.Ed. 975\u201d,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Supreme Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-13\">\u201cNo attempt was made * * * to make a showing that the no-solicitation rules truly diminished the ability of the labor organizations involved to carry their message to the employees. Just as that is a vital consideration in determining the validity of a no-solicitation rule, see Republic Aviation Corp[oration] v. National Labor Relations Board, supra, 324 U.S. at pages 797-798, 65 S.Ct. at pages 985-986; National Labor Relations Board v. Babcock &amp; Wilcox Co., supra, 351 U.S. at page 112, 76 S.Ct. at page 684, it is highly relevant in determining whether a valid rule has been fairly applied. * * * If, by virtue of the location of the plant and its facilities and resources available to the union, the opportunities for effectively reaching the employees with a pro-union message, in spite of a no-solicitation rule, are at least as great as the employer\u2019s ability to promote the legally authorized expression of his anti-union views, there is no basis for invalidating these \u2018otherwise valid\u2019 rules. The Board, in determining whether or not the enforcement of such a rule in the circumstances of an individual case is an unfair labor practice, may find relevant alternative channels <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>available for communications on the right to organize. When this important issue is not even raised before the Board and no evidence bearing on it adduced, the concrete basis for appraising the significance of the employer\u2019s conduct is wanting.\u201d <footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The Supreme Court then reversed the Board for failing to make findings that reasonable alternatives were not open to the union to distribute its solicitation literature.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">In accordance with the foregoing the Board in the instant case, having found that the respondent\u2019s no-distribution rule was enforced against employee distributions in its parking lot, properly required respondent to come forward with evidence to justify the rule.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">However, when the respondent offered evidence by way of justification, the Board was bound to consider not only the evidence that was offered as to the impact that the distribution of literature would have on plant discipline, cleanliness, order, etc., but also the effect that the bar against distribution would have on the ability of the employees to organize. Thus, the Board was constrained to consider such evidence as the availability of sidewalk distributions, the small size of the community as indicating the practicality of home solicitation and telephonic communications, as well as the evidence that anti-union employees would of necessity have been distributing literature at the employees\u2019 entrance at the same time as pro-union employees. The Board also should have considered the fact that if <em>employees </em>were permitted to distribute literature, <em>non-employees </em>could no longer be barred under the holding of Babcock &amp; Wilcox, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-13\">As the Supreme Court said in the Republic Aviation case the Board\u2019s duty is \u201c * * * working out an adjustment between the undisputed right of self-organization * * * and the equally undisputed right of employers to maintain discipline in their establishments. Like so many others, these rights are not unlimited in the sense that they can be exercised without regard to any duty which the existence of rights in others may place upon employer and employee. Opportunity to organize and proper discipline are both essential elements in a balanced society.\u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-14\">This is not to say that the Board could not apply a presumption of invalidity to the no-distribution rule. But the burden of proving the unfair labor practice is on the charging party.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In order to determine whether the respondent had justified its rule the Board is compelled to examine all of the evidence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> If the respondent is entitled to justify its rule, the Board must examine respondent\u2019s evidence. Clearly, if the employees have virtually no alternative opportunities to distribute literature and membership applications, then the respondent must show strong justification for its prohibition. Conversely when, as the respondent contends in this case, the employees have readily available alternative means of distribution, the employer\u2019s duty to show exceptional justifying circumstances is lessened.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-15\">Moreover, the Board\u2019s decision merely held that the respondent had offered no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>\u201cvalid reason for the application of its no-distribution rule\u201d. Nowhere does the Board\u2019s decision indicate that it considered the substantial evidence offered by respondent in justification of its rule, nor did it find that it operated to prevent the union from effectively reaching respondent\u2019s employees with its pro-union message.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On review of the record, we are satisfied it establishes respondent\u2019s no-distribution rule, promulgated some six years before the critical events at issue in 1957, was premised on its desire to \u201cserve production, order and discipline\u201d and further that it fails to establish that \u201cthe opportunities for effectively reaching the employees with a pro-union message, in spite of a no-solicitation rule\u201d were not \u201cat least as great as the employer\u2019s ability to promote the legally authorized expression of his anti-union views.\u201d National Labor Relations Board v. United Steelworkers of America, supra. [357 U.S. 357, 78 S.Ct. 1271.].</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">As earlier stated, Plant No. 1 faces on two highways and has \u201cgood broad sidewalks\u201d \u201cwithin a few feet of the plant\u201d and \u201cthere is plenty of room for distributing pamphlets or doing anything you want\u201d; it is located in an urban area in the city of Du Bois and \u201cpractically all\u201d of its employees live in that city (the quotations are from the testimony of Lamar Puyda, a pro-union employee and Board witness).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Further, Vernon C. Shaffer, a pro-union employee and Board witness, testified that anti-union employees were also engaged in distributing their literature outside the respondent\u2019s plants; \u201cthere were a lot of employees there that didn\u2019t want this [pro-union] literature\u201d; \u201cthere was a pretty strong feeling against the union as well as for it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">Shaffer\u2019s testimony as to the existence of strong anti-union sentiment on the part of a \u201clot of employees\u201d corroborated that of Earl Hudson, respondent\u2019s general manager. The latter testified that he posted the long-standing no-distribution rule on respondent\u2019s bulletin boards because he wanted to \u201cprevent fisticuffs and altercations\u201d on respondent\u2019s property because of the strong pro-union and anti-union feelings prevailing among employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">The testimony adverted to was uncon-tradicted by any of the Board\u2019s other witnesses and served to support respondent\u2019s contentions that it enforced its no-distribution rule to maintain order.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">It is unquestioned that had respondent permitted distribution of pro-union literature on its parking lot it would, under the law, have been required to permit distribution of anti-union literature creating, under the testimony, the disorders sought to be avoided by enforcement of the no-distribution rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Without spelling out the foregoing, the trial examiner in his Intermediate Report recommended the dismissal of the complaint insofar as it dealt with the respondent\u2019s no-distribution rule. In doing so he stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">\u201cOn the entire record the undersigned * * * finds that a rule intended to prohibit distribution of all literature at the plant unless specifically authorized existed since 1951.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-13\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-14\">\u201cUpon the entire record the undersigned is persuaded that the Respondent did not \u2018on February 8, 1957, and thereafter, discriminator-ily promulgate and enforce a rule denying its employees the right to distribute any literature on its property, including parking lots and other areas adjacent to the buildings comprising the plants of its DuBois plants\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-15\">In accordance with the foregoing we are of the opinion that the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement with respect to its order relating to the no-distribution rule must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">Coming now to the second phase of the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement based on statements and questions addressed by respondent\u2019s supervisory employees to certain pro-union employees:</p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>As earlier stated, the trial examiner in his Intermediate Report dismissed charges that unfair labor practices were committed with respect to verbal exchanges between the supervisory employees with pro-union employees Youn-gren, Case and Lenkerd. With respect to the incidents in which Youngren and Case figured the trial examiner stated he was persuaded they represented \u201conly isolated chance inquiries by the foreman not chargeable as an unfair labor practice\u201d, and as to the Lenkerd conversation he stated that \u201cthe General Counsel\u2019s dredging produced no gold.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">The Board disagreed with the trial examiner and found \u201c * * * in the context of the Respondent's admitted hostility to the Union, as manifested in the general manager\u2019s speech of February 5, 1957, and its unlawful prohibition of the distribution of union literature on the company parking lot by employees, at the inception of the union\u2019s organization campaign, the remarks of the foreman to Youngren, Case and Lenkard were coercive and violative of Section 8(a) (1) of the Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">An analysis of the verbal exchanges referred to sustains the finding and recommendation of the trial examiner and negates the Board\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Youngren testified with respect to his conversation with Foreman Hoskavich as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">\u201cQ. Now, what did Mr. Hoska-vich say to you? A. He said \u2018Verne, be careful. I heard that you are one of the instigators of this union trying to get in here.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cQ. What did you say to him? A. I thanked him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-10\">\u201cQ. That was all? A. That was all.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Case testified as follows to the incident in which Foreman Hoskavich also figured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-12\">\u201cQ. And in the year 1957 have any of your supervisors made any comments to you about unions? A. Mr. Hoskavich asked us what our opinion was of the union. That was all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-15\">******</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">\u201cTrial Examiner: Just a minute. You say Mr. Hoskavich addressed a group of you.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-17\">\u201cThe Witness: The ones that were working there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-19\">\u201cTrial Examiner: How did that happen. Did he call you together or what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-21\">\u201cThe Witness: We were all together there at quitting time, and he just asked us our opinion of the union.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-22\">\u201cTrial Examiner: He just came up to you and asked you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-23\">\u201cThe Witness: He came through where we had been working.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-24\">Two other employees who were in this group also testified that Hoskavich \u201casked us what we thought of the union.\u201d Lenkerd testified as follows with respect to remarks made to him by Foreman Domitrovich:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-25\">\u201cQ. Now, will you tell the Trial Examiner what Mr. Domitrovich\u2019s remark about the unions was, and the events, if any, leading up to such a remark ? A. This was over a tow motor deal, a tow motor operator was stacking meters over where we hang our coats, and they were so close that this tow motor was rubbing on our jackets. I stepped across the aisle to him and told him what was coming off, and he followed me back to the machine, and he was sort of hot under the collar, and he said \u2018Since this union business got in here\u2019, he said, \u2018everybody gets hot real quick\u2019, and I said \u2018Well, as big a company as Rockwell is, they ought to have a place big enough to hang your coats so the tow motor don\u2019t rub over them and get them all dirty.\u2019 He said, \u2018Well, you are lucky you are working. You are lucky you are working.\u2019 He said \u2018If the union wasn\u2019t\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-26\">\u201cQ. Take your time. A. \u2018If the union was in\u2019, he said \u2018you wouldn\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>be working now. We are making meters for stock\u2019. He said, \u2018You don\u2019t think you would be making meters for stock?\u201d\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">With respect to Foreman Hoskavich\u2019s admonition to Youngren to \u201cbe careful\u201d it should be noted that the foreman testified that after it took place he \u201crode home with [Youngren] the same night\u201d, and that Youngren frequently \u201crode me home\u201d from work.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">While such an admonition could under certain circumstances be adjudged a \u201cthreat\u201d violative of the Act, due consideration must be given to the fact that the trial examiner who heard .the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses and took note of the friendliness of their relationship, evidenced by their riding home together from work, found that it was not, and his finding merits consideration by this Court. The same holds true with respect to the trial examiner\u2019s finding as to the Case and Lenkerd incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">As we stated in In re United Corporation, 3 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 168, 178 in discussing the holding in Universal Camera Corp. v. National Labor Relations Board, 1951, 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456, \u201c* * * while a reviewing court need not give a trial examiner\u2019s findings more weight than they deserve in the light of reason and judicial experience, they should be accorded the relevance that they reasonably command in answering the over-all question whether the evidence supporting the Board\u2019s order is substantial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">To the same effect see National Labor Relations Board v. Supreme Bedding <em>&amp; </em>Furniture Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 1952, 196 F.2d 997 where it was found that the recommendations of the examiner were supported by substantial evidence while the findings of the Board were not and enforcement of the Board\u2019s order was accordingly denied. In that case the Court stated (196 F.2d at page 997): \u201c * * * the Board is unable to make use of, the tributes to the perspicuity and the superior opportunities of the examiner * * * \u201d and stressed (p. 998) \u201c * * * the examiner\u2019s superior opportunities to determine the credibility * *</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">Considering the statements made here, each is either permitted as (1) a non-coercive interrogatory, National Labor Relations Board v.
