D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 22-3501 (a), 62 Stat. 347. The child was an eleven year old girl. As in Benton v. United States, \u201ctestimony upon which the conviction rests came from the child and was denied by the accused.\u201d 88 U.S.App.D.C. 158, 159, 188 F.2d 625, 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-22\">Appellant was guilty if anyone was, for he alone was with the child at the time of the alleged offense. But there was no evidence of any sort, except the testimony of the child herself, that anyone took indecent liberties with her. In the conventional phrase, there was no corroboration of the corpus delicti.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-23\">The appellant in Kelly v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 125, 194 F.2d 150, had been convicted of inviting another person to accompany him for a lewd and immoral purpose. D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 22-2701, 62 Stat. 346. The disputed testimony of the complaining witness was the only evidence of such an invitation. Although we did not say that corroboration of the corpus delicti was required, we did say there was \u201cample precedent for a ruling by this court that in certain cases the uncorroborated testimony of one witness will not support a conviction\u201d, and we reversed the conviction \u201cfor lack of the requisite proof to convict.\u201d We said: \u201cThe case before us lies in a field in which our courts have traditionally been unusually skeptical toward the accusation. This has been true of all the so-called sex offenses.\u201d 90 U.S.App.D.C. at pages 127, 130, 128, 194 F.2d at pages 153, 156, 153. Cf. 3 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 924b, (3d ed. 1940), 7 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 2061 (3d ed. 1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-24\">The complaining witness in the Kelly case was a policeman. A woman\u2019s uncorroborated tale of a sex offense is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>more reliable than a man\u2019s. A young child\u2019s is far less reliable. \u201cIt is well recognized that children are more highly suggestible than adults. Sexual activity, with the aura of mystery that adults create about it, confuses and fascinates them. Moreover, they have, of course, no real understanding of the serious consequences of the charges they make. As a consequence most courts show an admirable reluctance to accept the unsubstantiated testimony of children in sexual crimes.\u201d Guttmacher and Weihofen, Psychiatry and the Law (1952), p. 374.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Wigmore says: \u201cNo judge should ever let a sex-offence charge go to the jury unless the female complainant\u2019s social history and mental makeup have been examined and testified to by a qualified physician.\u201d 3 Wigmore, Evidence, \u00a7 924a (3d ed. 1940). He quotes from a 1937-38 Report of the American Bar Association\u2019s Committee on the Improvement of the Law of Evidence: \u201cToday it is <em>unanimously </em>held (and we say 'unanimously\u2019 advisedly) by experienced psychiatrists that the complainant woman in a sex offense should <em>always </em>be examined by competent experts to ascertain whether she suffers from some mental or moral delusion or tendency, frequently found especially in young girls, causing distortion of the imagination in sex cases.\u201d We have not adopted that view and do not adopt it now. But its existence has some tendency to confirm the traditional skepticism of courts toward the present sort of accusation.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">In cases involving young girls, we have held that \u201cthe corpus delicti in a -case such as this may not be established by the victim\u2019s spontaneous declaration\u201d. Fountain v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 391, 236 F.2d 684, 686. Jones v. United States, 97 U.S.App.D.C. 291, 231 F.2d 244. And in Brown v. United States, 80 U.S.App.D.C. 270, 271, 152 F.2d 138, 139, we said: \u201cWe do not minimize the importance of a young child\u2019s spontaneous exclamations. They may be much more valuable than her testimony on the witness stand.\u201d On the other hand, her testimony is subject to the test of cross-examination, and if it meets that test it may be more valuable than her spontaneous exclamations. However that may be, we now hold that the corpus delicti in a case such as this may not be established by the child\u2019s uncorroborated testimony on the witness stand. The adequacy of particular kinds and amounts of corroboration must be left for decision in particular cases as they arise.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-12\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, concurs in the result.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
