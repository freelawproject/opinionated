It is so ordered.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">Appeal dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-5\">WASHINGTON, Circuit Judge, would affirm rather than dismiss.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b570-14\">. In view of this action we should note that defense counsel advises us that although privately engaged, he has acted on this appeal without compensation; he has ably presented all aspects of the case for our consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
