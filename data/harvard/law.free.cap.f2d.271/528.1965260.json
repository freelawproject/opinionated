While the resulting verdict was substantia] in its allowance for pain and suffering, the trial court did not find it excessive and there is no ground for us to interfere. The judge did not err in admitting in evidence the hospital records containing a history of treatment and including a statement from the plaintiff as to how the injury occurred, Terrasi v. South Atlantic Lines, 2 Cir., 226 F.2d 823, certiorari denied 350 U.S. 988, 76 S.Ct. 475, 100 L.Ed. 855; Tucker v. Loew\u2019s Theatre &amp; Realty Corp., 2 Cir., 149 F.2d 677; moreover, the statement appears to be quite colorless against the facts otherwise proven. The evidence, including the hospital records, also shows outpatient treatment supporting the award of maintenance. Moyle v. National Petroleum Transport Corp., 2 Cir., 150 F.2d 840.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
