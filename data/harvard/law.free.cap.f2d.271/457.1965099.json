Because appellant tendered the issue of arbitrary action by appellees in implementing the Voluntary Oil Import Program by sufficient allegations in its complaint, the complaint states a claim upon which relief could be granted and should not have been dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-19\">It is therefore ordered by the court that this case be, and it is hereby, remanded to the District Court with directions to vacate the orders dismissing the complaint and denying the motion for preliminary injunction and to afford ap-pellees an opportunity, in opposition to the motion for preliminary injunction, to controvert the allegations of arbitrary action; then to promptly hold a hearing for the purpose of determining whether a preliminary injunction, pending trial, is warranted. See Yakus v. United States, 1944, 321 U.S. 414, 431-443, 64 S.Ct. 660, 88 L.Ed. 834.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-20\">It is further ordered by the court that the motion in this court for injunction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>pending appeal be, and it is hereby, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">It is further ordered by the court that a certified copy of this order issue to the District Court forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
