Willoughby, 5 Cir.. 257 F.2d 580, 581, had held that the cause was moot and had dismissed the action in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-15\">We cannot at all agree with this view. As a reference to the opinion of the court in Brannen v. Willoughby, supra, will show, the appeal there was not from an order affecting the merits of the cause but was from an order granting a temporary injunction with respect to a season expiring on August 16, 1957. The only matter of which this court had jurisdiction and with reference to which it could speak was an appeal from a temporary injunction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b503-16\">When, therefore, it was stated in the opinion: that the cause was moot, since the season to which it was confined expired in August; it is manifest that it was not attempting to deal, as of course it could not, with the merits of the action of which, since the appeal had not brought them up, it had no jurisdiction, but, as the opinion shows by later declaring : \u201cTime has wiped the slate clean, the order is moot\u201d, it was dealing with, and only with the subject matter which the appeal had brought into the court, the temporary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-18\">The order of the district court, therefore, declaring that the Court of Appeals had in Brannen v. Willoughby, supra, acquired jurisdiction over the merits of the action in Willoughby v. Brannen, and had undertaken to declare the action moot, was erroneous in its predicate and, therefore, in the order, and its judgment may not stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-19\">Without, for the reason that they are not before us, undertaking to deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>the other questions argued on this appeal as to whether the original complaint, the amendment thereto, and the supplemental complaint state a claim against the appellees as to which any relief can be granted,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and as to the liberality of the rule for allowance of amendments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we order the judgment reversed for consideration of the issues and disposition of the suit on the merits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-11\">. As pertinent tere the judgment provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-12\">\u201cIt is Ordered, Adjudged and Decreed by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Georgia, Swainsboro Division that the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, by its decisions, case No. 17,020 [Aulbert J.

Willoughby] held in effect that the cause is moot and dismissed the same in its entirety;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b503-20\">\u201cTherefore, the cause of action, the original complaint filed in said case, the motion to amend the original complaint, the supplemental complaint and all other pleadings filed by the plaintiff in said cause be, and the same are hereby dismissed without prejudice <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b503-21\">.
