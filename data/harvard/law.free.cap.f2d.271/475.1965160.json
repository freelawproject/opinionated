Miller, Bazelon and Bast\u00edan, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b546-18\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b546-19\">Appellant was convicted of violation of statutes relating to marihuana<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and dangerous drugs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His conviction was based upon the testimony of an undercover police officer who had befriended him.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-20\">One of the many allegations of error relates to the voir dire upon which the court alone interrogated the jurors. At the conclusion of its examination, defense counsel requested the court to ask whether \u201cany of the jurors [are] inclined to give more weight to the testimony of a police officer <em>merely because he is a police officer </em>than any other witness in the case ?\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) The court denied the request. We hold this is reversible error requiring a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-21\">A trial court\u2019s \u201cbroad discretion as to the questions to be asked\u201d on voir dire is \u201csubject to the essential demands of fairness.\u201d Aldridge v. United States, 1931, 283 U.S. 308, 310, 51 S.Ct. 470, 471, 75 L.Ed. 1054. In the recent case of Chavez v. United States, 10 Cir., 1958, 258 F.2d 816, 819, certiorari denied sub nom. Tenorio v. United States, 1959, 359 U.S. 916, 79 S.Ct. 592, 3 L.Ed.2d 577, it was pointed out that a \u201cdefendant cannot be fairly tried by a juror who would be inclined to give unqualified credence to a law enforcement officer <em>simply because he is an officer.\u201d </em><footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-22\">In the present case the Government concedes that the voir dire had by no means been unduly protracted. The police officer\u2019s testimony was virtually the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>entire case for the prosecution. In these circumstances, the refusal to question the jurors in accordance with defense counsel\u2019s request constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Since the other questions raised on this appeal may not recur in a new trial, we do not consider them.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">WILBUR K MILLER, Circuit Judge, dissents.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b546-13\">.

The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court\u2019s refusal to ask to jurors \u201cWould any of you place a greater amount of weight upon the testimony of law enforcement officers over that of the defendants?\u201d Since this Question did not ask whether the law enforcement officer\u2019s testimony would be given greater weight <em>\u201csimply because he is an. officer\u201d </em>it represented an attempt to determine in advance of trial whether a juror would believe the testimony of one witness rather than another, and therefore was improper.
