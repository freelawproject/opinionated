D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 18-211. In the present case, before and also after the death of Florence Rice, an incompetent widow for whom guardians ad litem were appointed, the guardians concluded that the provision for her in her husband\u2019s will should be accepted. After the death of the widow, the District Court expressed its agreement with that view and entered an order accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">The widow\u2019s administrator appeals from that order. He contends that because, under D.C.Code (1951) \u00a7 20-202, he was required to give bond to administrator \u201call the money, goods, chattels, rights, and credits of the deceased * * * \u201d, it is for him to elect whether to accept or renounce the husband\u2019s will.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">We held in 1943 that after the death of an incompetent widow, the District Court had authority \u201cin her behalf\u201d to elect whether the provision for her in her husband\u2019s will should be renounced. Mead v. Phillips, 77 U.S.App.D.C. 365, 369, 371, 135 F.2d 819, 823, 825, 147 A.L.R. 322. The present case does not involve the question whether the court, the guardian ad litem, or neither, had that authority, for the court and the guardian have agreed that the provision should not be renounced. The incompetent widow\u2019s administrator has no such authority, because the widow herself had no such \u201cright\u201d when she died.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
