The district court dismissed thQ appellant\u2019s claim as being without merit. The appellant\u2019s claim of lien relates to tax refunds which his clients have not recovered and are not entitled to recover. Those who may have had a right of recovery have not asserted their rights and are not clients of the appellant. It follows that the judgment of the distinct court must be</p>\n<p id=\"b856-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
