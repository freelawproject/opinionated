This section, in numbered parar graphs, establishes five categories of de-portable aliens who are entitled to seek such relief. The district court dismissed the action. The facts are fully stated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>its opinion, 176 F.Supp. 421. The only question on this appeal is whether' as matter of law petitioner could qualify under any paragraph of the statute. We agree that he could not.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">In this court petitioner concedes that lie has no claim under section 244(a) (2), which deals with aliens who are deporta-ble solely for an act committed, or status existing, prior to or at the time of entry. Petitioner is being deported solely on the ground that his right to remain in this country expired in October, 1950, so that since then he has been a person who has remained longer in the United States than the period for which he was admitted. Although this status is specifically covered in section 244(a) (5), petitioner admittedly cannot qualify under paragraph (5) as a whole because he cannot satisfy its further requirement of ten years\u2019 residence. Accordingly, he claims under section 244(a) (3), which requires only five years\u2019 residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-5\">Paragraph (3) applies to an alien who is deportable for \u201can act committed or status acquired subsequent to such entry into the United States and [who] is not within the provisions of paragraph (4) or (5) of this subsection * * * \u201d Paragraph (5), as already stated, expressly includes \u201cremained longer\u201d persons. Petitioner says, however, that he \u201cis not within the provisions of paragraph (5)\u201d because of his insufficient length of residence, so that, accordingly, he is not excluded from paragraph (3). In other words, he contends that a \u201cremained longer\u201d person whose residence exceeds ten years might apply under paragraph (5), but if his residence is less than ten years, but not less than five, he can apply under paragraph (3) for the same relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">A rigid and literal reading of this rather cumbersome section seemingly supports petitioner\u2019s view, but we cannot attribute to Congress such an intention. On the contrary, careful examination of paragraphs (3) and (5) discloses that the sole reason for placing \u201cremained longer\u201d persons in paragraph (5) is to impose upon such persons a more lengthy residence requirement. Petitioner\u2019s construction would defeat the very purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-8\">Judgment will enter affirming the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
