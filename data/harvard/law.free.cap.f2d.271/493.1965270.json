He was represented at trial by retained counsel. In November, 1957, two years after his conviction, appellant filed a <em>pro se </em>motion which the District Judge treated as a motion to vacate sentence under 62 Stat. 967 (1948), as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (1952). After hearing testimony and arguments, including the testimony of the trial counsel, the District Judge held that appellant had failed to support the claim of ineffective- assistance of trial counsel and described trial counsel as \u201cdiligent, always working to the extent of his ability in the interest of his clients, aiid, by virtue of his long experience, a competent trial lawyer.\u201d Appellant was represented by court-appointed counsel in the post-conviction proceedings in the District Court, and by retained counsel on his appeal in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">Our review of the case on the merits satisfies us that there is no basis in law or fact for this appeal, and that it should be dismissed as frivolous under 62 Stat. 954 (1948), as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(d) (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b564-11\">Appeal dismissed as frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-12\">WASHINGTON, Circuit Judge, would affirm rather than dismiss.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
