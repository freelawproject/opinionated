Petitioner seeks release on the ground that the indictment on which he was convicted in the District Court (N.D.Ohio) charging him in substantially the words of the statute with passing an altered obligation of the United States (18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 472) was fatally defective because it failed to allege knowledge that the instrument had been altered. United States v. Carll, 1882, 105 U.S. 611, 26 L.Ed. 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-22\">Previously, petitioner\u2019s motion to vacate under 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255 was denied by the District Court in Ohio and leave to appeal in forma pauperis was denied by the Court of Appeals. (6 Cir., Aug. 8, 1958). The Supreme Court denied cer-tiorari. Brinson v. United States, 1958, 358 U.S. 890, 79 S.Ct. 130, 3 L.Ed.2d 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">To whatever extent the sufficiency of an indictment may be inquired into in a collateral proceeding, (United States v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>Shelton, 7 Cir., 1958, 249 F.2d 871; McGann v. United States, 4 Cir., 1957, 249 F.2d 431; Gregori v. United States, 5 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 47) it is no greater under habeas corpus than under \u00a7 2255. Barnes v. Hunter, 10 Cir., 1951, 188 F.2d 86. Consequently, this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain habeas corpus since it does not appear that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 was \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
