Appellant, however, contends now, as it did before the trial court, that it is entitled to not merely be saved harmless from loss of its out of pocket <em>expenses, </em>but to obtain the benefit of the bargain it made as if the sale had been a valid and binding one. The trial judge held that it was not so entitled and we affirm substantially for the reasons given in the trial judge\u2019s reported opinion. 159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329 (Ch.Div.1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">That opinion did not, however, address several other issues based upon trial court orders entered before the summary judgment. One concerns the propriety of the trial judge\u2019s refusal to permit appellant to amend its answer and file a third-party complaint, and the other a refusal to permit a late claim under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:8 9, to be filed against the Monmouth County District Court, Monmouth County District Court\u2019s Constable\u2019s Office and the Monmouth County Sheriff. We affirm. By reason of the principal holding in this case, that appellant is only entitled to be placed in the <em>status quo ante, </em>appellant has suffered no legally cognizable damages and hence has no claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Appellant\u2019s remaining contentions lack merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
