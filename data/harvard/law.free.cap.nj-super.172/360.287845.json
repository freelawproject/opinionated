Plaintiff appealed to the then County Court and over defendant\u2019s objection was granted a trial by jury. The jury returned a verdict in plaintiff\u2019s favor. Defendant appeals and contends that the trial judge (1) erred in granting plaintiff a jury trial in contravention of <em>R. </em>4:74 6, (2) committed \u201cplain error\u201d in not permitting certain testimony to be read back to the jury, and (3) committed \u201cplain error\u201d in not dismissing the complaint because the child\u2019s blood had been completely replaced following birth because of RH complications.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">With respect of defendant\u2019s first contention we affirm for the reasons stated in Judge Callahan\u2019s written opinion of September 12, 1978. Defendant\u2019s remaining two contentions are clearly without merit. <em>R. </em>2:11 3(e)(1)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
