A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Two insureds, Robert Tal and Mitchell Webb, appeal from a declaratory judgment in favor of their insurance carrier, Franklin Mutual Insurance Company (hereinafter \u201cFranklin\u201d), exonerating Franklin from liability on two homeowner\u2019s policies with respect to the death of one Thomas Flood because, according to the trial judge\u2019s findings, his death was \u201cexpected or intended\u201d by the insureds within the meaning of the provision in each of the two policies excluding coverage for</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-10\">f. . bodily injury . . . which is <em>either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured. </em>[Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">The underlying event was a fight during the early morning hours of November 6, 1975 in which Thomas Flood, Jr., received injuries from a blow delivered by Robert Tal, from which Flood later died. The other insured, Mitchell Webb, was found to have participated in the events leading to the fatal blow, and on that basis to have expected or intended the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-13\">Flood\u2019s death, and the circumstances in which it occurred, spawned not only issues regarding insurance coverage but two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>other proceedings as well. Prior to the declaratory judgment to be considered herein, a criminal proceeding against Robert Tal resulted in his conviction of involuntary manslaughter for the death of Thomas Flood. After the declaratory judgment, a civil action for Flood\u2019s wrongful death, brought by decedent\u2019s representative,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulted in a plaintiff\u2019s verdict against both Webb and Tal, the Tal verdict being based upon negligence, and the verdict against Webb, being based upon both negligence and intentional conduct. Because Franklin was exonerated from coverage by the declaratory judgment, it did not participate in the liability trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Before confronting the propriety of the challenged declaratory judgment, we first address the most significant aspect of the case \u2014 that the parties to the declaratory suit failed to join as a party the decedent\u2019s representative with respect to the action for Flood\u2019s wrongful death and with respect to the survival action on behalf of the decedent\u2019s estate. It was not until after this judgment and initiation of this appeal that decedent\u2019s representative became a party by way of intervention, and then only to establish that she was not bound by the declaratory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Whether decedent\u2019s representative is or is not bound by the declaratory judgment exonerating Franklin is an issue which, strictly speaking, is not before us. The binding effect of such a judgment should be decided only in a suit on the policies to collect the money judgments. Nevertheless, decedent\u2019s representative does presently have two money judgments of considerable magnitude against Webb and Tal and almost inevitably will seek to satisfy those judgments from the Franklin policies coverage of which is at issue on this appeal. The issue will have to be decided, the facts upon which the issue depends are undisputed, and all parties to this appeal have tacitly, at least, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>acquiesced in having it resolved on a primary basis at the appellate level. Therefore, in the exercise of our original jurisdiction, we undertake to do so. <em>R. </em>2.T0 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">Clearly, decedent\u2019s representative\u2019s contention that she is not bound by the judgment here under consideration is correct; no party contends otherwise. The failure to join decedent\u2019s representative to the declaratory suit robs the resulting judgment of any binding effect on her. Manifestly, it was the obligation of those seeking declaratory relief (in this matter both the insurance carrier and the insureds) to join \u201call persons having or claiming any interest which would be affected by the declaration . <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16 56. One not a party thereto remains unaffected by any such judgment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:16-57. Consequently, decedent\u2019s representative who now holds substantial money judgments against Webb and Tal resulting from the trial of the action for Flood\u2019s wrongful death may file her own suit on Webb\u2019s and Tal\u2019s policies and would be unaffected by the trial judge\u2019s ruling in the declaratory action in Franklin\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">That decedent\u2019s representative is free from the constraints of the declaratory judgment does not, however, end the inquiry. The effects of the two collateral proceedings previously mentioned remain to be considered. Considering, first, whether Tal\u2019s conviction of involuntary manslaughter bars decedent\u2019s representative\u2019s recourse to Tal\u2019s policy with Franklin, we are convinced that it does. The conviction was based upon jury instructions which properly charged that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b144-7\">The crime of manslaughter is an unlawful killing of a person where the death results unintentionally so far as the person charged with the crime is concerned <em>from an act committed by him with the intention to do less than great bodily harm. </em>. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The conviction, affirmed on appeal, established that by Tal\u2019s intentional act, the injury, although not great, resulted in Flood\u2019s death. Decedent\u2019s representative is bound by that find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ing and is collaterally estopped to assert that Tal did not intend some harm to Flood even though he never intended or expected Flood\u2019s death. Such was the clear holding in <em>New Jersey Mfrs. Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Brower, </em>161 <em>N.J.Super. </em>293 (App.Div.1978), a holding with which we agree. In <em>Brower </em>the court squarely held that the injured person was estoppe^ by the insured\u2019s conviction of assault with intent to kill from relitigating with the insurer whether his injuries had been intentionally caused by the insured even though the injured victim did not participate in the criminal trial. The holding is, of course, founded on the injured victim\u2019s privity with the insured through whom he claims; he stands in the insured\u2019s shoes vis-a-vis the policy from which he seeks payment. So here, with respect to Tal\u2019s policy with Franklin, decedent\u2019s representative has no greater rights thereunder than does Tal. Tal is clearly bound by the manslaughter conviction in which he participated; so, too, are all who claim through him, including decedent\u2019s representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Necessarily implicit in that conviction was the finding that Tal intended to inflict some injury on Flood even though his death was unintentional. That finding, however, forecloses decedent\u2019s representative from recovery on Tal\u2019s policy. <em>Lyons v. Hartford Ins. Group, </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>239 (App.Div.1973), certif. den. 64 <em>N.J. </em>322 (1974), and <em>Oakes v. State Farm, </em>137 <em>N.J.Super. </em>365 (App.Div.1975), certif. den. 70 <em>N.J. </em>142 (1976). In <em>Lyons </em>the insured, a police officer, had fired his gun allegedly as a warning, but had instead killed someone with the shot. His policy with Hartford contained an exclusion identical to the one found in Tal\u2019s policy with Franklin. The principle governing coverage under this exclusion w'as stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">The general rule is that coverage exists under insuring and exclusion clauses identical or similar to the ones involved here for the unintended results of an intentional act, hut not for the damages assessed because of an injury which was intended to be inflicted. <em>[Id. </em>125 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 245]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Where the intentional act has resulted in intended injury, even where the injury inflicted is different or more severe than intended, coverage has been denied . . <em>[Id. </em>at 246]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">The trial court judgment denying the officer coverage was reversed and remanded for a new trial because the insured had intended no injury at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">In <em>Oakes, supra, </em>defendant insurer appealed from a determination that a homeowner\u2019s policy provided the insured with coverage for injuries to another caused by an assault and battery by the homeowner. The trial court judgment in favor of the insured in those circumstances was reversed because the insured intended some injury to the third person although the extent of injury was unintended. <em>Id. </em>137 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 367.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In the present matter the jury in the criminal proceeding must have determined, by their verdict of manslaughter, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Tal intended Flood some injury although not his death. Tal was a party to that suit and had full opportunity and incentive to prove his innocence of any homicide charge. The necessarily implicit finding that Tal intended Flood some injury forecloses him and those claiming through him from any recovery on the Franklin policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Decedent\u2019s representative is not, however, similarly foreclosed in making a claim under Webb\u2019s policy with Franklin. The civil suit against Webb resulted in a special jury verdict which founded Webb\u2019s liability to Flood on the basis of both negligence and intention. Specifically, the jury found that recovery against Webb was warranted by his \u201cintentional wrongdoing in connection with the fight and the events that led up to it . and by his \u201cnegligence in connection with the fight and the events that led up to it . The jury was not asked to select which of the two inconsistent findings more accurately reflected their view of the evidence. Hence, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>are left with an equivocal jury verdict, of insufficient definition to estop Webb, and hence those claiming through him, including decedent\u2019s representative from making claim on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">Because decedent\u2019s representative is not bound by the declaratory judgment here under examination, and is not bound by the ambiguous jury finding in connection with the basis for Webb\u2019s liability to Flood, she is free to make claim on Webb\u2019s policy and litigate whether Webb\u2019s liability is covered under his policy by Franklin.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">It only remains for us to determine whether the declaratory judgment binds Webb and Franklin, two of the parties who did participate in the trial which resulted in the judgment, or whether we should regard the declaratory judgment as a nullity for the failure to join decedent\u2019s representative. We see no reason why they should not be so bound. Both parties had full opportunity to present all of their evidence with respect to Webb\u2019s entitlement to coverage under Franklin\u2019s policy. We see little to be gained in rerunning that course.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">In summary, we affirm the challenged declaratory judgment as being founded on substantial credible evidence. <em>Close v. Kordulak, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>589 (1965). In the exercise of our original jurisdiction, we hold decedent\u2019s representative foreclosed by Tal\u2019s manslaughter conviction from making claim on Tal\u2019s policy. Again, in the exercise of our original jurisdiction, we hold decedent\u2019s representative not bound by the declaratory judgment and free to litigate whether Webb\u2019s policy affords Webb coverage from which decedent\u2019s representative can obtain satisfaction of her judgment against Webb.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-7\">Decedent\u2019s representative and wife, Karen Flood, brought suit as administratrix for the estate of Thomas Flood, Jr., and as administratrix <em>ad prosequendum </em>of Thomas Flood, Jr.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
