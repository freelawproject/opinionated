A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b105-12\">Petitioner David Toma appeals from a final determination of the Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (Board) denying his application for acciden<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>tal disability retirement benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In essence, he contends that his application to the Board was timely filed<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that the Board\u2019s determination is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Petitioner, now 46 years old, was enrolled in the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System effective December 27, 1956, while employed as a police officer for the City of Newark. He attained the rank of detective in 1962 and continued in that position until his last day of active service on July 30, 1973. On April 2, 1975 he filed an application for accidental disability retirement. The Board of Trustees of the Police and Firemen\u2019s Retirement System (Board) denied the application. Petitioner appealed and a hearing was held in the Division of Pensions (Division).</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">At the Division hearing petitioner described a series of nine on-the-job injuries, <em>viz.:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b106-7\">(1) On April 10, 1959, while making an arrest, he \u201cwas bitten on the [thumb of his] left hand by a prisoner . \u201d He was taken to City Hospital and treated for blood poisoning. As a result of the incident his thumb \u201cis just in bad shape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b106-10\">(2) On September 24, 1960, while trying to subdue a violent 300-pound mental patient, he was thrown to the floor. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>experienced \u201ctremendous pain\u201d in his \u201clower spine,\u201d had difficulty walking, and was taken to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital where he \u201cwas put into traction for almost six weeks.\u201d For six months after leaving the hospital he was given heat treatments in the doctor\u2019s office \u201cthree or four times a week.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">(3) On May 8, 1961, while assisting in the removal of a sick person to an ambulance, his left hand was lacerated when it \u201cgot caught in the stretcher.\u201d He was taken to City Hospital where the wound was sutured.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">(4) On December 22, 1961, while assisting in the rescue of several persons in an apartment house fire, he was overcome by smoke and rushed to City Hospital where oxygen was administered to him for several hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">(5) On July 14, 1967, during the riots in Newark, while climbing a fire escape under gunfire, he fell and sustained a \u201cvery bad\u201d ankle sprain.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">(6) On October 10, 1968 he was beaten about the head and face and stabbed while attempting to break up a fight in a diner. He was rushed to St. Michael\u2019s Hospital. His resulting injuries were: a \u201cbad concussion,\u201d a fracture of his jaw resulting in a persisting impairment of the functioning of his mouth (he is unable to eat solid foods), and headaches, dizziness and a partial loss of hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">(7) On January 2, 1969, while lifting crates containing confiscated phonograph records, his \u201clegs went out completely.\u201d His body \u201cbecome twisted\u201d and he was unable to walk.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">(8) On September 16, 1971 his left foot was lacerated when a large garbage barrel, located outside of the office out of which he was then working, tumbled over and struck him as he passed by. The foot required suturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">(9) On September 28, 1971, as he was walking up a stairway in the Essex County Courthouse where he was scheduled to testify, he \u201cfelt a tremendous pain in [his] lower spine.\u201d His \u201cwhole body became twisted,\u201d and he had to be brought downstairs by other policemen.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Petitioner also testified that he suffered on-the-job traumatic experiences on many other occasions. The sum total of his injuries left him with a number of impairments. At the time of the hearing in the Division he was wearing a lumbosacral back brace. He testified that he has to wear \u201ca bite plane\u201d in his mouth \u201call night long.\u201d If he does not wear it his mouth \u201cis paralyzed\u201d when he gets up in the morning. His mouth and teeth have \u201cshifted.\u201d He has to exercise his mouth several times a day to keep it \u201clubricated.\u201d When he talks, eats or drinks he hears a \u201csquishing\u201d or \u201cclicking\u201d sound. He has \u201ctremendous\u201d headaches on the left side of his head. He cannot sleep in a bed. He has to sleep in a reclining chair. He takes pills for his dizziness. He cannot sit or stand \u201ctoo long.\u201d He has limited movement in his neck and arms.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">In addition to his physical complaints, petitioner described the psychological pressure which he felt from the continuing threats against him and his family\u2019s safety emanating from his many years of police work exposing criminal activities. His wife corroborated his physical complaints. She also described the threatening telephone calls received and petitioner\u2019s excessive fears for the safety of himself and his family, and concluded that \u201c[h]e is totally neurotic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">Dr. Robert E. Green, a neurosurgeon, Dr. David J. Flicker, a psychiatrist and neurologist, Dr. Patrick J. Strollo, a dentist, and Dr. Robert E. McCutcheon, a chiropractor, testified on behalf of petitioner. Dr. Green gave Toma a neurological examination on December 26, 1975. At that time he reviewed a record of petitioner\u2019s work-connected injuries. His diagnosis was: a chronic herniated lumbar disk (L 5 S 1), cervical myositis, radiculitis and an injured left temporal mandibular joint. In his opinion petitioner was totally and permanently disabled from performing his duties as a police officer, and his condition \u201cwill not improve or change significantly.\u201d He concluded that this disability resulted from the cumulative effect of all of Toma\u2019s work-connected injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Dr. Flicker conducted a psychiatric and neurological examination of petitioner on May 27, 1977. He concluded that Toma \u201cwas unmistakably a psychoneurotic,\u201d that he \u201chad been one for many years,\u201d and that \u201chis condition was probably worsening.\u201d He \u201cthought there were some elements of early decompensation,\u201d a loss of ability to function \u2014 here, a disabling stage of nervousness and anxiety. He further concluded that petitioner is permanently and totally disabled from functioning as a police officer, and that his total work experience as a police officer brought about his neurosis. He attributed petitioner\u2019s mental disability to the psychological effects of his many on-the-job injuries. He thought Toma \u201chad the neurotic problem most of his life,\u201d and that it was \u201cbrought to a head by police work,\u201d /. e., his \u201cdoing undercover work\u201d and being \u201cconstantly exposed to a pattern of pressure and tension.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">Dr. Strollo saw Toma on October 11, 1968, the day after the violent attack upon him at the diner. He found traumatic injuries of the maxilla and mand\u00edbula. The \u201clower denture was distorted beyond repair and there was a fracture of the lower right molar and a dislocation of the upper left temporal mandibular joint.\u201d At the time of the Division hearing on July 20, 1977 petitioner was still undergoing treatment for the effects of the injuries. Dr. Strollo concluded that Toma has \u201ca chronic arthritic condition of the upper left mandibular joint,\u201d a \u201cpermanent disorder,\u201d which prevents him from fully opening or closing his mouth, and that this condition is a direct result of the October 10, 1968 injuries and is likely to get worse.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">Dr. McCutcheon described his periodic treatment of petitioner from March 22, 1969, when Toma complained of low back pain after he moved furniture at the Newark Police Department. Based upon his then most recent examination of August 23, 1977 Dr. McCutcheon concluded that Toma was permanently and totally disabled \u201c[bjecause of the unstable low back condition that he has and has experienced now for eight years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>Dr. William Kruger, an orthopedic surgeon who examined Toma on November 12, 1975, was the sole medical expert to testify on behalf of respondent Board. His diagnosis .was that petitioner \u201chad a sprain or contusion of his left shoulder and may have a sprain of his lower back.\u201d On the basis of a hypothetical question incorporating medical reports and hospital records in the case, it was his opinion that Toma \u201cwas able to perform the duties of a police officer,\u201d either as \u201ca detective or as a regular patrolman.\u201d He did not \u201cfeel that the situation was that bad that he [petitioner] could not function.\u201d He made it clear, however, that he was referring to \u201corthopedic symptoms\u201d only and had not gone \u201cinto the question of his [petitioner\u2019s] physical and mental or dental problems.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Hubert Williams, the Police Director of the Newark Police Department, also testified on behalf of the Board. He said that Toma \u201cwas a good detective in the Police Department\u201d and that \u201che specialized basically in gambling enforcement and he worked through investigations and a larger per cent of his time was spent doing undercover work.\u201d He also said that \u201cthere is work available in the Community Relations Bureau\u201d of the Department.that Toma could do and, additionally, \u201cthere is a new Decoy and Disguise Unit\u201d in the Department \u201cand there are functions there that he can perform.\u201d He listed, as functions which petitioner could perform: \u201cLecturing, advising, counseling, assisting,\u201d and \u201cprogram management.\u201d The remainder of the proofs was documentary in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">The hearing officer who presided at petitioner\u2019s administrative appeal found, among other things: that \u201c[petitioner is permanently and totally disabled from performing any duties whatever as a police officer\u201d; that his disability \u201cis not directly, proximately and causally related to the alleged traumatic events in question, but rather is the cumulative result of both the injuries suffered in the work incidents, psychiatric sequelae and progressive deterioration\u201d; that he \u201chas failed to prove by a preponderance of the credible evidence a work event or events <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>directly resulting in permanent and total disability, directly related to or directly resulting from the performance of his regular or assigned duties as specified in N.J.S.A. 43 16A 7,\u201d and that he \u201cmeets all the requisites of an ordinary disability retirement allowance.\u201d He recommended that the decision of the Board of Trustees denying petitioner\u2019s application for accidental disability retirement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A 7 be affirmed. He further recommended that petitioner be granted an ordinary disability retirement under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A 6. The Board adopted the hearing officer\u2019s findings and conclusions, approved his recommendations, and affirmed the denial of petitioner\u2019s application. This belated appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">The applicable statute, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A 7, provides in pertinent part in paragraph (1), that a member of the retirement system in service may, upon written application,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-6\">. be retired on an accidental disability retirement allowance; provided, that the medical board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that the member is permanently and totally disabled as a direct result of a traumatic event occurring during and as a result of the performance of his regular or assigned duties and that such disability was not the result of the member\u2019s willful negligence and that such member is mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of his usual duty and of any other available duty in the department which his employer is willing to assign to him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">In <em>Cattani v. Police &amp; Firemen\u2019s Retirem. Sys. Bd. of Trustees, </em>69 <em>N.J. </em>578 (1976), the court pointed out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b111-9\">Trauma has been defined as \u201ca wound; any injury to the body caused by external violence.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, </em>(4 e&lt;l. 1951); see also, <em>Schmidt\u2019s Attorneys\u2019 Dictionary of Medicine </em>(1975). The phrase \u201ctraumatic event\u201d would ordinarily involve a mishap or accident involving the application of some kind of external force to the body or the violent exposure of the body to some external force. See 42A <em>Words and Phrases, Trauma; Traumatic, </em>p. 3 (4 Ed. 1951). [at 586]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">It was recognized, however, that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>a traumatic event may possibly be found in some situations which do not literally fall within the external force or violence concept but still might be regarded as having traumatic origin [and that] a basis for an accidental disability pension would exist if it were shown that the disability directly resulted from the combined effect of a traumatic event and a preexisting disease, [id.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">Here, it is apparent from the proofs, and the hearing officer virtually conceded, that each of the on-the-job incidents of April 10, 1959, September 24, 1960, December 22, 1961, October 10, 1968 and September 16, 1971, was a \u201ctraumatic event\u201d as that term is used in the statute and construed in <em>Gattani, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>See <em>In re Iannelli, </em>157 <em>N.J.Super. </em>324 (App.Div. 1978), certif. den. 77 <em>N.J. </em>488 (1978). We note that while the hearing officer properly concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-6\">. [petitioner, in his] present condition is less than a mere shadow or shell of his former seif, the core and substance having been decayed and withered by repeated injuries, trauma, physical abuse and perhaps most significantly by the mental, neurological, psychological and psychiatric effects of the cumulative effect of torturous pain and the emotional repercussions of the horrors associated with his constabulary duties [;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>he clearly was mistaken in his interpretation and application of the relevant principles of law. Thus we are convinced that where, as here, the evidence demonstrates that the member\u2019s permanent and total disability has been directly brought on by a combination of traumatic events occurring during and as a result of his performance of his regular or assigned duties, and \u201cwas not the result of the member\u2019s willful negligence\u201d the statutory criteria are satisfied even though the precise contributory role of each event separately may be uncertain. We so hold. Petitioner is, accordingly, entitled to an accidental disability retirement allowance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>43:16A 7.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b112-8\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>In light of the conclusive persuasiveness of the medical testimony as to the totality and permanency of Petitioner\u2019s disability, it necessarily follows that Petitioner is unable to perform any police functions whatever for or on behalf of the Police Department of the City of Newark [;]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The determination of the Board of Trustees under review is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Board with direction that petitioner be awarded an accidental disability retirement allowance. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b106-11\">It appears that petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal to this court was filed well beyond the time limited therefor by <em>R. </em>2:4 1(b). By letter of March 27, 1978 to petitioner\u2019s then attorneys, with copy thereof to petitioner, the Chief of the Police and Fire Bureau of the Board gave notice of the Board\u2019s final administrative determination in the matter. It was not until December 6, 1978 that petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal was filed with the clerk of this court by his present attorney. No application for extension of time to file had been made under <em>R. </em>2:4- 4(a). We disapprove of this disregard of the pertinent rules of court. We note, however, that respondent, although mentioning the late filing, does not challenge the timeliness of the appeal. In the circumstances, and since we perceive substantial merit in the appeal, we proceed as if the appeal had been timely filed. <em>R. </em>1:1 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Respondent does not question the timeliness of petitioner\u2019s application and, from our review of the record, we perceive no basis for petitioner\u2019s apparent concern in regard to that matter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b112-9\"> Of the four events found by the hearing officer to be nontraumatic, we are satisfied that two were definitely traumatic, <em>viz., </em>the July 1967 incident when Toma fell and dangled by his foot from a fire escape while trying to avoid being shot in the Newark riots, and the May 1961 laceration of his left hand which occurred while he was assisting in the removal of a sick person on a stretcher to an ambulance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
