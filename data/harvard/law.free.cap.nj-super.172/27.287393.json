A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Tried to a jury, defendant was found guilty of assault and battery upon a police officer, in violation of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:90 4(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On the conviction, he was sentenced to the Hudson County Penitentiary for a period of 18 months. The execution of 12 months of the term was suspended and he was ordered to be placed on probation for a period of two years following completion of service of the six months \u201cbalance\u201d of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">On this appeal, defendant\u2019s single contention is that it was plain error for the trial judge to have denied his motion for a judgment of acquittal at the close of the State\u2019s case since the State failed to establish that the victim was a law enforcement officer acting in the performance of his duties. He maintains that although the victim, Patrolman Donald Verney of the Jersey City Police Department, was wearing his Jersey City Police uniform at the time of the assault and battery, he was \u201cnot formally on duty\u201d since \u201che was acting as a private security guard, being paid by the promoters of the rock concert which had been scheduled that day\u201d in Roosevelt Stadium. On the night in question, Officer Verney was patrolling the main gate of the stadium. He had been assigned to this off-duty job by his superior, the captain of his police precinct, after volunteering for the work. Police officers were required for that assignment. Those Jersey City officers who volunteered to work at the stadium during the rock concert were assigned to the task by the city, /. e., upon approval by the police captain\u2014 the only distinction between this job and the officers\u2019 regular employment being that the individual who requested the police protection, the promoter of the rock concert, rather than the city, was paying for the service. Defendant argues, in essence, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>that this distinction removes the police officer victim from the category of a law enforcement officer acting in the performance of his duty. He claims that Verney \u201cwas acting as a privately paid security guard\u201d at the time and that his (defendant\u2019s) \u201cconduct in the case at bar\u201d could constitute nothing more than a simple assault and battery.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">We have considered defendant\u2019s contention and the argument advanced in support of it in our review of the record submitted on the appeal. We find the issue raised by defendant to be clearly without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Here, there is ample evidence in the record to support a finding of defendant\u2019s guilt of the crime charged in the indictment, beyond a reasonable doubt. The conditions prescribed in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:90 4(a) were met. Thus, (1) Officer Verney, a municipal police officer, was in uniform at the time; (2) he was exhibiting evidence of his authority and (3) he was acting in the performance of his duty as a law enforcement officer when the assault and battery took place.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See State v. States, </em>44 <em>N.J. </em>285, 291 (1965). As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Jasaitis v. Paterson, </em>31 <em>N.J. </em>81 (1959):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">. the [police] uniform has the same significance to the public whether the wearer is technically on or off duty. in such a situation [the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">municipality] and its public expect and obtain real benefits from [the police officer], [at 85]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\"><em>See, also, State v. Coleman, </em>224 <em>Kan. </em>447, 580 P.2d 1329 (Sup.Ct.1978), and cases cited therein. There, the court was called upon to determine the propriety of defendant Coleman\u2019s conviction for aggravated battery upon a law enforcement officer <em>(K.S.A. </em>21 3415), in light of defendant\u2019s claim that the statute did not apply \u201cto a battery committed upon an off-duty police officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>employed as a private security guard.\u201d 580 P.2d at 1331. At the time of the incident, the victim of the attack, Officer Fuson, \u201cwho commonly worked as a full-time police officer for the city of Wichita,\u201d was working during off-hours as a part-time employee at a Woolco department store. <em>Id., </em>at 1330. He was employed by the store \u201cto look for and apprehend shoplifters.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330 1331. Under the Kansas statute, <em>K.S.A. </em>21 3415:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">Aggravated battery against a law enforcement officer is an aggravated battery, as defined in section 21-3414, committed against a uniformed or properly Identified state, county, or city law enforcement officer while such officer is engaged in the performance of his duty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">Aggravated battery against a law enforcement officer is a class B felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In affirming the conviction the Supreme Court of Kansas concluded that \u201cunder the factual circumstances in the case, officer Fuson was engaged in the performance of his duty as a law enforcement officer at the time the aggravated battery was committed against him by the defendant.\u201d 580 P.2d at 1333. It pointed out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">Here the aggravated battery occurred after the police officer had identified himself as such and while the officer was in the process of arresting the defendant for a crime committed in the officer\u2019s presence. We hold that a police officer who is working during his off-duty hours as a part-time store employee in detecting and apprehending shoplifters, who observes a customer secreting merchandise on his person, who identifies himself as a police officer to the customer outside the store, and who advises the customer that he is under arrest for shoplifting, is a law enforcement officer \u201cengaged in the performance of his duty\u201d within the provisions of K.S.A. 21 3415. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">The conviction and sentence under review are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b56-7\">This statute was repealed by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:98 2, part of the New Jersey Code of Criminal Justice, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1 1 et <em>seq., </em>effective September I, 1979.
