A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">On December 16, 1975 a fire occurred in the auditorium of Wayne Hills High School, a facility operated by plaintiff-appellant Board of Education of Wayne Township. Property damage in the alleged amount of $985,230.46 resulted. This suit was filed on May 23, 1978 seeking damages against various parties who allegedly contributed to the loss by their negligence or defective workmanship during the design, manufacture or construction stages relevant to the installation of the dimmer panel for the auditorium stage completed in 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-11\">This appeal is taken from a summary judgment in favor of Walter J. Kidde &amp; Co., Inc. (Kidde), defendant-respondent. The claim of liability against Kidde was premised on its alleged ownership and control of a subsidiary, Century Lighting, Inc. (Century), which allegedly participated in the design and manufacture of the dimmer panel and its electrical components. Plaintiff\u2019s purported expert, electrical engineer R. W. Persons, had submitted reports implicating both the design of the dimmer panel and the method of manufacture as causative of the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-12\">For the purpose of the summary judgment only, Kidde stipulated that it \u201cdesigned, manufactured and sold the dimmer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>panel\u201d involved in the fire. The trial judge concluded that the dimmer panel, a unit approximately 2' X 7' X 13', weighing between 6,000 and 8,000 pounds and wired to operate the diverse stage systems and the projection room of the new auditorium, was an \u201cimprovement to real estate\u201d within the applicable statute of repose, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 l.l.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge was correct in this ruling. The dimmer panel was an integral part of the permanent electrical system of the auditorium and was \u201crequired for the structure to actually function as intended.\u201d <em>Brown v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>163 <em>N.J.Super. </em>179, 195 (App.Div.1978), certif. den. 79 <em>N.J. </em>489 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">Alternately, plaintiff contends that Kidde was a manufacturer only and did not participate in the design stage. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.1 affords the ten-year time-bar from date of completion of performance or furnishing of services to any persons \u201cperforming or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of such improvement to real property.\u201d The history and purpose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1.1 was explored carefully by Justice Mountain in <em>Rosenberg v. North Bergen Tp., </em>61 <em>N.J. </em>190 (1972), a case in which the statute was held applicable to a road-paving contractor. The statute was clearly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>a legislative response to the judicial adoption of the so-called \u201cdiscovery\u201d rule and abrogation of the so-called \u201ccompleted and accepted\u201d rule to tort claims arising from construction of improvements to real estate. <em>Id. </em>at 196 197. With respect to the scope of the statutorily protected class the Supreme Court commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">Viewed in this context the statute should be given a broader sweep than was accorded to it by the Appellate Division. If the condition to which the Legislature addressed itself was this extension of potential liability, then there seems no reason not to include within the favor of the statute all to whom this condition may adhere whether they be planners and builders of structures, roads, playing fields or aught else that by broad definition can be deemed \u201can improvement to real property.\" We prefer to read the statute, consonant with what we thus judge to have been the legislative intent, as applying to all who can, by a sensible reading of the words of the act, be brought within its ambit. We therefore conclude that the statute does apply to the facts of this case. [Id. at 198]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-6\">For convenience we have referred to the beneficiaries of this legislation as architects and building contractors. But the favored class is much larger. It includes \u201cany person performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of such improvement to real property.\u201d We do not attempt at this time to enumerate all of the classes of persons coming within this statutory group. These might include, as examples only, the designer of a sewage plant for a development complex, a landscape gardener or a well driller. We can find here no such exclusion from the class as to justify a determination that this is a special law coming within the prohibition of our state Constitution. [Id. at 201]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">See, <em>also, O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Altus, </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>106, 121 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In the present complaint plaintiff alleged that Kidde \u201cengaged in the business of designing, manufacturing and selling stage lighting and dimmer panels\u201d and that Kidde \u201cdesigned, manufactured and sold to plaintiff\u201d the stage lighting and dimmer panel which caused the fire. On the successful motion to dismiss because of the time-bar by the other defendants, which constituted the record for the appeal before us, the judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>considered an affidavit filed by Century Lighting, Inc., respondent\u2019s-alleged subsidiary and the conduit for its liability, which states that the \u201cdimmer panel was designed, planned and constructed by Century Lighting, Inc., according to specifications by Barnickel Engineering Corp. [the electrical engineer engaged by plaintiff\u2019s architect] and modifications by Knight Electric Co., Inc. [the prime electrical contractor].\u201d An affidavit filed by Barnickel\u2019s principal alleged that the electrical engineer designed the electrical system for the auditorium, including the dimmer panel component pursuant to assignment from Flatt and Pool, architects.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">The problem as we perceive it is the ambiguity lurking in the word \u201cdesign\u201d in this context. Clearly, the language and history of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1.1 manifests a legislative intent to extend the ten-year time-bar to those engaged in the design, planning and construction of improvements to real estate only. The statute was not intended to benefit manufacturers and sellers of products who were uninvolved in the design, planning and construction of improvements to real estate. Product-design alone is not enough to trigger the applicability of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1.1. <em>See Ramirez </em>v. <em>Amsted Industries, </em>171 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 277 n. 2 (App.Div.1979) (17 states had adopted special products liability statutes of limitations at that time); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Jersey Central Light &amp; Power, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 195. Any attempt to legislate statutes <em>o\u00ed </em>repose more favorable for those exposed to product liability hazards than the presently applicable statutes, which permit suit within six-years of the \u201caccrual\u201d of property damage <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1), or within two-years of the \u201caccrual\u201d of personal injury <em>(N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 2), has to date been unsuccessful in New Jersey.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At least one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>pending bill, Senate Bill 269 (1978), limiting the time for suit against a vendor or manufacturer to six years from date of purchase or ten years from the date of manufacture, failed passage during the last session of the Legislature, which adjourned early this year. See Note, 32 <em>Rutgers L.Rev. </em>21, 60 61, n. 364 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">We conclude that if Kidde, or its subsidiary for whose conduct plaintiff alleges Kidde is legally responsible, participated to any extent in the design and planning stages of the lighting system and dimmer panel, as fabricated and installed in plaintiff\u2019s auditorium, it is entitled to the repose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 -1.1. If, however, Kidde merely sold a stock or shelf item out of its regular inventory or fabricated a product as designed and specified by the electrical engineer or the electrical contractor for this project it was not within the repose of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1.1. We are satisfied that the Legislature did not intend <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14 1.1 to extend repose to the designers and manufacturers of all products or suppliers of materials which ultimately found their way into improvements to real estate. Implication in the design and planning stage of the improvement to realty itself or of integral component thereof, not mere design of a fungible product or fabrication of a product from specifications which product is later incorporated in the building, is required.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">The record before us is unclear on the nature and extent, if any, of Kidde\u2019s actual participation in the design phase for the electrical components of the auditorium addition. Especially in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>view of the apparent novelty of the question, we conclude that the record is not free of any genuine issue of material fact and that respondent Kidde was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law. The record should be further developed. <em>R. </em>4:46 2; <em>Jackson v. Muhlenberg Hospital, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>138, 142 (1969); <em>McGowan v. Eatontown, </em>151 <em>N.J.Super. </em>440, 446 (App.Div.1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">We therefore reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction. We wish to emphasize that we take no position on Kidde\u2019s legal liability for any acts of its alleged subsidiary, Century Lighting, Inc. That issue is not before us.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b328-5\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:14-1.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">No action whether in contract, in tort, or otherwise to recover damages for any deficiency in the design, planning, supervision or construction of an improvement to real property, or for any injury to property, real or personal, or for an injury to the person, or for bodily injury or wrongful death, arising out of the defective and unsafe condition of an improvement to real property, nor any action for contribution or indemnity for damages sustained on account of such injury, shall be brought against any person performing or furnishing the design, planning, supervision of construction or construction of such improvement to real property, more than 10 years after the performance or furnishing of such services and construction. This limitation shall not apply to any person in actual possession and control as owner, tenant, or otherwise, of the improvement at the time the defective and unsafe condition of such improvement constitutes the proximate cause of the injury or damage for which the action is brought.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Under these statutes a claimant\u2019s cause of action does not \u201caccrue\u201d until the injury or damage occurs and the claimant learns, or reasonably should have learned, of the existence of that state of facts which may equate in law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>with a cause of action. <em>Burd </em>v. <em>New Jersey Tel. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J. </em>284, 291 (1978); <em>Rosenau v. New Brunswick, </em>51 <em>N.J. </em>130 (1968). The manufacturer\u2019s liability under these statutes is theoretically without time limit during the life of the product.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b331-8\"> <em>E. g., </em>in <em>Carter v. Hartenstein, </em>248 <em>Ark. </em>1172, 455 S.<em>W.2d </em>918 (Sup.Ct.1970), the court held that a similar statute of repose applied to a defendant who manufactured and installed an elevator in an office building. In <em>Reeves v. We Electric Co., </em>170 <em>Mont. </em>104, 551 P.2d 647 (Sup.Ct.1976), the court held that the manufacturer of a whirlpool machine installed in the State University field house was not within the statute of repose.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
