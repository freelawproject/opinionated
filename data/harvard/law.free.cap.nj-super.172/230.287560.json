To the contrary, the documents involved here are comprised solely of the medical records of defendant and the police report. It is apparent that defendant is entitled to see the copies of those records in the possession of the pretrial intervention director, and on which he presumably relied in making his recommendation, to ascertain that in fact those documents truly reflect the actual records of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>medical history and activity. Although it is not suggested that such is the case here, it may readily be conceived of a situation where the record in the possession of the pretrial intervention director was a false copy of the true record. It is in the interest of both the State and the defendant that the actual records be used in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">In any event, Judge Meredith very carefully provided for a protective order in the event that any sensitive matters might be included in those things sought for by defendant. In affirming the Law Division we do not suggest that there is a wholesale right to discovery in a defendant who applies to a pretrial intervention program.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
