We hold that such an addition is improper and that interest runs only from the date of the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-14\">The plaintiff was injured in a motor vehicle accident on August 10, 1984. After receiving $110,000 from the operators\u2019 insurance carriers, he brought, on July 18, 1988, an action in the Superior Court against the defendant seeking arbitration of his claim for underinsurance benefits. By agreement<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the matter went to arbitration, and on May 19, 1989, the arbitrator awarded the plaintiff $33,000 \u201cin addition to all other monies he has received to date.\u201d Neither the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>arbitration agreement nor the award mentioned interest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The award was paid on June 1, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">Thereafter, on June 21, 1989, the plaintiff filed a motion in the Superior Court to confirm the award and to enter judgment with costs and with interest from July 18, 1988, the date of the filing of the complaint seeking appointment of an arbitrator. A judgment entered confirming the award, allowing interest from July 18, 1988, to June 1, 1989, the date the award was paid, and also allowing costs except for the plaintiffs portion of the arbitrator\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In this appeal the defendant challenges the portion of the judgment which awards interest. There are two periods involved: the pre-award period, July 18, 1988 - May 18, 1989, and the period between the award and payment, May 19, 1989, to June 1, 1989. The motion judge, relying on G. L, c. 251, \u00a7 14,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> confirmed the award and ordered contractual interest to be paid for both periods.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">1. <em>Pre-award interest. </em>As pointed out in <em>Blue Hills Regional Dist. Sch. Comm. </em>v. <em>Flight, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 459, 472 (1980), <em>S.C., </em>383 Mass. 642 (1981):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b687-8\">\u201cProvisions of law applicable to judicial actions and proceedings do not necessarily apply to arbitrations. Parties who submit their controversies to arbitration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>forgo those provisions and leave all questions of law and fact to the arbitrators. The right to interest involves questions of fact and law that are within the purview of the arbitrators.\u201d[<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>] See <em>Penco Fabrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bogopulsky, </em>1 A.D.2d 659 (N.Y. 1955).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">In the <em>Blue Hills </em>case we held that an arbitrator\u2019s award of interest \u201cis not subject to the statutory provisions which apply to court awarded interest on contract claims.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>In <em>Coughlan Constr. Co. </em>v. <em>Rockport, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 994, 997 (1987), citing the <em>Blue Hills </em>case, we rejected the plaintiff\u2019s claim to pre-award interest under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6C, where an arbitrator\u2019s award for damages under a contract made no award of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">There is sound reason for differentiating between arbitration awards and judicial proceedings with respect to interest:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">\u201cThe parties selected arbitrators, rather than a court, as the body that would, in the first instance, determine the amount due. This they had a right to do; this the law encourages them to do. It should be the rule, rather than the exception, that when arbitrators hand down an award the parties will comply with it, <em>without the necessity of court proceedings, </em>just as it is (or should be) the normal or usual result that parties comply with a judgment, without the necessity of resort to process or appeal.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) <em>Lundgren </em>v. <em>Freeman, </em>307 F. 2d 104, 112 (9th Cir. 1962).* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">If the silence of an arbitrator\u2019s award as to interest entitles the party obtaining a monetary award to claim interest under the interest provisions of G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 6B, 6C, or 6H, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>coming into court to confirm an award \u2014 in this case one already paid \u2014 the purpose of avoiding court proceedings is vitiated. That important purpose is better served by considering, in the absence of an explicit agreement to the contrary, pre-award damage claims, including interest, to have been submitted to arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Authority elsewhere supports our view that pre-award interest should not be ordered by a court. See, e.g., <em>Creative Builders, Inc. </em>v. <em>Avenue Devs., Inc., </em>148 Ariz. 452, 456 (Ct. App. 1986); <em>Wanschura </em>v. <em>Western Natl. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>389 N.W.2d 927, 928 (Minn. Ct. App. 1986); <em>Rivers </em>v. <em>General Acc. Group, </em>192 N.J. Super. 355, 359-360 (App. Div. 1983); <em>Penco Fabrics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bogopulsky, </em>1 A.D.2d at 659; <em>Paola </em>v. <em>Commerical Union Assur. Co., </em>461 A.2d 935, 937 (R.I. 1983); <em>Kermacy </em>v. <em>First Unitarian Church, </em>361 S.W.2d 734, 735 (Tex. Civ. App. 1962); <em>R.E. Bean Constr.

App. 1, 5-6 (1971), a case criticized in a concurring opinion in <em>Old Orchard By The Bay Assocs. </em>v. <em>Hamilton Mut. Ins. Co., </em>434 Mich. 244, 270 &amp; n.9 (1990) (Levin, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">2. <em>Post-award interest. </em>To encourage \u201cswift obedience\u201d to the award without the necessity of court proceedings, the rule in Massachusetts is that post-award interest runs from the date of the award.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Watertown Firefighters, Local 1347 </em>v. <em>Watertown, </em>376 Mass. 706, 717-719 (1978). <em>Coughlan Constr.

App. Ct. 558, 577 (1986), comparing <em>Glenn Acres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Cliffwood Corp., </em>353 Mass. 150, 156 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Accordingly, the judgment entered on October 31, 1989, is modified by striking all provision for interest other than that applicable to the post-award period, May 19, 1989, to June 1, 1989, the date the award was paid; and, as so modified, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b686-15\"> The agreement stated \u201cwhereas the Claimant and the Insurer are in disagreement as to liability and/or damages for which the Insurer may be liable,\u201d they agree that Paul G.
