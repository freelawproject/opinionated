On appeal, he challenges the denial of his motion to suppress evidence seized during a warrantless search of his automobile.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The facts found by the judge, supplemented by undisputed testimony given at the motion hearing, are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-14\">On February 3, 1988, an unidentified informant told Springfield police oEcer Paul Harvey that the informant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>could probably purchase cocaine from the defendant at the defendant\u2019s residence at 1302 Bay Street in Springfield. The informant had spoken of the defendant to Officer Harvey as a possible source of cocaine three or four weeks previously. The informant was authorized to make a purchase. He attempted to do so at noon that day, accompanied by an undercover police officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">The informant and the undercover officer returned immediately after attempting to make the purchase, and reported to Officer Harvey that they had been unsuccessful. They informed him further that they had information (from an unidentified source) that the defendant had gone to New York City and would be returning in the early afternoon, probably before three o\u2019clock. He would be accompanied by a Hispanic male who was planning to set up a cocaine distribution system. The second man was described as having a dark mustache and beard, and being from New York City. They would be transporting cocaine in the defendant\u2019s automobile. The police had previously learned the license plate number and the color of the defendant\u2019s automobile, a silver-colored \u201cMonte Carlo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">Thereafter, police officers set up a surveillance along Interstate 91 (I 91), the main route between New York City and Springfield. Shortly before one o\u2019clock in the afternoon, they spotted the defendant\u2019s automobile traveling north on I 91 near Enfield, Connecticut. Several unmarked police cars followed it north on I 91 and then on I 291. The police officers had expected the automobile to travel to the defendant\u2019s Bay Street address. Instead, it took the Armory Street exit off I 291. The automobile was stopped on the exit ramp because it appeared that it was not going to Bay Street and because it was a safe spot for a stop. The defendant was driving and he had a male passenger.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">The motion judge found that the facts established at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress probably did not satisfy the <em>Aguilar-Spinelli</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>test for probable cause. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>held, however, that they reached the \u201clevel of reliability\u201d sufficient to justify an investigatory stop and that the seizure of evidence had been proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\u201c[T]he ultimate legal conclusion to be drawn from the fact[s] developed at the hearing [on the motion to suppress] is a matter for our review, particularly where the conclusion is of constitutional dimension.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. 110, 113 (1988), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Accaputo, </em>380 Mass. 435, 448 n. 18 (1980). We employ the analysis required by the Supreme Judicial Court in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. 16, 19 (1990), to determine whether the police had sufficient reliable information to justify stopping the defendant\u2019s automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">A police officer may make an investigatory stop of an automobile only if the Commonwealth can prove that the officer \u201chas a reasonable suspicion that the occupants have committed, are committing, or are about to commit a crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra, </em>quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wren, </em>391 Mass. 705, 707 (1984). \u201cTo meet the \u2018reasonable suspicion\u2019 standard in this Commonwealth, police action must be \u2018based on specific, articulable facts and reasonable inferences therefrom\u2019 rather than on a \u2018hunch.\u2019 Thus, if the police conduct an investigatory stop based on an informant\u2019s tip, our evaluation of the tip\u2019s indicia of reliability will be focused on the informant\u2019s reliability and his or her basis of knowledge. Independent police corroboration may make up for deficiencies in one or both of these factors. Because the standard is reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause, a less rigorous showing in each of these areas is permissible.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>(Citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-7\">Here, the police relied on information given by an unnamed informant and an undercover police officer. As to the informant, Officer Harvey, the sole witness at the suppression hearing, provided no information concerning either his reliability or his basis of knowledge that the defendant sold drugs from his home. That aspect of the tip was not corroborated in any respect, as the attempted purchase was not successful. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, supra </em>at 115. Cf. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number><em>Commonwealth v. Nowells, </em>390 Mass. 621, 624-627 (1983). The tip, therefore, contributed nothing to the development of reasonable suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">This leaves the subsequent information relayed to Harvey by the informant and the undercover police officer, along with any independent corroboration, as the only bases by which we may determine whether the reasonable suspicion standard was met. The information relayed to Harvey by the informant and the undercover officer on return from the defendant\u2019s home was that the defendant had gone to New York City and would be driving to his home in the early afternoon, accompanied by a Hispanic man with a beard and mustache who planned to start a cocaine distribution ring, and that the defendant would be transporting cocaine. There was no evidence of the original source of that information and, consequently, nothing by which to measure reliability. No information was provided concerning the basis of knowledge of the source. The information did not rise to the level required to meet the reasonable suspicion standard. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. at 17, 20 (Anonymous caller\u2019s tip that two white men, one named Wayne, had just purchased narcotics in Chelsea and would be heading for Bridgton, Maine, in a silver Hyundai automobile with Maine registration 440-44T did not establish reasonable suspicion to stop defendant\u2019s automobile). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>366 Mass. 394, 399-400 (1974) (Contents of anonymous informant\u2019s note describing a bus passenger and stating that he was armed and carrying narcotics implied that the informant had obtained the information through personal observation; taken together with independent police corroboration of the defendant\u2019s description and suspicious behavior, an investigatory stop was justified); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blake, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 456, 457-459 (1987) (\u201cA detailed tip [describing the defendant\u2019s drug dealing, based on personal observation], confirmed by the appearance of the car as predicted, at roughly the indicated place, moving in the \u2018right\u2019 direction, surely provided the reasonable and articulable suspicion that justified a threshold inquiry\u201d); <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, </em>26 Mass. App. Ct. at 115 (One of two confidential informants had previously provided information leading to the arrest and conviction of both defendants on heroin charges, the two independently corroborated each other, and police surveillance confirmed the tips in significant predictive respects).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Since no information was introduced indicating either the reliability or the basis of knowledge of the source of information as to the New York City trip, we look to the degree of independent police corroboration to \u201cmake up for [these] deficiencies.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>409 Mass. at 19. Police corroboration consisted of spotting the defendant\u2019s automobile on the main road from New York to Springfield during the time period predicted. That corroboration was weakened by the fact that when the police stopped the defendant\u2019s automobile, it was not headed in the direction of his apartment, as the tip had led the police to expect. In this case, as in <em>Lyons, </em>the corroborative \u201cdetails do not reveal any special familiarity with the defendant [\u2019s] affairs that might substitute for explicit information about the basis of the [informant\u2019s] knowledge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyons, supra </em>at 20 (Independent police verification of the description of the defendant\u2019s automobile, the direction in which it was going, and the race and gender of the occupants was insufficient to justify a stop where the anonymous informant\u2019s tip provided no information concerning his reliability or basis of knowledge). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ciaramitaro, supra </em>at 112, 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Because the information given to the police, together with police corroboration, could not give rise to a reasonable suspicion that the defendant had committed, was committing, or was about to commit a crime, the stop of his automobile was improper. The motion to suppress should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">Accordingly, the judgment is reversed, the verdict is set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a finding of not guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number><em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 296-297 (1979).
