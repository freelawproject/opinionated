Early in 1985, the plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>tiff undertook the construction of a new building with fifty lodging rooms and an exercise room and, in the existing complex, the renovation and enlargement of \u201cfunction rooms.\u201d On March 25 and June 19, 1985, the plaintiff obtained from the town building inspector permits, respectively, for the new building, with an estimated cost of $650,000, and for the rest, with a $450,000 estimated cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Now the plaintiff had to take care to meet the regulations of the defendant Architectural Access Board<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> dealing with the accessibility of public premises to handicapped persons.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The constitutive statute, G. L. c. 22, \u00a7 13A, as appearing in St. 1974, c. 528, \u00a7 1, directs the board to ensure that \u201cconstruction, reconstruction, alteration or remodeling\u201d of buildings is done in a way to provide accessibility. While existing structures generally are exempt, the regulations assume \u201cjurisdiction\u201d over them if major renovation or expansion takes place. 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(3.3) (1982). Specifically, there is a twenty-five percent rule: if the cost of the construction work involved \u201camounts to more than twenty-five .percent (25%) of the one-hundred percent (100%) equalized assessed value of the building [meaning existing buildings], the entire facility shall comply\u201d \u2014 in the case of a hotel, with a requirement that five percent of rooms shall be \u201caccessible.\u201d See 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 3.00(3.3), (7.1)-(7.5) (1982).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">To return to the plaintiff, on July 9, 1985, it wrote to the board requesting approval of the plan to make accessible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>only four of the fifty rooms in the new building; it considered the twenty-five percent rule to be inapplicable. Evidently the plaintiff misunderstood what was entailed in that rule, for it submitted an architect\u2019s letter about \u201careas\u201d without data about assessed values. At a meeting with a board employee on March 5, 1986, the plaintiff was mistakenly citing the 1984 purchase price as relevant. When the board employee pointed to the criterion of assessed value, the plaintiff responded in a letter of March 6, 1986, stating that it would secure assessment figures from the town of Barnstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">Here began concern about which year\u2019s assessment of the existing buildings should apply. When, on May 1, 1986, the plaintiff wrote to the board requesting an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d (as allowed by 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 2.09, 3.00[4.5] [1982]) about application of the twenty-five percent rule, it noted an assessed value of $4,945,000 on January 1, 1984,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> but then went on to use the 1984 purchase price, $8,250,000, as the base for comparison with the total low-bid price for the new work of $1,487,880.97, yielding eighteen percent. On May 8, 1986, the board advised the plaintiff that it rejected the purchase price comparison and that under the twenty-five percent rule the entire complex fell under the regulations.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The board reiterated its position in a letter of August 1, 1986.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">Replying on August 19, 1986, the plaintiff stated that it was awaiting issuance of the fiscal 1986 tax bills by the Barnstable tax assessor, as those bills would be based upon \u201cthe most recent property valuations and will include, we believe, the additional rooms.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Upon securing this information, the plaintiff said, it would determine whether \u201cthe [twenty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>five percent] equalized assessed value figure is applicable, and if so, we will proceed with a request for a variance,\u201d meaning a variance from the regulations, see 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00( 4.1) (1982). On December 29, 1986, the plaintiff wrote that it had received the 1986 tax bill, but, because it reflected a January 1, 1985, assessment, it would not submit that value to the board; instead, it would wait for the 1987 tax bill \u201cdue out the next two weeks\u201d and would submit that figure. This drew a board response repeating its conclusion and scheduling a hearing \u201cto discuss full compliance\u201d for March 9, 1987.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Denying the attorney\u2019s request to continue the hearing until the \u201c1986 Barnstable tax information becomes available\u201d (i.e., the January 1, 1986, valuation needed to compute the 1987 tax bill), the board proceeded at the appointed time to consider the plaintiff\u2019s challenge to the advisory opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Now the attorney said the 1987 tax bill was not really necessary;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the 1986 tax bill, computed as of January 1, 1985, was the proper reference; the low bid cost of approximately $1.5 million ($1,487,880.97 exactly, as noted above) was less than twenty-five percent of the newly computed assessed value of $6.2 million. After discussion, the board voted to reject this last proposal and to maintain its position that the relevant figure was $4,945,000, the most recent assessed value on record at the town assessor\u2019s office at the time the building permits were issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Attention then turned to deciding the cost of the new construction. The attorney argued that, from the full costs of the new work, as documented in the May 1, 1986, letter to the board, there should be subtracted those items not fitting the term \u201cconstruction,\u201d defined in 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(5.8) (1982), principally as \u201c[w]ork for which a building permit is required.\u201d Among the candidates for such sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>traction were costs for air conditioners, wallpaper, and \u201csite work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">This view seems at first to have been well received by board members, and one member made a motion in that sense. But another member then raised the question whether costs of the work directly related to the new construction, although not itself requiring a building permit, were to be subtracted. The chairperson said, \u201cIf we are going to start looking \u2014 we have always held what we\u2019re looking at is what the building permit says. I always look at the cost on the building permits, and I ask for what the square footage is because you want to get a sense of whether it\u2019s a reasonable amount of money.\u201d A member then argued that $1.5 million (approximately) was the proper figure because the plaintiff had provided it as the \u201ctotal construction price\u201d in the May 1, 1986, letter seeking the advisory opinion. This view prevailed, the pending motion being withdrawn. The board denied the attorney\u2019s motion for reconsideration. On May 20, 1987, the board issued its formal ruling: In applying the twenty-five percent rule, (i) the board takes \u201cthe assessed value recorded in the assessor\u2019s office at the time the building permit is taken out,\u201d here $4,945,000; (ii) as construction costs, the board in this case takes the submitted cost of $1,487,880.97. The twenty-five percent is thus exceeded, and the entire hotel must comply with regulations (meaning thirteen accessible rooms).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The plaintiff sought judicial review pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (see also 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00[4.4] [1982]), by the Superior Court, which summarily affirmed, and the plaintiff appeals to our court.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">1. <em>The assessment question. </em>The plaintiff contends that the board erred in using the January 1, 1984, assessment. Instead, says the plaintiff, the appropriate figure is the January 1, 1985, assessment, which was not publicly available until October, 1986, for this would better reflect the \u201cactual\u201d assessed value as of the time when the building permits were issued in March and June, 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>The regulations do not point clearly to that assessment which should control: they refer to the \u201c100% equalized assessed value of the building.\u201d 521 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 3.00(3.3) (1982). The board asserts, and we accept, that it has int\u00e9rpreted its regulations, and in practice has consistently applied them, as referring to the assessment of record at the date the building permit is issued. To some extent, it must be confessed, this is arbitrary; but so also is, and must be, the very figure twenty-five percent. The board\u2019s practice has the virtue of easy identification of the figure and easy access to it. It avoids waiting periods to locate the applicable assessment. In the run of cases there are advantages in this practice for the persons regulated as well as the regulators.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">An affidavit of the Barnstable tax assessor, received upon the plaintiff\u2019s motion to reconsider, is instructive. Barnstable revalues property \u201con a three year cycle.\u201d Revaluation occurred as of January 1, 1982, so the 1984 figure was at the end of the cycle. It just happened that 1985 was a reassessment year, so the plaintiff could say with some plausibility, let\u2019s wait. In fact, the 1984 figures ($6.2 million for the present property) were issued late because of changes in computer methodology. As the Barnstable tax valuations are not on a yearly basis (nor are the State equalizations), the number called for by the board\u2019s practice will often be \u201cold.\u201d But the alternative is a protraction of the process to find a different number which may not be much preferable.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">We give weight to the board\u2019s practical interpretation of its own regulations, see <em>Greenleaf Fin. Co. </em>v. <em>Small Loans Regulatory Bd., </em>377 Mass. 282, 293 (1979); <em>Northbridge </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number><em>Natick, </em>394 Mass. 70, 74 (1985), and find it rational rather than capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">The plaintiff objects that the board did not equalize the assessment it adopted.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> True, but, according to the plaintiff\u2019s tax bill provided to the board, the hotel complex is classified in category \u201c300,\u201d commercial. The equalization rate for \u201c300\u201d in Barnstable in 1984 was 1.00. See the Biennial Report of the Commissioner of Revenue as reprinted in 1985 House Doc. No. 5012.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">2. <em>The question of costs, </em>(a) The plaintiff argues that the base taken for construction costs should be the total estimated costs of $1,100,000 shown on the building permits rather than the low-bid costs provided by the plaintiff itself to the board, $1,487,880.97. The argument refers to the remarks of the chairperson quoted above, but, examined in context, the statement, we think, was meant only to suggest that the figures on the permits may be used as some evidence of the approximate amounts of construction costs. There is no reason to think that such figures are meant to be conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">The board\u2019s use of a base of actual cost figures, where available, is reasonable and conforms to the text of regulations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In the present case the board has been content to accept the \u201clow-bid\u201d figure as tantamount to actual costs. This may well have favored the plaintiff by understating the final costs. While the lodestar of decision is actual cost, the board must have some measure of discretion as to the time when figures are taken to be final.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>(b) The further question is the narrow one raised, but skirted and left unanswered, in the discussion at the board hearing: Just which costs, taken to be actual, were fairly related to \u201cconstruction,\u201d as properly understood for this purpose? What, indeed, about such items as air conditioners, wallpaper, \u201csite work\u201d? No particular regulations have been cited on this matter, and the board may have to generate common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The foregoing opinion is written at some length to suggest that the board might, if feasible, consider improving its regulations at the points noted where they are less than clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The matter is to be remanded to the board for consideration of the narrow question with regard to construction costs mentioned in (b) above; otherwise the judgment appealed from is affirmed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Known at the time as the Architectural Barriers Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b304-8\">In 1985, the board\u2019s regulations defined \u201caccessible\u201d as \u201c[sjafely approached, entered, and/or used by physically handicapped persons.\u201d 521 Code Mass.
