See <em>Balas </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 995, 996 (1982). The material facts are not in dispute. In 1983, the zoning board of appeals of Plymouth (board) denied the application of the plaintiff V.S.H. Realty, Inc. (VSH), for a special permit<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to construct a 160,000 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>square foot shopping center on an 18 acre parcel of land between Summer Street and Samoset Street (U.S. Route 44) in Plymouth. The board denied the application because of the potentially adverse impact on vehicular traffic in the area. In response to the board\u2019s decision, VSH reduced the site to 17 acres, reduced the size of the project to 118,000 square feet, and eliminated a projected department store. The second application for a special permit was denied because of the same concern for traffic problems. On April 3, 1985, a judge of the Superior Court annulled the second decision of the board on the ground that the impartiality of one member of the board was impaired by a conflict of interest, and he remanded the matter to the board for reconsideration without the disqualified member.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">Following additional hearings after remand, the board granted the special permit,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> subject to numerous conditions which were required to be satisfied prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit for the project. Upon review again in the Superior Court, which had retained jurisdiction, a second judge concluded that the board had not exceeded its authority. See G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Two of the conditions, which are at the center of this dispute,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> had to do with the widening of Route 44, but that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>work was beyond the control of VSH; it was to be performed, if at all, by State and municipal authorities. The plaintiff agreed to perform all the remaining conditions which included (at the suggestion of VSH in response to an inquiry from the board) the construction of Pilgrim Hill Road, improvements to the intersections of Pilgrim Hill Road with both Route 44 and Summer Street, and improvements to the intersection of Summer Street and Westerly Road.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">The site of the proposed shopping center is within an \u201carterial commercial\u201d zoning district.* **<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Section 401.13 of the zoning by-law of Plymouth states that the intent of the arterial commercial zoning district is \u201cto allow the development on major arteries or highways of appropriate commercial uses of a traffic-oriented or one-stop nature. . . .\u201d This zoning district permits certain uses, such as motels and hotels, as of right; it also permits eight \u201cspecial permit uses subject to environmental design conditions,\u201d one of which is \u201cplanned shopping centers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">Section 205.03 of the by-law (i) states that as to projects requiring special permits subject to environmental design conditions (such as shopping centers), the environmental design requirements are <em>in addition </em>to the four general requirements applicable to all uses requiring special permits (which we have set out in note 2, <em>supra)',</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>6(ii) provides that the purpose of the environmental design conditions imposed on those uses subject to such conditions is to determine the impact of the project \u201cupon the health, safety and general welfare of the town and its inhabitants due to their location, intensity of use, scale of structures, [and] traffic generation . . .\u201d; (iii) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>establishes nine general standards for the design and evaluation of projects subject to environmental design conditions, including such factors as design and siting of structures, relation of project to the surroundings, and vehicular and pedestrian circulation; and (iv) states that the environmental design conditions \u201care intended as general tools for use by the board of appeals and planning board in reviewing projects and <em>are not to be seen as inflexible </em>standards\u201d (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">We have no doubt (and VSH does not argue otherwise) that the standards for environmental design conditions set out in the by-law fall within the authority extended by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9 (see note 1, <em>supra). </em>See <em>Balas </em>v. <em>Zoning Bd. of Appeals of Plymouth, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 995, 996 (1982). It is also clear from the board\u2019s opinion that the board evaluated the plaintiffs project against the nine general standards required by the environmental design conditions, and it imposed the two conditions in dispute in order to satisfy those standards. Moreover, wrote the board, only by complying with the two conditions imposed as a result of environmental design review would the project be in compliance with the four general requirements for all special permits set out in note 2, <em>supra. </em>It is within this context that we must consider the appropriate standard of review, the legality of the two disputed conditions, and the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">1. <em>The standard of judicial review. </em>The parties are sharply divided on the standard for the judicial review of the legality of the two disputed conditions. The board, claiming that the standard applicable is whether the board\u2019s decision granting the permit is \u201carbitrary and capricious,\u201d cites to <em>Gulf Oil Corp. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Framingham, </em>355 Mass. 275, 277-78 (1969), and <em>Humble Oil &amp; Ref. Co. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of </em>Amherst, 360 Mass. 604, 605 (1971), which state that a board decision cannot be sustained if it is based on \u201clegally untenable ground, or is unreasonable, whimsical, capricious or arbitrary.\u201d <em>Ibid., </em>quoting from <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number><em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>356 Mass. 635, 639 (1970).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See also <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>369 Mass. 512, 515 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">VSH argues, focusing on the conditions, that the standard is one of \u201creasonableness\u201d by analogy to decisions involving \u201csite plan approval,\u201d citing to <em>Y.D. Dugout, Inc. </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Canton, </em>357 Mass. 25 (1970), and <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Westwood, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 278 (1986). Those decisions involve conditions imposed upon a use allowed <em>as of right, </em>see <em>id. </em>at 282, and thus are significantly different from a special permit case.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">There is no need, however, to resolve this dispute between the parties. Here the conditions cannot be maintained on either of the standards put forth.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">2. <em>The legality of the conditions. </em>It is not disputed that the required road work can only be done by the governmental authorities responsible for Route 44, and the performance of that work \u2014 if it is to be done at all \u2014 will be a governmental decision beyond the control of VSH. <em>Board of Appeals of Hanover </em>v. <em>Housing Appeals Comm. in the Dept. of Community Affairs, </em>363 Mass. 339, 375 (1973), upon which the board relies and which involves the required local approval of a sewage disposal system, is inapposite. It is not unreasonable to require an applicant to comply with local law; compliance with law is commonly within the applicant\u2019s power. It is unreasonable to impose a condition the performance of which lies entirely beyond the applicant\u2019s power. <em>Caruso </em>v. <em>Pastan, </em>1 Mass. App. Ct. 28 (1973), upon which the board also relies, provides no help. There the board required a sewer connection to a twelve-inch sewer main to be constructed in Lynn Fells Parkway. The court noted that the applicant did not complain of that requirement, and the plaintiffs (nearby land owners) would not be harmed by it. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Thus the required connection was not a live issue in that case. <em>Id. </em>at 30-31 n.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Moreover, it is not the special permit that is suspended until the required work is done, but the applicant\u2019s certificate of occupancy. Putting to one side the question of the authority of the board to order the suspension of a certificate of occupancy (a doubtful proposition under the provisions of the Plymouth by-law), the condition effectively precludes construction of the project. No rational applicant would build (nor would a rational lender finance) a shopping center knowing beforehand that occupancy would be forbidden until governmental authorities elected to widen Route 44 to the extent \u201cnecessary.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>SCIT, Inc. </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of </em>Braintree, 19 Mass. App. Ct. 101, 110 n.16 (1984) (conditions must not \u201cbe used to enforce outright prohibition under the guise of regulation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">We conclude that the two disputed conditions are legally untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">3. <em>The disposition. </em>The question of disposition remains. This project has been in the hands of the board or the courts since 1983 \u2014 far too long. Nevertheless, we are constrained, under authority of <em>MacGibbon </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Duxbury, </em>369 Mass. at 520, to return this matter to the board for their decision, free of conflicts of interests or legally untenable conditions. See <em>Lovaco, Inc. </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals of Attleboro, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 239, 243 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">The judgment is reversed. A new judgment is to be entered annulling the board\u2019s decision and remanding the case to the board for further consideration and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-16\"> Special permits for use variations are authorized by G. L. c. 40A, \u00a7 9, as appearing in St. 1975, c. 808, \u00a7 3, the first paragraph of which provides as follows: \u201cZoning ordinances or by-laws shall provide for specific types of uses which shall only be permitted in specified districts upon the issuance of a special permit.
