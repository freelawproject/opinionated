One month later, an Essex County grand jury returned an indictment charging the defendant with murder. A motion to suppress the defendant\u2019s inculpatory statements to the police was denied after an evidentiary hearing, and on April 14, 1989, after a five-day trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty of murder in the second degree. The defendant appealed, claiming errors in the suppression ruling and in the conduct of the trial. We affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">1. <em>Motion to suppress. </em>The defendant was arrested on August 18, 1988, in New Jersey as a result of an automobile accident in which he was involved. While the defendant was being held by the Newark police, Detective Conte read aloud the full Miranda warnings from the police department Miranda warning form, and then the defendant read aloud the portion which stated, \u201cAnything you say can be used against you in a court of law.\u201d The waiver paragraph at the bottom of the form was next read to the defendant, and he was asked to read the waiver to himself. The defendant signed the waiver, agreed to answer questions, and proceeded to give a detailed statement of the circumstances of the victim\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">The defendant admitted to a homosexual encounter with the victim, in the course of which the defendant stabbed the victim with the defendant\u2019s knife and stuck him with a sharp object he found on a nearby sink. On appeal (but not at the suppression hearing) the defendant argues that the statement should be suppressed because at one point in the interrogation the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">\u201cQ. Shannon, you stated earlier that this man had grabbed your leg, is that all that happened?</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\u201cA. \u00d1o.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u201cQ. Did any sexual act occur between you and him in that [building] ?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, but I don\u2019t want to discuss it.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The questioning then was directed to another subject, and it continued to completion without objection or interruption. At the conclusion of the statement the defendant was asked, \u201cWhy have you given this statement?\u201d The defendant answered, \u201cBecause I couldn\u2019t live without paying for what I did and eventually I would have got caught.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">The defendant argues that because of his refusal to answer the single question just quoted, the interrogation should have ceased. There is no merit to the argument; the defendant\u2019s rights were not violated. He had decided, for whatever reason, not to answer a particular question, but he did not indicate in any manner that he was invoking the right he had previously waived \u2014 his right to remain silent. The outcome, adverse to the defendant, is controlled by <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roberts, </em>407 Mass. 731, 734 (1990), where the court said, \u201cFor the rule of <em>Miranda </em>regarding the termination of questioning to apply, there must be either an <em>expressed </em>unwillingness to continue or an affirmative request for an attorney,\u201d quoting (with emphasis added) from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pennellatore, </em>392 Mass. 382, 387 (1984). Neither one occurred here. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>374 Mass. 426, 428-430 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">2. <em>Motion for a required finding of not guilty of murder. </em>At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, which included the statement the defendant gave to the New Jersey police, the defendant moved for a required finding of not guilty of so much of the indictment as charged murder. The defendant\u2019s argument is that the motion should have been allowed because the evidence showed that \u201cthe killing, while intentional, was without malice . . . .\u201d The issue, then, is whether at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case there was sufficient evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, for the jury to conclude, beyond any reasonable doubt, that the defendant acted with malice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 676-678 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The thrust of the motion is that the defendant\u2019s statement to the police in New Jersey establishes no more than that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>defendant acted in self-defense. However, the jury were \u201centitled to disbelieve the evidence that the defendant acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. 427, 431 (1984), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fluker, </em>377 Mass. 123, 128 (1979). Disbelieving that portion of the statement, the jury could easily conclude on the basis of the remainder of the statement and other evidence that the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt, acted with malice.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">Joanne Richmond, a physician, forensic pathologist, and medical examiner for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, had performed an autopsy on the body of the victim; she testified at the trial that the cause of death was a massive hemorrhage due to stab wounds and puncture wounds, primarily a stab wound in the neck. Dr. Richmond described bruises on the victim\u2019s left cheek, around the left eye, and on the left side of the neck. On the right cheek there were two puncture wounds, one of which went to a depth of two inches. On the right side of the neck there was a stab wound that penetrated one and a half to two and a half inches. On the right upper chest there were two sets, or pairs, of puncture wounds. On the left chest there was a stab wound that had passed through the sternum bone \u201cwith a great deal of force\u201d and \u201craised the sac around the heart\u201d without entering the heart. This wound was two to three inches deep. The puncture wounds were caused by a two-pronged instrument; a carving fork was found near the victim. The stab wound was caused by a knife. The victim probably survived for twenty or thirty minutes after receiving the stab and puncture wounds; \u201cthere was almost no blood left in the body,\u201d Dr. Richmond testified. The victim, according to Dr. Richmond, was sixty-five years old, height 5\u20197\u201d, weight 170 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">The circumstances described in the defendant\u2019s own statement to the police certainly did not require any measure of self-defense. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kendrick, </em>351 Mass. 203, 211-212 (1966). The defendant, who had never previously met the victim, was picked up by him on a public street and voluntarily went with him to the victim\u2019s office, where the victim indicated he was interested in a homosexual en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>counter. When rebuffed, the victim swore at the defendant. At that point the defendant simply could have walked away; there is nothing in his statement that suggests there was any obstacle to his doing so. When the victim, in spite of the rebuff, took off his pants and shirt, the defendant admitted that he responded by taking out his knife and thrusting it forward and deeply into the victim\u2019s neck. This was followed by blows about the head, a stab wound that almost entered the heart, and several puncture wounds caused by a carving fork. Then, having taken the keys to the victim\u2019s car from his pants pocket, the defendant fled the Commonwealth in the victim\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">Moreover, \u201c[t]here is no constitutional principle which bars the conviction of a defendant when there is evidence warranting an inference of malice and also evidence warranting, but not requiring, a finding that the defendant acted in self-defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lamrini, </em>392 Mass. at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">The defendant relies on <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>3 Mass. App. Ct. 226 (1975). That was a case, however, in which the victim initiated sudden combat and which involved \u201chighly unusual circumstances,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 231; it has no bearing on the substantially different facts of this case. Compare <em>id. </em>at 233.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">There was no error in the denial of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">3. <em>Instructions on reasonable doubt. </em>The defendant objected to the charge on reasonable doubt. His argument is that the judge (who eschewed, inexplicably, the \u201ctime-tested language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 [1850],\u201d see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. 545, 551 [1980]) erroneously instructed the jurors \u201cthat they may convict upon a moral certainty without more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">There was no error in the judge\u2019s charge on reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He gave the instruction, \u201cProof beyond a reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>doubt is proof to a moral certitude,\u201d but that, the Supreme Judicial Court has said, \u201cis the heart of the matter,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>371 Mass. 203, 207 (1976), for it conveys the high degree of probability that is required for conviction. Webster, too, uses the same phrase: \u201cthe evidence must establish the truth of the fact to a reasonable and <em>moral certainty . </em>. .\u201d (emphasis supplied). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. at 320. The reference in <em>Webster </em>to \u201creasonable . . . certainty\u201d is meant to convey the idea, for the benefit of the Commonwealth, not the defendant, that \u201cabsolute certainty\u201d of guilt is not required, <em>ibid., </em>and the absence of that idea was, if anything, a benefit to the defendant. Moreover, the judge told the jury that \u201cif, when all is said and done there remain [s] in the mind of this jury a reasonable doubt from the evidence, then the law is clear, Shannon Ewing shall have the benefit of this doubt.\u201d Contrast a charge which instructs the jury to convict in the absence of a <em>\u201cdoubt </em>which amounts to a moral certainty\u201d (emphasis added). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>380 Mass. at 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">4. <em>The instruction on malice and intoxication. </em>The defendant objected to the refusal of the judge to give the following instruction: \u201cI have told you that one of the elements of the offense of murder which the Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant acted with malice; that he specifically intended to kill. The defendant cannot be guilty of murder without that malice and specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>intent. When you consider whether or not the Commonwealth has proved that the defendant acted with malice and had the necessary intent, you may take into account the evidence of intoxication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The judge was correct in refusing the requested instruction; there was no evidence of intoxication.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant testified that he had been drinking beer with the victim, but the record is barren of any evidence that the defendant was intoxicated or that the beer had any effect on his state of mind. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>408 Mass. 117, 134-135 (1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Freiberg, </em>405 Mass. 282, 287 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">5. <em>The instructions on manslaughter. </em>The defendant requested detailed instructions on the meaning of \u201cheat of passion\u201d and \u201cprovocation.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Walden, </em>380 Mass. 724, 727 (1980). The judge\u2019s instructions on these terms, which we set out in the margin,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> were adequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>The defendant\u2019s trial testimony \u2014 unlike his statement to the New Jersey police<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2014 described the victim\u2019s act of fellatio upon the defendant. When the defendant resisted further advances, the victim positioned himself \u201cnear the door,\u201d the defendant thereupon punched the victim, and a fistfight ensued, during the course of which the defendant drew out a knife from his back pocket and thrust it into the defendant\u2019s neck and chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">On the defendant\u2019s own statements to the New Jersey police and on his testimony at the trial, an instruction on manslaughter was certainly favorable to the defendant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Corriveau, </em>396 Mass. 319, 340-341 (1985), and the judge\u2019s description of voluntary manslaughter was not defective or inadequate. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>395 Mass. 307, 312 (1985). The judge did not have to give illustrations of acts that might constitute provocation, nor was he required to adopt the defendant\u2019s requested charges, however nicely phrased. <em>Ibid. </em>There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument that the judge\u2019s instructions on the voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s statement to the police in New Jersey were insufficient has no merit; the instructions were more expansive and detailed than the defendant\u2019s re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>quests numbered thirty-six and thirty-nine which were the basis of the objection. See Mass.R.Crim.P. 24(b), 378 Mass. 895 (1979). In any event, the judge\u2019s instructions were adequate. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>388 Mass. 846, 856-857 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">The defendant\u2019s remaining arguments are presented here for the first time, with the claim that certain alleged errors, to which the defendant did not object, created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that there was no error. Further discussion is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The judge\u2019s entire charge on reasonable doubt was the following:</p>\n<p id=\"AWA\">\u201cWell, what is proof beyond a reasonable doubt? It\u2019s a weight, a measure; it\u2019s a quantum of proof from the evidence, if there is any evidence that you find credible, believable. Such a measure that convinces you and causes you to form and to hold a strong conviction that from this credible evidence you are satisfied, and that you have within you a strong and a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>settled belief, such a strong and settled conviction that you may be said to be morally certain.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">\u201cProof beyond a reasonable doubt is proof to a moral certitude. Now it isn\u2019t proof beyond all possibility of innocence. Proof beyond a reasonable doubt isn\u2019t proof to a philosophical absolute or a mathematical certitude. But it is such a measure of proof that from the evidence, a juror says to him or herself from the evidence that I give credence to, I have within me now a firm and a settled conviction of this man\u2019s guilt, such a firm and settled conviction that I may be said to be morally certain. For the law also is, if when all is said and done there remain in the mind of this jury a reasonable doubt from the evidence, then the law is clear, Shannon Ewing shall have the benefit of this doubt. By your oath says, if he be guilty you shall find him guilty. If he be not guilty you shall find him not guilty and no more.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The judge\u2019s instruction that the defendant\u2019s alleged intoxication could be considered in connection with deliberate premeditation was more favorable to the defendant than was required by the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">Involuntary manslaughter was not an issue at the trial and is not an issue on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b317-9\">The judge charged the jury as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">\u201cMore specifically, what it is, manslaughter is the killing from a sudden transport of passion or heat of blood, upon some reasonable provocation and without malice. Or the taking of another\u2019s life occasioned by sudden combat; taking of another\u2019s life in the heat of passion occasioned by some sudden provocation. The malice aforethought is the distinctive element of murder, and it is explicitly excluded from manslaughter. If upon sudden provocation in the heat of passion, and I\u2019ll talk about that very shortly, if that is present, then malice aforethought is necessarily absent. And the killing is not murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">\u201cHeat of passion or sudden provocation. What is sudden provocation? Well, first, words. You can\u2019t be insulted; you cannot be insulted by words alone. Sudden provocation is, does not include words alone. No matter how insulted you might be, the law says that is not sufficient provocation to dethrone reason. Because you see, in the heat of passion that is what happens, that reason gets dethroned. You\u2019re not, for the moment there, you\u2019re not, you\u2019re not with the ability to reflect rationally.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">\u201cManslaughter is the unlawful taking of a life without malice aforethought, but it may be committed with real purpose and design where the cause is mitigated, because the design or purpose is suddenly formed and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>it\u2019s in the heat of mutual combat or through the violence of sudden passion that was itself the subject of strong provocation.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">\u201cSo, you have to look at the circumstances of this case. If the Commonwealth says murder, it must show it isn\u2019t manslaughter, any evidence of provocation. And the evidence of words alone is never enough. Any evidence of such provocation that would cause the heat of blood to raise up and rationality and reason be dethroned. The difference is the state of mind of the actor. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">\u201cSee, taking of another\u2019s life, with what the law calls malice aforethought is murder. Taking of another\u2019s life intentionally if one is provoked by something other than words, by actions, and so provoked that by combat, that the hot blood rises, heat of passion is what the law calls it. Reason dethroned; then the law makes allowance for that human frailty, and that killing is manslaughter. It\u2019s for you to say.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b318-10\">The defendant\u2019s statement to the New Jersey police did not include a description of a fistfight or of the act of fellatio. The statement describes the defendant as resisting the victim\u2019s homosexual advances and says that the victim, after yelling at the defendant for \u201cleading him on,\u201d proceeded to take off his clothes notwithstanding the defendant\u2019s rebuff and that the defendant then drew out his knife and thrust it into the victim\u2019s neck.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
