The apartment comprised two rooms, a living room and a bedroom, between which was a door that was open throughout the period here described. Both Lang and Coleman (Lang\u2019s uncle) were previously known to the victim. After a short while during which Lucky and Lang conversed and smoked crack cocaine, Lucky left. Thereafter, the victim and the defendants smoked cocaine for about five hours. Lang and the victim then left the apartment by taxi to obtain more cocaine. Upon their return, Lang and the victim smoked cocaine in the bedroom until about three or four A.M., when they again left the apartment by taxi to acquire more cocaine. When they returned, Coleman was awake on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>couch in the living room. Lang and the victim again retired to the bedroom and smoked cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">When the victim made ready to leave the apartment, Lang indicated that he did not want her to leave and that he wanted her to \u201cmake love to him.\u201d She refused and told him she was ready to go. She asked Lang to walk her to the corner. He refused and again stated that he wanted to \u201cmake love to her.\u201d She said, \u201cno, no, no,\u201d and, in order to deter him, told him she was pregnant and would have sex with him after she had had an abortion. When she persisted in her refusal, and while they were in the bedroom, Lang struck the victim in her eye with a closed fist. She then covered her face to prevent being hit again. At that time she was also asking Lang to stop in a voice loud enough to be heard in the living room. At some point after hitting her in the eye, Lang pulled the victim onto the bed. She took her clothes off so that she \u201cwouldn\u2019t keep getting hit on.\u201d Lang then took off his clothes and forced the victim to engage in vaginal and oral sex with him. Thereafter, while Lang was still in the bedroom, Coleman entered the bedroom, naked. As Coleman approached the bed, the victim told Lang that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do nothing with his uncle.\u201d Lang told her \u201cto treat his uncle good.\u201d Coleman then had vaginal and oral sex with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">The victim later put her clothes on, except for her shoes, and entered the living room where she engaged in conversation with the defendants until it was light outside. She later left the apartment to use a hallway bathroom. At some point thereafter, Coleman left the apartment for approximately an hour and one-half to two hours. While he was out, he telephoned the apartment and asked the victim if she wanted anything. When he returned with a soda for the victim, he asked her why she was not still in the bed. She said that she \u201cdidn\u2019t want to do nothing else.\u201d At that point, Lang was in the living room and Coleman was on his way to the bedroom. While Coleman was in the bedroom and the victim was in the living room, she heard Coleman calling out her name in a normal voice. Thereafter, Lang slapped her about three times <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>and pulled her from the living room to the bed in the bedroom. Coleman was then in the bed, naked. The victim took off her clothes because she was \u201cscared.\u201d Coleman told her \u201cif you\u2019re not interested its ok.\u201d Coleman then had vaginal and oral sex with her, following which Lang had vaginal and oral sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The victim testified that at no time did she consent to have sex with either defendant. Aside from being punched in the eye, the victim was hit by Lang \u201ca couple of more times\u201d while in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">Lang allowed the victim to leave the apartment at about 9:00 a.m. on February 27, 1987. She went to the house of her sister, who called the police. A police officer observed that she had a swollen right eye. The police arranged for the victim to be taken to a hospital by ambulance. Shortly after 11:00 a.m. on February 27, 1987, a nurse saw the victim at the hospital and observed that she was tearful, that her face was swollen, that one eye was particularly swollen, and that she had facial bruises. During the early afternoon of February 27, 1987, a police officer observed that the victim was upset and that her right eye was completely closed and swollen. A photograph depicting the victim\u2019s appearance at the time she was observed by the nurse and the police officer was entered in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">After the Commonwealth closed its evidence, which included testimony of fresh complaint, both defendants moved for required findings of not guilty on all charges. Both motions were denied. Neither defendant presented evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">1. <em>Denial of motions for required findings of not guilty. </em>Review of the denial of a motion for a required finding of not guilty requires consideration and determination whether the evidence, \u201cin its light most favorable to the Commonwealth ... is sufficient ... to permit the jury to infer the existence of the essential elements of the crime charged,\u201d notwithstanding the presence of contrary evidence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Sandler, 368 Mass. 729, 740 (1975). \u201cAdditionally, the evidence and the inferences permitted to be drawn therefrom must be \u2018of sufficient force to bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>minds of ordinary intelligence and sagacity to the persuasion of [guilt] beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Latimore, </em>378 Mass. 671, 677 (1979), quoting from <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Cooper, 264 Mass. 368, 373 (1928). \u201c[T]he relevant question is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 318-319, reh\u2019g denied, 444 U.S. 890 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">Under this standard, the denial of Coleman\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty clearly withstands challenge. A jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Coleman\u2019s first sexual encounter<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> with the victim was the product of a joint enterprise with Lang. The evidence readily permitted an inference that Coleman overheard the victim resisting Lang\u2019s sexual advances and either observed or heard Lang forcing the victim into sex by force and against her will. The evidence also permitted the further inference that he knew that the victim first succumbed to him unwillingly and as a result of the force and implied threats delivered by Lang. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Therrien, </em>383 Mass. 529, 538-539 (1981). A jury could find that the victim\u2019s resistance to Lang, coupled with her statement-that she did not want to do anything with Coleman, was sufficient to demonstrate to Coleman a lack of consent, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 688 (1982), which continued through her first sexual encounter with him. Moreover, given what could be found to have been Coleman\u2019s knowledge of Lang\u2019s first rape of the victim, Coleman\u2019s nude approach to the victim shortly after Lang\u2019s rape of her, and Lang\u2019s telling her \u201cto treat his uncle good,\u201d Coleman\u2019s sexual intercourse with the victim could be construed as \u201caccomplice liability.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>10 Mass. App. Ct. 668, 674 (1980). Such liability may arise without \u201cprior planning\u201d or an \u201canticipatory compact\u201d so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>long as at the critical time the parties \u201cconsciously acted together in carrying out the criminal endeavor.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fidler, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 506, 513 (1987). The circumstances permit an inference of \u201can identity of purpose and a common endeavor,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mercado, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 391, 396 (1987), either from the consecutive rapes or from Coleman\u2019s raping the victim under the cloak of Lang\u2019s force and implied threat. A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Coleman was the perpetrator of at least two rapes as part of a joint venture and that the essential elements of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), had been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">We also conclude that the denial of Lang\u2019s motion for required findings of not guilty was not error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Ample evidence of Lang\u2019s guilt was introduced. A rational jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Lang committed four aggravated rapes with the aggravating factors being either joint enterprise or serious bodily injury or both.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">2. <em>Inconsistency of verdicts. </em>Lang argues that, whereas the jury found him guilty of four counts of aggravated rape while finding Coleman guilty of only two similar counts, he was, in effect, convicted of having participated in two joint enterprises in which no one else participated. He claims that two verdicts against him, therefore, are legally impossible. He relies essentially on the seeming logic of the conclusion that one cannot be a joint venturer by oneself. Lang further claims that, since neither the indictment nor the verdict slips permit differentiation of the verdicts, it is impossible to determine which of his convictions are paired with Coleman\u2019s convictions and that, therefore, all four of his convictions fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>We construe this argument as grounded, by analogy, on the principle that \u201cone cannot commit a conspiracy alone.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cerveny, </em>387 Mass. 280, 285 (1982), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benesch, </em>290 Mass. 125, 135-137 (1935). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nighelli, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. 590, 595 (1982). In any event, Lang\u2019s argument overlooks two significant factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">First, the judge, without objection, instructed the jury that serious bodily injury was an element of aggravated rape and, at the request of Lang\u2019s counsel, reinstructed on the subject. The jury could have found that Lang\u2019s rapes of the victim were accompanied by serious bodily injury (swollen eye, swollen face, and facial bruises) thereby bringing to the case an aggravating element under G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 22(a), separate from joint venture. Second, Massachusetts appellate decisions have distinguished between jury verdicts that are impossible at law and those that are merely inconsistent. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. at 698; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McCombe, </em>5 Mass. App. Ct. 842, 843 (1977). We do not have here a defendant convicted of a crime based on joint enterprise and all other defendants acquitted of similar charges in the same trial.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benesch, </em>290 Mass. at 135-137. Instead, we have one defendant convicted of fewer counts than the other. Even if we assume that all the convictions relied on joint enterprise as the aggravating element, we have, at most, an internal inconsistency. Accordingly, the case is governed by the general rule that mere inconsistency of verdicts does not render a guilty verdict erroneous. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, supra </em>at 698. As we have indicated, sufficient evidence was presented to produce the verdicts returned by the jury. We are not confronted, therefore, with a situation in which the questioned verdicts must be set aside because they are \u201csupportable on one ground, but not on another, and it is impossible to tell which ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>the jury selected.\u201d <em>Yates </em>v. <em>United States, </em>354 U.S. 298, 312 (1957). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Matchett, </em>386 Mass. 492, 511 (1982). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 936, 937-938 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b262-5\">3. <em>Fresh complaint evidence. </em>The defendants argue that portions of the fresh complaint testimony of a police officer and a nurse who spoke with the victim at the hospital on February 27, 1987, were erroneously admitted and unduly prejudicial to them. In accordance with the Massachusetts rule, that testimony was permitted to go beyond the fact of a complaint and to include a recitation of the details allegedly recounted by the victim. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 622, 629 n.8 (1987). Those details were largely corroborative of the trial testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Those portions of the fresh complaint testimony that went beyond the victim\u2019s testimony or were at variance with it did not fill gaps in the prosecution\u2019s case or introduce otherwise absent essential elements. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 396 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Eldridge, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. at 938. It is noteworthy that the defense exploited the discrepancies. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra </em>at 396; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lagacy, supra </em>at 630. The judge properly instructed the jury that the fresh complaint evidence could be used only to corroborate and not to fill any gap in the prosecution\u2019s case. In any event, the discrepancies consisted largely of peripheral details and did not prejudice the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">4. <em>Other claims. </em>The other appellate contentions made by Lang do not require extended discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">a. Lang argues that the following portion of his trial counsel\u2019s closing argument constituted ineffective assistance:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-9\">\u201cThe burden of proof is on the government, on the Commonwealth, of which you are a part, and the burden is on you, as it was on Mr. Lang to sit here and to hear all this evidence. And based on the government\u2019s case I ask you people of the Commonwealth to find Mr. Lang not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>This statement was nothing more than an awkward rhetorical flourish. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Proulx, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 985, 987 (1987). It did not bring trial counsel\u2019s performance \u201cmeasurably below that which might be expected of the ordinary fallible lawyer.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Saferian, 366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">The alleged flaws in trial counsel\u2019s cross-examination and in his failure to make certain arguments and objections fall within the area of reasonable tactical decisions. The other claims of ineffective representation do not merit discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">b. The prosecutor\u2019s opening reference to a jigsaw puzzle was harmless. Her reference to Coleman in closing argument (\u201cMr. Coleman would have you give him the opportunity to say T saw no evil, and I heard no evil, and I didn\u2019t understand what was going on\u2019 \u201d) was more an allusion to the defensive tack taken by Coleman\u2019s counsel in his closing argument than to Coleman\u2019s failure to take the stand. Also, this argument made no mention of Lang and drew no objection from either Lang\u2019s or Coleman\u2019s counsel. There was no error which created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>405 Mass. 369, 375 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">c. While the references to \u201crape\u201d and \u201cvictim\u201d by the prosecutor and the witnesses should have been avoided, they did not, in the circumstances, constitute error. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Foley, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 983, 984 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b256-11\">All counts of the indictments were essentially identical. They charged the defendants in the precise language of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 79. That language, by operation of G. L. c. 277, \u00a7 39, conveys a definition of the crime of aggravated rape which tracks the wording of G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 <em>22(a).</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b256-12\">Lang and Coleman were sentenced to imprisonment at Massachusetts Correctional Institution, Cedar Junction, for terms of six to ten years and three to six years, respectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b259-6\">By first sexual encounter, we mean the oral and vaginal intercourse by each of the defendants with the victim which followed Lang\u2019s punching her in the eye; the oral and vaginal intercourse which followed Coleman\u2019s return to the apartment was the second sexual encounter.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b260-7\"> The defendant Lang also argues that the judge used an incorrect standard in deciding the motion for required findings of not guilty. He points to the judge\u2019s reference to \u201ca scintilla of evidence\u201d in the course of a comment concerning evidence relating to the defendant Coleman. The issue on appeal, however, is not whether the judge applied the proper standard but, as noted above, whether on the state of the evidence the motion for required findings of not guilty should have been granted. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sandler, </em>368 Mass. at 740. In any event, the random statement of the judge, when read in the context of the other of his statements, does not indicate a misunderstanding of the proper standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b261-6\">The conclusion that this verdict configuration in the same trial requires reversal of all guilty verdicts is not a necessary one. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bucuvalas, </em>909 F.2d 593 (1st Cir. 1990); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nighelli, </em>13 Mass. App. Ct. at 595-596.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
