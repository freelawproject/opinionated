Clermont and Robert W. Newman, have been long at war in this litigation, commenced on October 19, 1981. After considerable attrition of parties and theories, as mentioned below, the litigation was reduced to an action by the plaintiff Martha\u2019s Vineyard Auto Village, Inc. (MVAV), owned by Clermont, the only Ford and Lincoln-Mercury automobile franchisee on Martha\u2019s Vineyard from 1977 to 1984, against the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>ants, Newman individually, three franchisee companies owned by him in Hartford, Connecticut,* <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and a garage-service station on the island.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The action, so reduced, invoked G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11 (unfair trade practices by one business person against another), and arose out of activities of the defendants on the island, with alleged loss to the plaintiff. The case was tried without a jury on August 29-31, 1988. A judge of the Superior Court held that there had been a few violations of G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (declaring unfair or deceptive practices illegal), underlying the \u00a7 11 claim, but that these did not cause any damage to the plaintiff. Nevertheless, he awarded attorneys\u2019 fees and costs of $112,128 to the plaintiff under \u00a7 11. The plaintiff appeals, contending that damage was proved. The defendants cross-appeal, contesting the award of attorney\u2019s fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">1. <em>Course of the litigation. </em>The theory that the plaintiff now puts forward is almost entirely unrelated to those asserted in the original eighteen-count complaint. At that time, the plaintiff\u2019s charges centered upon two alleged conspiracies between some of the current defendants and Ford Motor Company (Ford) to establish a de facto sales franchise on Martha\u2019s Vineyard, competing with the plaintiffs franchise there, in violation of G. L. c. 93B, \u00a7 4(3)(/)(creating a \u201cbill of rights\u201d for automobile dealers), the other alleging a similar scheme involving Ford, the present defendants, and others to compete with a leasing subsidiary of MVAV.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Section 4(3) (l) of c. 93B, inserted by St. 1970, c. 814, \u00a7 1, prohibits motor vehicle manufacturers from \u201carbitrarily and without notice to existing franchisees . . . grant [ing] or enter [ing] into a franchise or selling agreement to or with an additional franchisee who intends or would be required by such franchise or selling agreement to conduct its dealership</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>In 1984, after three years of discovery, the plaintiff amended its complaint to include two additional counts under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 11, alleging violations under G. L. c. 93A, \u00a7 2 (and adding an additional defendant, Williams Ford, Inc.). Perhaps anticipating the weakness of the original theory, the plaintiff, without alleging additional facts, now recharacterized the defendant\u2019s actions in selling and leasing on Martha\u2019s Vineyard as \u201cunfair and deceptive trade practices.\u201d The defendants moved for summary judgment on all counts. A judge of the Superior Court allowed the motion, on August 24, 1984, as to all but the two c. 93A counts. The crux of his decision was that Ford\u2019s dealer franchise agreement did not give the dealer an exclusive right to sell vehicles within the \u201cdealer locality\u201d and that the defendants had not created a dealership on Martha\u2019s Vineyard within the meaning of the statute. Although the judge found no activity on the defendants\u2019 part denounced by c. 93B, he said the plaintiff \u201cat the very least produced facts regarding the oppressiveness of defendants\u2019 conduct and resulting loss of business to MVAV\u201d sufficient to avert summary judgment on the c. 93A counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Following the decision, the plaintiff in July and August, 1986, settled out of court on the leasing count with Ford and some defendants not now parties. This left the \u00a7 93A sales count.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">2. <em>Trial of the c. 93A claim. </em>Thus we reach what we have called the present reduced action. This, as of the time of the partial grant of summary judgment, alleged, as we have noted, that the very attempt by the defendants to sell Ford and Lincoln-Mercury cars and provide services to Vineyard residents, although without establishing a dealership in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>area, was an \u201cunfair and deceptive\u201d trade practice. In October, 1986, the plaintiff moved an amendment of the already amended complaint to charge specifically that the defendants had tampered with odometers and schemed to sell vehicles at a loss in order to drive MVAV out of business. Evidently the judge did not act formally on the motion to amend, but he did not disallow proof on these points.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The action was tried, jury-waived, in August, 1988.* <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> After noting that MVAV was the sole licensed Ford and Lincoln-Mercury dealer on Martha\u2019s Vineyard from March, 1977, to June, 1984, and reiterating that such franchises did not prohibit dealers from selling outside their own dealer localities, the judge went on to find: During the period mentioned, MVAV\u2019s new vehicle sales went from a high of 163 (in 1978) to a low of 78 (in 1983). Newman and the companies he controlled sold 302 vehicles on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in this period.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> They paid finders\u2019 fees to Martha\u2019s Vineyard residents to seek out customers on the island; at MVAV\u2019s request, Ford asked Newman to stop this practice, but he refused. The defendants had \u201cunderpriced cars, tampered with odometers and sold vehicles with incorrect mileage amounts,\u201d but \u201conly six cars were sold by use of these practices,\u201d and \u201carguably\u201d these were sold on Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Newman had \u201cforced some employees into giving false testimony in their depositions,\u201d but these persons later recanted in affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">To come to the judge\u2019s rulings of law, he did not accept the plaintiffs theory that the defendants\u2019 mere sales on the island violated c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and so would reach \u00a7 11. He ruled as violations of \u00a7 2 the defendants\u2019 \u201cfraudulently tamper [ing] with odometers in vehicles they later sold to unsuspecting consumers\u201d and \u201csuborn [ing] perjury by intimidat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>ing witnesses.\u201d Less clearly, he also appears to have ruled that \u201cunderpricing\u201d was a violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The judge entered judgment for the defendants because the plaintiff had \u201cnot met its burden of proving a causal connection between its losses and the defendants\u2019 activities.\u201d He awarded the plaintiff attorneys\u2019 fees for having proved unfair and deceptive behavior by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">3. <em>Plaintiffs appeal. </em>The plaintiff has abandoned its blanket contention that defendants\u2019 sales on Martha\u2019s Vineyard were in themselves, without more, violations of c. 93A, \u00a7 2; it now argues that the evidence at trial \u201cconclusively established . . . that defendants sold at least 302 motor vehicles on Martha\u2019s Vineyard through unfair and deceptive trade practices, including odometer tampering and selling at a loss,\u201d from which it follows, the plaintiff contends, that the defendants should answer to the plaintiff for the profits attributable to those sales.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">(a) Analysis of the record shows that the plaintiff provided scant evidence of unfair and deceptive business activities by the defendants on the island.* *<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Plaintiff points to the deposition testimony of Joseph Corey, a former general manager of Williams Ford, Inc., one of the Newman companies. Corey testified to various incidents of odometer tampering by the defendants\u2019 employees \u2014 a deceptive practice according to c. 93A, \u00a7 2, and see G. L. c. 266, \u00a7\u00a7 141 &amp; 141A \u2014 but to sales of only two tampered vehicles to residents of the island.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He said also that on two occasions the defendants sold vehicles to businesses on the island at a loss,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and that Newman had confided to him on other occasions that he wanted to drive MVAV out of business. During pretrial discovery the defendants admitted (by failure to deny) that they had sold 302 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>cars on the island between 1977 and 1984 and that at least one of these had an altered odometer.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> If we accept up to six as the judge\u2019s figure of underpriced sales, there was still nothing resembling a systematic scheme of predatory pricing, sustained by one with economic power, that would fall under c. 93A by reference to the Federal analogues that are brought into play by c. 93A, \u00a7 <em>2(b). </em>See <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co. </em>v. <em>Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 588-595 (1986); <em>Barry Wright Corp. </em>v. <em>ITT Grinnell Corp., </em>724 F.2d 227, 230-236 (1st Cir. 1983). The \u201csubornation of perjury\u201d during the trial of the action \u2014 the substance being later recanted \u2014 although reprehensible, can hardly figure as an unfair trade practice, cf. <em>Stromberg </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>456 F.Supp. 848, 850-851 (D.Mass. 1978); it may be separately punishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The, compendium of violations of c. 93A, \u00a7 2, any way it is looked at, thus comes to very little.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">(b) The judge was correct in concluding that the plaintiff had not carried the burden of showing a causal connection between violation and any loss. See <em>Kohl </em>v. <em>Silver Lake Motors, Inc., </em>369 Mass. 795, 800 (1976); <em>Van Dyke </em>v. <em>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co., </em>388 Mass. 671, 678 (1983); <em>Massachusetts Farm Bureau Fedn., Inc. </em>v. <em>Blue Cross, Inc., </em>403 Mass. 722, 730 (1989). An expert witness for the plaintiff asserted that the plaintiff\u2019s loss should be measured by the total average profit for the Ford and Lincoln-Mercury vehicles sold by the defendants on Martha\u2019s Vineyard from 1977 to 1984, but apart from technical difficulties, such as that some cars registered on the island had been bought off-isl\u00e1nd, the expert founders because the sales themselves were not violations. The few odometer cases were frauds on the customers, as the judge indeed said, but could not be shown to cause loss to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The plaintiff relies on <em>Ricky Smith Pontiac, Inc. </em>v. <em>Subaru, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 396, 424 (1982), to claim recovery of profits on the 302 sales, but the reliance is mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>placed. In the <em>Ricky Smith </em>decision, a car dealer recovered against a regional distributor for unlawfully franchising a competing dealership in violation of c. 93B, \u00a7 4(3)(/). The defendant had to present \u2014 and did \u2014 proof of actual damage flowing from the unlawful act, but he was not bound to show it with mathematical precision (any more than he would have to do so in proving an ordinary tort). The same holds for claims under c. 93A, \u00a7 11. <em>Ricky Smith </em>does not help the plaintiff in the present case because there was no showing of actual damage here. In <em>Ricky Smith, </em>the court noted that \u201c[c]ommon sense suggests that the placement of a competing automobile dealership within the market area of an existing dealer should normally have some direct negative economic impact on the existing dealer in terms of lost sales and diminished profits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424. Contrast the situation here, where a minimal number of cars were sold with tampered odometers in the plaintiffs area over a period of seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">4. <em>Defendants\u2019 appeal. </em>The same distinction \u2014 actual but not clearly measurable damage or loss, contrasted with no actual damage or loss \u2014 is important in considering the judge\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiff. When the judge made his decision herein, on October 27, 1988, he might have supposed, and evidently did, that a person at whom a violation of c. 9 3A, \u00a7 2, was somehow directed, but who suffered no loss in consequence of the violation, could bring suit under c. 93A, \u00a7 11, secure no substantive relief, but nevertheless recover attorneys\u2019 fees. This proposition might have been thought to derive some support from <em>Shapiro </em>v. <em>Public Servs. Mut. Ins. Co., </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 648, 657-658 (1985), although it would overlook <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Bendetson, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 558, 566-567 (1978). Compare <em>Raymer </em>v. <em>Bay State Nat. Bank, </em>384 Mass. 310, 320 (1981); <em>Trempe </em>v. <em>Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 457-458 (1985) <em>(Trempe </em>dealt with \u00a7 9). The matter has now been clarified in <em>Jet Line Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>American Employers Ins. Co., </em>404 Mass. 706, 718 (1989). The court there reconciled previous decisions and held that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>\u201c[u]nder \u00a7 11, a plaintiff must be entitled to relief in some other respect in order to be entitled to an award of attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d A plaintiff gets no bounty in the form of attorney\u2019s fees \u201cfor merely identifying an unfair or deceptive act or practice. Under \u00a7 11, that unfair or deceptive conduct must have had some adverse effect upon the plaintiff, even if it is not quantifiable in dollars.\u201d In the case before us, the trial judge found no harm had come to the plaintiff caused by the \u201cdefendants\u2019 activities\u201d and gave the plaintiff no substantive recovery. It follows that attorneys\u2019 fees should have been withheld.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The judgment, so far as it awards attorneys\u2019 fees, is reversed; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-7\"> Newman Lincoln Mercury, Inc., Williams Ford, Inc., and Westwood Auto Leasing, Inc.
