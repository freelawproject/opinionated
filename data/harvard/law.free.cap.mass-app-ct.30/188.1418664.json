Strothers\u2019 appeal from a judgment of divorce and an award of child support presents two questions: whether the Probate Court judge erred in (1) denying her motion for a continuance so she could attempt to obtain counsel; and (2) engaging in ex parte communications with counsel for the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-16\">We draw background facts from findings made by the judge. Just a few months after the birth of their fifth child, Samuel R. Strothers\u2019 wife of nineteen years died. He advertised for a housekeeper, and Denise L. Rock, then a twenty-five year old single mother, applied for the position and was hired. After Denise had been employed for about two weeks, Samuel, then forty-three years of age, proposed marriage to her. On April 16, 1983, three weeks after she began work as his housekeeper, Denise and Samuel married and began a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>brief and troubled union. They lived together in Samuel\u2019s first marital residence in Framingham.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On May 14, 1984, their child, Naomi, was born. Denise was primary and almost sole caretaker of Naomi, as Samuel chose to spend most of his time in California. He provided very little support to either Denise or Naomi.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On July 26, 1984, Denise, represented by counsel, filed a complaint for divorce. After an apparent reconciliation, Denise was allowed to dismiss her complaint on December 11, 1984. On March 6, 1985, Samuel, represented by counsel, filed a complaint for divorce, alleging cruel and abusive treatment. On March 22, 1985, Denise, represented by counsel, filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging cruel and abusive treatment.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A temporary order for support of $125 per week entered on March 26, 1985, of which Samuel claims he neither received notice nor had knowledge. Nonetheless, on June 10, 1985, he was held in contempt of court for failure to comply with the temporary order for support.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He was at that time ordered to pay arrears and attorney\u2019s fees. Samuel paid support for a limited time, but never paid arrears or attorney\u2019s fees. He also hindered discovery by filing incomplete and evasive answers to interrogatories, and was ordered to pay sanctions and attorney\u2019s fees as a result of his nonresponsiveness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> While Samuel appears to owe De<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>nise\u2019s second attorney a total of fifteen hundred dollars in fees,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the record contains an October, 1985, entry by a Probate Court judge, reserving the matter of fees and costs until the case was heard on the merits. With no cash in hand, however, Denise\u2019s second lawyer was allowed to withdraw in February, 1986, without Denise\u2019s consent.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Due to financial constraints, Denise was unable to engage other counsel.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The day before the start of the trial, Denise filed, pro se, an ex parte motion<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for a continuance in order to attempt to obtain counsel. The court denied her motion, pointing out that Samuel had come from California to Massachusetts for trial, and that correspondence from Samuel\u2019s lawyer plus a copy of a letter from her former attorney to the court, see note 8 <em>supra, </em>gave Denise notice that \u201cat least something was going to happen in the Court.\u201d Denise was forced to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">1. <em>The denial of the wife\u2019s motion for a continuance. </em>The general rule in Massachusetts is that a continuance \u201cshall be granted only for good cause.\u201d Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 40(b) (1975). As the basis of her motion, Denise claimed she had not been provided with adequate notice of the trial date.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>The decision whether to grant a continuance \u201cis in the sound discretion of the [trial] judge.\u201d <em>Leonard </em>v. <em>Strong, 2 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 467, 469 (1974). <em>Beninati </em>v. <em>Beninati, </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 529, 534 (1984). A trial judge is usually in the best position to assess a situation as it arises. This matter was a moderately complicated case, involving an uncooperative spouse. As the facts began to unravel during the trial, it should have become clear to the judge that Denise was not able to cope with the trial, and that she would need help. For example, to identify and pursue assets would require sophisticated investigative skills. Her situation was not of her own making. Compare <em>Griffith </em>v. <em>Griffith, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 943, 944 (1987). Although good cause for a continuance has been shown, because of our ruling on the second issue, we need not decide whether to substitute our judgment for that of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">2. <em>The ex parte communication. </em>On the last day of the trial, the judge noticed two of Samuel\u2019s children in the courtroom, and thereupon asked Samuel and Denise to leave in order to discuss a trust fund Samuel had previously established for the children of his first marriage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Denise was not present during the ensuing conversations. The record shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>that the judge then engaged in conversations with Samuel\u2019s counsel and the guardian ad litem for Naomi about Samuel\u2019s misuse of the trust funds. Those conversations involved discussions of whether, in view of Samuel\u2019s misuse of them, the trust funds should be treated as such or as Samuel\u2019s money and, thus, marital assets. They also involved a discussion of how much child support Samuel could afford to pay for Naomi. It was improper to conduct these conversations in the absence of Denise, and for that matter, Samuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">By requiring Denise to proceed pro se, the judge was obliged to treat her as he would have her attorney. She had the right to be present, especially where she was not represented by counsel. Specifically, the Code of Judicial Conduct S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3(A)(4), 382 Mass. 810 (1982), set put in the margin,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> required, in the circumstances, that Denise have the opportunity to participate in these discussions. The amount and nature of Samuel\u2019s assets had direct relevance to his ability to pay support, both that which had previously been ordered and not paid, and prospective provisions for Naomi and, possibly, Denise.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">Further, the suggestion by the husband\u2019s counsel that Samuel could afford only a certain amount per week for child support, followed closely in time by the judge\u2019s ultimate decision to order the very amount suggested as weekly child support, leads us to conclude that the substance of the ex parte communication may have \u201cinfluenced [the court\u2019s] judicial action.\u201d S.J.C. Rule 3:09, Canon 3(A)(4). See <em>Olsson </em>v. <em>Waite, </em>373 Mass. 517, 533 (1977) (\u201cjudicial decision brought about by ex parte communications with the judge has no place in our adversary system\u201d). Compare <em>Cormier </em>v. <em>Carty, </em>381 Mass. 234, 238 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Although the wife, pro se, has asked us to determine the exact nature of the husband\u2019s assets in order to set child support, we decline to do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, those provisions of the judgment with respect to alimony and child support are vacated. The case is remanded to the Probate Court for further proceedings, which shall include the matter of attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b215-6\">This property was the subject matter of a trust established in 1982 for the benefit of Samuel\u2019s five children before his first wife\u2019s death and Samuel\u2019s remarriage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Later, in the course of the divorce hearing, counsel for Samuel proposed \u201cmakfing the action] a IB\u201d [G.L. c. 208, \u00a7 IB], which Denise accepted.

In June, 1986, the attorney, having sued Denise for the unpaid legal fees, asked the court to order Samuel to pay the court ordered fee payments, see note 5 <em>supra, </em>directly to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b216-10\">Denise, her older daughter, and Naomi, are all now on public assistance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b216-11\">The record does not indicate whether notice was provided to Samuel Strothers or his attorney.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Counsel for Samuel inquired by a June 3, 1986, letter whether Denise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>expected to be represented by counsel, as the trial date was \u201cimminent.\u201d Denise received a copy of a June 4, 1986, letter from her former counsel to the judge which stated that the case was \u201cscheduled for June 20,\u201d but maintained that she did not understand those words to mean that the trial would commence on that date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\">The judge noted that there was no reason to disbelieve Samuel\u2019s story that he had been, for the most part, unemployed during and after his marriage to Denise, and that he had lived off the proceeds of a one hundred thousand dollar life insurance policy on his first wife\u2019s life. Samuel claimed that those funds were held in trust for his five children, but the judge found no documentary evidence to support this claim. The judge further noted that those funds were, effectively, Samuel\u2019s property, as his conduct regarding the funds was \u201ctotally inconsistent with the duties and obligations of a trustee.\u201d For example, Samuel made various loans to people totalling more than twenty thousand dollars, utilizing these proceeds, and also expended eighty thousand dollars on his own business, which failed.
