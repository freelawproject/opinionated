A Superior Court judge allowed the defendant\u2019s motion for a required finding of not guilty on ten of the twelve indictments, and the jury found the defendant guilty of one count of rape of each child. On appeal, the defendant argues that (1) the judge erred in admitting the fresh complaint testimony of two witnesses, and (2) there were prejudicial improprieties in the prosecutor\u2019s final argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>The Commonwealth presented its case through the testimony of six witnesses: the two children, whom we shall call Susan and Michael; a Department of Social Services (DSS) investigator; a North Adams police department detective; a pediatrician who examined Susan; and the children\u2019s mother. The basic facts are not in dispute. There was evidence that the defendant lived with the two children, Susan (age five) and Michael (age seven), their mother, and the defendant\u2019s brother, Clyde Snow, in North Adams.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Both children used anatomically correct dolls during part of their testimony. Michael said that the defendant had touched Michael\u2019s penis with his finger. Susan testified that the defendant had put his penis inside her \u201clots of times,\u201d that she had heard the defendant tell Michael to put his mouth on the defendant\u2019s penis, and had seen Michael do so \u201cmore than once.\u201d Using the dolls, Susan demonstrated how the defendant penetrated her and how he had put his penis inside Michael\u2019s mouth. She also said that the defendant \u201cdidn\u2019t want no one to tell.\u201d She testified that she told the DSS investigator that Clyde hurt her, and that when she went to see a doctor after that, she also told the doctor that Clyde had hurt her. On redirect examination, Susan told the prosecutor that the defendant \u201cdid something that hurt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The DSS investigator, assigned to investigate a report of sexual abuse, testified that she went to the home on March 22, 1989, and spoke with Clyde. Two days later, the investigator returned to interview Susan about the defendant. Susan told the investigator that the defendant \u201cpee\u2019d on me,\u201d and that the defendant pulled down her underwear and \u201cpee\u2019d white\u201d on her genitals. She further testified that Susan, using two anatomic\u00e1lly correct dolls to show what the defendant did, inserted the male penis into the female vagina. The investigator also said that Susan told her that, on more than one occasion, the defendant \u201cpee\u2019d white on me and Michael, too.\u201d The detective\u2019s testimony was similar; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>testified that Susan said the defendant \u201cpee\u2019d on me\u201d and the defendant \u201cpee\u2019s white on me.\u201d He also testified that Susan, using anatomically correct dolls, placed the male penis on the female doll.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">After the interview, the investigator referred the children to Susan\u2019s pediatrician for a medical exam. The doctor testified that at the last of three examinations of Susan, he saw indications of \u201cchronic\u201d vaginal penetration which were consistent with \u201cpenile penetration.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">In the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, he stated that Susan had not been questioned about the defendant at the first interview with the DSS investigator. He also gave a definition of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After the prosecutor\u2019s closing, defense counsel moved for a mistrial, objecting to the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cpatently untrue . . . representation that [Susan] was not questioned about [the defendant] in [the first] interview\u201d and to the prosecutor\u2019s proffered definition of \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The judge denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">We turn first to the issue of the admissibility of the fresh complaint testimony. An exception to the general rule that a witness\u2019 testimony may not be corroborated by proof of his having said the same thing at an earlier time applies in the case of a victim of sexual assault such as rape. The victim\u2019s statement to another will be admissible if it is \u201cfresh,\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>is, if there is no unreasonable delay in making it. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Dion, ante </em>406, 413 (1991); Liacos, Massachusetts Evidence 171 (5th ed. 1981). Fresh complaint evidence is admitted only to corroborate the victim\u2019s testimony at trial. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cleary, </em>172 Mass. 175, 176-177 (1898); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Izzo, </em>359 Mass. 39, 42-44 (1971). Fresh complaint witnesses may testify to \u201cdetails\u201d where the testimony contains \u201cno new information\u201d and is \u201cmerely a short summary of the testimony the victim herself gave about the criminal events.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 393 (1976). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kirouac, </em>405 Mass. 557, 564 (1989). That is, the person to whom the victim complained may testify as to the entire complaint, not merely to the fact that the complaint was made. <em>Bailey, supra. </em>Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>LeFave, </em>407 Mass. 927, 940-941 (1990). Witnesses may not testify to details which add substantively to the complainant\u2019s account, see <em>Kirouac, supra </em>at 565, and details which are so graphic, colorful or gruesome as to have an important effect on the jury may be excluded. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Blow, </em>370 Mass. 401, 404 (1976). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Adams, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 534, 536 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">Here, Susan testified that the defendant had penetrated her. That testimony, if believed, would support a charge of sexual intercourse or unnatural sexual intercourse and abuse of a child under sixteen. She did not testify, as stated by the investigator, that he had ejaculated on her. However, whether or not ejaculation occurred would not add substantively to Susan\u2019s account, nor would it add anything essential to the proof of the crime. Moreover, it did not contain graphic, colorful, or gruesome prejudicial details. Indeed, \u201c[t]he entire case necessarily included details which would be distasteful to people of ordinary sensibilities; that ejaculation might occur in the course of the acts the child testified to is neither surprising nor, by itself, sensational.\u201d <em>Adams, supra </em>at 537. See <em>Blow, supra </em>at 404. We conclude that there was no error in admitting the fresh complaint testimony as to Susan.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>As to the issue of fresh complaint testimony concerning Michael, we reach a different result. The testimony of the DSS investigator and the detective was not fresh complaint testimony as to him. There is no evidence that Michael made any complaint which the DSS investigator could corroborate. It was error to admit the investigator\u2019s testimony as fresh complaint testimony pertaining to Michael. Because the defense did not object at trial to the fresh complaint testimony on the ground that it exceeded the complainant\u2019s testimony, and is, thus, raising the argument for the first time on appeal, our standard of review is whether there is a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallison, </em>383 Mass. 659, 671 (1981); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahdi, </em>388 Mass. 679, 690 (1983). In light of Susan\u2019s direct testimony of her personal observations of the sexual acts performed between Michael and the defendant, we think there is little such risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">We turn next to the question whether there was prejudicial error in the prosecutor\u2019s final argument, which the Commonwealth concedes contained misstatements of the facts and the law.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To determine whether an improper remark is prejudicial, we must look at the prosecutor\u2019s entire argument, the evidence at trial, and the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>376 Mass 402, 416 (1978); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, </em>399 Mass. 514, 518 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The prosecutor should not have attempted an explanation of reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That function is within the exclusive province of the judge. Here, however, the judge gave a full and proper definition of \u201creasonable doubt,\u201d following faithfully the language of <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Webster, </em>5 Cush. 295, 320 (1850). That was the last word the jury heard on the subject and cured any misimpression the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements might have caused.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>There was no prejudice from the prosecutor\u2019s misstatements of fact about the questioning of Susan at the first interview with the DSS investigator. While the judge could have directly addressed the prosecutor\u2019s closing remarks in his jury instructions, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Barton, 17 Mass. App. Ct. 961, 962 (1983); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>401 Mass. 109, 113-114 (1987), the judge made a particular point of instructing the jury that their recollections of the evidence were to control in their deliberation, and that closing arguments were not evidence. See <em>Barton, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kozec, supra </em>at 522-523 &amp; n.15. Further, the misstatements were not persistent, flagrant, or repetitious. Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Clary, </em>388 Mass. 583, 590-591 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b470-7\"> According to the evidence, the defendant lived with the family from September, 1988, until March, 1989, and Clyde Snow lived with them \u201coff and on\u201d for longer periods of time.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b471-8\"> The doctor testified that he had talked with the DSS investigator prior to examining Susan, and that they had agreed that he did not need to interview Susan about the alleged abuse by the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b471-9\"> The prosecutor\u2019s statements regarding the burden of proof were as follows: \u201cIt\u2019s a very high standard but it\u2019s the standard the Commonwealth readily accepts. It\u2019s not an impossible standard for you to deal with as jurors. It\u2019s a standard that\u2019s in front of jurors such as yourselves every day of the week, every day of the year in the Commonwealth and throughout the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">\u201cIt is not proof beyond all doubt. It\u2019s not proof to a certainty, like two plus two equals four, but proof beyond a reasonable doubt that you\u2019re convinced to a moral certainty that you can go home with a clear conscience as to the directness [m'c] of your decision. When you enter deliberations I submit to you there are a [sic] certain total truths about what you said, if you\u2019re sworn to duty, you\u2019re going to find. There is always room for doubt. Some doubt is a possible doubt, an imaginary doubt. There is always room for doubt, but the question is is there a reasonable doubt?\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b473-7\"> We note that the defendant made no request for curative instructions, nor did he suggest to the court how to resolve his concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b473-8\"> See note 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
