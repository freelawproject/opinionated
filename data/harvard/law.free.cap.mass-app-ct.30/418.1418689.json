Larson (Richard) for refusing to make child support payments to Judy R. Larson (Judy), as required by a separation agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>ment (the agreement) incorporated into, but explicitly surviving, the parties\u2019 divorce judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Richard presents several arguments against the judgments and the judge\u2019s refusal to set them aside on his motions. All of them condense to a single proposition: that the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction to enter the judgments. Richard\u2019s position, however, is based upon a misreading of a prior opinion of this court and a misapplication of principles of res judicata and related doctrines. We, accordingly, affirm the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">1. <em>The prior proceedings. </em>Richard, a surgeon, and Judy, a homemaker, obtained a judgment of divorce nisi from the Middlesex Probate and Family Court on March 31, 1983. The judgment ordered the parties to comply with the provisions of the agreement, which expressly survived the judgment with independent legal significance. The agreement required that Richard would pay Judy, as unallocated alimony for her support and that of the three children of the marriage (who were then nineteen, sixteen, and thirteen years old), the sum of $2,500 per month.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">The agreement provided that the monthly payments were to continue until certain specified events. The only terminating event relevant to this litigation was to occur when all of the children became \u201cemancipated according to law.\u201d The record is silent as to what the parties intended by that phrase. Upon that event, Richard\u2019s payments to Judy would cease to include child support and would equal thirty percent of his annual gross earned income. The agreement also obligated Richard to pay the children\u2019s educational and related expenses. Finally, it declared that any \u201cdispute or misunderstanding arising under this [ajgreement as to the meaning, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>interpretation, application or performance of any provision of this [agreement . . . shall be submitted to the Middlesex Probate and Family Court if the parties are unable to resolve the question by mutual agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">When the youngest child, Elizabeth, turned eighteen on April 1, 1987, Richard unilaterally decreased the amount of his monthly payments to Judy to one-twelfth of thirty percent of his annual gross earned income, which had by then been much diminished as a result of his voluntary reduction of the level of his medical practice. On August 24, 1987, Judy filed a complaint for contempt alleging that Richard\u2019s reduction in payments as of April 1, 1987, and each month thereafter violated the divorce judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">It was \u201capparent that Richard\u2019s reduction in support payments was pursuant to the emancipation clause of the agreement.\u201d <em>Larson </em>v. <em>Larson, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 338, 339 n.l (1990) <em>(Larson I). </em>Richard appears to have implicitly adopted the position that Elizabeth\u2019s eighteenth birthday on April 1, 1987, had triggered the support termination provision of the agreement and that the monthly child support obligation had thereupon ceased.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Inexplicably, however, neither party referred to or relied upon the agreement in the course of the proceedings on Judy\u2019s 1987 complaint for contempt. Instead, they tried the case on the single legal theory that G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, governed Judy\u2019s entitlement to child support.3 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Richard submitted as the outcome-determinative is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>sue that Judy failed to satisfy one of the two statutory standards authorizing the court to order support for a child between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one, namely, whether Elizabeth was \u201cprincipally dependent\u201d upon her for maintenance. See <em>Larson I, supra </em>at 339-341.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The judge disagreed with Richard and found for Judy on the \u201csole question\u201d whether Elizabeth was \u201cprincipally dependent\u201d upon her. <em>Id. </em>at 340.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On the first appeal, in addition to criticizing the judge\u2019s application of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, Richard advanced a contention not made below: \u201cthat the judge erred in determining that Elizabeth was not \u2018emancipated according to law\u2019 as provided in the separation agreement . . . [because] under Massachusetts law a child becomes emancipated upon attaining the age of eighteen years.\u201d <em>Larson I, supra </em>at 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">This court, however, rejected Richard\u2019s belated new argument in <em>Larson I. </em>We observed that the case had been tried below solely on the theory of the applicability of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, reminded Richard of the settled principle that the theory of law on which by assent a case is tried cannot be disregarded when the case comes before an appellate court for review, and stated unambiguously that \u201c[w]e, therefore, do not consider the question whether Elizabeth was emancipated as matter of law upon attaining the age of eighteen.\u201d <em>Larson </em>I, <em>supra </em>at 341. We affirmed the contempt judgment on the issue of principal dependency under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, and authorized Judy to file a petition for appellate costs and fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">2. <em>The present proceedings. </em>On April 1, 1990, when Elizabeth, then a college junior, became twenty-one, Richard again curtailed his child support payments, without explanation. On May 29, 1990, Judy filed a new complaint for contempt for the full amounts of the April and May, 1990, pay-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>merits.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Richard, who had by that time left Massachusetts to reside in Maine, was personally served on June 13, 1990, with copies of the complaint and the summons, which ordered him to appear at the Probate Court at 9:00 a.m. on August 1, 1990. At some point in early June, 1990, Richard\u2019s then attorney also received copies of these documents from Judy\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Meanwhile, Judy, acting pursuant to the authorization of <em>Larson </em>/, <em>supra </em>at 343-344, had filed a petition with this court for counsel fees and costs in connection with the first appeal on May 24, 1990. Though given a reasonable time to respond to the petition, Richard failed to do so, and neither he nor his counsel appeared at the scheduled June 26, 1990, hearing on the petition. On June 26, 1990, Richard was ordered by this court to pay Judy $9,193.57 as counsel fees and costs on or before July 26, 1990. The order further provided that \u201c[a]ny proceedings necessary to enforce payment are to be brought in the Probate Court.\u201d On July 27, 1990, Judy, having heard nothing from either Richard or his counsel, amended her complaint for contempt by adding claims for his failure to pay the fees and costs awarded by this court, as well as for his continued failure to make $2,600 payments for June and July, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">At the appointed August 1, 1990, contempt hearing before the Probate Court, neither Richard nor his counsel was present. No answer had been served to either the original or the amended complaint, nor was any motion for continuance filed. The judge found Richard in contempt and ordered him to pay Judy $27,083.79 in arrears, interest, and attorney\u2019s fees.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This judgment finally stirred Richard to action. On August 10, 1990, his then counsel filed motions for a new trial and for relief from the August 1, 1990, judgment, pursuant to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 59(a), 60(b)(4), and 60(b)(6) (1975). The sole ground for these motions was the assertion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>that the contempt judgment was void because the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction to enter any support orders with respect to a nondisabled child over the age of twenty-one. Accompanying the motions was an affidavit of Richard\u2019s then counsel attempting to explain the failure to appear at the August 1, 1990, hearing on the basis of the counsel\u2019s emergency surgery just before the hearing, his inability to contact Richard following receipt of Judy\u2019s May 29, 1990, complaint, and a failed effort to negotiate a continuance with Judy\u2019s counsel on the eve of the hearing.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On August 22, 1990, the judge held a hearing on Richard\u2019s motions. Richard appeared personally and by new counsel. His new attorney elaborated the lack of jurisdiction argument by propounding the theory that Judy was estopped by the prior proceedings to assert the applicability of the separation agreement, or to deny G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, as the sole basis for the Probate Court\u2019s jurisdiction. Since that statute conferred power to make support orders only as to children between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one and since the parties\u2019 youngest child was concededly over twenty-one, counsel argued that Richard was entitled to relief or a new trial on the ground of \u201cmistake of law . . . [namely] the entry of a judgment without jurisdiction. It is our position that under Section 28, this court cannot make an order for a [nondisabled] child over the age of twenty-one . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The judge questioned Richard at the August 22, 1990, hearing as to his reasons for not appearing or taking any action earlier. Richard testified, inconsistently with his former counsel\u2019s affidavit, that he had in fact discussed matters with his former counsel after reviewing Judy\u2019s May, 1990, complaint and was told by counsel that he did not have to appear. The judge also received an affidavit from Judy\u2019s attorney materially contradicting the affidavit of Richard\u2019s former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>counsel regarding the events surrounding that counsel\u2019s late July request for a stipulated continuance. With all this in hand, the judge denied Richard\u2019s motions (later recalling that he simply did not believe Richard\u2019s explanation for his nonappearance). Richard took a timely appeal from the denials and from the August 1, 1990, contempt judgment on August 24, 1990.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Judy then filed a second complaint for contempt, on August 29, 1990, alleging that Richard had failed to pay $15,290.22 of the $27,083.79 due under the August 1, 1990, contempt judgment. This time Richard answered, repeating his contention that the court\u2019s August orders were void as matter of law for want of jurisdiction, and also filed a motion to stay all proceedings until the determination of his pending appeal. At a September 26, 1990, hearing on Judy\u2019s second complaint and Richard\u2019s stay motion, Richard\u2019s counsel reiterated his previous position that Judy \u201cis estopped from denying it\u2019s anything but a [G. L. c. 208] Section 28 case, and that the case turned on the relatively narrow issue of whether you [the judge] exceeded your authority in ordering support for a child over the age of twenty-one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The judge denied Richard\u2019s stay motion, adjudged him in contempt, and ordered him to pay Judy $18,590.22, an amount Richard conceded he was able to pay.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Richard appealed from this judgment of contempt and obtained from a single justice of this court a stay of proceedings on both outstanding judgments pending resolution of his appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">3. <em>The Probate Court\u2019s jurisdiction. </em>Richard\u2019s entire argument on appeal depends upon the success of his proposition that the Probate Court\u2019s judgments are void as matter of law because the court lacked jurisdiction to order support once Elizabeth turned twenty-one.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Richard correctly states that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>a Probate Court judge has no authority under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, to make support orders for a child over twenty-one. He then insists that the court\u2019s only jurisdiction in this case was provided by that statute, leaving it without any basis to order support for a child such as Elizabeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Without citing or discussing <em>Kotler </em>v. <em>Spaulding, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 515, 517-520 (1987), Richard implicitly acknowledges that, where a divorce judgment provides by its terms for child support past the age of twenty-one, the Probate Court retains the power to enforce the provision through contempt orders. He contends, however, that the parties\u2019 agreement here is no longer a source of jurisdiction, despite its express bestowal of jurisdiction on the Probate Court over disputes as to its meaning and application. Judy is barred from resort to the agreement, he maintains, by the doctrines of claim preclusion, issue preclusion, and judicial estoppel. He asserts that <em>Larson I </em>operates as res judicata, precluding Judy from relying on the agreement, because she has waived her rights to child support pursuant to the agreement. The alleged waiver consisted of allowing the earlier litigation to proceed solely on the basis of G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Richard\u2019s argument<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> is without merit. The contention that Judy waived reliance on the agreement ignores the determinative fact that this appeal does not deal with the same claims, issues, or arguments as did <em>Larson I. </em>That decision announced, as emphatically as could be done, that it did not address the agreement, let alone consider the meaning or application of the term \u201cemancipated according to law.\u201d <em>Larson I</em>, <em>supra </em>at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">a. <em>Claim preclusion. </em>This doctrine, traditionally known as merger or bar, prohibits the maintenance of any action based on the same claim that was the subject of and was decided in an earlier action between the parties or their privies. <em>Heacock </em>v. <em>Heacock, </em>402 Mass. 21, 23 (1988). <em>Bagley </em>v. <em>Moxley, </em>407 Mass. 633, 636-637 (1990). It has no application to the instant matter because the contempt judgments appealed from constituted new claims based on different facts from those at issue in <em>Larson I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The original contempt judgment that gave rise to <em>Larson I, </em>dated September 30, 1988, involved claims for violation of' the divorce judgment\u2019s monthly payment obligations through that date only, as did the <em>Larson I </em>opinion. The judgments at issue in the present appeal cover claims for subsequent payment violations, from April through September, 1990. These later violations were not and could not have been raised in the original action because the times for payment had not yet occurred or given rise to any cause of action in favor of Judy. Each violation of Richard\u2019s continuing monthly payment obligation under the divorce judgment constituted a new claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>for preclusion purposes, as with any contract calling for continuous separate performances over a period of time or for payment of money in separate installments. See <em>Dunbar </em>v. Dunbar, 180 Mass. 170, 173 (1901), aff'd, 190 U.S. 340 (1903); <em>Phelps </em>v. <em>Shawprint, Inc., </em>328 Mass. 352, 356-358 (1952); 18 Wright, Miller &amp; Cooper, Federal Practice &amp; Procedure \u00a7 4409, at 77-78 n.11 (1981); 4 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7\u00a7 948, 949, &amp; 956 (1951). Accordingly, the doctrine of claim preclusion cannot provide a basis for Richard\u2019s jurisdictional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">b. <em>Issue preclusion. </em>This modern term for collateral estoppel prevents relitigation of an issue of fact or law determined in an earlier action when the same issue arises in a later proceeding, even though based on a different claim, between the parties or their privies. <em>Heacock, supra </em>at 23 n.2. The central requirements are that the issue sought to be foreclosed was actually litigated and was essential to the decision in the prior action. See <em>Cousineau </em>v. <em>Laramee, </em>388 Mass. 859, 863 n.4 (1983); <em>Moat </em>v. <em>Ducharme, </em>28 Mass. App. Ct. 749, 753 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">Neither of these prerequisites obtains here. <em>Larson I </em>dealt exclusively with the propriety and sufficiency of the judge\u2019s finding that Elizabeth was \u201cprincipally dependent\u201d upon Judy under G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28. No issue relating to the agreement was litigated or essential to the rulings in that prior action; indeed, they were expressly disavowed by both courts as a basis for their decisions. The prior action concerned Richard\u2019s support obligation to a child between eighteen and twenty-one; the present claim involves his obligation to a child over twenty-one. Issue preclusion has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">c. <em>Judicial estoppel. </em>This term appears to describe the doctrine that a party who has maintained one position in a legal proceeding may not, in a subsequent proceeding between the same parties, assume a contrary or inconsistent position, at least when the prior position has been acted or relied upon by an adverse party. While this basic principle seems to be recognized in Massachusetts, see <em>Brown </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Quinn, </em>406 Mass. 641, 646 (1990), application of the doctrine would be inappropriate here because Judy has not taken contrary positions in the two lawsuits. It is perfectly consistent for her to have argued, in the prior case, that Elizabeth was principally dependent upon her for support, as defined by G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, and to argue, in the present action, that Richard remains bound to pay child support pursuant to the agreement. Cf. <em>Turner </em>v. <em>McCune, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 864, 865 (1976) (emancipation is not automatic upon reaching the age of majority). Compare <em>Brown v. Quinn, supra </em>at 646 (argument that an appeal was premature estopped because it contradicted party\u2019s earlier position that judgment appealed from was final). Until Elizabeth turned twenty-one, Judy in fact had no occasion or necessity to resort to the agreement, since G. L. c. 208, \u00a7 28, provided a sufficient alternative basis to enforce Richard\u2019s support obligations.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In summary, Richard\u2019s res judicata arguments are inapposite. The Probate Court had ample sources of authority, including the agreement, to act on Judy\u2019s complaint, and its judgments were therefore not void for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">4. <em>Other arguments. </em>Richard\u2019s only contention on appeal not founded on his unsuccessful jurisdictional points is directed to the judge\u2019s alleged abuse of discretion in denying his rule 59(a) motion for a new trial. He presents, however, no reasoned analysis of the circumstances constituting the alleged abuse. Richard\u2019s cursory, three-sentence presentation does not assist the court with meaningful citation of authority and cannot be said to rise to the level of acceptable appellate argument under Mass.R.A.P. 16(a)(4), as amended, 367 Mass. 921 (1975). See <em>Lolos </em>v. <em>Berlin, </em>338 Mass. 10, 13-14 (1958); <em>Hastoupis </em>v. <em>Gargas, </em>9 Mass. App. Ct. 27, 39 (1980). Richard\u2019s position with respect to the judge\u2019s refusal to grant him relief from the August 1, 1990, judgment under rule 60(b) makes no mention of any abuse of discretion by the judge. Rather, it rests entirely on the court\u2019s supposed lack of jurisdiction and consequent voidness of its judgments. Given the inconsistent statements of Richard and his attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>ney as to the purported reasons for their failures to answer or appear at the August 1, 1990, hearing, as well as the conflicting affidavits of counsel regarding the background of the nonappearance, there was no abuse of discretion in the judge\u2019s denial of Richard\u2019s motions in any event. Deference is particularly due the judge\u2019s exercise of discretion because of his lengthy involvement in the proceeding. <em>Burger Chef Sys., Inc. </em>v. <em>Servfast of Brockton, Inc., </em>393 Mass. 287, 289 (1984).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">5. <em>Costs and fees on appeal. </em>Both parties have requested an award of counsel fees and costs in connection with this appeal. Richard\u2019s appeal having failed, he is not entitled to them. <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, </em>406 Mass. 17, 20 (1989). Richard has conceded his ability to pay any judgments issued and is in a financial position to defray the costs of this appeal superior to that of Judy, who has prevailed. Judy was awarded fees and costs not only for the first appeal but also for the two 1990 contempt proceedings in the Probate Court, which awards Richard does not here contest. Therefore, as in the prior appeal, Judy may submit to this court a motion for counsel fees within thirty days after issuance of our rescript, in accordance with the procedural requirements of <em>Yorke Mgmt. </em>v. <em>Castro, supra </em>at 20. See <em>Larson I, supra </em>at 343-344.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">\n<em>Order denying motion for new trial affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> Richard filed two separate notices of appeal: one on August 24, 1990, from the August 1, 1990, contempt judgment and the August 22, 1990, denials of his motions for new trial and relief from that judgment; and the other taken on September 28, 1990, from a judgment of contempt entered September 26, 1990.

Instead, he asserts that, \u201c[bjecause the original contempt [in <em>Larson </em>7] was pre-tried, tried and decided on appeal as a Section 28 proceeding, traditional views of emancipation and the factors employed to determine whether it has occurred were not then and are not now applicable to the facts of the case.\u201d Both Judy\u2019s May 24, 1990, contempt complaint and July 27, 1990, amended contempt complaint alleged the continued applicability of Richard\u2019s obligation to make monthly support payments \u201cuntil the youngest child is emancipated according to law.\u201d Although Richard was not deemed to have admitted these averments by his failure to deny them in a responsive pleading (there is no rule in the domestic relations rules corresponding to Mass.R.Civ.P. 8(d), 365 Mass. 750 (1974); see Kindregan &amp; Inker, Family Law &amp; Practice \u00a7 184, at 267 [1990]), and although Richard\u2019s September 24, 1990, answer did deny the same allegation contained in Judy\u2019s August 29, 1990, contempt complaint and averred further that \u201cthe claim for child support is barred by the child\u2019s emancipation and her having obtained the age of 21,\u201d he did not, as noted above, subsequently press or argue this point, but rather appears to have expressly abandoned it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\"> Richard did not affirmatively set forth estoppel or res judicata as defenses in his answer to Judy\u2019s August, 1990, contempt complaint, as required by Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 8(c) (1975); nor did he raise them in arguing against the judgment on her May, 1990, contempt complaint or her July, 1990, amended contempt complaint, which he never answered, contrary to Mass.R.Dom.Rel.P. 7(a) &amp; 8(b) (1975). The judge nonetheless allowed Richard to present his jurisdictional argument during the hearings below, without objection from Judy, so the failure to plead was not fatal. Compare <em>Brash </em>v. <em>Brash, </em>407 Mass. 101, 104 n.4 (1990); <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Davidson, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 364, 368 n.3 (1985). In any event, since the issues may recur as to future monthly payment obligations, we would choose to discuss them in the interest of judicial economy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b455-8\"> Since each monthly payment obligation under the agreement gives rise to a separate claim, see the discussion in part 3a, <em>supra </em>at 11-12, Richard remains free to raise any arguments he may have against enforcement of that agreement in a future proceeding, including whether Elizabeth has become \u201cemancipated according to law.\u201d This court is unable to make such a determination on the present record, because the issue was not briefed or argued either before the Probate Court or on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
