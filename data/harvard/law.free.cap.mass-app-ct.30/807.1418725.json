L. c. 94C, \u00a7 32A) and false impersonation to obtain a driver\u2019s license (G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24B). The defendant moved to suppress the evidence. His motion was denied, and, after a jury trial in the Superior Court, he was convicted on both charges.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The threshold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>(and dispositive) issue is whether the information contained in the affidavit supporting the application for the search warrant provided probable cause for issuing the warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-5\">Plymouth police officer William E. Curtis prepared the affidavit. In it, he provided the following information concerning an alleged motor vehicle theft ring. On December 17, 1987, an unidentified informant, \u201cwhose information has led to court convictions in the past,\u201d told Officer Curtis that a Michael Ostrander had been involved in the larceny of two Ford pickup trucks in New Bedford on December 15, 1987. New Bedford police verified that two Ford pickups had been stolen, one yellow, Massachusetts registration 325-070, and one red, Massachusetts registration A/L 62601. Ostrander was arrested at 34 Colonial Terrace in Plymouth several days later on various outstanding warrants. The stolen red pickup truck was located outside his apartment and he was charged with its theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">A day or so after Ostrander\u2019s arrest, Officer Curtis again spoke to the unnamed informant. The informant told Curtis that he believed that the second stolen pickup truck, yellow with a white cap, was located behind a gray apartment building at 189 Standish Avenue in Plymouth. A person named Ralph, who lived in a first floor apartment at that address, had \u201cgotten\u201d the truck from Ostrander. The informant further stated that \u201cRalph\u201d drove a black Oldsmobile Toronado automobile with Rhode Island registration plates. The informant \u201cthought\u201d the Toronado was also stolen.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">That day, Officer Curtis went to the Standish Avenue address. He saw a yellow Ford pickup with a yellow cap behind the building. In front of the building stood a black Oldsmobile Toronado with Rhode Island plates. The Oldsmobile was listed to Mark A. Boyden, of 14 Eddy Street, Providence, Rhode Island. At the time Ostrander was arrested, he had in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>his possession a false Maine driver\u2019s license bearing the name Charles Mariacher. Seized from Ostrander\u2019s apartment was a set of license plates traced to Charles Mariacher of 44 Eddy Street, Providence, Rhode Island. In Officer Curtis\u2019s \u201copinion\u201d Ostrander and \u201cRalph\u201d were involved in the theft and \u201cprobably\u201d the resale of motor vehicles.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">On the basis of this information, Officer Curtis obtained a warrant to search the black Oldsmobile Toronado, the yellow Ford pickup truck, and the first floor apartment at the left side of 189 Standish Avenue for motor vehicle titles, registration plates, and \u201cany other contraband.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">\u201cUnder art. 14 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights a search warrant must be supported by probable cause. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Upton, </em>394 Mass. 363, 370 (1985). ... In <em>Upton, </em>[the Supreme Judicial Court] set forth the standard for determining whether information received from an unidentified informant is sufficiently reliable to give rise to probable cause under art. 14. <em>Id. </em>at 373. The <em>Upton </em>court stated: \u2018[I]f an affidavit is based on information from an unknown informant, the magistrate must \u201cbe informed of (1) some of the underlying circumstances from which the informant concluded that the contraband was where he claimed it was (the basis of knowledge test), and (2) some of the underlying circumstances from which the affiant concluded that the informant was \u2018credible\u2019 or his information \u2018reliable\u2019 (the veracity test). ... If the informant\u2019s tip does not satisfy each aspect of the . . . test, other allegations in the affidavit that corroborate the information could support a finding of probable cause. . . (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>at 374-375. This continues to be the law in this Commonwealth and provides the standard under which this case must be decided.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lapine, </em>410 Mass. 38, 40-41 (1991) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">Here, the supporting affidavit presented none of the circumstances underlying the unnamed informant\u2019s assertions and thus did not fulfil the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong of the test. Nor did the police officer\u2019s investigation following his conversation with the informant provide sufficient indepen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>dent verification to remedy that deficiency. As a result, the affidavit failed to establish probable cause to issue the search warrant, see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bottari, </em>395 Mass. <em>777, </em>783 (1985), and the motion to suppress should have been allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The informant\u2019s tip purporting to link \u201cRalph\u201d to criminal activity and to the premises to be searched, consisted of the following: 1) \u201cRalph\u201d somehow acquired the stolen yellow pickup truck from Ostrander; 2) the truck was located behind the Standish Avenue apartment building; 3) \u201cRalph\u201d drove a black Oldsmobile Toronado automobile with Rhode Island registration plates \u201cthought\u201d by the informant to be stolen; and 4) \u201cRalph\u201d lived in a first floor apartment on the left in the Standish Avenue building. The tip thus was made up of primarily conclusory statements that could have been based on \u201ccasual rumor\u201d and speculation. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>381 Mass. 301, 302-303 (1980). There is no explanation of how the informant acquired the information that \u201cRalph\u201d acquired the stolen pickup truck from Ostrander, or of the basis for the informant\u2019s belief that the black Oldsmobile Toronado had been stolen. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Allen, </em>406 Mass. 575, 578 (1990) (Unnamed informants\u2019 information based on hearsay from third parties whose reliability was not established fails the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d test). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, </em>407 Mass. 891, 896-897 (1990) (An unnamed informant\u2019s tip contained sufficient detail about the defendant\u2019s appearance, background, and behavior to permit the inference that his information was based on personal observation); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>DiAntonio, </em>8 Mass. App. Ct. 434, 438-439 (1979) (A confidential informant\u2019s statements indicated that he had direct knowledge of the criminal activity, \u201cbased on personal observation and contacts which went materially beyond \u2018a casual rumor circulating in the underworld or an accusation based merely on an individual\u2019s general reputation\u2019 \u201d). Nor does the affidavit present any basis for the informant\u2019s assertion that \u201cRalph\u201d lived in the Standish Street apartment. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, </em>393 Mass. 703, 716 n. 10 (1985) (Observations of defendants entering residences to be searched, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>the fact that their vehicles were registered at the residences, provided probable cause to believe that the defendants resided at those premises).</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">Except for the connection between Ostrander and the stolen red pickup truck, the informant\u2019s claims are either insufficiently corroborated or uncorroborated by other allegations in the affidavit. The yellow pickup truck that Officer Curtis saw at the Standish Avenue address did not fit the informant\u2019s description of the stolen pickup truck. The former had a yellow cap, the latter a white cap. Although the affidavit gives a registration number for the stolen yellow pickup truck, it provides no registration for the pickup truck Officer Curtis saw and there is no further information to support the conclusion that it was in fact the truck stolen in New Bedford. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Baldwin, 11 Mass. App. Ct. 386, 391-392 (1981). Likewise, the information provided by Officer Curtis concerning the ownership of the Oldsmobile Toronado fails to verify the informant\u2019s claim that the automobile was stolen. No independent information supports the informant\u2019s assertion that \u201cRalph\u201d lived in the Standish Avenue apartment. Finally, the fact that license plates traced to an address at 14 Eddy Street, in Providence, Rhode Island, were found at Ostrander\u2019s apartment, while the Oldsmobile Toronado was listed as belonging to a person living at a different Eddy Street- address, does not assist in reaching a conclusion that stolen goods were likely to be found in the Standish Avenue apartment in Plymouth. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Kaufman, </em>381 Mass, at 303-305. Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Burt, supra </em>at 711-715; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cast, supra </em>at 897-898.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">Because the affidavit supporting the search warrant did not contain any solid information linking \u201cRalph\u201d either to criminal activity or to the Standish Avenue apartment, it did not provide a sufficient basis for concluding that stolen property could \u201creasonably ... be expected to be located\u201d in that apartment. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cinelli, </em>389 Mass. 197, 213, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 860 (1983). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number><em>Wright, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 245, 250-251 (1983). Compare <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saleh, </em>396 Mass. 406, 409-412 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pratt, </em>407 Mass. 647, 661-662 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">As the evidence seized during the search constituted the entire basis for the defendant\u2019s convictions, the judgments are reversed, the verdicts are set aside, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of findings of not guilty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Funches, </em>379 Mass. 283, 296-297 (1979). Contrast <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>383 Mass. 272, 283-285 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b838-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b833-15\"> The indictment for false impersonation to obtain a driver\u2019s license was placed on file with the defendant\u2019s consent. \u201cOrdinarily, we do not consider appeals from indictments placed on file, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Delgado, </em>367 Mass. 432, 438 (1975), but in the interest of efficiency and in a suita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>ble case we may choose to do so. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bianco, </em>388 Mass. 358, 364-365 (1983).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Chappee, </em>397 Mass. 508, 523 (1986). Here, the filed indictment may appropriately be considered because the defendant\u2019s claim that the search warrant was invalid applies to both indictments.
