The complaint sought both injunctive relief and damages as a result of the defendant\u2019s failure to allow the inspection.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-17\">In December, 1986, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. At the suggestion of a Superior Court judge, the parties entered into a statement of agreed facts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>provide a basis for a report of a question of law to this court pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The judge then reported the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">\u201cDoes plaintiff have a right to inspect and copy the . Fall River Gas Company stockholders list for the purpose of identifying current stockholders whom he can contact in order to determine whether they are willing to sell their shares of Company stock to him for his own investment portfolio?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">The plaintiff claims that, as a stockholder, he has the right under G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to inspect and copy the stockholders list for his stated purpose. The defendant responds that, because the plaintiff\u2019s purpose in examining the list is solely for his personal gain, he is not entitled, under the statute, to inspect and copy the stockholders list.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">We summarize the agreed facts. The plaintiff has been a stockholder of the defendant since 1980. The defendant, a Massachusetts gas company within the meaning of G. L. c. 164, has only one class of stock, of which there are 296,757 shares issued and outstanding. The stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>On September 14, 1984, the plaintiff made a formal written request that he be permitted to inspect and copy a list of all stockholders of the defendant company. According to the statement of agreed facts, \u201c[t]he purpose of Plaintiff\u2019s request . . . was to learn the identity of Company stockholders in order to determine whether there were stockholders willing to sell their Company shares to him. Plaintiff was happy with current management of the Company and . . . wished to change [neither] management nor its policies. . . . Plaintiff has stated under oath that if he is permitted the inspection which he seeks, he will use the Company stockholders lists solely to make inquiries of Company stockholders to see if they are willing to sell their shares of Company stock to him. The Defendant [] [does] not contend that Plaintiff intends to sell the stockholders list . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">An answer to the reported question requires an interpretation of G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32. In doing so, we are guided by the principle that \u201c[statutes are to be interpreted, not alone according to their simple, literal or strict verbal meaning, but in connection with their development, their progression through the legislative body, the history of the times, [and] prior legislation. . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Welosky, </em>276 Mass. 398, 401-402 (1931). See also <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bohn, </em>377 Mass. 544, 547-548 (1979). Therefore, a short history of the rights of stockholders to inspect stockholders lists is in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">At common law, stockholders had the right to inspect the books and records of their corporations if the stockholders were acting in good faith and for the purposes of advancing the corporation\u2019s interest and protecting their rights as owners. <em>Varney </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>194 Mass. 239, 240-241 (1907). The right, therefore, was not absolute, and it could not be \u201cexercised for mere curiosity, or for merely speculative purposes, or vexatiously.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 241. There was, however, strong resistance by corporate officers to <em>any </em>attempts by minority stockholders to inspect the books and records. To counteract that resistance, legislatures in several States, toward the close of the Nineteenth Century, gave stockholders an unrestricted right to inspect stockholders lists and other corporate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>records. See <em>Crouse </em>v. <em>Rogers Park Apartments, Inc., </em>343 Ill. App. 319, 322 (1951). In Massachusetts, the Legislature followed the trend and enacted St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 30, which amended the predecessor to G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 22, then the only statute applicable to inspection of corporate records by a stockholder.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 5The amendment was interpreted by the Supreme Judicial Court as eliminating \u201cthe restrictions imposed at common law on the examination of the stock and transfer books of a domestic corporation.\u201d <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>234 Mass. 592, 595 (1920). Consequently, as a result of the 1903 amendment to G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 22, a stockholder had an unrestricted right to inspect and copy stockholders lists, even if the stockholder\u2019s sole purpose was to use the information for his personal gain.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">Apparently in response to the holding in <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>the Legislature in 1923 again amended G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 22. See St. 1923, c. 172. The amendment removed the stockholder\u2019s unlimited right to inspect stockholders lists and provided that \u201cit shall be a defence that the actual purpose and reason for the inspection sought are to secure a list of stockholders for the purpose of selling said list or copies thereof or <em>of using the same for a purpose other than in the interest of an applicant, as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the corporation </em>...\u201d (emphasis added). Identical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>language is found in G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, the statute under review here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Here, the plaintiffs sole purpose for inspecting and copying the defendant\u2019s stockholders list, as framed by the reported question, is to identify \u201ccurrent stockholders whom he can contact in order to determine whether they are willing to sell their shares of Company stock to him <em>for his own investment </em>portfolio\u201d (emphasis added). That purpose, it is clear, was solely for the benefit of the plaintiff and is not, as required by G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, \u201cin the interest of the [plaintiff], as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the corporation,\u201d and, in deciding the narrow issue before us, we hold that a stockholder in a company does not have the right to inspect stockholders lists where his <em>sole </em>purpose is to obtain information that might result in acquiring additional company stock for his investment portfolio.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">We are aware that some States, under their statutes, allow such inspections for the purpose stated by the plaintiff. Those statutes, however, appear to emphasize the personal interest of the stockholder and do not contain our statutory language referring to the \u201cinterest of the applicant, as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the corporation.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We cannot ignore <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>any provision of a statute when we are engaged in the interpretation of a legislative enactment. See <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Bevs. Control Commn., </em>377 Mass. 231, 234 (1979) (\u201cIt is a common tenet of statutory construction that, whenever possible, no provision of a legislative enactment should be treated as superfluous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The decisions in <em>Hanrahan </em>v. <em>Puget Sound Power &amp; Light Co., </em>332 Mass. 586 (1955), and <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>347 Mass. 274 (1964), are not controlling. In the <em>Hanrahan </em>case, stockholders were interested in having the defendant corporation merge with another corporation. The stockholders sought inspection of the stockholders list in order to solicit proxies on behalf of a promerger committee and thereby attempt to elect a management which would actively seek a merger. The court stated: \u201cWith the business merits of such a merger we are not concerned; that is a question for the stockholders to determine. All that we are concerned with is whether this objective is such a purpose as to fall outside the plaintiffs\u2019 interest \u2018as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the corporation.\u2019 Plainly a change in the management and policy of the corporation affects the plaintiffs\u2019 rights as stockholders and is certainly relative to the affairs of the corporation.\u201d 332 Mass, at 592. Because the purpose in that case was \u201crelative to the affairs of the corporation,\u201d inspection was permitted. In the <em>Donaldson </em>case, the plaintiff, a stockholder in the defendant corporation, made a request to inspect the defendant\u2019s stockholders list to solicit proxies \u201cin order to obtain a measure of control\u201d of the company. 347 Mass, at 280. The court held that \u201c[t]he solicitation of proxies in order to try to change management is a proper purpose.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>Here, the plaintiffs purpose in inspecting the stockholders lists was not to pursue issues of corporate governance, policy, or control, but instead solely for his own personal reasons. We hasten to add that, if a stockholder does have a proper purpose in making a request to inspect a stockholders list, the fact that he may have personal, or indeed even selfish, motives in making the request does not render his purpose improper. See <em>Donaldson </em>v. <em>Boston Herald-Traveler Corp., </em>347 Mass. at 280. That is, however, not the case here in light of the reported question and the statement of agreed facts entered into by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">We answer the question reported by the Superior Court, \u201cNo.\u201d The matter is remanded to the Superior Court for further proceedings in accordance with this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\"> Under rule 64, the court may not report a case to this court for determination without making any decision unless the parties have agreed in writing \u201cas to all the material facts.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b796-9\"> General Laws c. 156B, \u00a7 32, as inserted by St. 1964, c. 723, \u00a7 1, provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b796-10\">\u201cIf any officer or agent of a corporation having charge of . . . [the Company\u2019s stock and transfer records] refuses or neglects to exhibit them in legible form or to produce for examination a list of stockholders with the record address and amount of stock owned by each, he or the corporation shall be liable to any stockholder for all actual damages sustained by reason of such refusal or neglect, but in an action for damages or a proceeding in equity under this section for neglect or refusal to exhibit for inspection the stock and transfer records, <em>it shall be a defence that the actual purpose and reason for the inspection sought are to secure a list of stockholders or other information for the purpose of selling said list or information or copies thereof or of using the same for a purpose other than in the interest of the applicant, as a stockholder, relative to the affairs of the </em>corporation\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b798-6\"> St. 1903, c. 437, \u00a7 30, in pertinent part, read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">\u201cThe stock and transfer books of every corporation, which shall contain a complete list of all stockholders, their residences and the amount of stock held by each, shall be kept at an office of the corporation in this Commonwealth for the inspection of its stockholders. ... If any officer or agent of a corporation having charge of such . . . books . . . refuses or neglects to exhibit them or to submit them to examination ... he or the corporation shall be liable to any stockholder for all actual damages sustained by reason of such refusal or neglect, and the supreme judicial court or the superior court shall have jurisdiction in equity, upon petition of a stockholder, to order any or all of said . . . books ... to be exhibited to him and to such other stockholders as may become parties to said petition, at such a place and time as may be designated in the order.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b798-8\"> In <em>Shea </em>v. <em>Parker, supra, </em>the stockholder was also a stockbroker. His stated purpose in seeking inspection of the stockholders list was to use the information, thus obtained, in his business as a stockbroker.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\"> Because of the nature of the defendant\u2019s business, G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, and not G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 22, is applicable to the defendant. In 1964, the Legislature enacted G. L. c. 156B (the Business Corporation Law). Because the defendant is a gas company, organized under G. L. c. 164, certain sections of G. L. c. 156B, including \u00a7 32, apply to its operations. See G. L. c. 164, \u00a7 <em>4(a). </em>Given their identical language, the interpretation of G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, is affected by the interpretation of G. L. c. 155, \u00a7 22, and the two statutes should be interpreted as being consistent with each other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-8\"> For example, compare the provisions of G. L. c. 156B, \u00a7 32, with Delaware Code Ann. tit. 8, \u00a7 220(b) (1983). The Delaware statute states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">\u201c(b) Any stockholder .. . shall. . . have the right ... to inspect for any proper purpose ... a list of its stockholders .... A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person\u2019s interest as a stockholder. . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-10\">Section 16.02(c) of the Model Business Corporation Act (Supp. 1986) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">\u201c(c) A shareholder may inspect and copy [shareholder lists] only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>(1) his demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">(2) he describes with reasonable particularity his purpose and the records he desires to inspect; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-8\">(3) the records are directly connected with his purpose.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-9\">In the \u201cOfficial Comment\u201d to \u00a7 16.02(c), it is stated, \u201cA \u2018proper purpose\u2019 means a purpose that is reasonably relevant to the demanding shareholder\u2019s interest as a shareholder.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
