L. c. 231 A, a declaration that, in the computation of his accidental disability retirement allowance, \u201cregular compensation for his employment in the public service\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, includes payments received pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>G. L. c. 152 and G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A.* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendants, the Commissioner of the Division of Public Employee Retirement Administration (PERA), and the treasurer-chairman of the Worcester County retirement system (WCRS), moved to dismiss the plaintiffs complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See Mass.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), 365 Mass. 755 (1974). After a hearing, a judge of the Superior Court allowed the defendants\u2019 motion.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Judgment entered for the defendants and this appeal ensued.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-4\">The plaintiffs complaint alleges that on January 5, 1981, he sustained personal injuries in the course of his employment as a correction officer at the Worcester County jail and house of correction. Since 1981, the plaintiff has received weekly workers\u2019 compensation payments plus a sum equal to the difference between his wages at the time of the accident and those workers\u2019 compensation payments from the Commonwealth pursuant to G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>In December of 1985, the plaintiff filed an application with the WCRS, requesting an accidental disability retirement allowance as prescribed by G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7. The application was approved by WCRS and PERA and the plaintiff\u2019s c. 152 and c. 126, \u00a7 18A, payments were discontinued by his employer at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">A dispute then arose between the plaintiff and PERA over the computation of the plaintiff\u2019s accidental disability retirement allowance. The essence of the dispute concerned whether the term \u201cregular compensation\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1,* ***<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> includes payments the plaintiff has received pursuant to c. 152 and c. 126, \u00a7 18A. PERA took the position that it did not.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The plaintiff did not appeal the decision of PERA, but rather withdrew his application for accidental disability retirement. On August 20, 1987, the WCRS voted to accept the withdrawal of the plaintiff\u2019s application and his employer has now restored his c. 152 and c. 126 benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Supreme Judicial Court has had occasion to construe the definition of \u201cregular compensation\u201d in c. 32, \u00a7 1, and has concluded that \u201c[i]n the words \u2018salary, wages or other compensation in whatever form\u2019 the last generic phrase takes its color of meaning from \u2018salary\u2019 and \u2018wages\u2019 . . . , and the whole refers to remuneration geared to work or services performed; . . . .\u201d <em>Boston Assn. of Sch. Administrators &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. 336, 341 (1981) (citation omitted). Workers\u2019 compensation insurance is not paid \u201cfor the individual service of the employee\u201d (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1), but instead is paid only where the employee cannot perform any service due to injury. See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 29. It thus is neither a \u201csalary\u201d nor a \u201cwage\u201d and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>is therefore not \u201cremuneration geared to work or services performed.\u201d 383 Mass. at 341. See <em>State Bd. of Retirement </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>391 Mass. 92, 94 (1984) (\u201cwe need not look beyond the words of the statute where the language is plain and unambiguous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\">Similarly, workers\u2019 compensation insurance is not paid \u201cby the employing authority\u201d (G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1) but instead is paid by an insurer (or self-insurer). See G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 34. Thus, with respect to both the source of the payment and its purpose, workers\u2019 compensation insurance fails to meet the threshold requirements of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 l.6 *<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Accordingly, for purposes of computing the accidental disability retirement allowance, the term \u201cregular compensation for his employment in the public service\u201d within G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 7, does not include workers\u2019 compensation payments received under c. 152. To conclude otherwise would effectively undermine the legislative purpose behind the retirement law which is to prevent the introduction of ad hoc payments into the calculation of pension allowances and ensure a minimum level of predictability in computing pension payments made out of the retirement system. See <em>Boston Assn. of Sch. Administrators &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. at 341 (regular compensation \u201cimparts the idea of ordinariness or normality as well as the idea of recurrence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Likewise, the payments received by the plaintiff as an employee of a county jail pursuant to G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, are not \u201cregular compensation\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 32, \u00a7 1. Section 18A provides that the benefit received shall be \u201cthe difference between the weekly cash benefits to which [the employee] is entitled under [the workers\u2019 compensation act] and <em>his regular </em>salary\u201d (emphasis added). Implicit in this language is the assumption that workers\u2019 compensation and the supplemental payment are not themselves <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>regular compensation, but instead are a substitute for an employee\u2019s \u201cregular salary.\u201d For this reason, if no other, \u00a7 18A payments may not appropriately be used to calculate accidental disability retirement allowances. <em>Boston Assn. of Sch. Administrators &amp; Supervisors </em>v. <em>Boston Retirement Bd., </em>383 Mass. at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We conclude that PERA\u2019s determination that the amount of \u201cregular compensation\u201d to be used in calculating the plaintiffs retirement allowance \u201cwould be the annual rate of his regular compensation [as] of the date that he last received regular compensation, most likely the date of the injury\u201d is correct. The judgment is vacated (see note 4, <em>supra), </em>and a new judgment is to be entered declaring that payments made to an employee pursuant to G. L. c. 152 and G. L. c. 126, \u00a7 18A, must be excluded from the computation of accidental disability retirement allowances.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"AG\"> General Laws c. 32, \u00a7 7(2), as appearing in St. 1982, c. 630, \u00a7 18, provides in part: \u201cUpon retirement under the provisions of this section a member shall receive an accidental disability retirement allowance to be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>come effective. . . on the date for which he last received regular compensation for his employment in the public service . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-7\"> General Laws c. 126, \u00a7 18A, as appearing in St. 1977, c. 1002, provides in part that \u201c[a]n employee in a jail or house of correction. . . who, while in the performance of duty, receives bodily injuries . . . and who as result of such injury is entitled to benefits under [c. 152], shall be paid, in addition to the benefits of said [c. 152], the difference between the weekly cash benefits to which he is entitled under said [c. 152] and his regular salary . . . .\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> The motion should not have been allowed.

Ordinarily we might simply vacate the judgment and remand the matter for further proceedings. See <em>Motor Club of America Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>All American Rental, Inc., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1031, 1032 (1982). Here, however, the case was argued on the footing that the facts are undisputed (the judge recited the facts in his memorandum of decision). As the determinative question of law has been fully briefed we proceed to consider it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\"> The question whether the plaintiff was required to appeal the decision of PERA to the Contributory Retirement Appeal Board (CRAB) before seeking judicial relief needs no extended discussion. The question is controlled by the principles set out in <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Administrator of the Div. of Personnel Adm., </em>377 Mass. 217, 220-222 (1979), and <em>Martell </em>v. <em>Teachers\u2019 Retirement Bd., </em>20 Mass.

[or] early retirement incentives\u201d \u2014 are to be excluded from the definition of \u201cregular compensation.\u201d Workers\u2019 compensation payments fit more comfortably into this category of excluded compensation than into the definition of \u201cregular compensation.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
