The plaintiffs alleged that the town was liable under G. L. c. 258, \u00a7 2, for the negligence of its building inspector in giving the plaintiffs\u2019 contractor oral permission to build on the property when, under G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, the Wetlands Protection Act, such construction would not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>permitted. A Superior Court judge, relying on <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801, 804 (1982), and its progeny, allowed the town\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and final judgment was entered on the claim against the town pursuant to Mass.R.Civ.P. 54(b), 365 Mass. 821 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b830-5\">The judge based his decision on the following facts alleged in the complaint to which the town, for purposes of the motion, stipulated. The plaintiffs purchased land from a developer on which they wished to build a residence. In the fall of 1988, their contractor obtained oral permission from the town\u2019s building inspector to begin construction, and construction began. A written permit was issued in March of 1989. On February 5, 1989, however, the town\u2019s conservation commission issued an order for the work to cease because of noncompliance with the Wetlands Protection Act. The plaintiffs have been unable to satisfy the conservation commission\u2019s concerns. They are, thus, unable to build a residence on their property and have suffered economic loss. With respect to the building inspector\u2019s authority to issue permits, a town bylaw provides: \u201cNo permit shall be issued by the Building Inspector unless the application for permit indicates compliance with . . . the Wetlands Protection Act, if applicable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-6\">In <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. 801 (1982), purchasers of a single-family home which suffered water damage alleged causal negligence on the part of a building inspector in the issuance of building and occupancy permits to the builder from whom the plaintiffs purchased the house. The court held that no action against a municipality for negligent inspection to check compliance with the building code could be maintained \u201cin the absence of a special duty owed to the plaintiffs, different from that owed to the public at large.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 810. The court noted that building codes are generally enacted for the benefit of the public, and concluded that \u201cthere is nothing in either the General Laws or in the State <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>Building Code which shows a legislative intent to impose liability on a municipality to individual property owners for the negligent issuance of building permits or the nonenforcement of the State Building Code.\" <em>Id. </em>at 809-810. See also <em>Ribeiro </em>v. <em>Granby, </em>395 Mass. 608 (1985); <em>Nolan </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 475 (1983). The plaintiffs contend that, notwithstanding facial similarities to the building inspection cases, the present case is one involving foreseeable harm to them as a result of an assurance of compliance made directly to them through their contractor. Therefore, they contend, the building inspector owed them a special duty of care. The plaintiffs rely on <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. 745 (1984), and <em>A.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>402 Mass. 234 (1988), in which the court found a special duty owed to the plaintiffs by the public employee beyond that owed to the public at large. \u201cWhere the risk created by the negligence of a municipal employee is of immediate and foreseeable physical injury to persons who cannot reasonably protect themselves from it, a duty of care reasonably should be found.\u201d <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware, </em>392 Mass. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">Although there are some factual distinctions between the present case and the public inspection cases decided to date, we do not agree with the plaintiffs that, in the circumstances, they were owed a special duty of care. Unlike the plaintiffs in <em>Irwin </em>v. <em>Ware </em>and <em>A.L. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>the plaintiffs in the present case were in a position reasonably to protect themselves from the threatened harm. The ability to protect oneself is an important factor in determining whether one is owed a special duty of care. See <em>Ribeiro </em>v. <em>Granby, </em>395 Mass. at 612 (pointing out, in foreclosing liability in an inspection case, that the plaintiffs \u201ccould have taken measures to rectify or avoid the danger\"). The Hinsdale by-law does not place a special duty on the building inspector to investigate the wetlands status of any particular piece of property. On the contrary, the by-law places the obligation to show compliance with the Wetlands Protection Act on any person applying for a building permit. A property owner has the initial burden of investigating whether the Wetlands Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>Act would pose any impediment to construction and, thus, is in a position reasonably to protect himself from harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-5\">The case of <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Toppenish, </em>23 Wash. App. 554 (1979), on which the plaintiffs rely, is distinguishable. In that case, a zoning administrator gave assurance to a landowner that an apartment house he planned to build would be in compliance with the applicable zoning requirements. The court noted, however, that the zoning classification of the property was solely within the knowledge of the zoning administrator, and for the landowner to have searched for the answer \u201cwould have been an extreme, if not impossible, burden.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 560. Unlike that zoning administrator\u2019s assurance, the Hinsdale building inspector\u2019s oral permission should not have been construed as a representation to the plaintiffs that all applicable requirements for construction had been met. Having failed to assure themselves before making application for the building permit that the construction would be in compliance with the Wetlands Protection Act, the plaintiffs could not reasonably rely on the oral permission.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The distinction between the <em>Dinsky </em>and <em>Irwin </em>lines of cases not being sharp, policy considerations may enter into the determination whether a particular case falls within one line of cases or the other. While the plaintiffs have apparently sustained an unfortunate economic loss, given the language of the by-law placing the obligation to investigate the wetlands situation initially on them, considerations of fairness do not require the imposition of liability on the town. Moreover, imposition of liability on a municipality in a case such as the present one would create the potential for a \u201ctremendous exposure to liability . . . .\u201d <em>Dinsky </em>v. <em>Framingham, </em>386 Mass. at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b830-7\"> The plaintiffs have made no showing as to what the building inspector was told by the contractor before oral permission to build was given. Absent such a showing, one cannot know whether there was negligence on the building inspector\u2019s part.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
