L. c. 229, \u00a7 2. The complaint alleged that the defendant\u2019s negligence in not properly diagnosing Matthew\u2019s condition and in discharging him from emergency hospital care resulted in his conscious suffering and death. The case was tried to a jury beginning on November 4, 1987. On November 17, 1987, the jury returned a spe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>cial verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff now claims that the trial judge committed error in the admission of certain evidence: (1) hospital records containing hearsay information under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79; (2) a letter written by the defendant to his corporate employer after Matthew was transferred to another hospital; and (3) testimony of Matthew\u2019s pediatrician relating to notes made during a morbidity and mortality conference at Children\u2019s Hospital. We reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The relevant facts are as follows. On June 21, 1983, when Matthew was fourteen months old, he awoke at approximately 9 p.m. with a fever. As the night wore on, his breathing became labored, and the plaintiff testified that later in the evening she heard, a \u201cclicking\u201d noise emanating from his chest. Because of his agitation, she decided to take him to Sancta Maria Hospital, less than four miles from their home. Upon Matthew\u2019s arrival at the emergency room at 4:15 a.m., the nurse on duty obtained a history, noting in the record her own observation that Matthew was feverish, had \u201cmild inspiratory stridor\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and was generally uncomfortable. Next, Matthew was examined by the defendant, a specialist in internal (adult) medicine, who was employed part-time by Atlantic Medical Associates, at the emergency service at Sancta Maria. There was conflicting testimony as to whether the medical sign of mild inspiratory stridor was reported to the defendant at this time. Attempting a throat examination, the defendant used a pen light as a tongue depressor, but Matthew instinctively pulled away and would not open his mouth. The defendant ordered a chest X-ray and a blood test which later demonstrated a markedly elevated white blood cell count. He called Matthew\u2019s pediatrician, Dr. Samuel Andonian, to report the initial results of his examination and to solicit his advice concerning the administration of antibiot<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>ics. Satisfied that Matthew had an early viral syndrome and that his pediatrician would follow with an examination later that day, the defendant discharged him at 5:45 a.m. The diagnosis recorded by the defendant in the Sancta Maria record was \u201c[fjever \u2014 prob[ably] early viral syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">Matthew was next examined at the emergency department of Symmes Hospital in Arlington at 10:45 a.m. on the same day. The plaintiff, preparing to leave for the pediatrician\u2019s oEce, had noticed that Matthew had stopped breathing and sought immediate emergency care at this nearby facility. The Symmes emergency care staff, headed by Dr. James Campbell, called an emergency code and attempted to resuscitate him by intubation performed by an anesthesiologist, Dr. Chal Kwon. Noted in Symmes\u2019 hospital record contemporaneous with this procedure is a diagnosis of respiratory arrest, with a possibility of sepsis.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The sketchy notes of the physical examination, prepared just before emergency transfer to Children\u2019s Hospital in Boston, do not mention any abnormality associated with his epiglottis. As soon as his vital signs were stabilized, Matthew was transported by an emergency team to the intensive care unit at Children\u2019s Hospital. After three days in a coma, Matthew\u2019s condition deteriorated, and he died on June 25, 1983. According to all of the expert testimony, the immediate cause of death was an inability to breathe brought on by epiglottitis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Dr. Richard Stone, a pediatrician, testified as an expert on the plaintiff\u2019s behalf. The sum of his testimony was that, based upon reasonable medical probability, Matthew\u2019s rapidly progressing and eventually fatal condition could have been avoided had the defendant made a timely and proper diagnosis of epiglottitis. He expressed the opinion that, given the history, physical examination and laboratory findings at Sancta Maria Hospital, the defendant should have consid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>ered epiglottitis as a priority in his diagnosis. There was testimony from physicians called by both parties that one of the classic signs of epiglottitis is redness and swelling of the epiglottis, sometimes detected through pharyngeal examination, X-ray, or visualization through a laryngoscope.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s expert faulted the defendant for his failure, in view of the blood tests later showing a bacterial process characteristic of this condition, to consider the possibility of epiglottitis and to transfer Matthew immediately to a specialized acute care facility like Children\u2019s Hospital. He opined that the defendant\u2019s treatment fell below the expected standard of care at the time for an emergency service internist.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">The defendant countered that none of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses established that Matthew had any focal signs, especially a red and swollen epiglottis, which would have required that epiglottitis be considered as part of the differential diagnosis. One defense expert, Dr. Daniel C. Shannon, testified as to the rare and rapidly progressing nature of this disease. He stated that precise staging of Matthew\u2019s condition was difficult at best, and the lack of any focal signs during physical examination by the defendant justified his initial diagnosis of early viral syndrome.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">1. <em>The \u201cnormal\u201d epiglottis evidence. </em>Prior to trial, the plaintiff filed a motion in limine which sought the exclusion of certain evidence. The primary matter disputed was an unsubstantiated reference in the Children\u2019s hospital record (discharge summary and progress notes) made by Dr. Louis Rubin describing Matthew\u2019s epiglottis as \u201cnormal\u201d while he was at Symmes Hospital. The judge prudently declined to rule on the plaintiff\u2019s motion, preferring that counsel develop the matter fully at trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>389 Mass. 581, 595 (1983). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Barber, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1008, 1010-1011 (1982). Subsequently, on the third day <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>of trial, and immediately before the cross-examination of Dr. Stone (the plaintiff\u2019s expert), the judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion to exclude Dr. Rubin\u2019s handwritten note in the Children\u2019s hospital record which referred to a throat culture done at Symmes indicating an impression of a normal epiglottis.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s objection was timely recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 79, renders hospital records admissible because of the presumption of reliability arising from their use in a medical setting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>385 Mass. 733, 750 (1982). The standard to be applied is much influenced by <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524 (1978), where it was suggested (in dictum) that statements as to medical history based on personal knowledge of the declarant may be admissible even if the declarant is not the patient. The court, however, indicated that for a document to fall within the medical records exception to G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, \u201cthe information must be recorded from the personal knowledge of the entrant or from a compilation of the personal knowledge of those who are under a medical obligation to transmit such information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 531. \u201c[Sjecond level hearsay ... is not rendered admissible by the medical records exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">The <em>Bouchie </em>case criteria were not met here. During numerous conferences with counsel, the judge questioned the source of Dr. Rubin\u2019s note which was never explained.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because the Children\u2019s Hospital statement that the epiglottis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>was normal while at Symmes was not evidence within the purview of the statute,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the judge allowed a substantial hearsay violation hidden beneath the guise of a hospital record. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Baldwin, </em>24 Mass. App. Ct. 200, 201-202 (1987). Consequently, we conclude that the admission of Dr. Rubin\u2019s note was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">We come to the close question whether the erroneously admitted evidence \u201cinjuriously affected the substantial rights\u201d of the plaintiff. See G. L. c. 231, \u00a7\u00a7 119, 132. We conclude that it did and that the plaintiff is entitled to a new trial. <em>Ibid. Sacco </em>v. <em>Roupenian, </em>409 Mass. 25, 30 (1991). Dr. Stone, the plaintiffs expert, testified that, in all the cases of epiglottitis that he has treated, visualization by laryngoscopy has always shown a red and swollen epiglottis. Dr. Rubin\u2019s note was the only evidence which directly contradicted the plaintiffs central allegation \u2014 that Matthew exhibited classic warning signs of epiglottitis at an early stage. Using the improperly admitted note, the defendant could lead the jury to believe that if the epiglottis was \u201cnormal\u201d at Symmes Hospital then it must have been such earlier at the time of the defendant\u2019s examination of Matthew.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Indeed, defense counsel argued in favor of admission as follows: \u201c[Y]our Honor, it certainly is a crucial issue because if this one reference in the historical information that is listed by many phy<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>sicians at Children\u2019s is excised you are cutting out the heart of the defense of Dr. Dong.\u201d Because the note was the only evidence that the epiglottis was normal and not red and swollen, and because the defense employed the damaging notation often and to effect, we cannot say that its admission was harmless. <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 407 (1982). <em>Grant </em>v. <em>Lewis/Boyle, Inc., </em>408 Mass. 269, 275 (1990). <em>Wright </em>v. <em>American Precast Concrete, </em>19 Mass. App. Ct. 1014, 1016 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">2. We comment on the issues which may arise at retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">a. <em>The post-treatment letter. </em>On the day following Matthew\u2019s discharge from Sancta Maria Hospital, June 23, 1983, the defendant wrote a letter to Dr. Joseph Maloney, a director of the defendant\u2019s corporate employer, Atlantic Medical Associates, recounting his telephone conversation with Matthew\u2019s pediatrician, Dr. Andonian. At trial, the defendant acknowledged that he wrote the letter at Dr. Maloney\u2019s request after being informed that Matthew was in critical condition at Children\u2019s Hospital. This letter was at some point incorporated into the Sancta Maria hospital record.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">The plaintiff, as part of her motion in limine,, sought to exclude the letter, arguing that, because it was not composed contemporaneously with treatment, it was no more than a contrivance to show Dr. Andonian\u2019s support of the initial diagnosis. The letter refers to various signs which appeared during Matthew\u2019s initial examination as well as Dr. Andonian\u2019s responses upon being apprised of the symptoms. In its cross-examination of Dr. Andonian, the defense aimed to shift blame from the defendant to him for not intervening with alacrity to diagnose Matthew\u2019s condition properly.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Plaintiff\u2019s counsel used the document to impeach the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We agree with the plaintiff that the defendant was not entitled to admission of the letter under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7\u00a7 78, 79. See and contrast <em>Wiik </em>v. <em>Rathore, </em>21 Mass. App. Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>399, 401-402 (1986) (plaintiff was proponent of evidence and sought full probative effect of post-operative entry; entry held admissible only as a prior inconsistent statement bearing on credibility). That the plaintiff could have the letter admitted (for limited purposes) does not help the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">b. <em>Dr. Andonian\u2019s morbidity conference notations. </em>Dr. Andonian was called by the plaintiff to give his testimony as a treating physician. Midway through direct examination, the plaintiff opted to treat him as an expert on the diagnosis of epiglottitis. The riskiness of this tactic became apparent when, over the plaintiff\u2019s objection, the defendant was permitted to cross-examine Dr. Andonian about his notations made during a physician\u2019s meeting at Children\u2019s Hospital months after Matthew\u2019s death. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, in particular, to Dr. Andonian\u2019s opinion as to the \u201crarity of the condition [epiglottitis].\u201d In <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. <em>A Juvenile, </em>398 Mass. 516, 527-531 (1986), the Supreme Judicial Court took a modest step in enlarging the basis for expert opinion. See also Proposed Mass.R.Evid. 703. An expert may base his opinion on hearsay information so long as the facts are independently admissible and form a permissible basis for the opinion. Should Dr. Andonian\u2019s diagnostic opinion become the subject of his testimony at any retrial, the judge should conduct a preliminary voir dire inquiry to determine whether his recordings were part of the underlying factual basis upon which his opinion rested, and, as such, independently admissible. <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>D\u2019Annolfo, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 413, 430 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-6\"> Laryngeal stridor, usually associated with inspiration, is manifested by a hoarse \u201ccrowing\u201d sound.
