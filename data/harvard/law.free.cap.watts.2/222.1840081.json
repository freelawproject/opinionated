The note in question having been indorsed to Dinsmore and Kyle, and the suit being in the name of Adam Kyle, and there being no proof of any transfer from Dinsmore and Kyle to Adam Kyle, and no proof otherwise, of any title thereto being vested in Adam Kyle, the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-13\">2. That the suit cannot be sustained in the name of the present plaintiff, because the transfer of the note is under seal. -</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-14\">Charge of court to jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-15\">First point answered. On the general issue pleaded to an action by partners, the plaintiffs are not obliged to prove their partnership. 1 <em>Browne </em>145. The style of this suit not being denied at the time when such objection could have been more properly made, we think the objection now insisted on is invalid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-16\">Second point. \u2022 We think this point also ineffectual. The indorsement of a note need not embrace negotiable words. A bill originally negotiable contin\u00faes so, unless its general negotiability be restrained by express terms.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-17\">A transfer of the whole interest in a negotiable note, in writing, carries with it the right of action in the name of the indorsee. Even a special indorsement, exempting the indorsee from any liability under it, is good. So an indorsement under seal with an extended liability would, on the same principle, clothe the indorsee with the who'e interest in the note ; one of the incidents of which would be, the right to sustain a suit in his own name. If the suit was on the transfer, it might be different; all that is wanting in this case, is evidence of a written transfer of the right to the negotiable paper, from the original payees to the plaintiff; the note being in terms payable to order, any order in writing is enough. This writing need not be of a commercial character. The original contract is to pay to order : any legal evidence of such order is enough.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-18\">Exception taken by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>Errors assigned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-6\">1. The court erred in receiving fhe indorsement of the transfer of the note in evidence, as stated in first bill of' exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-7\">2. In rejecting the evidence offered by defendants, as stated in the second bill of exceptions.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b225-8\">3. In answering both the points put by defendants\u2019 counsel in the negative in their charge; and for not charging that plaintiff could not sustain his action for each of the reasons stated in defendants\u2019 points.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-9\"><em>Alexander </em>and <em>Carothers, </em>for plaintiffs in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ARQ\">cited, Foley <em>v. </em>Houk, 2 <em>Penns.

But when the note is payable or indorsed specially to a firm, the contract is with them only, and it has often been ruled, that in an action by such payees or indorsees, strict evidence must be given that the firm consists of . the persons who sue as plaintiffs on the'note. <em>Ibid. </em>The indorsement in this case was special, to Dinsmore and Kyle. The plaintiff sues in his individual right, averring in his statement that the note was indorsed to him, trading in the name of Dinsmore and.Kyle. This averment forms a material part of his title. It is the only right to sue which he sets forth, and if not true, the acdon is not maintainable in his name. <em>Non assumpsit </em>puts in issue every pan of the plaintiff\u2019s title. It. is otherwise on <em>non est factum, </em>which, though called the general issue, is in the nature of a restricted plea; it denies the validity of the deed declared on, but admits every thing else. On this ground, the case of Porter <em>v. </em>Cresson, 10 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>257, was determined. Here the issue was <em>non assumpsit; </em>and on this issue the plaintiff was bound to give evidence of the averment that he represented Dinsmore and Kyle. The court below, therefore, erred in charging the jury that this objection was not sustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-13\">The other errors are not supported.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-14\">Judgment reversed, and <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
