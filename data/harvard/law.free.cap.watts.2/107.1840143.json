M\u2019Guire, esquires. Moses Canan had been the treasurer of the county, and his accounts were settled with the commonwealth, and balance found to be due by him for tavern licenses; for this balance he was sued by an action for money had and received, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>a judgment rendered against him, <em>a fieri facias </em>issued, his personal property sold, and the proceeds applied to former levies. This was an action subsequently brought against him and his sureties, on his official <em>bond; </em>and the only question which arose was, whether the judgment in the action against Moses Canan was a bar to this. The court below (Young, president) was of opinion that it was not, and rendered a judgment, for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b108-6\"><em>Stanard </em>and <em>Fetterman, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A4P\">cited, Tom <em>v. </em>Goodrich, 2 <em>Johns.

The action was not on the bond, the condition of which was to pay only in case the principal did not; but on the direct evidence of the debt which arose out of the receipt of the money: and it surely could not make the case the worse for the creditor, that the debt had been established and default of payment conclusively proved by a judgment at law. If a judgment directly for the debt were to bar an action on a collateral covenant to secure payment of it, then a recovery against an administrator, in the first place, would prevent a recourse to his administration bond, which, however, is had every day. The judgment therefore was properly rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
