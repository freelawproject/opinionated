Two modes of proceeding were presented to Mr Creps, either in court or before a justice.

The plaintiff below took an amicable judgment from the principal in the note before a justice of the peace, for a sum above 100 dollars, without consulting the surety. 2d. He stipulated with the principal for a stay of execution for a year.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b46-9\">Any agreement of the principal parties, inconsistent with the terms of the original agreement, or any alteration in the mode of performing them, discharged' the surety. <em>Theobald on Principal and Surety </em>119, 120. So any act of the party <em>to </em>whom the promise is made, which \u25a0 tends to increase the risk of the surety, or defeat his remedy, puts an end to his liability. <em>Fell on Guar. </em>194; <em>Theobald on Principal and Surety </em>122. And the question in such case is, whether, by the act or agreement, the surety <em>might have been prejudiced, </em>and not whether he was in fact injured. Moore <em>v. </em>Bowmaker, 7 <em>Price </em>223. In the present case, Creps, the plaintiff, took from Cring the principal, whose estate was incumbered to its full value, a judgment by confession, for the amount of the note, 172 dollars, and stipulated for a year\u2019s stay of execution. It is true the fourteenth section of the act of 1810, <em>Pur don\u2019s Digest </em>500, gives cognizance to justices of the peace for sums exceeding-100 dollars, if the parties voluntarily appear before them, and provides that no execution shall issue for a year, if the defendant be a <em>freeholder, </em>the sort of freeholder not being specified. If by freeholder is meant every one owning real estate, whether incumbered or not, the risk of Clippinger .was materially increased by this resort to an extraordinary tribunal; for had the proceeding been in court (the ordinary mode), judgment would have been had at the second term, and execution could have issued imme<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>\u25a0diately, as the privilege of a freeholder does not extend there to persons whose estates are incumbered. But by the mode adopted, no recourse could be had for a year to the personal property of Cring, which was the only available fund he had. Under any aspect of the case, as this was a proceeding out of the ordinary course, between Creps and'Cring, without consulting Clippinger, he is discharged. The business of collecting money from the principal debtor, is as much the duty of the surety as of the person to whom it is payable. <em>Fell on Guar. </em>199. He, the surety, has a concern in every transaction with the principal debtor. You cannot keep him bound and transact his affairs, for they are as much his as the obligee\u2019s, without consulting him. Rees <em>v. </em>Berrington, 2 <em>Ves. Jun. </em>540.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-6\">2d. The stipulation for a year\u2019s stay of execution discharged Clippinger.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b47-7\">By the act of 1724, 5 <em>Pur don\u2019s Dig. </em>56, which relates to proceedings in court, freeholders are particularly described. The real estate necessary to giving them privilege must be \u201c clear estate any incumbrance defeats the privilege. Fitler v. La Breure, 1 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>17; Toy <em>v. </em>Simpson, 1 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>363; <em>Supreme Court </em>1820, <em>MS. </em>Had this agreement to give a year\u2019s stay been in court, there can be no question the surety would have been discharged. Rathbone <em>v. </em>Warren, <em>10 J. R. </em>587. But reliance is had upon the fact, that the word <em>freeholder </em>is used without qualification in the fourteenth section of the act of 1810, under which Creps took the judgment from Cring; and that the latter was consequently entitled to the stay given, although his estate was incumbered. The description of a freeholder in Pennsylvania, given in the act of 1724\u20141725, shows clearly the intention of the legislature in other acts, where they speak of freeholders generally. The practice under the act of the 21st of March 1806, <em>Pur don\u2019s Dig. </em>58, is to issue a <em>capias </em>against a defendant whose estate is incumbered, although that act directs a <em>summons </em>to issue where the party is a \u201c freeholder.\u201d What places the matter in a still stronger light is, that in the tenth section of the act of 1810, the act relied on by the defendant in error, it is expressly stated, \u201c no judgment, whether obtained before a justice or in any court of record within this commonwealth, shall deprive any person of his right as a freeholder <em>longer than such, judgment shall remain unsatisfied </em>showing conclusively to whom they intend a freeholder\u2019s privilege to extend. Besides it would be most incongruous to give a defendant the right of a freeholder before a justice for an amount exceeding 100 dollars, when at the same time if would be refused to him in our courts.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b47-8\"><em>Devor </em>and <em>Alexander, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b47-10\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6C\">If a creditor, by any contract which can be enforced against him at law or in equity, gives time to his debtor, he dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>charges the surety; for if, notwithstanding such contract, it were competent to sue the surety, the latter would immediately have his remedy over against the debtor. This would be in fraud of the contract of forbearance, which the creditor would thereby indirectly defeat. The doctrine that if the creditor gives time to the principal debtor, the surety is discharged, was first introduced in courts of equity. It was founded on this principle, that every surety has a right to come into a court of equity, and require to be permitted to sue in the name of the creditor. If, then, the creditor gives time to the principal debtor, or does any act which alters the situation of the parties, he prevents the surety from using his name with effect. And the law is the same even when the arrangements may be for the benefit of the surety, for he stands upon his contract, and is discharged from all obligation, if any alteration is made in it without his consent. How then does this case stand, on the facts which were in evidence. John Clippinger, the defendant, was the surety in a note given by himself and John Cring to the plaintiff. The plaintiff and the principal debtor, without the consent of the surety, enter an amicable action, before a justice of the peace, in which the defendant confesses a judgment with a stay of execution for twelve months. It was a proceeding under the fourteenth section of the act of 20th March 1810. The act provides, that \u201ca justice of the peace shall take cognizance of any matter or thing, made so by the act (20th March 1810) for any sum exceeding 100 dollars, if the <em>parties voluntarily </em>appear before him for that purpose, and shall proceed to the recovery thereof, by entering judgment if confessed, or if submitted to him by reference ; but no execution shall issue before the expiration of one year from the date of such judgment, if the party defendant be a <em>freeholder, </em>or shall have entered special bail, &amp;c.\u201d At the time the judgment was.'entered by the justice, the real estate of Cring, the principal debtor, was incumbered by mortgage, to an amount exceeding its value. The argument is, that the surety has no cause to complain, because this was a proceeding warranted by an act of assembly, and that no greater advantage was given by the creditor than the debtor had a right to claim. The soundness of this argument may be well questioned. It may admit of doubt, whether a debtor, whose estate is incumbered to an amount greater than its value, is a freeholder within the meaning of the act, and as such, entitled to a stay of execution for twelve months. At common law, an estate of freehold, <em>liberum tenementum, </em>a frank tenement, is defined by <em>Britton </em>to be the possession of the soil by a freeman. And <em>St Germyn </em>tells us, \u201cthat the possession of the land is called, in the law of England, the frank tenement, or freehold.\u201d At common law, he who has the actual possession of land for life, or a greater estate, is a freeholder. But that is not the sense in which the term <em>freehold </em>is understood in the act of assembly. We must have recourse to other acts of assembly in which the term is used and defined. The act of the 20th March 172&amp; speaks of a freeholder, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>as one who is an inhabitant of the commonwealth, having resided therein for the space of two years, who has thirty acres of land, in fee simple, well settled, twelve whereof, or more well cleared or improved ; or one who hath a dwelling house, with fifty pounds and clear estate, or who hath unimproved lands worth fifty pounds. Such estate must be a clear estate. It has always been held, that an incumbrance, to any amount, takes from him the' privilege of the exemption from arrest given him by the act referred to.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">When a subsequent act dispenses with bail from a freeholder, which it exacts from others, we are to take it, that the legislature has reference to freeholders as understood in the statute. And this view of the case derives force, from the tenth section of the act of 1810. \u201cNo judgment, whether obtained before a justice, or in any court of record of this commonwealth, shall deprive any person of his or her right as a freeholder, longer or for a greater time than such judgment shall remain unsatisfied ; any law, usage or custom to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d This provision would be unnecessary, on the supposition that the debtor was entitled to a stay of execution, whether his estate of freehold was incumbered or not. The section marks the understanding of the legislature, that a judgment deprives the holder of real estate of the privilege conferred by the act, as <em>long </em>as it remains unsatisfied. It revives only when the incumbrance ceases to exist, nor can I perceive what security is afforded to the creditor by afreehold incumbrance to an amount greater than its value. Nor is the law unreasonable, as, in such cases, all that is required is special bail, which is exacted from others.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">But the surety is discharged from the contract on other grounds. A surety has a right to come into a court of equity, and require to be permitted to sue in the name of the principal debtor. In the case at bar, Clippinger would have a right to demand the use of the judgment confessed before the justice. He has a direct interest in it, and should have been consulted before any such proceeding was had. It must be remembered, that the justice has no jurisdiction, except by consent. The proceeding is not compulsory, but voluntary, and <em>non constat, </em>if Clippinger had been consulted, he would have consented to the confession of judgment before a justice, or before the justice. The course pursued is an anomaly unknown to the common law, and only adopted in this state. When, therefore, the act requires consent to give jurisdiction, it must mean the consent of all who are to be affected by it. It is no answer to say that, in this case the surety is not injured. Supposing the fact to be so, yet the surety has a right to say, I stand upon my contract, which you have undertaken to vary without my consent. He is placed in a different situation, without his consent, from that in which he placed himself when he entered into the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
