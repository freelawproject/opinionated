Philip Mead, the plaintiff, was the son of John Mead, and alleged the property was his by purchase from his .father. Two questions arose on the trial of the cause: that of fact, to whom did the property belong ? and that of law, if it did belong to the father John Mead, could it be levied and sold upon a judgment against him ,as administrator <em>1 </em>The court decided the law, and the jury the fact, in favour of the defendant.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-13\"><em>Derrickson </em>and <em>Fa/rrelly, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkIf\">cited the fourth and eleventh sections of the 20th of March 1810. 1 <em>Bac.
