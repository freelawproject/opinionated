Common pleas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-10\">In this action Jacob Slyder, administrator of John Goswiler, was plaintiff, and Christian Poorman was defendant, and the following special verdict was found.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b69-11\">\u201cThe defendant stood indebted to the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in his lifetime, in three notes, upon which this suit is founded, all dated the 21st of September 1825. One for payment of 100 dollars on the 1st of April 1826 ; one-for payment of 100 dollars on the 1st of August 1826; and the third for payment of 50 dollars on the 1st of April 1827. Agreeably, to plaintiff\u2019s statement filed in this suit, the Pennsylvania Agricultural and Manufacturing Bank obtained judgment in the court of common pleas of Columbia county, against the defendant and the said John Goswiler, plaintiff\u2019s intestate, in his lifetime, on the 8th of November 1820, for the sum of 650 dollars 25 cents, besides costs of suit. The debt for which said judgment was obtained, was for money borrowed from said bank, for the use of the said John Goswiler and for his accommodation. That the defendant paid the amount of debt and interest due on said judgment, to the said bank in 1828, upon an agreement on the part of the bank, that the said judgment should remain for - the use of the said Christian Poorman; and on the 17th of November 1828, the court upon motion, and proof exhibited, ordered the said judgment to stand for the use of said Poorman. That the said judgment was revived by <em>scire facias </em>against the administrator of said Goswiler, and judgment entered thereon the 19th of September 1829; that the said Goswiler died in 1827, intestate and insolvent, leaving other judgment debts unpaid to a large amount. If the court shall be of opinion that the defendant has no right to defalk or protect himself from the claim of the plaintiff, on account of the judgment in favour of said bank, and assigned and marked for his use as aforesaid, then judgment to be rendered for plaintiff. But if the defendant has such right, then judgment to be rendered for the defendant, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>amount of the principal and interest due on the notes aforesaid, tobe credited on the aforesaid judgment. If the court shall be of opinion that the bank judgment constitutes a partial defence, they will then enter judgment for the plaintiff, and that the said judgment shall come in <em>pro rata </em>with other judgment creditors, and the-sum to be fixed when the assets are marshalled, and the deduction made.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b70-6\">Upon which the court below entered a judgment for the plaintiff, and that the <em>pro rata </em>of the bank debt in favour of the defendant, with other judgment creditors, be deducted, agreeably to the last provision in the case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b70-7\"><em>Carothers, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdE\">relied upon the principles determined in Frantz <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 <em>Penn.

At the death of Goswiler, Poorman had no claim against his estate, because he bad not paid the judgment; having afterwards paid <em>it, he </em>could acquire no right which the bank had not, nor claim to recover more than the bank could have recovered, especially as that recovery would be against creditors,</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b70-9\">. Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AlZ\">\u2014ssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssWe affirm this judgment on the authority of Dorsheimer <em>v. </em>Bucher, though it is not easy to reconcile it, on principle, to Lighty <em>v. </em>Brenner, 14 <em>Serg, tip Rawle </em>127, and Frantz <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>257; or to say why a matter which might have been set up as an equitable defence against the party in his lifetime, may not be set up against his representatives. Dorsheimer <em>v. </em>Bucher was argued on the ground <em>of </em>actual <em>set-off, </em>and in that <em>aspect </em>rightly decided; but it is apparent that the strong point of the cause was not taken. Had it been put to the court as an equitable defence, it is probable the judgment would, have been different. The decision is, however, directly in point, and rules the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-10\">Judgment afiirmed.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
