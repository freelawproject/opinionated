Graff <em>v. </em>Smith\u2019s Executors, 1 <em>Dall. </em>481; Morris <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 <em>Yates </em>245; Hannum <em>v. </em>Spear, <em>Ibid. </em>554. The lien of a decedent\u2019s debt (no limit being made by either of the acts referred to) was of indefinite duration, and that it was so considered is evident from the preamble of the act of the 4th of April 1797, <em>Purdon\u2019s Dig. </em>421, and the opinion of the court in Trevor <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, 2 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>95, in which it is said, \u201c before the act of 1797, the debts of a deceased person remained a lien for an indefinite length of time.\u201d This latter act provides thatno debts of a decedent, except they - be sec\u00fared by mortgage, &amp;c. or other-record, shall remain a lien on lands for a longer period than seven years, unless an action for the recovery thereof be commenced and duly prosecuted within the said period of seven years, with a proviso in favour of <em>femes covert, </em>minors, persons in prison, or out of the limits of the United States, whose claims continue liens, notwithstanding the expiration of the said term, until four years after the disability is removed. The plaintiff in this suit having obtained his judgment within four years after the death of Mr Blaine, brought himself fully within the conditions of this act: he had <em>duly prosecuted </em>his claim within seven years; it was a debt secured by record, and to all intents and purposes he stood in the same situation as if this law had never had an existence; in other words, nothing but presumption of payment from lapse of time could affect him. He had \u201c <em>duly prosecuted\u201d </em>for his judgment, put an end to the action, 3 <em>Jacob\u2019s Law Die. </em>583, and the intention of the act which was to give notice <em>to </em>all the world of his claim was attained. Again, the words used are, \u201c duly prosecute within seven years.\u201d Now unless this duly prosecuting be confined to obtaining a judgment, and not to reaping the fruits of it within that period, the proviso is useless. Neither the case of Fryhoffer <em>v. </em>Buzby, 17 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>121, nor that of the Agricultural Bank <em>v. </em>Crever, 2 <em>Rawle </em>224, has any application to the question of the indefinite lien of a decedent\u2019s debt. They merely decide that a judgment obtained in the <em>life time, </em>and regularly revived, should be paid out of the proceeds of land, before a prior judgment that had lost its lien on the property sold. It was not pretended that the judgment creditor, whose priority of lien was gone, as against the more vigilant creditor, did not, after the decedent\u2019s death, retain a lien against his lands in the hands of the heir or devisee or those claiming under them. In Trevor <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, it is said, that if no suit is brought against the representatives of a decedent, the lien of the debt continues for seven years; but that if suit is brought before the expiration of that time, the lien will con- \u25a0 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>tinue <em>until jive years after judgment obtained. </em>There must be some mistake in this, for the facts do not warrant the rule laid down. There the testator died in 1816, judgment was obtained in 1820, and a <em>scire facias </em>did not issue for <em>six years after, </em>and yet the claim was held to be a subsisting lien. Again, if the lien of a decedent\u2019s debt be limited to five years after judgment on it against his representatives, the creditor who prosecutes to judgment within a year after the death, has a lien, of shorter duration than if he had brought no suit at all. Nor does the act of 1797 justify such a conclusion; for after reciting that the debts of deceased persons are a lien on their lands and tenements for an indefinite period of time after their decease, it enacts that no such debts shall remain a lien longer than seven years, <em>unless </em>an action be commenced and duly prosecuted, &amp;c. Nothing is said of the duration of the lien when the condition of the act is complied with, and of course it remains indefinite as it was before. It is true that the act of 1798, <em>Purdon\u2019s Dig. </em>421, makes it incumbent on the creditor who wishes to preserve the lien of his judgment, to revive the same by <em>scire facias </em>within five years; but this relates to judgments <em>inter vivos, </em>and <em>not </em>to those obtained against their representatives. The court say, in Ellenberger <em>v. </em>Trevor, the act of 1798 was not intended to interfere with that of 1797. The lien of the debt of a decedent is not by reason of the <em>judgment </em>against his representatives, it is created by his death. A judgment had against administrators or executors, has not the effect of merging a simple contract debt. Thus such judgment on a simple contract claim would be postponed to a specialty on which no suit had been brought, as a judgment in the latter would give place to a debt by .recognizance. In short, the act of 1798 is confined to judgments in the life time, whilst that of 1797 speaks of debts the nature of which is not altered by a judgment against the representatives. Why, then, issue a <em>scire facias </em>to continue the lien of a debt the duration of which is indefinite when the conditions of this latter act are complied with ? Nor is there any peculiar hardship in the law as contended for. By the other provisions of the act of 1797 in favour of minors, <em>femes covert </em>and persons out of the United States, where no notice is requisite, the most disastrous consequences might result to purchasers from heirs or devisees; but in cases like the present, where suit has been brought and the claim liquidated within seven years from the (estator\u2019s death, purchasers would always be secure, by using due diligence. There is no necessity, therefore, for straining the law and making the act of 1798 apply its provisions to that of 1797, to which it has no legitimate reference.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-6\"><em>Watts, Alexander </em>and <em>Carothers, </em>for defendants in error;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2J\">cited, Allen <em>v. </em>Sawyer, 2 <em>Penn.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">The principle of Trevor <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, though not fully expressed in the opinion delivered, will be found to cover the whole field of the controversy. It was admitted that the lien of creditors \u00f3n a decedent\u2019s land, springs exclusively from the intestate laws which make his estate a fund for payment of his debts ; insomuch, that nothing is added or gained by a judgment against his representatives; and that the act of 1798, by which is provided a peculiar <em>scife facias </em>to prolong the lien of judgments <em>inter vivos, </em>is not directly applicable to it. But it was distinctly asserted that a decedent\u2019s lien, also, might be prolonged by <em>scire facias; </em>and the construction by which that result is obtained, is the matter to be shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">The act of 1797, which gives rise to it, provides that no debts but such as are secured by mortgage, judgment, recognizance or other record, shall remain a lien on the lands of a decedent longer than seven years from his death; \u201cunless an action for the recovery thereof be commenced and <em>duly prosecuted </em>against his or her heirs, executors or administrators, within the said period of seven years; or a copy or particular statement of any bond, covenant, debt or demand, where the same is not payable within the seven years, shall be filed, within the said period, in the office of the prothonotary of the county where the lands lie.\u201d It is evident from the context, that the excepted liens are such as have been acquired in the decedent\u2019s lifetime; and that they are thus mentioned to preclude the implication of an-intent to- abridge or impair them. The difficulty in Trev\u00f3r <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, was to determine when an action should be \u201cduly prosecuted ;\u201d and it was thought not to be so, within the.meaning of the act, when prosecuted to judgment merely, because that construction might extend the lien to some twenty or thirty years without a further act done, as the presumption of payment from lapse of time would run but from the rendition of the judgment, which might be several years after the expiration of the original limitation. The law is.a remedial one, and we thought ourselves bound to make such a construction of it, liberal though it were, as would best advance the remedy and repress the mischief. In legal estimation, judgment is doubtless the end of prosecution ; but that can scarce be thought the sense in which the words were used by the legislature. That the inconvenience of stale liens was beginning to be felt, is evident not only from the act in question, but from the act of the year following, for the limitation of the lien of judgments ; and we cannot suppose that the legislature, proceeding systematically to the removal of it, intended to pay respect to any discriminating circumstance depending upon origin. It was of little moment as to consequences, whether the lien had its root in a judgment, or was but dependent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>on one for its continuance, as the mischief from an indefinite duration of it would be the same ; and it may-appear singular, that the provisions of the act of 1798 were not extended to a judgment in prosecution of a decedent\u2019s lien, in terms. The omission is doubtless attributable to inadvertence in respect to the fact, at that time not a very obvious one, that a judgment against a\u2019decedent\u2019s representatives, is not a lien on his lands, the lien created by the intestate acts being exclusive of it. In restraining the lien of a judgment, the legislature certainly did not purposely omit a like provision for a lien depending on a judgment for its continuance, merely because its origin is elsewhere. Such a lien, thoughnotwithin theletter,is certainly within the equity of the act; and if the intent were, as I think it was, to compel the creditor to give notice to purchasers by the institution of an action on the principle of <em>lis pendens, </em>without, at the same time, compelling him to sacrifice the land, and perhaps his debt along with it, the instant he should entitle himself to execution, the period which the lien shall be suffered to endure afterwards cannot be left to a jury, under the circumstances, with either certainty or safety; it must be a deterfninate one, and measured by the court as a conclusion of law. But without resorting to parallel provisions for cases standing in the same mischief, it will be impossible to extract a definite rule from words of such indefinite import, as \u201cduly prosecuted.\u201d When we find in a series of subsequent enactments on the basis of circumstances essentially the same, a particular period assumed as the reasonable and proper one for the duration of a lien depending on a judicial recognition of the debt\u2014as five years for the lien of a judgment by the act of 1798, and the same period for the lien of a <em>testatum scire facias </em>registered in the proper county by the act of 1823\u2014it seems reasonable to adopt it as an interpretation indicated by the legislature itself, in giving, as we are compelled to do, a determinate meaning to words which are not susceptible of a fixed construction, without resorting to this or some other assumption equally arbitrary. The most plausible objection to it is, that to apply the specific provisions of a statute to cases merely analogous, partakes apparently of legislation as much as construction: But it is the principle and not the specific provision that is applied by adoption as a rule of construction ; and it is to be remembered, that principles borrowed from statutes of limitations, to which class the act of 1798 certainly belongs, have been frequently applied by the courts with decisive effect, if not as a positive bar, to subjects not within their purview; for instance in corporeal rights which are barred, in analogy to the 21 <em>Jac. </em>1, by an adverse interruption of them for twenty years. In the same way, the British statutes of limitations have been adopted in practice by their courts of chancery, though expressly confined by the terms,of their enactment to the courts of common law; yet this has never been charged asa judicial encroachment on the prerogative of the legislature. If, then, the principles of such a statute may be engrafted on a ride of equity or of the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>law, why may they not be resorted to for the interpretation of an ambiguous clause in a preceding statute <em>in pari materia ? </em>The lien of a judgment itself, though derived from the statute of <em>Westm. </em>2, the original and still the general law in England for taking land in execution, depends on a provision borrowed from the statute <em>de </em>mer<em>catoribus </em>passed a few months later, which, in creating the recognisance called a statute merchant, declared that the conusee should have <em>\u201c </em>execution of all the lands that were in the hands of the conusor, the day of the recognisance made, into whose hands soever they come after, either by feoffment or otherwise\u201d\u2014a clause that is not in the original statute, or in our acts for taking land in execution. Yet it is the origin of the lien attributed to judgments in the construction of that statute, as well as our own. In all cases like the present, where a court is called on to affix a definite meaning to words which were understood in no definite sense by those who used them, it is the safest and most reasonable course, to resort to their subsequent provisions for cases in the same circumstances. Taking then, the act of 1798 as a guide to the construction of the clause in question, it results, that in order to preserve a lien on the estate of a decedent beyond the limitation of seven years, an action must be prosecuted to satisfaction, or the judgment be revived as in other cases. To accomplish the latter, a resort to the <em>scire facias </em>instituted by the act of 1798, is not only unnecessary, but would be improper, for no such writ was known to the law when the clause in question was enacted; and the writ given by the statute of <em>Westm. </em>2, being adequate to the purpose, ought rather to be used.. What remains then, is to determine the point of time from which the further limitation consequent on a revival, is to run. In Trevor <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, it was said, that if the creditor sue out a <em>scire facias immediately </em>before the expiration of the seven years, the lien will endure for five years longer; from which it might be inferred, that it was supposed to run from the time of revival, and not from the end of the original period; nothing of which was intended, for, counting from the judgment, the demand, in that case, would have been barred. It might be otherwise were the character of the lien changed or a new one created; but as nothing more is done than to prevent the lapse of the old one, the second period is necessarily to be computed from the end of the seven years. Such then being the construction put on the act of 1797 in Trevor <em>v. </em>Ellenberger, how does it dispose of the case before us <em>1 </em>The decedent died in 1804: the bonds were sued to November term 1806, and judgments recovered in 1807 were successively revived in 1812 and 1821; and executions issued in 1829 and 1830, were levied on the lands in question. It is an immaterial part of the case, that these lands had passed from the devisees of the decedent to purchasers, as the lien would have been gone without it. It was indeed taken for granted in Bruch <em>v. </em>Lantz, 2 <em>Rawle </em>392, that the limitation was not designed to be a protection for Volunteers; but the point has since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>been directly considered in Kerper <em>v. </em>Hoch, 1 <em>Watts </em>9, and a contrary principle established against the inclination of my opinion, which I shall however be the last to question. In the case before us, judgment was properly given for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
