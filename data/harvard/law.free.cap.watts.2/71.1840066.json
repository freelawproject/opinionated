A transcript of this judgment was filed in the common pleas in 1830. John Shannon having also died in the meantime, this <em>scire facias </em>was issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-9\">The defendants moved the court to strike off the transcript on the ground that the justice had exceeded his jurisdiction,-and the proceeding was a nullity. The plaintiffs asked the court to permit them to amend their <em>scire facias.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b71-10\">The court refused to permit the amendment, but struck off the transcript as a nullity.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-11\"><em>Penrose, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AWK\">cited, 12 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>72.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b71-12\"><em>Williamson, </em>for defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9A\">cited: Guilky <em>v. </em>Gillingham, 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>93; Braman <em>v. </em>Kelly, 8 <em>Serg. </em>&amp; <em>Rawle </em>479; Pedan <em>v. </em>Cox, 3 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>246; King <em>v. </em>King, 1 <em>Penn.

But was not the entry supported by the transcript of the last <em>1 </em>The apparent1 defect in it is, that after one of the original defendants had been released by death, his personal representatives were brought on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>the record and made jointly liable with the survivor, on whom the liability had exclusively devolved. Had this been done by adversary process, the justice would have transcended his jurisdiction, and the judgment would have been void. But it was rendered by voluntary appearance and confession, and, though erroneous, it cannot be inquired into in a collateral way.
