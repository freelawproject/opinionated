INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">In this consolidated multi-district litigation (\u201cMDL\u201d), plaintiffs seek relief from contamination, or threatened contamination, of groundwater from various defendants\u2019 use of the gasoline additive methyl tertiary butyl ether (\u201cMTBE\u201d) and/or tertiary butyl alcohol (\u201cTBA\u201d), a degradation product of MTBE.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The parties have already engaged in extensive motion practice, and familiarity with the Court\u2019s previous opinions is assumed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants now move for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 product liability, public nuisance, deceptive business practices, negligence and related claims, insofar as they relate to defendants\u2019 manufacturing or selling gasoline containing MTBE and/or TBA (\u201cproduct liability claims\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 product liability claims present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>nonjusticiable political questions under two prongs of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Baker v. Carr.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Specifically, defendants argue that (1) resolution of this case requires an initial policy determination regarding MTBE and (2) judicial involvement would express a lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government, because Congress has expressed an intent to resolve the \u201chighly politicized issues surrounding MTBE, ... by means other than litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> For the following reasons, defendants\u2019 motion is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">II. LEGAL STANDARD</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The parties dispute which of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure covers a motion to dismiss under the political question doctrine. Defendants moved pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 product liability claims. Plaintiffs claim that the political question doctrine is not jurisdictional and that defendants\u2019 motion should be treated as a motion for judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants respond that regardless of how the motion is construed the legal standard is the same.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">\u201cIn determining whether a case presents a non-justiciable political question, the court must first make a \u2018discriminating inquiry into the precise facts and posture of the particular case.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As the Second Circuit has explained, the question of justiciability should not be conflated with that of jurisdiction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> A motion to dismiss pursuant to the political question doctrine is a \u201cmotion to dismiss for failure to state a justiciable cause of action.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Here, because the motion has been made on the pleadings, it is appropriate to ana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>lyze it pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">The task of the court in ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion is \u201cmerely to assess the legal feasibility of the complaint, not to assay the weight of the evidence which might be offered in support thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> When deciding a motion to dismiss, a court must accept all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and draw all reasonable inferences in plaintiffs favor.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, for a motion to dismiss on nonjusticiability to succeed, it must be clear from the Complaint that the case involves or requires determination of an inextricably linked political question.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">III. APPLICABLE LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The political question doctrine calls for a careful and delicate analysis into whether a \u201cmatter has been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This doctrine is distinguished from lack of jurisdiction, as \u201cconsideration of the cause is not ... foreclosed; rather, the [] inquiry necessarily proceeds to the point of deciding whether the duty asserted can be judicially identified and its breach judicially determined, and whether protection for the right asserted can be judicially molded.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This \u201cnonjurisdictional, prudential\u201d doctrine distinguishes between political cases and political questions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u201cA well-recognized, if not altogether clear\u201d doctrine, it \u201cinstructs federal courts to avoid deciding \u2018political questions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The doctrine requires dismissal, where a political <em>question </em>is inextricably linked to the case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-12\">Cases pose non-justiciable political questions only to the extent that those questions are \u201cbeyond the competence and proper institutional role of the federal courts.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Supreme Court established six factors for determining whether an action is nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> A case fails to state a justiciable cause of action if it \u201cprominently\u201d involves:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>(1) \u2018a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-4\">(2) a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">(3) the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-6\">(4) the impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">(5) an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-8\">(6) the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\u2019 <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">In <em>Baker, </em>plaintiffs challenged the Tennessee Apportionment Act claiming that the apportionment scheme placed them in a position of \u201cconstitutionally unjustifiable inequality.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Court found that it was not barred from deciding the case because the plaintiffs\u2019 equal protection challenge posed an ordinary question of constitutional interpretation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-17\">Over the years, the Supreme Court has applied the political question doctrine to questions under the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> as well as ratification of constitutional amendments, impeachment of officials from office, foreign policy decisions, training of state national guards, and political party disputes.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In 1973, for example, the Court found a claim regarding the use of the National Guard three years earlier to quell student unrest non-justiciable.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The Court found it would be inappropriate for a district court to evaluate the \u201cwide range, of possibly dissimilar procedures and policies approved by different law enforcement agencies or other authorities\u201d for training, equipping, and general management of the military forces.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>In recent years, the Supreme Court has only applied the political question doctrine to cases implicating the first two <em>Baker </em>criteria.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> As the Court has explained, the criteria are \u201cprobably listed in descending order of both importance and certainty.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Thus, in a case that involved the Senate\u2019s impeachment duties under the Constitution, the Court applied the first factor and found that the case was nonjusticiable based on a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> And, in a case regarding political gerrymandering, Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality opinion applied the second factor to bar a claim noting that the Court lacked judicially manageable standards for deciding the case.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In contrast, where the government argued that judicial review of a statute\u2019s constitutionality would show a lack of respect to Congress because Congress had explicitly considered a statute\u2019s constitutionality, the Court refused to apply the fourth factor to bar a claim, noting that \u201ca judicial finding that Congress has passed an unconstitutional law might in some sense be said to entail a \u2018lack of respect\u2019 for Congress\u2019 judgment. But disrespect, in [this sense], cannot be sufficient to create a political question.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">The third and fourth factors have, however, recently been applied by courts in the Second Circuit. These cases, when read in conjunction with the Supreme Court\u2019s earlier cases, demonstrate that the third factor' \u2014 \u201cthe impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion\u201d\u2014 requires a court to avoid removing an important policy determination from the Legislature. For example, in <em>767 Third Avenue; </em>plaintiffs sought to recover unpaid rent for offices leased to the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY), and the court found the claim nonjusticiable based on the third <em>Baker </em>factor.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> The SFRY had been replaced by the countries of Macedonia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and defendants argued that liability for the rent could not be determined until the questions of which individual states succeeded to the liabilities of the SFRY, and in what proportion liabilities would be allocated, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>were resolved. The United States submitted a statement in the case arguing that its policy was to allocate interests and liabilities among states through international negotiations, and that liability could not attach \u201cin the absence of a political determination\u201d regarding succession.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> The Second Circuit found that there were no standards for a court to use to make the initial policy decision of \u201cthe equitable distribution of the public debt of a foreign state between several successor states.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">In another example, a district court recently found a claim to abate \u201cthe public nuisance of global warming\u201d nonjusticiable as it required \u201can initial policy determination of a kind clearly for non-judicial discretion.\u201d <footnotemark>37</footnotemark> That court found that the claims regarding global warming were unique in the context of \u201cpollution-as-public-nuisance cases\u201d as they \u201ctouched on so many areas of national and international policy.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In contrast, one district court has refused to apply the third factor in a case involving allegations by Vietnamese nationals that United States herbicide manufacturers were responsible under international law and tort law for harming them and their land during the Vietnam War.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Defendants argued that the question would require an initial policy determination to assess \u201cthe President\u2019s conduct during a time of war.\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> However, the court found that this \u201ckind of determination is one of substantive international law, not policy.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b338-14\">The fourth criteria \u2014 \u201cthe impossibility of a court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government\u201d\u2014 is generally only implicated where judicial resolution of a question \u201cwould contradict prior decisions taken by a political branch in those limited contexts where such contradiction would seriously interfere with important governmental interests.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> For example, the Second Circuit found that \u201cjudicial deference\u201d was due to the Executive Branch where it had filed a \u201cstatement of interest\u201d urging dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 claims against the Republic of Austria for \u201clooting, expropriation, Aryanization, and/or liquidation\u201d of their property be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>tween 1938 and 1945.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The United States had entered into an executive agreement with Austria under which Austria was to set up a fund to compensate Austrian Jews, but disbursement of the funds was contingent on dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 putative class action against Austria. The Second Circuit found in a two-to-one decision that \u201ca court\u2019s undertaking independent resolution\u201d of the claim would be impossible \u201cwithout expressing lack of respect due the Executive Branch.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In another case, where neither the Executive nor the Legislature had \u201cmade significant political decisions\u201d in the areas raised by the plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the claims were found to be justiciable.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">The political question analysis must be performed carefully and on a case-by-case basis.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Considering the Supreme Court\u2019s reticence in applying the later <em>Baker </em>criteria to find a case nonjusticiable, utmost caution is warranted in considering a request based on those criteria. The political-question doctrine continues to rest, at least in part, \u201con prudential concerns calling for mutual respect among the three branches of Government.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">IV. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">This motion requires me to weigh \u201c[t]he respect due to coequal and independent departments,\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> against \u201c[t]he very essence of civil liberty ... the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs\u2019 claims \u201crun afoul\u201d of the third and fourth <em>Baker </em>criteria because (1) the Court cannot balance the interests implicated by plaintiffs\u2019 \u201ceffort to ban MTBE absent \u2018an initial policy determination\u2019 by Congress and the President\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> and (2) the Court cannot grant plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief without \u201c \u2018expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Plaintiffs respond that <em>Baker </em>factor three does not apply as there are clear and well-settled rules for determining plaintiffs\u2019 product liability, public nuisance, and other claims. In addition, plaintiffs argue that <em>Baker </em>factor four is not applicable as Congress has not made a decision or set a policy regarding MTBE.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> Plaintiffs note that merely because MTBE legislation has been proposed and debated in Congress is no guide to congressional intent. Allowing congressional debates to create a political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>question, as defendants claim, would permit a defendant to \u201clobby its way into a dismissal even when it comes up short in Congress.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">A. <em>Baker </em>Factor Three</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The third <em>Baker </em>factor requires courts to evaluate whether it would be impossible to decide the case without making an initial policy determination of a kind clearly involving nonjudicial discretion. Defendants characterize plaintiffs\u2019 requests for relief as broad policy goals which can only be achieved by replacing MTBE with ethanol throughout the national fuel supply.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Defendants claim that this Court cannot balance the \u201crelevant economic, environmental, energy and security interests implicated by plaintiffs\u2019 effort to ban MTBE\u201d before Congress and the President make an initial policy determination regarding whether to ban the product.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Defendants have blurred the line between a determination of whether defendants are liable for water pollution caused by MTBE and a policy determination regarding the composition of the country\u2019s fuel supply. Here, the only relevant policy determination would be if Congress had decided to ban the use of MTBE or grant manufacturers immunity from lawsuits asserting damages attributable to the use of MTBE. But Congress has not made any such determination. If and when it makes such a decision, the Court can then assess the impact of that decision on these cases.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">Tort litigation concerning a gasoline additive may proceed despite the possibility that Congress may ban any further use of the product. Even when products are heavily regulated under federal law, tort suits involving those products may be brought absent a congressional injunction prohibiting such suits.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> For example, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>prescription drugs are heavily regulated by the federal government,<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> but the Products Liability Restatement nonetheless includes a provision for product liability for prescription drugs and medical devices.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Thus, where the foreseeable risk of a drug or medical device is so great in comparison to its benefits that a reasonable medical provider, knowing the risks, would not prescribe the drug for \u201cany class of patients,\u201d the drug is defective.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In general, while Congressional regulation is relevant to tort liability, it is not dispositive.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">This case is distinguishable from <em>Connecticut v. American Electric Power Company.</em><footnotemark><em>62</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In that case, the court found that plaintiffs sought to enact broad limits on carbon dioxide emissions and that Congress and the Executive had issued explicit statements \u201con the issue of global climate change in general,\u201d specifically refused to \u201cimpose limits on carbon dioxide emissions,\u201d taken several steps to study and research the issues involved in global warming, and directed the Secretary of State to \u201ccoordinate U.S. negotiations concerning global climate change.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Though Congress has studied MTBE, defendants cannot point to any similar statements or actions regarding MTBE. Indeed, Congress has not banned the use of MTBE and has passed no law governing liability for the decision to use MTBE and any contamination its use may have caused. Failure to act on an issue is a notoriously poor guide to congressional purpose.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">In addition, while plaintiffs in the global warming case sought quasi legislative remedies such as an injunction \u201cenjoining each of the defendants to abate its contribution to the nuisance by capping its emissions of carbon dioxide and then reducing those emissions by a specified percentage each year for at least a decade,\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> plaintiffs here do not seek such relief. Plaintiffs simply request that defendants be prevented from \u201cengaging in further <em>releases </em>of MTBE.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-10\">It is also inaccurate for defendants to assert that plaintiffs are seeking an \u201cetha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>nol mandate.\u201d To the extent plaintiffs referred to \u201csafer alternatives,\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> such as ethanol, this tracks the typical product liability claim. New York law, for example, requires that a plaintiff show a \u201creasonable alternative design before she will be permitted to recover in strict liability for a defectively designed product.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> The weighing of alternative designs is typical of the balancing undertaken in courts around the country in product liability cases and it is wholly independent of a policy determination mandating the use of ethanol.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">Defendants finally argue that plaintiffs\u2019 actions do not comprise \u201cordinary tort actions\u201d because they named defendants who did not actually \u201crelease\u201d gasoline containing MTBE.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> It is well accepted, however, that product defect claims may be brought against manufacturers.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> Merely because plaintiffs have asserted a claim of market share liability based primarily on the difficulty of product identification does not transform a complex product liability case into a political question.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">B. <em>Baker </em>Factor Four</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">The fourth <em>Baker </em>factor requires a court to determine whether -judicial resolution of a question \u201cwould contradict prior decisions taken by a political branch in those limited contexts where such contradiction would seriously interfere with important governmental interests.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Defendants argue that plaintiffs raise nonjusticiable political questions in light of \u201cCongress\u2019s active and ongoing debate regarding the use of MTBE and ethanol in gasoline sold in the US.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Defendants then argue that plaintiffs seek a regulatory scheme regarding the fuel supply that would implicate the standards set by Congress\u2019s reformulated gasoline program under the Clean Air Act and the ability of refiners and manufacturers to meet emissions standards.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>Allowing these claims to proceed does not contradict any prior decisions made by a coordinate branch of government because Congress has never spoken on the issues raised in these lawsuits. Defendants point to legislative findings to a proposed bill that was introduced in the House of Representatives on April 8, 2005, which state that setting \u201cdrinking water standards is a complex public policy determination requiring careful analysis and balancing of a number of factors.\u201d<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> The bill was sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce and the House Committee on the Judiciary on the day it was proposed.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> It remains in those Committees to this day. As such, the proposed findings cannot be considered evidence of legislative intent nor are they a prior legislative decision which would be contradicted by allowing these cases to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">Defendants also point to the fact that MTBE \u201cwas hotly debated in the 109th Congress in the context of H.R. 6,\u201d the Energy Policy Act of 2005.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> But, as defendants concede, the signed Act does not shield MTBE producers from product liability claims, impose a nationwide ban on MTBE, or mandate ethanol\u2019s use in its place.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> These provisions were debated and proposed but no legislative decision was made on the issue of liability for water pollution caused by MTBE.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-12\">Defendants note that the EPA has been actively involved in regulating and investigating use of MTBE and ethanol in gasoline. Defendants refer to recommendations by an EPA Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates regarding use of MTBE and ethanol, which recommend reducing MTBE use over time.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Defendants also claim that the Energy Policy Act of 2005 replaced the oxygenate requirements under the Clean Air Act with economic incentives to use ethanol and a timeline for meeting the new standards, and thus, a \u201cde facto ban [on MTBE] and ethanol mandate would usurp Congress\u2019s power\u201d to set such a timeline.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-13\">Regulatory recommendations from the Blue Ribbon Panel do not prove that Congress intends to resolve the issues raised in this litigation. And, though Congress has considered phasing out MTBE, there is no sign that Congress or the President has set up an alternative forum or entered into an agreement to resolve plaintiffs\u2019 product liability claims outside the judicial process, as in Whiteman.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Indeed, plaintiffs\u2019 requested relief, including investiga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>tion, monitoring, and an early warning system, does not conflict with EPA recommendations as those recommendations track some of the equitable relief sought by plaintiffs.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Thus, while \u201c[i]t is true that requests for injunctive relief can be particularly susceptible to justiciability problems\u201d a ruling by any court that defendants must clean up MTBE contamination and take precautions to avoid causing further MTBE contamination would not clearly interfere or <em>conflict </em>with federal policy goals regarding the country\u2019s fuel supply.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Defendants\u2019 arguments boil down to the claim that holding manufacturers, refiners, and sellers responsible for MTBE contamination is highly controversial and thus should be left to the Congress, the EPA, and the President.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> But, the fact that the issues arise in a \u201cpolitically charged context\u201d does not convert this tort suit into a non-justiciable political question, given that there is no evidence that Congress has decided that it would resolve the issues.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> While regulation of the national fuel supply is surely not an issue for the judicial branch, these suits seek abatement and damages in addition to a ban on further <em>contamination. </em>Weighing the issues in a products liability claim is a quintessential judicial function. Plaintiffs claim that \u201cwhen [defendants placed gasoline containing MTBE into the stream of commerce, it was defective and unreasonably dangerous for its intended and foreseeable uses,\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> and defendants had a duty to warn plaintiffs, the public, and public officials about the dangers posed by MTBE.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Though the political question doctrine has given rise to many difficult cases, this is not one of them. Plaintiffs\u2019 claims fall into the realm of justiciable questions and do not implicate a political question as defined by <em>Baker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">V. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">For the foregoing reasons, defendants\u2019 motion is denied.
