The horse was stolen in Mariposa County, and taken into Tuolumne County, where the defendant was arrested. On the trial Mallet the prosecuting witness was asked, for the purpose of impeaching his testimony, if he did not testify differently before the committing magistrate from what he then did. The Court on the objection of the District Attorney refused to allow the question to be put.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b421-11\">The defendant was convicted and sentenced, and appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b421-12\"><em>Edwin A.

It is never irrelevant to inquire of a witness whether he has not on some former occasion given a different account of the matter, for the purpose of impeaching his testimony by contradicting him. (1 Greenleaf on Evidence, Sec. 449.) It will not do to say that this error was immaterial because Mallet\u2019s testimony upon the point in question was corroborated by other witnesses, and that therefore the verdict would have been the same had his testimony been successfully impeached in the mode proposed. We cannot say what effect the successful impeach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>ment of his testimony might have had upon the minds of the jury; and it cannot be held that an error is immaterial unless it be made ,to appear beyond all controversy that it could have had no effect whatever upon the verdict prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-7\">The point made on the motion to arrest the judgment is answered by the ninety-second section of the Criminal Practice Act, which provides that when property has been feloniously taken in one county and brought into another, the jurisdiction of the offense shall be in either county.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-8\">We do not deem it necessary to notice the other points.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-9\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
