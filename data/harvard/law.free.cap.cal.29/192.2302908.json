Notice was given for a settlement of the statement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>a day named, but before the time defendant paid the judgment, and plaintiff\u2019s attorney entered a satisfaction. Neither party appeared at the time named for a settlement of the statement. Defendant\u2019s attorney afterwards gave notice for a settlement of the statement, and both parties appearing, plaintiff\u2019s attorney objected to a settlement on the ground that the motion had been abandoned.

It was made in the course of proceedings taken with a view to a new trial, and is no more the subject of appeal than the order made in the course of the same proceedings fixing the 13th of February, 1865, as the day for settling the statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-11\">Further, there is no specification of grounds in the statement accompanying the appeal. The appeal is not based alone upon the affidavit contained in the record, but upon the affidavit aided, by a statement of facts <em>aliunde, </em>and is within the principle of <em>Haggin </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>28 Cal. 162.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
