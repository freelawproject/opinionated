Judgment by default was rendered March 9th, 1865, for ten thousand three hundred and twenty-six dollars and sixty-six cents, and it was provided in the judgment that the said^sum should bear interest from the date of judgment at the rate \u00f3f one per cent per month until paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">The judgment being by default, and the plaintiff having demanded in his complaint interest only <em>\u201cuntil rendition of </em>judgment,\u201d the appellant claims so much of the judgment as allows interest <em>after </em>the rendition of judgment \u201cat one per cent per month until paid \u201d to be erroneous, because, to this extent, it exceeds the relief demanded in the complaint, and is in violation of section one hundred and forty-seven of the Practice Act, which provides, that, \u201c the relief granted to the plaintiff, if there be no answer, shall not exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">The respondent, on the other hand, insists that section two of the statutes of 1850, relating to interest, prescribes what the judgment shall be upon contracts bearing a conventional rate of interest, and that, when such a contract is the basis of \u2018an action, it is the duty of the Court to direct by its judgment that said judgment shall bear interest at the stipulated rate, irrespective of the relief demanded in the complaint. The section, which was in force when the Practice Act was adopted, is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-11\">\u201c Sec. 2. Parties may agree in writing for the payment of any rate of interest whatever on money due, or to become due, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>on any contract. Any judgment rendered on such contract shall conform thereto, and shall bear the interest agreed upon by the parties, and which shall be specified in the judgment.\u201d (Statutes 1850, 92.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">But the question is not what judgment plaintiff\u2019s contract and the law relating to it entitles him to demand, and have entered upon such demand; but what judgment has he demanded, and does the relief afforded exceed that demanded in his complaint? The law and his contract give him a right to certain relief, but the Practice Act prescribes the mode by which he must obtain the relief to which he is entitled ; and it says, that the measure of his relief, if there be no answer\u2014 no matter how much may be his due\u2014\u201c shall not exceed that which he shall have demanded in his complaint.\u201d There can be no misunderstanding the meaning of these terms. That the judgment for a greater rate than ten per cent is a portion of the relief necessary to be given in express terms in the judgment there can be no doubt. The judgment would bear interest from its date at the legal rate without any specific provision to that effect, for the law\u2014section one\u2014so pi'ovides. As no specific relief in the judgment is required to enable plaintiff to collect the statutory rate, no prayer for such relief is necessary. But to enable the plaintiff, to receive a higher conventional rate of interest, it must be \u201cspecified in the judgment.\u201d This requires a special judgment\u2014specific relief. It is as much specific relief as the foreclosure of a mortgage, or any other extraordinary relief. And there is no more reason for granting one kind of specific relief in face of the express provision of the statute, than another. The plaintiff in this case was, under the law and his contract, as much, entitled to a judgment of upwards of ten thousand dollars, as that his judgment should bear the conventional rate of interest. He might, however, have demanded judgment for only five thousand dollars. Had he done so, we apprehend no one would have claimed, that a judgment for ten thousand dollars could be sustained under the provision of the Practice Act. What he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>did do was in reality to demand judgment for a specific, certain sum, less than he was entitled to demand\u2014for he demanded judgment for ten thousand dollars and interest at one per cent per month from a specified date <em>until rendition of judgment, </em>and as soon as the date at which the judgment was to be rendered was ascertained, it was only necessary to make the computation to ascertain the precise sum demanded. If the plaintiff does not obtain the full measure of relief to which his contract and the law would have entitled him, it is because he failed to demand it, and it is his own fault. We think the relief granted exceeded that demanded in the complaint, and to that extent unauthorized. <em>(Raun </em>v. <em>Reynolds, </em>11 Cal. 19 ; <em>Gage </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>20 Cal. <em>91; Lattimer </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>20 Cal. 63; <em>Lamping </em>v. <em>Hyatt, </em>27 Cal. 103; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Gluckauf, </em>28 Cal. 288.)</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">Ordered that the judgment be modified by striking out all that \u00a1Dortion of the judgment allowing interest at one per 'cent per month subsequent to the rendition of judgment, and that appellant recover his costs of appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
