The judgment of the Court below recited the amount of the defalcation to be one thousand two hundred and thirty-six dollars and thirty-six cents, and then recited the penal sum of the bond, and the amount for which each surety had bound himself, and then a separate judgment was rendered against each surety who had signed for a greater amount than the defalcation, for the full amount of the defalcation and costs, and against each surety who had signed for a less amount than the defalcation, for the amount for which he signed and costs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-6\">The defendants appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-7\"><em>Alexander </em>Deering, for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b643-8\"><em>Campbell &amp; Burckhalter, </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b643-9\">By the Court, Sanderson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">In actions like the present the judgment should first fix the amount of the defalcation or recovery and thereafter proceed with a separate judgment against each of the sureties for the full amount for which he has made himself liable in the bond and costs, and then close with a proviso to.the effect that each shall be satisfied by the collection or payment of the amount of the defalcation or recovery and costs.
