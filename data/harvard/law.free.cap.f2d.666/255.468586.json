Under Maxwell\u2019s previous authorization, it could transport \u201cspent silica gel catalyst, in bulk.\u201d The new authorization empowers Maxwell to transport \u201ccommodities in bulk,\u201d without further restriction. The genesis of the ICC\u2019s decision is its \u201cGuidelines\u201d for removal of restrictions on commodities that a carrier may transport. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1137.21(b). In Steere\u2019s view, these guidelines contravene the ICC\u2019s authority under the Motor Carrier Act of 1980, and, therefore, the broadened certificate granted to Maxwell is invalid. Under our decision in <em>American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. ICC, </em>659 F.2d 452 (5th Cir. 1981), Steere\u2019s petition must be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-20\">The Motor Carrier Act of 1980 authorizes the ICC to lift unreasonable restrictions from the certificates that authorize motor carriers to transport goods. 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10922(h)(1). To implement this statutory aim, the Commission issued guidelines for processing restriction-removal applications. The guidelines inform an applicant who is authorized only to haul \u201cone or more named commodities\u201d that the ICC will routinely grant an application for broader authorization framed in terms of the Commission\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>generally accepted categories, such as \u201ccommodities in bulk.\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1137.21(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">The Commission\u2019s guidelines ineluctably compel an applicant to use the categories suggested by the Commission. <em>American Trucking Associations, </em>659 F.2d at 463.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Maxwell\u2019s application did track the Commission\u2019s language, requesting the removal of the restriction to \u201cspent silica gel catalysts, in bulk\u201d and the substitution of an authorization to transport \u201ccommodities in bulk.\u201d Pursuant to its rule, the Commission granted the restriction-removal application.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">In <em>American Trucking Associations, </em>this Court reviewed portions of the ICC\u2019s guidelines implementing the Motor Carrier Act\u2019s command \u201cto reasonably broaden the categories of property authorized.\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10922(h)(1). We interpreted the Commission\u2019s guidelines to force an applicant for the removal of restrictions to adopt the broad categories suggested by the Commission. 659 F.2d at 463-64. We held that these categories failed to account for the Motor Carrier Act\u2019s mandate that every carrier be \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation to be authorized by the certificate.\u201d 49 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 10922(a)(1); 659 F.2d at 464. We noted that the Commission\u2019s formulas for removing restrictions on certificates make \u201cit likely that a carrier with authority to transport only one commodity who desires to transport only one additional commodity would be required to seek authority for an entire class of commodities, some of which the carrier may not wish to transport or may lack the ability to transport.\u201d 659 F.2d at 462. These observations led us to conclude that the guidelines were infirm because they fail to provide for \u201creasonable broadening\u201d of the category of products each carrier is authorized to haul. Therefore, we held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-14\">The carrier must be permitted, both by the Commission\u2019s express statement and actual agency practice, to seek some other commodity classification if it can show that use of the tripartite commission standard would require the transportation of commodities unrelated to those previously authorized or would require the institution of a different type of service, and that the carrier is not fit or is unwilling or is unable to provide the service. The procedure for seeking such a modification must be reasonably flexible so that applications will neither be arbitrarily prejudged nor condemned to excessive expense. Finally, there must be some opportunity for opposition to an application to be voiced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">Silica gel is a catalyst used in processing petroleum. Because the catalyst is exhausted through use, it must be periodically replaced. Maxwell hauls this \u201cspent silica gel in bulk.\u201d Its former certificate limited it to hauling this one item. As such, the certificate was an example of the overly-restrictive certificates that Congress condemned in the Motor Carrier Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">But the new category that the Commission has awarded Maxwell includes all products hauled in bulk.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Maxwell is now authorized to carry all petroleum products, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>all non-petroleum chemicals, all ores and minerals, tequila, Coca-Cola syrup, milk, liquid feed, dry fertilizer, flour, sugar, and a virtually unlimited list of other bulk goods. It is likely that Maxwell is fully competent to haul some of these goods but is either unversed or uninterested in hauling many others. The record contains no evidence to support a conclusion that the carrier is \u201cfit, willing, and able to provide the transportation authorized by the certificate.\u201d 49 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 10922(a)(lXA). We believe that an applicant for removal of a restriction should be required to make a prima facie showing in its application that it is fit, willing and able to provide the transportation for which it is seeking authorization. We do not suggest that such a showing must be elaborate. What form that showing should take and how detailed it should be are, in the first instance, matters that should be addressed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">We remand to the Interstate Commerce Commission for reconsideration in the light of our decision in <em>American Trucking Associations v. I. C. C., </em>659 F.2d 452 (5th Cir. 1981). Costs are to be divided equally.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b317-7\">. \u00a7 1137.21 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-8\">(b) <em>Where </em>a <em>carrier is authorized to transport one or more named commodities, the authority is considered unduly restrictive </em>and may normally be broadened under these procedures.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-9\">Use of these procedures is normally appropriate for applications which seek\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-10\">(1) to expend [sic] such a commodity authorization to the two-digit STCC level;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-11\">(2) to replace such an authorization with a commodity description contained in <em>Descriptions in Motor Carrier Certificates, </em>61 M.C.C. 209 (1952) and 766 (1953); or,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b317-12\">(3) <em>to replace such an authorization with a broader class description generally accepted by the Commission, such as commodities in bulk, </em>commodities which because of their size or weight require special equipment, or oilfield commodities as described in <em>Mercer Extension-Oilfield Commodities, </em>74 M.C.C. 459 (1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-18\">(emphasis supplied).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b317-19\">.
