Therefore the conclusion that the defendant was negligent must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">The finding, after all admissible corrections, discloses a fact situation bearing upon claimed contributory negligence of the plaintiff driver, Harold Jones, substantially as follows: The defendant\u2019s car, next behind it an automobile bearing Ohio markers, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>then the plaintiff\u2019s car were traveling westerly on a straight concrete highway, one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five feet apart and at a speed of thirty to thirty-five miles per hour. Upon the sudden stopping of the defendant\u2019s automobile the Ohio car turned sharply to its left and passed it. View of the defendant\u2019s car by Jones was obscured by the Ohio car until it so turned, he did not until then become aware that the defendant\u2019s car had stopped in his path, and by that time he had come within fifty feet of it. When so confronted by its presence he also turned to pass it on the left but perceived that eastbound traffic was then so close that he could not do so without danger of collision. Thereupon he applied his brakes and turned back to the right, colliding with the rear of the defendant\u2019s car. Under the circumstances the plaintiff driver could reasonably be regarded as not having created or materially contributed to the emergency which he encountered and the trial court was not precluded from concluding, as it did, that his conduct during the few seconds intervening between his first knowledge of that emergency and the collision did not constitute contributory negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">There is no error on either appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
