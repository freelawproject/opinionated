To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>continue this credit, Zachs with the other defendant, Safran, executed a guaranty on November 2d, 1928, a copy of which is quoted in the footnote.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">On receipt of this guaranty, the plaintiff delivered additional merchandise to the Spring Company until, on January 1st, 1929, there was due $4374.08. During January and February, 1929, the plaintiff repeatedly demanded payment not only from the Spring Company but from Zachs and Safran, and they asked the plaintiff not to institute legal proceedings. For their accommodation, and to fix a definite time for payment, the plaintiff, on March 10th, 1929, accepted a two months\u2019 note from the Spring Company, which Zachs and Safran personally endorsed. This note was three times renewed. When the original note matured, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>was reduced by a payment of $275.59 and a new two months\u2019 note, endorsed by the defendants, was given. When this latter note matured, it was reduced by the payment of $300 and another two months\u2019 note in the sum of $3500, again endorsed by the defendants, was given. When this note matured, it was not reduced in amount, but interest was paid upon it, and another similar two months\u2019 note, again endorsed by the defendants, was given to the plaintiff. These notes were not accepted by the plaintiff as payment of the debt of the Spring Company, or in discharge or in lieu of the guaranty, or as additional security, but because Zachs had asked the plaintiff to handle the balance in this manner. When the last note matured, it was presented for payment at the bank, but was not paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The language of the instrument, viewed in the light of the situation of the parties as disclosed by the finding, evidences without question an absolute and unqualified undertaking upon the part of the guarantors to pay for merchandise, both past and future, which might be furnished by the plaintiff to the Spring Company. In <em>Sage </em>v. <em>Wilcox, </em>6 Conn. 81, we had before us an instrument reading \u201cI hereby guaranty the payment of the within note, one year from this date;\u201d and the four judges were equally divided as to whether this constituted a conditional or absolute guarantee. In the following cases, however, the guarantees were held to be absolute: \u201cI hereby guaranty payment;\u201d <em>Breed </em>v. <em>Hillhouse, </em>7 Conn. 523; \u201cWe guarantee the within note until paid;\u201d <em>City Savings Bank </em>v. <em>Hopson, </em>53 Conn. 454, 5 Atl. 601; \u201cWe guarantee payment of the within note;\u201d <em>Loomis Institute </em>v. <em>Hurd, </em>57 Conn. 435, 18 Atl. 669; \u201cI hereby guarantee the punctual payment,\u201d etc.; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Waddingham, </em>58 Conn. 375, 395, 20 Atl. 335; \u201cWe sign the above note for security for payment thereof which we hereby guarantee;\u201d <em>Beards</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number><em>ley </em>v. <em>Hawes, </em>71 Conn. 39, 43, 40 Atl. 1043; <em>\u201cI </em>hereby guarantee the payment of said rent;\u201d <em>Garland </em>v. <em>Gaines, </em>73 Conn. 662, 666, 49 Atl. 19; \u201cI hereby guarantee . . ..the. full payment of the note;\u201d <em>Higinbotham </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>113 Conn. 62, 72, 154 Atl. 242. In at least two of these instances, the guaranties before the court were upon separate instruments from that the payment of which was in question. <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Waddingham, </em>and <em>Higinbotham </em>v. <em>Manchester, supra. </em>The language of the guaranty before us is <em>\u201cWe </em>do hereby guarantee and hold ourselves jointly and severally responsible for the payment at maturity of the purchase price,\u201d etc.; this falls fully within the precedents we have cited, and the conclusion that the intent was to make it an absolute rather than a conditional guaranty gathers weight rather than otherwise from the statement that the signers held themselves jointly and severally responsible for the payment; nor is there anything in the terms of the instrument which reasonably can be construed to evince a different intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">The guaranty being absolute, no steps were required to enforce the debt against the principal before proceeding against the guarantors. <em>Beardsley </em>v. <em>Hawes, </em>and <em>Higinbotham </em>v. <em>Manchester, supra. </em>The notes were taken at the request and with the knowledge of the guarantors and with no intent on the part of any of the parties that the contract of guaranty was thereby affected. The interest was paid after the debt had long matured, upon the third renewal of the note. This imposed no additional burden upon the guarantors. The agreement provided for payment of the accounts at maturity; this necessarily implied interest after maturity. Interest on sums past due is in the nature of a penalty for the wrongful detention of money due. <em>Healy </em>v. <em>Fallon, </em>69 Conn. 228, 37 Atl. 495; <em>Capitol City Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Sudarsky, </em>95 Conn. 336, 341, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Atl. 349. The evidence does not justify an addition to the finding that the Spring Company entered into any agreement with the plaintiff for the payment of interest on the indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote orphan=\"true\">\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u201cPlease sell and deliver to the Everlast Spring Company of Hartford, Conn., hereinafter called the purchaser, on your usual credit terms, such goods, wares and merchandise as the purchaser from time to time may select.
