Memorandum: We reject defendant\u2019s contention that the prosecutor shifted the burden of proof during his summation. The prosecutor\u2019s comments were a proper response to defense counsel\u2019s summation <em>(see, People v Maisonet, </em>172 AD2d 274, <em>lv denied </em>78 NY2d 969; <em>People v Peralta, </em>172 AD2d 155, <em>lv denied </em>78 NY2d 925). Any impropriety in the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of defendant was not so egregious that it deprived defendant of a fair trial <em>(see, People v Toumbis, </em>204 AD2d 1026; <em>People v Dawkins, </em>203 AD2d 957, 958, <em>lv denied </em>84 NY2d 824).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-7\">The trial court properly declined to grant a mistrial based upon a communication between two jurors and the employer of one of those jurors. Given the nature of the information discussed, there is no likelihood that defendant was prejudiced <em>(cf., People v Brown, </em>48 NY2d 388, 394; <em>People v Magnano, </em>175 AD2d 639, <em>lv denied </em>79 NY2d 860).</p>\n<p id=\"b824-8\">The testimony of the victim\u2019s mother regarding the victim\u2019s prompt complaint did not constitute bolstering <em>(see, People v McDaniel, </em>81 NY2d 10, 16-17; <em>People v Guerra, </em>174 AD2d 502, <em>lv denied </em>78 NY2d 1076). The other alleged instances of bolstering are not preserved for our review <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.05 [2]), and we decline to exercise our power to review them as a matter of discretion in the interest of justice <em>(see, </em>CPL 470.15 [6] [a]). We also decline to review the contention, raised for the first time on appeal, that the trial court exhibited partiality in its rulings and comments to defense counsel <em>(see, People v Charleston, </em>56 NY2d 886, 887). The sentence imposed is not unduly harsh or severe. (Appeal from Judgment of Ontario County Court, Henry, Jr., J. \u2014 Sexual Abuse, 1st Degree.) Present \u2014 Green, J.
