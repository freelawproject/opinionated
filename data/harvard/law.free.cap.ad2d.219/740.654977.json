Upon review of the record, we find that substantial evidence, consisting of the misbehavior report and testimony of the correction officer who prepared it, supports the administrative determination. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s claim, we find that petitioner was given adequate notice of the charges against him. We further find that the Hearing Officer did not unduly restrict petitioner\u2019s questioning of the correction officer who prepared the misbehavior report. We have considered petitioner\u2019s remaining contentions and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">Cardona, P. J., Mercure, White, Yesawich Jr. and Peters, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
