The practice of applying to suppress depositions, on a special motion, was founded upon the rule on that subject, and was not a part of the general practice of the court of chancery; and as the rule has been abrogated, no such practice now exists. The proper course to pursue will be to move, on the hearing, to suppress the depositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
