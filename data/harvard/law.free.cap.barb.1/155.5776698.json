J. The slander consisted in charging the plaintiff with stealing the defendant\u2019s money. And the words were uttered in the presence of police officers who were employed by the defendant to make investigations respecting a theft or robbery which had been committed in his store. There was no evidence that any other person was present at the time the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>charge was made. The defendant pleaded the general issue. Upon the trial a witness testified that subsequent to the uttering of the slander the plaintiff had said to the defendant that if the latter would write to his brother, at Albany, stating plaintiff\u2019s innocence, the plaintiff would be satisfied. The defendant\u2019s brother testified to the receipt of a letter from the defendant about a week after the <em>money </em>was stolen, which letter he supposed was lost; that he had looked for it among his letters and papers two or three times and could not find it, and supposed he had destroyed it. The witness being asked to state the contents of the letter, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected, on the ground that the declarations of the defendant were inadmissible in his own favor. But the court allowed the witness <em>to </em>state the contents of the letter. To which decision exception was taken. The plaintiff also excepted to other decisions of the judge respecting the admission of testimony, and to his charge; which exceptions will appear from the opinion of the court. The jury having found a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiff, upon a case, moved for a new trial.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-6\">\n<em>E. C. Gray,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Az\">for the plaintiff. The judge erred in permitting parol evidence to be given of the contents of the letter. The loss of the letter was not sufficiently proved. Neither should the witness Robinson have been allowed to testify as to the declarations of the defendant, in his own favor, at the time of the negotiation for an arbitration. The judge erred in charging the jury that the words uttered were privileged, if addressed to the police officers in their official capacity. The defendant was not privileged to state any thing more than the circumstances, and his suspicions. At all events, if any privilege existed, as respected the police officers, it would not excuse a declaration made to them when other persons were present, in his own store.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-7\">\n<em>H.

As the evidence showed that the words used were addressed to police officers while engaged in the investigation of a robbery, they were privileged. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>(1 <em>Stark on Sian. </em>202. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Evans, </em>3 <em>Esp.

After he had testified to an attempt made by the parties to arbitrate, he was asked by the defendant\u2019s counsel, whether the defendant did not say, during the negotiations to effect an arbitration, that he had satisfied the plaintiff by writing to his brother. This was objected to by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel, but the court allowed the question to be put, and the witness answered, that the defendant claimed during those negotiations that he had satisfied the plaintiff by writing to his brother, William Ken, and exculpating the plaintiff, which was all he desired. This does not appear to have been competent evidence ; and its reception might be a ground for ordering a new trial, under other circumstances. But the question arises on a case, and if this evidence, although objectionable, could not have materially influenced the jury in arriving at their verdict, a new trial ought not to be granted for this cause. It is true, that the evidence tended to prove one ground of the defence, to wit, accord and satisfaction. But the facts which it was claimed constituted that branch of the defence were already made out by other evidence, and there was no controversy as to those facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">It was clearly proved, that on one occasion when the parties were together, the defendant said he was sorry for what had occurred, and would do any thing in his power for the plaintiff. To which the plaintiff replied, that all he wished was that the defendant would write to his brother, William Kerr, in Albany; and it is proved that a letter had been so written by the defendant, by which he entirely exculpated the plaintiff. As to this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>there was no controversy in point of fact, and the objectionable evidence was merely cumulative upon a point of fact which was clearly established before. It could not have affected the finding of the jury as to the point of fact to which it was directed, and the verdict ought not to be disturbed for this cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The charge of the circuit judge was substantially correct. It does not appear from (he evidence, that any words imputing a ci;ime to the plaintiff, were uttered by the defendant in the presence of any persons except the two police officers with whom the plaintiff was in communication, for the purpose of detecting a crime. Therefore that portion of the judge\u2019s charge in which he stated that the defendant would not be liable to this action for making the statement to police officers, <em>although done in the presence and hearing of others, </em>could not, even if erroneous, have had any material influence upon the decision of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">New trial denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
