At the time of granting this order, the defendant\u2019s counsel was present, and was aware of it, and yet omitted to serve it, until July 7th ; and no offer was made by him to pay the costs. Judgment having been entered, on the 2d of July, . \u25a0</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b35-11\"><em>N. F.

He had good reason, under the circumstances, to believe that the defendant did not intend to use it. On the merits, however, the defendant might be let in, if the court were satisfied that he had any. The suit is against him as sheriff, for neglect of duty in not returning an execution. He merely swears generally to merits, without specifying what they are. And as I doubt, under the circumstances, whether he has any meritorious defence, I cannot let him in ; unless he discloses what that defence is, so that I may judge whether it is such an one as he ought to be allowed to set up.</p>\n<p id=\"b36-7\">Motion denied with costs; but without prejudice to the defendant\u2019s right to renew it, on papers disclosing the nature of his defence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
