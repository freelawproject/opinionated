The bill in this cause was filed to recover dower in certain lands in Orange county. It set forth that the plaintiff, on the 9th of November, 1814, was married to James Cunningham, who was then seised of the premises, consisting of about 100 acres; that on the 24th'of May, 1815, she joined with her husband in a conveyance thereof to one James Smith, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>the plaintiff being at that time an <em>infant; </em>that her said husband died in 1832, leaving her entitled to her dower; and that the defendant was in possession and refused to assign her dower. The bill required an answer on oath from the defendant. The answer stated that on the 3d day of May, 1814, James Smith was the owner of the premises, subject to the right of one Peter Bush to have a conveyance of seven acres, under a contract between them, and that said James Cunningham made an agreement with Smith and Bush to purchase the whole premises for $3750, of which $2875 was to be paid to Smith for the ninety-three acres, and $875 to Bush for the seven acres; and that Cunningham should execute his bond and mortgage to Bush, for the benefit of the vendors, upon the lands so sold, and upon certain other lands, to secure the payment of the whole purchase money with interest, one year from that date; and that Smith should continue in the actual possession of the ninety-three acres until the payment of said sum of $2875, which possession should be in lieu of interest: that in pursuance of that agreement, Smith, on the 3d of May, 1814, executed a deed to Cunningham for the one hundred acres, and the latter executed a bond and mortgage to Bush to secure the whole $3750; that Smith remained in possession until May, 1815, when Cunningham, being unable to pay, reconveyed the premises to Smith by the deed dated 24th of May, 1815, which was executed by Cunningham and wife, and received by Smith and Bush, in satisfaction of the purchase money. The answer admitted the death of James Cunningham in 1832, and that the plaintiff had demanded her dower, but denied that she was entitled to any, and insisted that if she was entitled, her right was subject to the payment of the principal moneys mentioned in said mortgage with interest. The answer also admitted that the defendant was in possession of all except ten acres, claiming to hold under Smith by mesne conveyances, as a bona fide purchaser.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b404-6\">The proofs taken show 1st.

A certificate of the clerk of Orange county, showing that the mortgage so given to Bush was discharged as to the 100 acres, excepting about eight acres, by his satisfaction piece acknowledged and filed on the 27th of January, 1816, and that the residue of said 100 acres was discharged in like manner, on the 6th of May, 1816, by a satisfaction piece acknowledged the 26th of April, 1816.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-6\">The defendant\u2019s counsel admits that the age of the plaintiff, her marriage, and the death of her said husband, are as stated in the bill. The defendant called as a witness Samuel Smith, a son of James Smith, who proved the agreement for the purchase of the 100 acres by Cunningham of Smith and Bush, substantially as stated in the answer: Cunningham agreeing to give the mortgage to secure the whole amount of the purchase money. The mortgage was given to Bush at the instigation of James Smith, who was father in law of Bush: the latter agreeing to give the former \u201c obligations to secure him.\u201d James Smith remained in possession until the spring of 1815, when Cunningham being unable to pay, made a proposition to give up the property. Cunningham told James Smith <em>\u201c </em>he would transfer the farm back to him again just as he had it before.\u201d James Smith said <em>\u201c </em>he would think it over and let him know <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>what he would do.\u201d At a subsequent day the parties again met, when Cunningham agreed to convey the 93 acres back to Smith, to satisfy and pay $2875 of the mortgage given to Peter Bush, being the purchase money for that 93 acres. It was stated at every one of these meetings that no money had been paid by Cunningham for the land. At this last meeting Cunningham executed the certificate dated May 3d, 1815. This witness further testified, \u201c I succeeded my father in the possession of the premises, and sold to David Webb, and Webb sold to William Knight.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-6\"><em>J. Wyman </em>Jones, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ate\">I. The deed of conveyance from James Cunningham and the complainant, of the 24th of May, 1815, is inoperative and void as against the complainant. An infant/eme <em>covert </em>cannot bind herself, by any deed or contract, either at law or in equity, except under the sanction of the court of chancery, or in cases provided for by the statute. <em>(Jones </em>v. <em>Todd, 2 J. J Marsh. </em>361. <em>Sandford </em>v. <em>McLean, </em>3 <em>Paige, </em>117, 121.) II. The- proof offered by the defendant, that the mortgage to Peter Bush was given by James Cunningham to secure the purchase money of the land bought of James Smith, is inadmissible; and if admitted, is insufficient to establish the point. 1. The witness Samuel Smith is interested. A release from the defendant does not destroy his liability upon his covenant of warranty. 2. The testimony is introduced to contradict sealed instruments. <em>(Webb </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>1 <em>Hill, </em>608; <em>S. C. </em>6 <em>Id. 219. Stevens </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>1 <em>John. Ch. </em>429. 1 <em>Phil. Ev. </em>564, <em>notes </em>1429, 1434.) III. The conveyance of 24th of May, 1815, to James Smith, was not made to satisfy the mortgage to Peter Bush. 1. The testimony does not show any thing more than an <em>executory agreement </em>to this effect. 2. This mortgage was satisfied at two different times ; as to \u00e1 portion, 27th of January, 1816; and as to residue, 26th of April, 1816. IV. The complainant is entitled to her dower, notwithstanding the mortgage to Peter Bush, as against the defendant and all persons except Bush and those claiming under him. (1 <em>R. S. </em>733, <em>1st ed. </em>740, \u00a7 4.) James Smith, under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>whom the complainant claims, never was an equitable mortgagee. He took obligations of P. Bush for his share of the mortgage. V. This deed of 24th of May, 1815, reserves and excepts seven acres of this lot, which the defendant admits he is in possession of, but to which he sets up no title whatever; and the complainant\u2019s right to dower in this portion of the farm is therefore undisputed. VI. The two acres which the defendant denies that he is in possession of, is not a part of the seven acres reserved in the deed from the complainant to James Smith. VII. The complainant is entitled to damages for withholding her dower in the seven acres of which her husband died seised. (1 <em>R. S. </em>734, <em>1st ed. 742, </em>\u00a7 19. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Austin, </em>1 <em>Paige, </em>194.) VIII. The complainant is entitled to costs. 1. The court of chancery has concurrent jurisdiction with courts of law, in suits for assignment of dower. <em>(Badgley </em>v. <em>Bruce &amp; Halsey, </em>4 <em>Paige, </em>98. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Austin, 1 Id. </em>194.) 2. The complainant was unable to proceed at law, as she could not pay the costs of the former suit commenced without her knowledge or consent. <em>(Swain </em>v. <em>Perine, </em>5 <em>John. Ch. </em>488.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-6\"><em>John W. Brown, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUU\">1. James Cunningham, before his intermarriage with the complainant, having executed a mortgage for the whole of the purchase money, simultaneous with the execution of the deed to him by James Smith, until payment of the amount secured by the mortgage, he had no such seisin as would entitle the complainant to her dower. <em>(Stow </em>v. <em>Tift, </em>15 <em>John. Rep. </em>459. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Dewit, </em>6 <em>Cowen, </em>316. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>44, 45.) 2. By the agreement, James Smith was to continue in the possession of the premises until Cunningham paid the purchase money. The mortgage to Peter Bush to secure the payment of the purchase money, coupled with Bush\u2019s interest in the premises, and the agreement that Smith should retain the possession, was to all intents and purposes a mortgage to James Smith. 3. James Cunningham obtained the possession for two or three weeks by a forcible entry, and in violation of the agreement. He therefore never was in the lawful or rightful possession of the property, and the con-</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b408-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>Barculo, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-8\">There can be no doubt of the correctness of the position contained in the plaintiff\u2019s first point, that the deed of the 24th of May, 1815, having been executed by the plaintiff when an infant <em>feme covert, </em>does not bind or affect her, by virtue of such execution. The first question to be considered, therefore, is whether the testimony of the witness Samuel Smith was inadmissible, on the ground of interest, as contended for by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. No objection was made before the examiner, to the testimony on this ground. Notwithstanding that, however, a release from the defendant to the witness was executed. But the counsel insists that the interest was of such a nature that it could not be released, and that, therefore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>objection may be raised at the hearing. The fact upon which the objection rests is, that the witness conveyed the premises by warranty deed to David Webb, who in like manner conveyed to the defendant. From this fact it is argued that Webb is liable on his covenant to the defendant, and that the witness is liable over to Webb, in case the plaintiff should recover in this suit; and that the defendant\u2019s release cannot discharge the witness from his liability to Webb. The answer to this proposition is, that it is sufficient, if <em>at the time of testifying </em>the witness is disinterested ; and it is not a question, whether tie may, by possibility, or in the course of events, become interested. I am also inclined to think that the release would be a defence of which Webb could avail himself in an action by the defendant. It is further contended that the covenant runs with the land, and that therefore the witness must be liable to any person who may at any time come in, as immediate grantee of the defendant, or by subsequent conveyances. To this objection the answer is, that the covenant runs with the land so long as it remains unbroken. When it is broken by an eviction of the purchaser or his assignee, a right of action accrues to him to recover the consideration money and interest. <em>(Kane </em>v. <em>Sanger, </em>14 <em>John. </em>89. <em>Withy </em>v. <em>Mumford, 5 Cowen, </em>137.) It then takes the character of a chose in action, and can be released by the covenantee or his assignee. At the time of giving the release the defendant had a contingent right of action against the witness. If he should be evicted by the result of this suit, that right would become absolute, and would be forever discharged by this release. The covenant could never pass to any subsequent purchaser. If, however the recovery should be in favor of the defendant in this suit, then the witness would probably remain liable on his covenant, to subsequent owners : but that very liability would rather tend to interest him against the defendant, inasmuch as a recovery against the defendant, after the giving of the release, could not affect the witness injuriously, but would forever terminate his liability. This question has been twice decided in the supreme court of Connecticut. In the case of <em>Abby </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>(3 <em>Day, </em>433,) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>the court held that the interest could not be released. But in <em>Clark </em>v. Johnson, (5 <em>Day, </em>373,) the precise point was determined in favor of the competency of the witness. The case of <em>Ford </em>v. <em>Wadsworth, </em>(19 <em>Wend. </em>334,) involved the same principle. In that case Beach conveyed to Rowley with covenants for quiet enjoyment: Rowley conveyed to the wife of the defendant. On the trial, the defendant offered Beach as a witness, who being objected to, the defendant executed a release. The circuit judge still rejected him. The supreme court held that the release was sufficient to remove the incompetency, and, on that and other grounds, ordered a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">The testimony of Samuel Smith being admitted, I think it establishes, in connection with the documentary evidence, the fact, that the mortgage was given to Peter Bush for the purchase money, and that the reconveyance by Cunningham, on the 24th of May, 1815, was given and received in satisfaction of the mortgagee\u2019s debt, to the amount of $2875., The deed and mortgage being acknowledged and recorded at <em>the same time, </em>raisej of themselves, a presumption that they were simultaneous acts, and that the latter was given for the purchase money, although given to Bush instead of Smith. <em>(Kettle </em>v. <em>Van Dyck, </em>1 <em>Sandf. Ch. Rep. </em>76.) These facts raise the next question : Whether James Cunningham had such a seisin of the premises as would entitle the plaintiff to her dower. Upon this point the authorities are full and conclusive. Kent in his commentaries, (4 <em>Kent, </em>45,) lays down the rule thus: \u201c If the mortgage was executed on a purchase before marriage, and the husband releases the equity after the marriage, the wife\u2019s right of dower is entirely gone: for it never attached, as the mortgage was executed immediately on receiving the purchaser\u2019s deed.\u201d The case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Dewitt, </em>(6 <em>Cowen, </em>316,) is precisely in point. There Bruyn conveyed to Depuy, and took back a mortgage for the purchase money. Depuy then married Catharine Bevier. Depuy afterwards reconveyed to Bruyn for the moneys due on the mortgage. Hixon, the lessor of the plaintiff, derived title by several mesne conveyances from Bruyn. After Depuy\u2019s death, dower was assigned to his widow by the surrogate. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>brought ejectment in the supreme court and recovered against Hixon. (17 <em>John. </em>123.) Dewitt was in possession as her tenant. The court held that the widow was not entitled to dower; upon the ground that the husband had an instantaneous seisin only, and therefore the widow was never entitled to dower, and accordingly ordered judgment for the plaintiff. <em>(See also Stow </em>v. Tifft, 15 <em>John. </em>458.) The case of <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Dewitt </em>is not to be distinguished from the present. It is proper, however, to notice one or two other points taken by the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">1. He contends that under the statute (1 <em>R. S. </em>740, \u00a7 4,) the widow is entitled to dower as against every other person, except the mortgagee and his assigns; and that therefore the defendant, claiming under Smith, cannot avail himself of this defence, as the mortgage was given to Bush. That statute does not change the law, nor is it applicable to the case of a mortgage for the purchase money. I think, however, in Smith must be regarded as the real mortgagee. The 1= sold by him, and the mortgage, by his direction, taken by Bush. The property was reconveyed to Smith in tion of the mortgage, and the mortgage cancelled on the s of that conveyance. 2. It is contended that the defend his answer, admits himself in possession of the whole 100: while the deed to Smith conveys but 93 acres. But I find on examining the pleadings, that the bill charges that Cunningham conveyed to Smith, with certain reservations, the whole 100 acres. This the answer admits. The fact is thus established that the whole 100 acres were reconveyed to Smith with certain <em>reservations. </em>Now although when produced the deed shows an <em>exception </em>of seven acres, the plaintiff cannot avail herself of that discrepancy, as there is a material difference between an exception and a reservation. An <em>exception </em>is something taken out of that which is before granted, by which means it does not pass by the grant, but is severed from the estate granted. A <em>reservation </em>is something issuing out of the thing granted, and not a part of the thing granted. <em>(Cruise\u2019s Dig. tit. </em>32, Deed, <em>ch. </em>3) In Shepherd\u2019s Touchstone the distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>is thus made: <em>\u201c </em>This [a reservation] doth differ from an exception, which is ever of part of the thing granted, and of a thing <em>in esse </em>at the time, but this is of a thing newly created or reserved out of a thing demised that was not <em>in esse </em>before; so that this doth always reserve that which was not before, or abridge the tenure of that which was before.\u201d <em>(See also </em>4 <em>Kent\u2019s Com. </em>468.) The defendant has doubtless been drawn into the mistake of admitting more than he intended, and more than is true, by the want of precision in the language of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Again; there is another fatal objection to this part of the plaintiff\u2019s argument. If the exception in the deed is considered it excepts seven acres \u201c this day conveyed by James Cunningham to William Bush.\u201d The evidence in this case, I think, fully warrants the conclusion, that the conveyance of these seven acres to William Bush, of which this recital is evidence binding the plaintiff, <em>(Cowen Hill\u2019s Notes, </em>160,) was in satisfaction of that part of the mortgage moneys due to Peter Bush. In this view of the case the plaintiff could not be entitled to dower in the seven acres, whether they were in the defendant\u2019s possession or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">Upon the whole, I think the plaintiff has failed to make out a case entitling her to dower, in any part of the premises. The bill must be dismissed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
