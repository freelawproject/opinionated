The warrant of attorney was absolute on its face, -but upon the back of it there was an endorsement signed by the defendant, at the time of the execution of the warrant of attorney, stating that the judgment to be entered up thereon, was intended to secure an indebtedness for goods to be sold on the said 25th day of August, to-the amount of $500, and also to secure a similar amount for goods thereafter to be sold.

A motion was made to set aside the judgment and execution. The affidavits on the part of the plaintiff, shewed that it was agreed between the parties that the judgment should apply to the indebtedness which accrued previous to the 25th of August, and that it was by mistake that such a provision was not contained in the endorsement.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-6\"><em>J.

Parol evidence is not admissible to contradict a written instrument. (6 <em>Hill, </em>219. 1 <em>Id. </em>606. 1 <em>John. Ch. Rep. </em>429.) 2.

The writings in this case are all to be taken together, in order properly to understand the contract. It was expressly agreed that the plaintiff might issue execution on the judgment, for whatever should be due him. But the true character of the agreement may be established by parol; even if contradictory or explana<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>tory of the writing, because it is not a contract, but a mere memorandum like a receipt\u2014and the courts have a right to amend, in conformity with the actual understanding, when the rights of subsequent creditors are not prejudiced. (16 <em>John. Rep. </em>149. 1 <em>Dunlap\u2019s Prac. </em>367. 9 <em>John. Rep. </em>80. 1 <em>Taunt. </em>413. 16 <em>John.

It appears then, that the judgment to be entered up on the warrant of attorney, was intended to secure an indebtedness for goods <em>to be sold </em>on the 25th of August, the day of its execution, to the amount of $500, and also to secure a similar amount for goods thereafter to be sold. There was a further provision that, in case the plaintiff should <em>deem himself insecure, </em>he might issue execution for whatever might be due to him for principal and interest, and collect the same. The general expressions must be taken in connection with the particular provisions of the agreement, and they clearly mean, that the plaintiff might issue execution for whatever might be due, according to the terms of the agreement; that is, for the amounts which were intended' to be secured by the judgment. The plaintiff then had no claim under the said judgment for any indebtedness which had accrued previous to the time of executing the warrant of attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">But as to all goods sold on that day, or subsequently, and before the first of January succeeding, he had an undoubted right to issue his execution, provided he did not exceed the amount limited by the agreement. The fact that the goods sold by the plaintiff, and which constituted the consideration of the judgment, belonged to the partnership firm of which he was a member, can make no difference. The judgment given to him, if given to secure a partnership debt, would belong to the firm, and the plaintiff would hold it as trustee for them. And a satisfaction of the judgment would be a satisfaction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>the debt, and a complete discharge of the defendant from all partnership claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">It seems, however, from the affidavits read on the part of the plaintiff, that the original agreement between the parties was that the judgment should also secure the indebtedness of the defendant which had accrued before the first of August, and that it was by mistake that a different agreement was executed; and it is contended that this court, in the exercise of its equitable powers over judgments entered up on bond and warrant of attorney, can relieve against the mistake. Although this court will exercise a general equitable control over judgments of this nature, still, it has never done so to the extent claimed in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">But, inasmuch as the plaintiff\u2019s affidavits, disclose a case in which the equity side of this court would, probably, give relief, it is proper that he should have an opportunity to make an application for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">The plaintiff in the judgment must therefore be stayed from any further proceedings under the execution, to collect the amount of indebtedness which accrued before the 25th of August last, or any part thereof, and he must pay the costs of this-motion; unless be files his bill within twenty days, for the purpose - of correcting the alleged mistake in the agreement. In which event, the judgment and execution, and the levy under it, shall remain as security for the payment of the indebtedness which accrued before the said 25th of August, until the final decision and decree in the suit in equity.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
