It appeared that the defendants were sued for a bill of goods as partners, and they swore to a number of witnesses residing in Clinton county, their residence, to prove that they were not partners. On the other side it was shown that the claim did not rest on evidence of the fact of partnership, but on evidence that at the time of purchasing the goods both the defendants were present and represented themselves as being partners.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-10\"><em>P. G. </em>Ellsworth, for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-11\"><em>C. A.

But as the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney swears that their case rests upon another ground, viz., representations made in New-York by the defendants, respecting the partnership; and as he now offers to stipulate not to give any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>other evidence of the partnership than those representations, the venue may be retained in New-York, upon the giving of such a stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-6\">\u25a0a</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
