One of the witnesses had died since the former commission was returned. The party moving asked a new commission upon the ground that from recent occurrences, the surviving witness would now be able to testify more definitely than before.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-6\"><em>T.

That ought not to be allowed. The practice would be fraught with too much danger; especially where the only other witness who was cognizant of the fact to which the witness is sought to be re-examined has since died. The advantage would be all on one side; and granting the order would give the witness, if he wished, an opportunity of yielding to passion or prejudice in restating his testimony, with entire safety to himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Motion denied with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
