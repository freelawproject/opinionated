After an attachment, an alias and pluries attachment, and an attachment with proclamations, the defendant Andrews was arrested and' brought into court on a commission of rebellion, for a contempt in refusing to appear and submit to an examination before a master on a breditor\u2019s bill. On being brought into court and asking time to answer the interrogatories, he was committed to prison, in default of bail in $3000. On the day appointed, the defendant moved to set aside the commission of rebellion on the ground that the first attachment, the affidavit on which it was grounded, and all subsequent proceedings, were entitled in the original cause.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b232-7\">Edmonds, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ApIZ\">That is no objection. Attachments against parties to the suit, and the papers therein, ought to be so entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">The defendant then objected that his co-defendant Wiswall had died before the defendant was arrested; and that the suit had not been revived.</p>\n<author id=\"b232-9\">Edmonds, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9C\">The death of a defendant is an abatement as to himself alone; and pending aii abatement by his death, even process of contempt may be executed against the other defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">The defendant then demurred to several of the interrogatories because they related to other alleged contempts in the cause than that for' which he had been arrested.</p>\n<author id=\"b232-11\">Edmonds, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">. The demurrers must be allowed. The inter-' rogatories should be confined to the fact of the service of the order or process and to the acts of neglect or commission constituting the violation thereof. They should not' relate to any previous proceeding.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
