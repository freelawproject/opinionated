It appeared from the return of the coroner who served the writ, that the bond taken by him upon the execution thereof had but one surety, instead of two, as required by the statute. And the return did not state the addition, residence, or occupation of the surety. After the serviceofnotice of this motion, the defendant executed a new bond, with two sureties, and gave notice to the plaintiff\u2019s attorney of the giving of such bond to the coroner, with the additions, residences and occupations of the sureties. The plaintiff, upon an affidavit stating that fact and that the irregularity, if any, was the fault of the coroner, made a cross motion for leave to amend the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>coroner\u2019s return, by adding thereto the names of the sureties, with their additions, &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-6\"><em>A. </em>Child, for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b25-7\"><em>D.

And the defendant to have the usual time to except to the sufficiency of the sureties in the new bond.<footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b25-9\"> See 2 <em>R.
