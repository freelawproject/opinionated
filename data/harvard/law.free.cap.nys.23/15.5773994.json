Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 1316. The interlocutory judgment in this action was affirmed at gen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>eral term upon appeal by the present appellant, (Zunz v. Heroy, [Com. Pl. N. Y.] 7 N. Y. Supp. 644,) and is therefore conclusive upon us. The closest scrutiny of the evidence and proceedings before the referee on the accounting directed by the interlocutory judgment, which involved the examination of much testimony and numerous exhibits,\u2014labor which the many inaccuracies in the brief of appellants\u2019 counsel did not tend to diminish,\u2014has not enabled us to discover any error. The referee\u2019s findings of fact are abundantly supported by the evidence, and his conclusions of law are fully warranted by the facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">The judgment and orders should be aifirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
