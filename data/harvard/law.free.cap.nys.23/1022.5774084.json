You are therefore directed and required to remove the said violation within five days from the service of this notice, by surrounding said lot or open space on all sides by a wall of brick or stone, or other fireproof material, to be approved by the superintendent of buildings, not to exceed eighteen feet in height above the curb, and said packing boxes or cases of wood must not be piled or stored to a height greater than 12 inches less than the height of said wall or fence to be erected as aforesaid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\">On defendant\u2019s refusal, after due service of the order, to comply with its requisition, this action was brought, and judgment has gone against him for the penalty prescribed in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">For affirmative defense the appellant alleged that his business and premises were not obnoxious to the provisions of the statute, and in support of the plea tendered proof that the \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cmaterial\u201d were not in fact defective or dangerous, \u201cupon a reasonable construction of the statute.\u201d The evidence was excluded, the court holding, in effect, that it had no jurisdiction to pass upon the reasonableness of the order of the fire department, and that the only question within its province to determine was whether the defendant had refused obedience to the order. An exception to the ruling duly challenges its correctness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">That the evidence was competent, and its rejection error, is settled by the decision of the court of appeals in Mayor, etc., of City of New York v. Dry-Dock, E. B. &amp; B. R. Co., 133 N. Y. 104, 112, 30 N. E. Rep. 563. Upon principle the point is clear, beyond controversy. That upon the arbitrary fiat of a municipal board, acting upon nothing of legal evidence, a citizen may be punished for an offense against which, at no stage of the proceeding, he is afforded an opportunity to appear or make defense, is a proposition so repugnant to the principles of free government, and to the prohibition of our own state and federal constitutions against a deprivation of property without due process of law, as to absolve us from the obligation of any other reply than a categorical denial. Health Department of City of New York v. Rector, etc., of Trinity Church, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 17 N. Y. Supp. 510. Argument to support an axiom involves the concession that it is open to question, and the principle impugned by the judgment below is too precious to be exposed to an implication of infirmity. The defendant had an inviolable right to show his innocence of the act against which the statute denounces the penalty, namely, the maintaining his premises in a defective or dangerous condition; but this right the court denied him, on the assumption that the ex parte declaration of the board, upon the unsworn statement of a subaltern, was conclusive of his guilt. That such a conviction is not by \u201cdue process of law,\u201d neither argument nor authority is requisite to demonstrate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>Whether the statute upon which the fire department proceeded be constitutional is a question which, though discussed by counsel, \u2022it is unnecessary to adjudicate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered; costs to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
