Upon this taxation the clerk allowed $30 as trial fee for the inquest, and $30 as trial fee of the final trial, and from which defendants appealed to the special term, where the clerk\u2019s taxation of the first trial fee was reversed, and it is from such reversal that this appeal is taken. This order of reversal recites that the inquest was \u201cduly taken,\u201d and the first judgment \u201cduly entered,\u201d and that thereafter the defendants\u2019 default was opened, and the final trial had, at which was returned, for plaintiff, the verdict upon which the second and final judgment was entered. There is no other or further proof in the record, as regards the inquest, the first judgment, the opening of defendants\u2019 default, the final trial, or the second judgment,. Upon the record on appeal the clerk\u2019s taxation of two trial fees, of $30 each, was correct, and should not have been reversed, for it has been repeatedly held that an inquest is such a trial as entitled plaintiff to a trial fee of $30. Wessels v. Carr, (City Ct. N. Y.) 6 N. Y. Supp. 535. The order appealed from is reversed, with $10' costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
