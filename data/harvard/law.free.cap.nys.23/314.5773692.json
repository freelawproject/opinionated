If actual loss or injury is produced, the amount thereof must be based upon legal proof of the damage actually sustained. Moffat v. Herman, 116 N. Y. 135, 22 N. E. Rep. 287; Sudlow v. Knox, 7 Abb. Pr. (N. S.) 411; Dejonge v. Brenneman, 23 Hun, 332; Clark v. Bininger, 75 N. Y. 344; King v. Flynn, 37 Hun, 329; Gallagher v. O\u2019Neil, (City Ct. N. Y.) 3 N. Y. Supp. 126. No such assessment of damages <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>appears by the appeal book, and the order appealed from must therefore be modified by reducing the fine to the statutory limit, $250, and $30 costs, and, as modified, the order appealed from will be affirmed, without costs. See Dejonge v. Brenneman, supra; Railroad Co. v. Ramsey, 45 N. Y. 637.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
