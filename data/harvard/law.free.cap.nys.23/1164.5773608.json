Sullivan, and restrained, forbade, and prevented defendant from proceeding further under said executions until said stay was dissolved, which did not occur until August 9, 1892. It is therefore very evident that the sheriff had not 60 days free from said stay during which he could exercise his official duties, and consequently this action was prematurely brought. Therefore the trial justice was right in dismissing the complaint herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-20\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
