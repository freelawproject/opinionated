There was abundant evidence that the reckless rider wore the uniform of a mounted park police officer, and according to the testimony of Officers Purcell and Hoey, and the stableman, Jacob Smith, which was believed by the hoard of commissioners, the relator must have been the man. The judgment should be affirmed, and the writ dismissed, with $50 costs and disbursements to the respondents. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
