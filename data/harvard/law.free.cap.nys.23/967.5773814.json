The Exhibit A annexed to the complaint is an account stated by the defendant to T. Eomano, of the bark G-iulio E, and shows that defendant is indebted for $210.45, the balance due for the freight of the cargo of bones mentioned in the complaint. This account is marked \u201cExhibit B\u201d in the case, and is shown to have been made and sent by defendant to the agent of the owners of the vessel. Months thereafter defendant writes that he \u201cwill pay over the amount,\u201d and again, one year after he stated the account, he writes: \u201cAs soon as the proper person appears who can show that he is the legal receiver of freight for G-iulio B, it will be paid promptly.\u201d See Exhibits O and D, which are proven to be in the handwriting of the defendant. The plaintiffs prove that they are the proper persons to receive this balance of freight admittedly owing by defendant. Moreover, the defendant assumed full control of this cargo of bones, and sold it to Baugh &amp; Sons Company, and directed its delivery to them from the vessel. The defendant\u2019s counterclaim is specifically based upon the charter party, which he now claims should not have been marked in evidence by the plaintiffs, and it was his counsel who objected to this question: \u201cTo whom was the cargo consigned?\u201d Defendant\u2019s counsel: \u201cThe contract in writing will be the best evidence.\u201d Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel: \u201cI ask the defendant to produce the charter party.\u201d And he produced it, and it was then put in evidence. Eliminate this charter party from the case, and then defendant would not have been entitled to go to the jury on any part of his counterclaim, for his entire counterclaim is, by the sixth paragraph of the answer, made dependent upon an alleged breach of the charter party; and the plaintiffs then should have had a direction in their favor. Moreover, it is questionable whether the defendant should have had his counterclaim submitted to the jury at all. However, it was so submitted, and the jury very properly returned a verdict for the plaintiffs for the full amount claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-8\">Judgment and order affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
