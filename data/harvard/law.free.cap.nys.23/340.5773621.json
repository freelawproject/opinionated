The husband gave defendant a note indorsed by plaintiff for a loan to enable him to pay the expenses of an enterprise that was expected to be advantageous to the corporation. Plaintiff and her husband testified that when the note was drawn the husband turned it face downward, and requested plaintiff to write her name on it, telling her that it was a memorandum that the husband was holding defendant\u2019s stock, and that after she had done so the husband wrote above her name the words, \u201cPay to the order\u201d of defendant. Defendant testified that such words were written first, and that plaintiff indorsed the note with full knowledge of what she was doing.

Defendant denied all fraud and false representation. On conflicting testimony the learned trial judge decided in favor of the defendant, and plaintiff appeals from the judgment entered against her on the ground that the findings of fact were against the weight of evidence. It accordingly becomes our duty to carefully examine\u201dand wreigh the evidence in the case, in order to determine if the contention of the plaintiff is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">It appears from the evidence that the plaintiff held the controlling interest in a company known as the Standard Corporation, in which her husband and defendant were also stockholders; the latter having purchased his stock from plaintiff\u2019s husband, and paid him $1,000 therefor. Defendant also held the promissory note of plaintiff\u2019s husband for $400. Plaintiff and her husband were the owners of sundry patents, which they were negotiating to sell to certain parties in Philadelphia; and such sale, if consummated, was expected to prove very advantageous to plaintiff, and to promote her interests as a stockholder in the Standard Corporation. Defendant entered into an arrangement with plaintiff\u2019s husband by which he agreed to loan, and did loan, to plaintiff\u2019s husband, the further sum of $100, for his expenses to Philadelphia, to carry out the proposed arrangement, on the agreement that he (defendant) was to surrender the note of Mr. Plass for $400, and also the stock, for which he had paid $1,000, and receive in return therefor the note of plaintiff\u2019s husband for $1,500, indorsed by her. When it was proposed that plaintiff should indorse this note, her husband testified that he told defendant that his wife would not indorse a note, but that he was persuaded to make the effort to procure her \u2022indorsement; that he accordingly drew up the note, turned it over on its face on the desk, called his wife into the room where he and defendant were, and said to her, \u201cWrite your name on that piece of paper;\u201d that she inquired of defendant \u201cwhat it was about;\u201d and that defendant replied \u201cthat it was simply a piece of paper,\u2014a memorandum that I [Mr. Plass] was holding his [defendant\u2019s] stock; and, taking his word for it, she wrote her name on the piece of paper, and passed upstairs.\u201d He further testified that he then, at defendant\u2019s request, wrote over his wife\u2019s signature the words, \u201cPay to the order of D. F. Lucas,\u201d and delivered the note <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>to defendant. Plaintiff tells substantially the same story as to how she came to indorse the note. Defendant squarely denied the statement as to the way in which it was alleged that plaintiff\u2019s indorsement was procured, and he testified that she was fully aware of the whole arrangement, and that she indorsed the note under the words, \u201cPay to the order of ,D. F. Lucas,\u201d with full and complete knowledge that she was indorsing her husband\u2019s note for $1,500. In our opinion, plaintiff\u2019s story is too improbable to be entitled to any credence, in the face of the admitted circumstances surrounding the whole transaction. It appeared that plaintiff was a thorough business woman, having at one time conducted business on her own account; was familiar with the indorsing of checks, the transferring of stock certificates, and the signing of proxies; talked, glibly about \u201cthe Philadelphia deal, and of when it was to go through,\u201d the sale of her patents, and of her controlling stock interest, and of the intention of her husband to take care of defendant and others in the company, \u201cbecause they always pulled honest and square with him, while others pulled against him.\u201d She showed herself, plainly, to be fully conversant with business ways; and yet we are asked to believe that she, with all her intelligence, was persuaded to write her name on a piece of blank paper on the assurance \"that it was a memorandum that Mr. Plass held his stock for him in trust. I signed it because I thought it was a piece of paper he wanted to pin to the stock.\u201d The history of the whole transaction, as testified to by the defendant, is, in our opinion, the correct story of the indorsement of the note by plaintiff. We do not regard the evidence of plaintiff\u2019s husband as affording any corroborative weight to plaintiff\u2019s story, for it plainly shows, taking it to be true, that he deliberately entered into a scheme to defraud his own wife. He appears as a self-confessed cheat, and his evidence, in our opinion, is utterly worthless. We fhi-nk that the learned trial judge properly decided this case, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
