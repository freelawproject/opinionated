From a judgment for defendants, dismissing the complaint, plaintiff appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"AbOq\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-3\">For some years prior to May 9, 1887, Henry Van Gelder and Charles Van Gelder were partners under the firm name of Van Gelder Bros., and engaged in manufacturing leather for hatters, at 97 Spring street, New York. On the date mentioned they made a general assignment to Henry J. Newton for the benefit of creditors. The partners were owing no individual debts, and the assignment covered partnership and individual property. By the assignment the employes of the firm' were preferred. After paying those claims the assignee was directed to pay the indebtedness of the firm to himself, and, secondly, the claims of three other creditors. After the payment of these preferred debts the assignee was directed to distribute the remainder nro rata among the other creditors of the assignors. The assignee accepted the trust, and entered upon its execution. The usual notice to present claims was sent to the creditors, and February 20, 1889, the plaintiff filed proof of his debt with the assignee. May 31, 1890, the plaintiff recovered a judgment on this claim against the assignors for $15,306.68, and an execution was issued thereon, which was returned wholly unsatisfied. On the 26th of October, 1889, John M. Jones and others, who were judgment creditors of Van Gelder Bros., began an action in the supreme court against the assignee and assignors to compel the assignee to account for the assigned estate, and distribute its avails among the creditors. The action was brought \u201con behalf of themselves and all other creditors of the defendants Henry Van Gelder and Charles Van Gelder who shall come in, seek relief, and contribute to the expense of this action.\u201d It was also alleged \u201cthat the question which is the subject of this action is one of common and general interest to many persons who are interested in said trust estate; that said creditors, as plaintiffs are informed and believe, are very numerous, and that some of them are unknown to plaintiffs, and cannot with diligence be found by them; and that it is impracticable, therefore, for plaintiffs to bring them all before the court in this action, and for these reasons sues for the benefit of all.\u201d The assignee answered. After issue joined, a reference was ordered to take and state the account of the assignee, to ascertain and report the amounts due and owing the plaintiff and the other creditors of the assignors. The referee was also directed to fix a date for the hearing, and give notice thereof to the creditors. The referee gave due notice to all creditors that the hearing would be had February 28, 1890. On July 7, 1890, the referee made his report, which on the 7th of September, 1890, was confirmed by the court. It appears by the report that after paying $650.75, the wages of employes of the firm, the expenses of the assignment, of the action and accounting, there was insufficient to pay .the preferred claim of the assignee. On the 17th of November, 1890, an order was entered in the action wherein Jones and others were plaintiffs, discharging the assignee and the sureties on his bond. The plaintiff had no notice that the judgment was to be entered, nor of the motion- to confirm the report, nor of the motion to discharge the assignee. On the 17th of July, 1890, 10 days after the date of the referee\u2019s report, this action was begun to set aside the assignment on the ground that it was executed with the intent on the part of the assignors and assignee to defraud the creditors of the assignors.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b60-4\">Argued before VAN BRUNT, P.

Blodgett, 48 N. Y. 62. Kerr\u2019s Case was an action brought to compel the 'assignee to account. A previous action had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>begun in the same court for the same purpose by a creditor, in his own behalf, as well as in behalf of all others similarly situated. A decree was entered in the first action, and a report was made, which was confirmed. before Kerr\u2019s action was begun. It was held that, both actions being for the same purpose, the second action could not be maintained. The facts in Kerr\u2019s Case are more fully reported in 16 Abb. Pr. 137, and 25 How. Pr. 303. The case at bar does not ask for the same relief that, was sought in the action brought by Jones,\u2014an accounting,\u2014but seeks to have the assignment set aside as fraudulent. The action of Jones was in aid of the assignment, and the relief which this plaintiff seeks could not have been given in it. The order discharging the assignee has no greater force than the judgment on which it rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The respondents also insist that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action because he verified and filed his claim with the assignee, and in support of this position they cite Cavanagh v. Morrow, 67 How. Pr. 241; Wilson v. Daggett, 9 Civil Proc. R. 411; and McLean v. Prentice, 34 Hun, 504. Cavanagh\u2019s Case was brought to set aside an assignment as fraudulent. The plaintiff in that action had filed his claim with the assignee, and appeared on the accounting' in the court of common pleas, and interposed objections to the assignee\u2019s account. The account and objections were referred to a referee, who made his report. It was held that Cavanagh, having filed his claim and participated in the accounting, had elected to take under the assignment, and could not afterwards maintain an action to set it aside. In the case at bar the court did not find that the plaintiff took part in the accounting, but simply that he verified and filed his claim with the assignee before action for accounting was begun. In Wilson v. Daggett it was held that a creditor who had filed his claim, and proved it, in proceedings for an accounting pending in the common pleas, could not maintain an action to set aside the assignment. Precisely what was done by the creditor on the accounting does not appear in the report of the case. No action was pending to set aside an assignment, the question being whether the examination of the assignor in proceedings supplementary to execution should be limited to trans: actiqns since the assignment. The question now under considera tian was not involved in that case. In McLean v. Prentice it was held that an action brought several months after the assigned estate had been distributed under the decree of the court could not be maintained. In Schofield v. Scott, (Sup.) 3 N. Y. Supp. 496, it was held that filing a claim after an action had been brought to set aside an assignment as fraudulent was not a defense to the action. Whether a creditor who has verified and presented his claim to an assignee can thereafter commence and maintain an action to set aside an assignment as fraudulent does not seem to have been decided, and, under the facts as found in this case, it is not necessary now to determine the question. The court found that the assignment was not fraudulent in fact. The facts relied upon by the plaintiff as evidence of fraud were that the assignors were employed by the assignee to get the unmanufactured stock ready for the market. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>and were for the purpose left in the possession of the assigned estate, and that the assets of the estate brought but about 50 per cent, of their actual value, as stated in the inventory. The evidence is that the property, in the condition that it came into the hands of the assignee, was of little value, and not marketable until it was manufactured into the article for which it was designed. The goods, consisting of skins, were made into \u201chat sweats\u201d by the assignors for the assignee, .and, when sold, the avails were deposited to the credit of the assignee in a separate account. There is no evidence that the assignors derived any personal benefit from their employment, or that there was any understanding, previous to the assignment, that they should be employed. They received no compensation for their services, but were allowed to use the machinery to manufacture from new stock furnished them by friends. By the inventory the assets were estimated to be of the actual value of $8,585.86, but they brought only $4,433.21. It is argued that this is evidence of fraud, but there is no evidence that any of the property was wasted, or that any was sold for less than its value. The court found, upon undisputed evidence, \u201cthat as soon as the stock of the assigned estate had been disposed of, and in about the month of March, 1888, the assignee sold at auction the machinery, fixtures, furniture, and all the remaining unmarketable assets of the assigned estate; that said sale was openly, fairly, and duly made through Messrs. Mallaby &amp; White, auctioneers, and the property was duly struck off to the highest bidder; that thereafter the said assignee sold at public sale the undivided estate of Henry Van Gelder, consisting of six lots of land at Ft. Lee, New Jersey, to Benjamin W. Jones, for $200, he being the highest bidder at such sale; that the course pursued by the assignee in the disposal of the stock and assigned estate was in the best interest of the creditors.\u201d There is no evidence tending to show that these sales were not duly advertised and fairly conducted, nor that any of the property was sold for less than its value. The fact that this property was bid in by third persons in the interest, and for the benefit, of the wife of one of the assignors, is, in the absence of evidence that the sale was collusive, or that the property brought less than its worth, but slight, if any, evidence that the assignment was made with a fraudulent intent. There is no evidence that Mrs. Van Gelder did not pay the full value of the property from her own means. If she did, she had the same right to purchase that any person had. We think that the finding that the assignment was made in good faith, and not with intent to defraud creditors, is sustained by the evidence, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
