J.</author>\n<p id=\"A0nd\">Under the extremely restricted rule applied to this case the verdict of the jury is supported by the evidence. The stream is a large stream, 60 or 70 feet wide. The defendants have a dam some 200 feet wide, just above the point where the defendants take the water for their factory, and the dam for its extreme width overflows each day, in the dryest of times, for its entire length. The stream below the dam at its lowest period is 10 or 12 feet wide, and when the defendants are running their factory, and at the lowest of water, no perceptible diminution is seen in the stream running in its natural bed. The defendants\u2019 wheel is but a 30-inch wheel. Proof which would have legitimately tended to show that the fluctuation in the stream, reducing it from a 60-foot width to a 10 or 12-foot width, was caused by the ponding of the water of the stream in the great body called \u201cWhaley Pond,\u201d and in and by the numerous large ponds between that great reservoir and the defendants\u2019 dam, was excluded. With this proof in, the stream would have been a very large stream in the lowest of water.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-19\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b279-20\">PRATT, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"ADer\">(concurring.) If we correctly understand the decisions of the court of appeals, (107 N. Y. 310, 14 N. E. Rep. 269; 132 N. Y. 293, 30 N. E. Rep. 841,) the turning point of this case is this: Have defendants, by their race way, materially and perceptibly diminished the natural flow of the waters of Maatewan creek from their natural channel in front of plaintiff\u2019s two lots, or either of them? We understand that it has also been decided by that court that this question was for the jury. The learned trial judge so held, and refused to direct a verdict for the plaintiff, even for nominal damages. This question was broadly and fairly submitted to the jury, and the verdict was for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-21\">It follows that the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
