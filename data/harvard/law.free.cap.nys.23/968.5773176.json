Defendant then, without warning, and when plaintiff\u2019s horses were at his front wheel, suddenly turned his horses .against plaintiff\u2019s horses, forcing them against an engine which was standing near the curb, held them there as if in a vice, then driving his horses ahead. His hind wheel passed over the right hind hoof of plaintiff\u2019s horse, so injuring him as to cause his death. This testimony certainly entitled plaintiff to have the opinion of the jury as to whether or not defendant was negligent, and he free from contributory negligence, in the management of their-respective teams. It was error for the trial justice to dismiss the complaint. Judgment must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
