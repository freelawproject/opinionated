The stairway leading down from the second floor had at the top thereof a .water-closet. For some weeks prior to the accident this closet was out of repair and stopped up, so that its filthy contents and water would flow out of the basin upon the floor of the closet, and thence down these stairs, which were rendered slippery with fecal matter, mixed with dirty water. The plaintiff testified that she went down this stairway three steps, and reached a platform about\u2019 four feet square, and, while in the act of feeling her way to the edge of it, and about to take hold of the baluster, her foot slipped on some of this filthy matter, and she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>was precipitated down 15 steps, receiving the injuries complained of. Defendant\u2019s son, who was in charge of and managed this house, testified that he went up and down this stairway daily. Plaintiff had a verdict for $500. Under such circumstances, the negligence of defendant and the freedom of plaintiff from contributory negligence were questions for the jury. Peil v. Reinhart, 127 N. Y. 381, 27 N. E. Rep. 1077; Palmer v. Dearing, 93 N. Y. 7. We think the evidence fully sustains the verdict bn both questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">The only other exception called to our attention by the appellant\u2019s counsel, either in his printed brief or oral argument, is that taken to the court\u2019s instruction to the jury, at folios 200 to 204. He contends that the evidence of the promise to compensate the plaintiff should have been taken entirely from the jury, on the ground that it was merely an offer to compromise, and cites Smith v. Satterlee, 130 N. Y. 677, 29 N. E. Rep. 225. There are several answers which seem to .us to be fatal to this contention: First, it was not an offer to compromise merely, but a voluntary and absolute promise to compensate her, (Brice v. Bauer, 108 N. Y. 428, 433, 15 N. E. Rep. 695, 697;) second, the court instructed the jury to disregard any offer of compromise; third, Smith v. Satterlee and like cases simply hold that an offer of compromise is privileged, and evidence thereof will be excluded if the privilege is claimed by objection to its admission. This testimony was admitted without objection on the part of the plaintiff, and, before it was introduced, defendant\u2019s counsel had brought out similar evidence on his cross-examination of plaintiff. The defendant, by failing to object in the one instance, and by bringing out the testimony in the other'instance, has waived her privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">For these reasons, we think the judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
