The failure of defendant to submit or offer to submit testimony of the character mentioned justified the trial justice in directing a verdict, as he did, in plaintiffs\u2019 favor for the amount claimed. The fact that he gave a wrong reason does not affect his action, which, as above shown, was right. Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
