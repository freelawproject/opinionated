Each one of the three statements contained in the complaint specifically alleges that she was well aware of the dangerous and defective condition of the demised premises, and, notwithstanding the possession by her of that knowledge, she moved into and continued to occupy said premises until the time when she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>was injured by the fall of the ceiling. It is therefore very apparent that she was guilty of contributory negligence; and, as that fact appeared upon the face of the complaint, the trial justice was right in dismissing the same.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
