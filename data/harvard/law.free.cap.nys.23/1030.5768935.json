The action is brought to recover <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>damages for injuries done, through defendant\u2019s culpable fault, to plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfurniture, carpets, oilcloths, matting, rugs, table coyer, lamps and shades, crockery, stoves, toilet sets, silverware, clothing, linen, and sundry articles of household goods,\u201d on February 22,1893, at 20 Graham avenue. Defendant, in asking for a bill of particulars of the articles injured, and the damage to each, alleged generally that he was ignorant of the same. On the hearing plaintiff swore that on February 22, 1893, she called defendant\u2019s attention to the extent of the damage done, and exhibited to him all the damaged articles, and that on the next day she again exhibited the articles to defendant and Mr. Batterman, his appraiser, and to Mr. Cohen, her appraiser, and that these two appraisers duly examined the damaged articles and appraised the same in the presence of defendant and herself. Defendant did not deny this explicit statement of plaintiff under oath, showing conclusively that he personally has examined the articles and had them examined and appraised by a person selected by himself, and it is hard to imagine what more information a bill of particulars would afford him. There is no valid feason for interfering with the exercise of what seems to us to have been a sound discretion in the denial of the application.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">Order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
