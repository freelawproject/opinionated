The unpaid rent sued for is $75 for each of the months of March and April, 1892. The defendant, by his answer, specifically \u25a0 alleges \"that under an agreement made between defendant and plaintiff the defendant used and occupied said premises for the month of November, 1891, at the rent of $75 per month, which was paid,\u201d and for the month of April, 1892, at the same rent, which was not paid. Thus it appears that plaintiff was entitled to a direction in his favor for $75 for the use and occupation of his premises by defendant for the month of April, 1892. Hence he should not have been non-suited. The judgment of nonsuit should be reversed, for this reason alone, however. There are others, the discussion of which are not now necessary. Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to appellant, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
