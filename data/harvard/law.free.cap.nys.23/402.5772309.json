Defendant, for answer, (1) denied the material allegations of the complaint; and (2) set up that one Seymour Colson and wife were the owners in fee and possessed of the said premises, and entitled to the right of immediate and actual possession thereto, and were removing their furniture to said dwelling house, as they had a lawful right to do, and, finding in said house some furniture, goods, and chattels unlawfully therein, necessarily and carefully removed them from said house, and that defendant, at the request of said Colson, assisted him in such re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>moval, as he had a lawful right to do. Plaintiff on the trial obtained a verdict for $5, which, by- order of the court, was increased to $15, by virtue of the provisions of section 1669 of the Civil Code. Before the clerk, on the taxation of the costs, each party claimed to recover of the other the costs of the action. The clerk awarded the costs to the defendant. This motion is made by the plaintiff to review the action of the clerk; plaintiff insisting that he is entitled to recover the costs of the action, although the recovery was less than $50, under the provisions of subdivision 1, \u00a7 3228, Civil Code, on the ground that a claim of title to real property arose upon the pleadings. No \u00bfertificate is produced that a claim of title to real property in fact arose upon the trial. If, under the provisions of the Code, a reply were required where the answer set up an affirmative defense not constituting a counterclaim, and the plaintiff, in this case, replying to the allegations contained in the answer as to the title of Seymour Colson and wife to the premises in question, had denied such allegation, it would not be doubted but that a claim of title to real property arose on the pleadings. Dinehart v. Wells, 2 Barb. 432. But, inasmuch as the answer did not contain a counterclaim, no reply was required, and the allegation setting up title in the Colsons is to be deemed controverted by the plaintiff. Section 522, Civil Code. To the allegation of the defendant, asserting the title of Seymour Colson and wife to the premises in question, the statute interposes a denial on the part of the plaintiff. The statute created a legal issue as to the Colson title. Coming down to the trial on such pleadings, defendant would be compelled to prove his allegation of title just the same as if a reply were served, denying such allegation. I think, therefore, where a defendant pleads title, which by statute is deemed denied by the plaintiff, a claim of title to real property arises upon the pleadings. The question raised in this case was settled in this district long since, in the case of Lillis v. O\u2019Conner, 8 Hun, 280. The action was assault and battery, and the defense was (1) general denial; and (2) son assault demesne; (3) justification in defense of defendant\u2019s possession of his own-property. Justice Bockes gave the opinion of the general term, and, referring to Dinehart v. Wells, supra, remarked: \u201cUnder the Code, no reply to the defendant\u2019s answer was admissible, (Code, \u00a7 153,) and the third defense was to be deemed controverted by the adverse party as upon denial or avoidance, (section 168.) The two cases are therefore precisely alike, as regards the pleading. Thus, in the case in hand, according to the decision in Dinehart v. Wells, and in legal logic, a claim of title to real property was raised on the pleadings. The defendant tendered the issue by his answer. A reply was inadmissible; but the new matter interposed as a defense was, by the Code to be deemed controverted, \u2018as upon a direct denial or avoidance.\u2019 Section 168.\u201d The above authority, I think, has not been questioned, but is referred to in Lynk v. Weaver, 128 N. Y. 177, 28 N. E. Rep. 508, and must be deemed to settle the law in accordance with the views above suggested. The case of Lynk v. Weaver, supra, referred to by counsel for defendant, is not parallel to the case before us. In that case the plaintiff, in his complaint, claimed title to the premises described. The answer contained no denial of his title, and the court held that where, \u201cviewing all the pleadings, there is no issue or dispute about the title, in no legal sense can it be said that a claim of title arises upon the pleadings. The phrase has reference to a case where both parties in the pleadings claim the title, or where one claims it, and the other disputes it.\u201d In the case before us the defendant pleaded title in the Colsons. The allegation is deemed denied by the complaint, thus raising a direct issue upon the claim of title. Of course, under the provisions of subdivision 1, \u00a7 3228, Civil Code, where an issue as to a claim of title to real estate is thus raised by the pleadings, the plaintiff, recovering any judgment, is entitled to costs, without any certificate, and although in fact no evidence was offered on the trial on the question of title. An order should be entered directing retaxation of costs, and that the clerk, on such retaxation, allow to plaintiff the costs of the action, with $10 costs of this motion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b435-5\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.
