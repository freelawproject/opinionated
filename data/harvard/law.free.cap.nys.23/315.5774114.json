J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATz\">The defendant having parted with $60. in violation of the injunction order was subject to a fine for this amount. But beyond this the order made below was unauthorized. The defendant did not have a family depending on him for support, within the meaning of the statutory provision exempting earnings- of a judgment debtor, and that feature of the case requires no serious consideration. There was nothing in the case warranting a higher fine than the $60 wrongfully parted with to the prejudice of the judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-17\">The provision requiring the debtor to obtain a reassignment of the rights transferred to Ms son was unauthorized. The transfer had been made prior to the recovery of the judgment, and could be attacked by a creditors\u2019 bill only. It follows that the order appealed from must be modified by reducing the fine to $60, and by eliminating the part in respect to the reassignment; and, as modified, the order must be affirmed, without costs. See opiMon, in Luedeke v. Coursen, (City Ct. N. Y.) 23 N. Y. Supp. 314, filed herewith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
