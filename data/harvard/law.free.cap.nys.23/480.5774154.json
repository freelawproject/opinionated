That the above-named defendant is indebted to the above-named plaintiffs in the sum of $4,438.09 over and above all counterclaims known to plaintiffs upon the cause of action for breach of express contract other than a contract to marry, and that the grounds for the plaintiffs\u2019 claim are as follows, to wit: That plaintiffs are merchants doing business in the city of New York; that the defendant is a merchant * residing in Spanishtown, Jamaica; that plaintiffs have, from time to time, for many years last past, shipped merchandise to the defendant, and advanced money to him, and there is an account current between them; that On September 15, 1892, there became and was due the plaintiffs from the defend-ant upon said account current the sum of $4,438.09 over and above all offsets and counterclaims known to the plaintiffs; that no part of said sum has been paid, and the amount thereof, with interest from September 15, 1892, is wholly due and unpaid from defendant to plaintiffs, and plaintiffs have a cause of action against the defendant therefor for breach of contract; that plaintiffs are about to commence an action to recover the same; that the summons is node out, and a copy thereof is hereunto annexed.

In the case at bar the cause of action at-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>1 empted to be set out clearly does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. There is no allegation except that of an account current. It is true that the items of such account current are stated to consist of merchandise and money advanced, but how much merchandise, what its value was, or how such value was arrived at, or upon what basis the plaintiffs claim a recovery, are not even hinted at. Under such circumstances, no recovery can be had upon a cause of action set out in this manner. Therefore, there being before the court no proof of the existence of a cause of action, no attachment should have been issued. The order appealed from should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the attachment vacated, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
