The defendants allege, by way of defense, that they were accommodation makers of the note; that the payees delivered it, together with 26 other notes, to. the bank, as collateral security for the payment of a note for $8,000' which such payees at that time made and delivered to the bank for-value; and that the bank has collected $3,000 of such collateral\" 26 notes, and hence has been paid said $3,000 note in full. The-proof, on trial, as to the conditions under which the note in suit, and the other 26 notes, were delivered to the bank by Haas &amp; Pohalski, was conflicting; the plaintiff bank contending, by evidence, that these notes were delivered by Haas &amp; Pohalski, and left with it as collateral security for their account in general, and for-any overdrafts they might make, and that they continued to make overdrafts every day up to the time of their failure, and that at the time of their failure they owed the bank about $10,000, and still owe it about $6,000. On the other hand the defendants\u2019 evidence shows that the note in suit, and the other 26 notes, were delivered to the bank, specifically, as collateral security for the payment of the $3,000 note, and that such note has been fully paid.. The determination of these disputed questions of fact was properly left to the jury, under a careful charge by the court, to no part of which either side excepted, and by which the jury were told that \u201cif you believe that those notes, the one in suit included, were given as collateral security for the note of .three thousand dollars, then plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d This was an instruction to the jury that defendants could not be held liable on the note in suit if it, with the others, had been delivered to the bank as security for the $3,000 note, even though the defendants had made and delivered it to Haas &amp; Pohalski for full value received, because it was in proof that the bank had collected more than $3,000 on the other 26 notes-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>\u25a0Hence it was not fatal error to exclude the proof offered by defendants, that they were accommodation makers of the note in suit. And, moreover, the court instructed the jury, as requested by defendants\u2019 counsel, \u201cthat the burden of proof that the note was given for the future indebtedness of Haas &amp; Pohalski to the bank was- upon the plaintiff,\u201d and that \u201cthey must establish, by a fair preponderance of evidence, that the note was given as collateral for future indebtedness, and that unless they do the defendant is entitled to a verdict.\u201d By returning a verdict for plaintiff under these instructions, they found that the note in suit was given to the bank as collateral security, not for the $3,000 note, but for the future indebtedness of Haas &amp; Pohalski to the bank, and, so finding, the defendants would be liable, although they were accommodation makers. The judgment and order appealed from are affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
