The action was tried by the court with a jury. On the trial there was much and contradictory evidence given on both sides as to how the accident occurred which produced the injury to the plaintiff\u2019s horse and wagon. At the close of the case the judge charged the jury both as to the facts and the law. He was requested, among other things, to charge that \u201cthe plaintiff\u2019s team was bound, so far as it reasonably could, to keep off the tracks of the railroad company, so as to permit the free and unobstructed passage of the defendant\u2019s cars thereon.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>This the trial judge refused; but, on the contrary, had already, in his charge, said: \u201cThis horse was standing in the street where it had a perfect right to stand.\u201d This, together with the refusal to charge defendant\u2019s request, was equivalent to saying to the jury that the plaintiff was not bound to use reasonable care in keeping off the defendant\u2019s tracks; and this is contrary to the law applicable to such cases. A horse car can only run on the tracks provided for it, and cannot swerve to the right or left to avoid obstacles, which can readily be done by other vehicles. Hence the courts have, held that a public highway upon which a railway track is authorized to be laid is necessarily set apart for the use of the owners of the car and tracks, to the extent that the public, in passing over that part of the highway, cannot interfere with the running of cars, or with the track, so as to unnecessarily hinder or delay the business of the\u2019 railroad. Whitaker v. Railroad Co., 51 N. Y. 295; Fenton v. Railroad Co., 126 N. Y. 625, 26 N. E. Rep. 967; Hegan v. Railroad Co., 15 N. Y. 380, and many other cases which may be cited. We think this error sufficient, under the very contradictory testimony given in the case, and the somewhat improbable accounts of the accident given by plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, to warrant us in reversing the judgment, and ordering a new trial, with costs to the appellant, to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
