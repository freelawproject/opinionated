Defendant appeals.</summary>\n<disposition data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Agh\">Affirmed.</disposition>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b580-19\">The defendant resided in the city of Albany from 1850 to 1886, and was assessed for personal taxes up to 1882. He also had a house in the town of Rensselaerville from 1850 to the time of the trial, in which- he spent some part of every year, and in which his son and his son\u2019s family, whom defendant includes in his family, have lived since 1870. Defendant has practiced law in Albany, and had an office in said city for that purpose, from 1835 to the present time. In 1882 he went to the assessors of the city of Albany, and told them he was no longer a resident of that city; that he had removed to the town of Rensselaerville; and the assessors, relying on the truthfulness of this statement, removed his name from the assessment roll for that year, and it was not again put on the roll till the year 1889. Defendant continued residing in Albany, in the same house, until 1886, \"when he sold it, and moved <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to 292 Hamilton street, where he resided for one year. From Hamilton street, he moved, in 1887, to 65 Lancaster street, where he has ever since and still resides. In 1882 or 1883 he saw the assessors of Rensselaerville, and told them he had removed his residence, and became a resident of \"that town, and thereafter he was assessed for personal property in that town, and ever since has been so assessed. The assessors of Albany did not know Hint he continued to live in that city, from 1SS2 to 1S86, until 1889, when they placed his name on the roll, and assessed him for personal property at 65 Lancaster street, where he 'resided. That tax remained unpaid, and to recover the amount thereof this action was brought.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b581-5\">Argued before MAYHAM, P.

He was therefore properly taxed in 1889 for personal estate in that city, under the provisions of the act of 1850-51. It is suggested by defendant that said act was repealed or superseded by chapter 392 of the Laws of 1883. The latter act does not in terms supersede the former statute, nor is it inconsistent therewith. The act of 1883 was not intended to apply to a case like this, where one has two residences, and each in different towns. That a person may have two residences, although but one domicile, under the act of 1850-51, cannot be doubted. Bell v. Pierce, 51 N. Y. 12; Bartlett v. Mayor, 5 Sandf. 44. We do not understand the act of 1850-5.1, where one resides in different towns during the year for which he is taxed, as intending only \u201csuccessive\u201d residences, as claimed by defendant. The language of the act cannot be so construed properly. The defendant, being taxable in Albany, where his principal business was carried on, was in that city properly taxed in the ward where he resided. Wilcox v. City of Rochester, 129 N. Y. 247, 29 N. E. Rep. 99. We agree with the view of the learned referee that the tax properly assessed against defendant in the city of Albany in 1889 may be deemed a debt \u201con contract implied,\u201d and hence that the city court of Albany had jurisdiction of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-9\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
