The affidavits upon- which the original order was made, and upon which the motion to vacate it was heard, show that the defendant is a resident of the state of New York, and is temporarily sojourning in the city of Paris, France. By the order it was directed \u201cthat said summons be served by leaving a copy thereof and of this order at Ho. 220 Broadway, in the city of New York, with a person of proper age, and by depositing another copy of said summons and this order in the general post office of the city of New York, properly inclosed in a post-paid wrapper addressed to said James Gordon Bennett, 220 Broadway, New York City.\u201d It appears by the moving affidavit\u2014which is not disputed\u2014that Ho. 220 Broadway is not, and never has been, the residence of the defendant, but that his residence is, and for many years has been, at Ho. 28 West Twenty-First street in said city. This direction for service upon the defendant at a place other than that of his residence, as provided by the Code, was a fatal error, for which the order must be reversed. The order is reversed, with $10 costs and printing disbursements, and the motion granted, with $10 costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
