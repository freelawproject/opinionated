A further examination of the case of Matson v. Blossom, (Sup.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 489, affirmed without opinion by the court of appeals, (30 N. E. Rep. 865,) leads us to the conclusion that that evidence should have been received, and submitted to the jury upon the question of fraud in procuring the note from the defendant; and, such being the case, the exception to the exclusion of such evidence should be allowed, and the motion for a new trial granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial granted, with costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
