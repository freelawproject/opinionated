Douglass v. Leonard, (Com. Pl. N. Y.; filed February 1, 1892,) 17 N. Y. Supp. 591. See, also, interesting note appended to Johnson v. Leman, (Ill. Sup., 23 N. E. Rep. 435,) 19 Amer. St. Rep. 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-19\">An exception taken to the denial of a motion for a new trial is not available on appeal from the city court of New York to this court. Grier v. Hazard, Hazard &amp; Co., (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 14 N. Y. Supp. 784; Carroll v. O'Shea, (Com. Pl. N. Y.) 21 N. Y. Supp. 956. We must assume that there was sufficient evidence of every fact essential to plaintiff\u2019s recovery, because the record does not disclose a motion for dismissal of the complaint, or that a verdict be directed for defendant, when both parties rested, and an exception to the denial of either of such motions, (Barrett v. Railroad Co., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>45 N. Y. 628; Schwinger v. Raymond, 105 N. Y. 648, 11 N. E. Rep. 952; and we are precluded by the judgment of affirmance of the court below from any consideration of the weight of the evidence, (Arnstein v. Haulenbeek, [Com. Pl. N. Y.] 11 N. Y. Supp. 701; Smith v. Pryor, [Com. Pl. N. Y.] 9 N. Y. Supp. 636; Rowe v. Comley, 11 Daly, 318.) The motion made for dismissal of the complaint when the introduction of direct evidence for plaintiff was closed, and the exception taken to its denial, are not available for the assignment of error, because any defect in the proof then remaining was cured by evidence subsequently adduced by either party. Road Co. v. Thatcher, 11 N. Y. 102; Tiffany v. St. John, 65 N. Y. 314, 317; Painton v. Railroad Co., 83 N. Y. 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Three exceptions appear to the admission of evidence of conversations with one Wittekowski in defendant\u2019s absence. The facts in evidence, however, support an inference of Wittekowski\u2019s authority from defendant to employ plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and conversations with him \u2022 concerning the subject-matter of the latter\u2019s employment were both relevant and material. Another exception was taken to the admission in evidence of the deed of the premises to defendant. The deed was relevant and material to the fact of defendant\u2019s purchase, and so properly admitted. Defendant\u2019s witness Moeran was asked on his direct examination, \u201cDo you know why this expression was put in the contract, \u2018Brokerage, if any?\u2019 \u201d This called for the witness\u2019 conclusion, not for the facts, and the objection to the question was, upon that ground, properly sustained. The contract executed by defendant for the purchase of the premises subsequently conveyed to her contained the following: \u201cBrokerage, if any, to be paid by the party of the second part, (defendant,)\u201d and defendant\u2019s witness Meyers was asked on his direct examination: \u201cTell us what occurred in reference to putting in that contract those words, \u2018Brokerage, if any.\u2019 \u201d We fail to see the materiality of this question, or the testimony it sought to elicit. The contract spoken of was by defendant with a person other than plaintiff\u2019s assignor, and why they inserted the provision concerning the brokerage could not affect the question whether or not plaintiff\u2019s assignor was employed by defendant, which was the question at issue. If the conversations of the persons present at the time of the execution of the \u25a0 contract were material to the question at issue on the trial it was incumbent upon defendant\u2019s counsel to apprise the trial court of the grounds of the materiality. Trustees, etc., First Baptist Church v. Brooklyn Fire Ins. Co., 23 How. Pr. 448. This was not done. Two further exceptions remain, but, as no ground was assigned for the objection to the evidence in either case, they are ineffectual for any purpose. Cruikshank v. Gordon, 118 N. Y. 178, 23 N. E. Rep. 457.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
