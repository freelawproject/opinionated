Under the contract set forth in the second paragraph of the complaint, and not denied by the answer, the plaintiff was not bound to first pursue the principal debtors to judgment and execution as a condition precedent to his cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"970\">*970</page-number>of action against defendant. Moreover, if he was, the evidence at folio 21 was sufficient to permit of a finding by the jury that the defendant had waived the condition as to certain of the debtors whose debts aggregated $315.50, and it would seem that the jury had so found by returning a verdict for only $157.75,\u2014just one-half of such debts,\u2014as the plaintiff sought by pleading and evidence to hold defendant hable for one-half of all of certain uncollectible debts, aggregating $480. This verdict cannot be reviewed here as regards the weight of evidence, because there is no certificate that the case on appeal contains all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
