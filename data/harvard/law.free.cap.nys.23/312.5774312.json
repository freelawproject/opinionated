The employment contemplated services to be rendered in the merchant marine, instead of which the plaintiff, after he arrived at the West Indies, was ordered into the Haytian navy,\u2014a service he very properly declined to accept. The plaintiff seems to have been ready, able, and willing to do all he undertook to do, but was not afforded facilities for performance, and, after a struggle, succeeded in reaching his home. There was no meritorious defense, and the jury properly found for the plaintiff. The judgment entered on them verdict must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
