The defense of payment was a question of fact, and apparently was not proved to the satisfaction of the jury. The claim made by defendant, that plaintiff applied the proceeds of her husband\u2019s note to the payment of the cause of action at bar, was disbelieved by the jury. They evidently believed that said note was applied in payment of the husband\u2019s debt, as agreed upon by plaintiff and defendant\u2019s husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-11\">Finding no error, the judgment is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
