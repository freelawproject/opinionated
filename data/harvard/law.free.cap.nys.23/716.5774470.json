In view of the denial of such \u2022application by the special term with permission to apply to the general term, although we think it was entirely unnecessary under the prayer for further and other relief contained in the motion papers herein, we think the motion should be granted striking from the record the said final judgment.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
