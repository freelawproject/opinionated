Where one went to an unoccupied house and deposited bed-clothing there, and when notified to leave by a person who had been in possession of the land on which the house stood for several years, replied that he had bought the land and was in possession, and declined to leave, this was not alone such use of force as to sustain a proceeding for forcible entry and detainer.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
