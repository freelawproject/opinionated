Complainant was absent from the county, and knew nothing of the levy; no notice thereof was served of which' he knew any thing; complainant\u2019s attorney made a claim affidavit, and presented it to the sheriff, but it was refused ; he then gave notice o'f the homestead, and defendant bought with full knowledge ; the debt was not one which bound the homestead; the levy was excessive; complainant had sufficient personalty to pay the debt; he has tendered to the purchaser the amount paid for the land, which the latter refused to receive. Complainant is old and is about to be turned out of his home. The prayer was for injunction, cancellation of sheriff\u2019s deed, etc. The answer set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>up that complainant was never entitled to a homestead, that it was illegal, that there were incumbrances on the land, and that defendant bought <em>bona fide </em>for value. The chancellor ordered that the injunction be granted upon complainant\u2019s giving bond to pay the 165.00; but that it might be dissolved by the defendant\u2019s giving bond to pay complainant all damages he might sustain from possession or occupancy by defendant:</headnotes>\n\n<judges id=\"b295-6\">Speer, Justice.</judges>\n<opinion><p id=\"b295-5\"><em>Held, </em>that the chancellor did not abuse his discretion in granting such order.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
