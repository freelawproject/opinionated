Problematically, the complaint reveals no actual, justiciable controversy. There is no specific project, building or property identified by the County; rather, the suit purports to apply generally and prospectively to all real property owned by the County that may be involved in future but unspecified projects. Under these circumstances, the circuit court engaged in an academic exercise, and its order amounts to\n   an advisory opinion that has little practical use to the parties in the resolution of any dispute that may arise if, and when, a project is undertaken by the County. Lacking a justiciable controversy, the underlying complaint for declaratory relief was insufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the circuit court under the Uniform Declaratory Judgements Act, and the resulting order granting declaratory relief must be vacated.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The County filed suit in the Circuit Court of Berkeley County against the City seeking declaratory judgment that various properties located within the City limits, but owned by the County, are not subject to the City's zoning ordinances. The complaint lists twelve properties owned by the Berkeley County Council and six properties owned by the Berkeley County Building Commission (collectively, the County Properties). The County Properties include the Berkeley County Court House, the Berkeley County Judicial Center, the Berkeley County Assessor's Office, the Berkeley County Sheriff's Department, P.O. Faulkner Park, and other public buildings. At oral argument, counsel for the County indicated that, to his knowledge, the complaint lists all of the properties owned by Berkeley County located within the City's limits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The County's complaint contended that West Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 7-3-1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   - 2,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   - 5,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and - 7\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   support its position that the County has the specific authority, unrestricted by the Legislature, to purchase property used for courthouses, hospitals, jails and other public buildings, and therefore the County Properties are not subject to city ordinances that may restrict the type or location of those public buildings in the county seat. The County then alleges that the City had previously contended that the County Properties, including those used for a courthouse, hospital, other public building, or jail are subject to its zoning ordinances. Consequently, the County sought a declaratory judgment that the County Properties were not subject to the City of Martinsburg's zoning ordinances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The City filed a motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, contending that its authority\n   to enact land use regulations extends to all land within its jurisdiction pursuant to West Virginia Code \u00a7 8A-7-1(a)(3), and, that under West Virginia Code \u00a7 8A-10-3(a), the enacting body may enjoin \"a person or a unit of government\" from violating the enacted land use ordinances. A \"unit of government\" as defined in \u00a7 8A includes \"any federal, state, regional, county or municipal government or governmental agency.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   So, the City argues that the Legislature intended that county-owned properties would be subject to city ordinances. That is, the City contends that although Chapter 7, Article 3 of the West Virginia Code empowers a county to acquire property, that property is equally subject to city zoning ordinances under West Virginia Code \u00a7 8A-7-1(a)(3). Finally, the City argues that the declaration sought by Berkeley County would, in practice, apply to all county-owned property, not just those designated for a courthouse, jail, or hospital due to the broad \"other public buildings\" language included in statutes at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In response, the County reiterates the arguments made in the complaint to the effect that the City's ordinances could not be applied to the County-owned property used for the County's courthouse, hospital, jail or other public buildings consistent with the provisions contained in Chapter 7, Article 3 of the West Virginia Code. The County further argues that West Virginia Code \u00a7 8A-7-2, which lists the appropriate subjects for zoning, does not include regulation of government-owned property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court denied the City's motion, and granted summary judgment in favor of the County, agreeing that \"the City has no inherent power to adopt a zoning ordinance that affects the properties of governmental entities, and that it is well-established law in West Virginia that the County is afforded the power to purchase or lease real estate for the purpose of constructing or maintaining a courthouse, hospitals, jails, and other public buildings.\" This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Petitioner appeals from a grant of summary judgment that resulted in entry of a declaratory judgment. Accordingly, our review is de novo: \"A circuit court's entry of a declaratory judgment is reviewed\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The rationale behind the justiciable controversy requirement is that the Act [ ] \"is designed to enable litigants to clarify legal rights and obligations\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   acting upon them.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2390489\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/195/608/#p618\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Expanding on those considerations, in\n   <em>\n    Hustead\n   </em>\n   we outlined four factors for circuit courts to consider in this context:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   In deciding whether a justiciable controversy exists sufficient to confer jurisdiction for purposes of the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, West Virginia Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-13-1 to - 16 (1994), a circuit court should consider the following four factors in ascertaining whether a declaratory judgment action should be heard: (1) whether the claim involves uncertain and contingent events that may not occur at all; (2) whether the claim is dependent upon the facts; (3) whether there is adverseness among the parties; and (4) whether the sought after declaration would be of practical assistance in setting the underlying controversy to rest.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Applying that framework to the allegations made in the County's complaint, it is plain to this Court that there is no actual, existing justiciable controversy sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgments Act. Specifically, the complaint does not allege any proposed or potential project that might implicate an analysis of the County's apparent authority to acquire real estate as it relates to the City's apparent authority to zone land within its jurisdiction. There has been no legal right claimed by the County to acquire particular real estate for or to construct a particular type of public building-or any building for that matter-and, consequently, there has been no right denied by the City based on one or more of its zoning ordinances. We are therefore asked to resolve an issue that has not, and indeed may not, ever arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We recognize that declaratory judgments provide certainty for parties as to the extent of their legal rights before undertaking enormous expense or legal obligation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, as we have discussed, \"[t]he crux of the actual controversy requirement ... is that the facts must be known and existing at the time of the filing of a declaratory judgment proceeding[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties here seek an advisory opinion in the total absence of factual\n   circumstances and real controversy, and ask us to interpret and apply statutes that necessarily require factual inquiry. Further, there is no proposed project apparent from the complaint or the parties' briefs that gives any indication that this declaratory judgment was sought for the purpose of avoiding an expense or undertaking an obligation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   As to the third\n   <em>\n    Hustead\n   </em>\n   factor, the parties are undoubtedly adverse, in that they take different legal positions, but that level of adverseness is considerably different from that required in the context of avoiding issuance of advisory opinions. We have discussed that \"one problem with 'friendly,' or 'test case' lawsuits is that the nominally adverse parties are not truly at each other's throats. The parties do not have the gut-level adversarial incentive that causes a litigant to bring forward all possibly meritorious arguments that might defeat their opponent's claims.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, because we have no specific project or ordinance to analyze, there may be additional arguments unknown to the parties specific to a particular project or ordinance that might influence analysis of the parties' competing authority, be it additional statutory or regulatory authority or some matter of balancing public policy interests. For a similar reason, this case does not present an actual, justiciable controversy under the fourth\n   <em>\n    Hustead\n   </em>\n   factor. Any opinion rendered by this Court would be a blind reconciliation and application of statutes, and could be wholly inapplicable to a proposed future project, or its intended use, depending on the factual circumstances. For that reason, the sought-after declaration is of little use to settle any potential future dispute even if it were to eventually arise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   To the extent the County seeks to ascertain its legal rights prior to embarking on a project to construct a building for a particular public use in a particular location that could arguably be subject to the City's zoning ordinances, we invite the County to amend its complaint to reflect that. As it stands, however, we are unable to define the County's authority as opposed to the authority of the City because we have no context with which to evaluate the statutes implicated, and are unable to render a judgment capable of resolving such a general and wide-ranging dispute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   As we have long held, \"[c]ourts are not constituted for the purpose of making advisory decrees or resolving academic disputes[,]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   and we decline to do so here. Although the question of a justiciable controversy was not raised in this context before the circuit court, we find that the order issued by the circuit court was advisory in that it lacked a justiciable controversy sufficient to confer jurisdiction under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act, and, for that reason, must be vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
