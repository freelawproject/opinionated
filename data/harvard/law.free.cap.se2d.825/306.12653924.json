Accordingly, we dismiss the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Alice Jin-Yue Guan filed a petition for review pursuant to Code \u00a7 8.01-626 of an order granting temporary injunction entered February 27, 2019 by the Circuit Court for the City of Alexandria (the \"order\"). The order is part of a complex\n   litigation involving the parties' divorce and the effect of an amended property settlement agreement on the ownership rights and management responsibilities for AdSTM, a company created and owned by the parties. The entirety of the order was as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-9\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER GRANTING TEMPORARY INJUNCTION\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-10\">\n   THIS MATTER came to be heard upon the Defendant's Motion for Entry of Rule\n   to Show Cause and For Temporary Injunction filed against the Plaintiff, ALICE JIN-YUE GUAN.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   AND IT APPEARING to the Court that the following relief should be granted; it is, hereby,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"judges\" id=\"p-12\">\n   ORDERED, ADJUDGED and DECREED as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n    1.

Additionally, Code \u00a7 8.01-631 requires that, except in certain cases not applicable here, \"no temporary injunction shall take effect until the movant gives bond with security in an amount that the trial court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by any party found to have been incorrectly enjoined, with such conditions as the trial court may prescribe.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Here, Guan seeks review of an order by the trial court related to a property settlement agreement from the parties' divorce.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Code \u00a7 17.1-405. The order enumerates several restrictions and requirements on Guan's interaction with AdSTM. There is little doubt that, once the injunction becomes effective, Guan's \"personal, pecuniary, or property rights\" in AdSTM will be\n    \"adversely affected.\" At that point, she will qualify as an aggrieved party for purposes of this Court's review of the injunction order. The injunction, however, is not yet effective because the movant, Ran, has not \"give[n] bond with security in an amount that the trial court considers proper to pay the costs and damages sustained by\" Guan if it turns out that Guan was improperly enjoined. It appears from the record before us that the trial court has not yet determined what the appropriate amount of bond will be. Until the movant \"gives bond with security,\" the injunction does not \"take effect.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Code 8.01-631(A). Accordingly, Guan is not yet enjoined from any action and is not an aggrieved party for purposes of review.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Code 8.01-626 (permitting aggrieved parties to seek review of a temporary injunction).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    CONCLUSION\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Because the temporary injunction referenced in the trial court's February 27, 2019 order has not yet taken effect and there is not yet an aggrieved party enjoined by such temporary injunction, this Court does not yet have jurisdiction to review the merits of the order. We therefore dismiss the petition for review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    This order shall be published and certified to the circuit court.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"1\">\n    <p id=\"p-29\">\n     The text in italics was handwritten on the order.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-30\">\n     An injunction bond is not required \"in the case of a fiduciary or any other person from whom in the opinion of the court awarding an injunction it may be improper or unnecessary to require bond.\" Code \u00a7 8.01-631(A). Nothing in the trial court's order indicates it made such findings in this case.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
