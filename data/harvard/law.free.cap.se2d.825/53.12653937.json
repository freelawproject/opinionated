He contends the trial court erred in permitting the introduction of logs from a national database of pseudoephedrine sales. He also argues the trial court erred in allowing testimony on the theoretical yield of methamphetamine from the amount of pseudoephedrine allegedly purchased by or for him. Additionally, Mealor maintains the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   John Ross, a volunteer reserve deputy for the Pickens County Sheriff's Office (the Office), monitored the National Precursor Log Exchange (NPLEx)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   for the Office. Ross noticed a trend of individuals with the same address purchasing pseudoephedrine on the same day or within a few days of each other.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He suspected those individuals were \"smurfing,\" which is the practice in which methamphetamine manufacturers will recruit others to purchase pseudoephedrine for them in exchange for money or drugs due to limits on how much pseudoephedrine a person can purchase.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ross began monitoring those individuals' purchases and signed up to receive notifications in NPLEx for any attempted purchases by them. The Office also began surveilling those individuals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In November 2011, officers received notice Mealor had purchased pseudoephedrine at a pharmacy. Officers went to the pharmacy and observed a car associated with the case parked at another pharmacy across the street. The officers waited and observed Cynthia Greenfield\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   exit the store. The officers then received a notification Greenfield had purchased pseudoephedrine. The officers followed the car anticipating the occupants might go to a hardware store to get supplies for making methamphetamine. However, the car instead drove toward the residence, traveling over forty miles per hour in a twenty-five-miles-per-hour speed limit zone. The officers initiated a traffic stop for speeding. Amanda Hayes Hurley was driving and Daniel Ray Hurley, Mealor, and Greenfield were passengers along with infant children. Amanda had a suspended license, and the officers asked for her permission to search the vehicle, which she gave. The officers found two boxes of cold medicine containing pseudoephedrine-the same boxes for which the officers had received the earlier alerts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In June 2012, officers arrested many of the individuals they believed were involved. On December 10, 2013, the grand jury indicted Mealor on one count of trafficking over one hundred grams of methamphetamine. Trial began on December 16, 2013, for Mealor, Greenfield,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Hayes, who is Mealor's sister as well as Amanda's mother. Many witnesses testified about activities relating to methamphetamine occurring at a house owned by Louise Mealor-Mealor and Hayes's mother-and indicated Mealor, Greenfield, and Hayes all lived in the house. Other witnesses testified Jason Mealor -Hayes's son-and his then girlfriend, Melissa Wardlaw, also lived in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Multiple witnesses\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   testified about buying medicines with pseudoephedrine to give to Mealor or Greenfield. Rebecca Crisp testified she gave pseudoephedrine she purchased to Hayes, who put it in the bedroom Mealor and Greenfield used. A few of those witnesses indicated they bought some of the pseudoephedrine to treat allergy or sinus problems for themselves, their children, or other family members. Several witnesses testified they would receive methamphetamine from\n   Mealor or Greenfield after they gave them pseudoephedrine they bought. A few witnesses stated they received other drugs or money in return. One witness testified about going to various pharmacies with Mealor and Greenfield to buy pseudoephedrine. Many witnesses also testified about using methamphetamine with them or seeing it used at their home. Several witnesses testified about different supplies that are used in making methamphetamine, such as plastic bottles, batteries, ether, and big bottles of Coleman fuel. One witness indicated she asked Greenfield why she had so many plastic bottles and was told it was because Greenfield and Mealor could feel them expand unlike with glass. Some witnesses also testified the place had a toxic or strong smell. One witness indicated Greenfield told her \"the less [you] know, the better off [she] was\" when she asked about the smell. Some witnesses testified Greenfield and Mealor told them they were going to make methamphetamine so it would be a cleaner product than what they were buying as well as cheaper. Angela Armstrong testified she knew Mealor and Greenfield would be making methamphetamine out of the pseudoephedrine she gave them because they told her they were. Wardlaw testified Greenfield and Mealor told her they could make methamphetamine. Thomas Rooney testified he saw Mealor and Greenfield making methamphetamine in their bedroom in the house several times. Rooney stated the process of making methamphetamine has a strong smell and causes the place where it is being manufactured to become \"really smoky.\" He indicated he had seen Mealor and Greenfield shaking plastic drink bottles to make the methamphetamine. Billy Miller testified that when he gave Mealor and Greenfield the pseudoephedrine they told him they were going to make methamphetamine out of it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The State presented testimony from Paul Forst, a business data analyst employed by Appriss, the company that maintains the NPLEx database. He indicated he was the records custodian for the logs. Over objections, the State introduced the NPLEx record for each of the defendants on trial and the witnesses and others charged with the same offenses. The NPLEx record for Mealor shows he purchased 69.36 grams and was blocked from purchasing it seven times for a total of thirty-seven attempts during 2011. The NPLEx record for Greenfield shows she purchased 68.64 grams and was blocked from purchasing it an additional five times for a total of thirty-four attempts in the same time period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Captain Chad Brooks with the Office also testified. He provided he had been involved in the seizure of close to two hundred methamphetamine labs. He indicated he had manufactured methamphetamine once in a lab setting. He stated he was trained how to calculate the yield that could be produced from a particular amount of pseudoephedrine.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Captain Brooks testified 92% was about the highest yield one could obtain and 40 to 50% is the lowest yield amount one could obtain \"assuming it doesn't flash fire and assuming you['re] successful.\" He indicated 40% was the \"worst case scenario.\" The yield percentage depends on a lot of factors such as how long one waited for the extraction to occur and spillage. He testified the things normally observed at a home lab are sulfuric acid (drain cleaner), coffee filters, funnels, bottles, Xylene, ether, starter fluid cans, cut batteries, medication blister packs, and burn piles. He testified the labs are \"very portable and easy to dispose of.\" He also testified producing methamphetamine creates a distinct smell. Captain Brooks testified on cross-examination he did not find any methamphetamine manufacturing equipment at the scene or on any of the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the close of the State's case, Greenfield moved for a directed verdict and Mealor joined in that motion. They contended only one witness testified he saw Greenfield and Mealor make methamphetamine. They asserted because trafficking requires at least ten grams of methamphetamine and the State presented no evidence of any particular amount of methamphetamine, the State's case was speculative. Mealor also argued that assuming a 40% yield from the pseudoephedrine witnesses indicated they gave him and Greenfield, the result would be sixty-three grams of methamphetamine, which was less than the charge for which they were on trial-trafficking one hundred grams. The trial court denied the motion for a directed verdict on trafficking under one hundred grams but took under advisement trafficking over one hundred grams.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Mealor and Greenfield both testified in their own defense. They both stated all of the pseudoephedrine they bought was to treat their allergy and sinus problems. They both indicated they had a problem with others stealing some of the pseudoephedrine they bought. Mealor testified he had been using Sudafed since he was thirteen years old due to his doctor's recommendation at the time. He also provided he did not have a way to get to the store, so he would buy pseudoephedrine whenever someone drove him to the store. He agreed that according to the NPLEx records, he bought 69.36 grams of pseudoephedrine in 2011, which was under the limit of 108 grams that one person could legally buy in one year. Greenfield admitted to attempting to buy pseudoephedrine thirty-four times in 2011, including the times she was blocked for being over the monthly limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mealor explained on cross-examination he and Greenfield often purchased pseudoephedrine at the same store around the same time because they \"stayed together all the time. [They] never left each other's side.\" He contended the fact he bought pseudoephedrine at the same pharmacy or a nearby pharmacy within a short period of time (i.e. thirty minutes) of many of the witnesses was a coincidence. Greenfield asserted the same. Greenfield also testified she bought pseudoephedrine from several different pharmacies because she had prescriptions for medications at various pharmacies. Both Greenfield and Mealor asserted that during the time period at issue, they did not live at the address where the State alleged the methamphetamine was being made. They both indicated Jason and Wardlaw lived there. Instead, Greenfield and Mealor along with Greenfield's daughter, Julie Williams, contended they lived at Williams's home to help care for her while she was pregnant. However, Greenfield admitted that at times they would stay at the house in question for periods of several nights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the close of the defendants' case, Mealor and Greenfield renewed their motions for a directed verdict on the charge of trafficking over one hundred grams of methamphetamine. The State asserted the amount of the pseudoephedrine purchases the witnesses testified they gave Mealor combined with his own purchases amounted to a total of 161 grams of pseudoephedrine. The State provided the amount of the witness's pseudoephedrine purchases they testified they gave Greenfield combined with her own purchases amounted to a total of 182 grams of pseudoephedrine. The State indicated Mealor's amount did not include Greenfield's purchases and vice versa. Greenfield and Mealor disputed these figures. Greenfield alleged the witnesses testified they gave Mealor or Greenfield 80 grams of their purchases whereas Mealor asserted it was 132 grams, not including the amounts they purchased themselves.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court denied the motion, finding when taking the light most favorable to the State as the nonmoving party, the yield used to calculate the possible amount produced would be the highest yield possible and because the defendants agreed with the amount of pseudoephedrine the witnesses testified they gave the defendants, the possible produced methamphetamine would be above one hundred grams. The court also found that because the statute makes it illegal to conspire to manufacture methamphetamine, the numbers could be used in the aggregate and not necessarily allotted to the defendant to whom the witness testified they gave the pseudoephedrine. The trial court determined\n   the jury could find credible the testimony the yield could be 92%. The State requested to amend the indictment to trafficking between twenty-eight and one hundred grams, given the evidence presented, which the trial court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During closing arguments, the State posited the witnesses testified they gave 164.64 grams of pseudoephedrine to Mealor during 2011. The State asserted when combined with the amount his NPLEx record indicates Mealor purchased himself, this amounted to 243 grams. For Greenfield, the State contended the witnesses gave her 179.76 grams, which it alleged amounted to 248 grams when combined with the amount her NPLEx record showed she purchased. The State argued that when Captain Brooks's lowest yield of 40% was applied to those amounts, the amount of methamphetamine produced was 65 grams for Mealor only accounting for the 164 grams given to him and about 100 grams of methamphetamine when the amount of pseudoephedrine he purchased himself was added.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The jury convicted Mealor and Greenfield of trafficking twenty-eight grams or more but less than one hundred grams of methamphetamine. The trial court sentenced them each to nine years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    LAW/ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals has addressed the admission of these logs in depth. Specifically, that court found \"the pseudoephedrine purchase logs were business records for the purposes of Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   [-]admissible under the exception to the hearsay rule via the affidavits certifying their status.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Thus[,] they were not kept in the ordinary course of business.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049799\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/404/#p407\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049799\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/404/#p407\">\n    at 407-08\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, three pharmacists from area pharmacies testified as to the procedure for when a person purchases pseudoephedrine from their stores, which includes scanning the barcode of the purchaser's government issued identification card through the NPLEx system. They provided their pharmacies require training for using the system. Mealor points to the fact that these witnesses did not testify as to observing a particular purchase by Mealor or the others involved here. We agree with the\n   <em>\n    Towns\n   </em>\n   court \"[t]here is ... no need to have individual cashiers from each of the pharmacies testify.

However, Forst explained all South Carolina pharmacies are required to report the sales to the NPLEX system. As Forst is the records custodian, and the NPLEx logs were admitted during his testimony, the fact that one pharmacist did not identify the exact database does not affect the trustworthiness and reliability of the NPLEx logs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Rule 803(6) states the necessary information is \"shown by the testimony of the custodian.\" Here, Forst, the records custodian, indicated he had access to the records that Appriss maintains and controls. He explained the procedure the pharmacies used to check identification for purchasers. He stated the data was \"stored in a secured data warehouse in a database\" and Appriss has \"a redundant system as a backup stored in another facility.\" He provided \"[t]he only people that have access to them are individuals that work with the product at Appriss and the records are also available to law enforcement by law. They can access them through a web portal that we provide for law enforcement, that once they are vetted and receive an account, then they can access and search the records.\" He responded affirmatively\n   when asked if the \"records are kept in your ordinary course of business.\" The testimony by Forst, the records custodian, provided exactly the information Rule 803(6) requires.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Towns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049799\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/404/#p407\">\n    718 F.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"What is more important-and actually required-is the testimony of the custodian who ensures such records are free from adulteration after the fact.\" (footnote omitted)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Further, Mealor contends the NPLEx logs lacked foundation because the State presented no information regarding the date the NPLEx logs were requested. When the State sought to admit the NPLEx logs at trial, Mealor objected to the fact they did not reference what date range was requested to be printed out but acknowledged the records specified the date each purchase occurred. The timing aspect of Rule 803(6) states the record must be \"made at or near the time\" of the events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Towns\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4049799\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/718/404/#p407\">\n    718 F.3d at 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The purchase logs comprised records of a regularly conducted activity, which were made at or near the time of the purchase by individuals whose job duties entailed making those records.\"). The pharmacists who testified provided how they entered the information as to who was purchasing the pseudoephedrine\n   <em>\n    at the time the purchase was being made\n   </em>\n   . Forst explained that within a second of when a pharmacy inputs the purchaser's information, that information is sent to Appriss to ensure the purchaser would not be exceeding any of the limits for purchasing pseudoephedrine. Mealor's contention the State did not provide the date range for which the records were requested is not the timing aspect Rule 803(6) requires.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the State had laid a foundation for the NPLEx logs.

Captain Brooks described \"[i]n the clandestine lab training, [he] went to the [South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED) ] lab and manufactured methamphetamines from start to finish the lab, in the controlled setting.\" He indicated he had been trained about the various methods with which one can make the methamphetamine.

Mealor argued that from \"research on the [i]nternet,\" the experts disagreed on the actual conversion measurements but did not provide any sources. He argued the \"yield is [a]ffected by the way [it is] cooked, by who cooks it, by what's done with it.\" He contended \"it would be completely inappropriate to expect a police officer who is trained in investigative techniques regarding this with no more than a high school education in chemistry as an expert.\" However, Captain Brooks explained those factors are what caused a range of yields instead of a specific percentage that would be the yield in any situation. Captain Brooks did not develop the calculation; he simply utilized it as he was trained. As numerous courts have held, this is a widely accepted calculation.

Many witnesses testified Mealor and Greenfield gave them methamphetamine in return for pseudoephedrine. Accordingly, the records contain evidence they were able to actually produce methamphetamine. Further, witnesses also testified one of the reasons Mealor and Greenfield started manufacturing methamphetamine was because they believed they could produce it at a lesser cost than buying it. Captain Brooks testified the worst case scenario yield was 40%. Applying a 40% yield to the amount of pseudoephedrine Mealor and Greenfield were given, according to the testimony the State presented, the amount of grams of methamphetamine would be over twenty-eight grams. Several witnesses testified Mealor or Greenfield would give them methamphetamine in the amount of $20 or $40 at a time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   While Captain Brooks's testimony indicates a person attempting to make methamphetamine could end up with no methamphetamine due to flash fire, that person would still have been attempting to produce some amount of methamphetamine. Here, many witnesses testified that Mealor and Greenfield gave them methamphetamine after they had made it, demonstrating they were successful. Although we do not have specific testimony that Greenfield or Mealor was a \"good cook,\" we do have testimony they successfully produced methamphetamine. Accordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the directed verdict motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting into evidence the NPLEx logs or Captain Brooks's testimony on the theoretical yield. Further, the trial court did not err in denying Mealor's motion for a directed verdict.

The State questioned Caption Brooks specifically on his qualifications. The trial court overruled the objection, finding it was not necessary for the witness to have certain degrees and that it went to credibility as opposed to admissibility. Mealor then voir dired Captain Brooks. The trial court qualified him as an expert and stated that it did not know what Captain Brooks's testimony would entail because the court had not yet heard it.

After the trial court determined they had satisfactorily reconstructed the record, Mealor's appellate counsel asked for an order stating the record could not be reconstructed. The trial court denied that request, finding the record had been successfully reconstructed. Mealor appealed that denial to this court on March 9, 2016. On July 22, 2016, Mealor requested to drop his appeal regarding the reconstruction of the record.
