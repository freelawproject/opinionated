The subpoena was issued by Trump\u2019s Castle during the course of discovery relating to an action by it against a former employee, Joseph Tallone. TropWorld contended that the subpoena called for the revelation of \u201ctrade secrets\u201d or proprietary information relating to marketing strategy which it should not have to disclose to a vigorous competitor in the gaming industry, especially since Trop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>World was not a party to the primary dispute in litigation. We conclude that the Law Division judge should have reviewed the materials and taken any necessary testimony <em>in camera, </em>outside the presence of Trump\u2019s Castle\u2019s attorneys or representatives, and then reached a conclusion whether the subpoenaed information was protected from routine discovery disclosure in civil litigation. On the present record, we cannot tell if the subpoenaed information warrants protection from disclosure as a \u201ctrade secret.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">In 1992 Joseph Tallone was employed by TropWorld Casino in Atlantic City. Tallone worked at TropWorld in a supervisory position over several employees. In the summer of 1992, Tallone solicited employment with Trump\u2019s Castle, claiming that he and Ron Gollapardi, Bimal Dua, Lou Pascal, James Palladinetti, Ping Bagg and Chi Hui could bring \u201c \u2018high roller\u2019 patrons\u201d to Trump\u2019s Castle Casino. Trump\u2019s Castle hired Tallone and the others. Tallone was hired as Vice-President of Player Development under a two-year written contract from September 1, 1992 to August 31, 1994 for $205,000 a year plus fringe benefits, car allowance of $750 a month, and a bonus in Trump\u2019s Castle\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Tallone\u2019s performance did not reach Trump\u2019s Castle\u2019s expectations. Neither Tallone nor the other new employees brought substantial new business or increased receipts for Trump\u2019s Castle. They were terminated in January 1994. Trump\u2019s Castle was allegedly \u201cforced to expend considerable sums in employee salaries and other expenses occasioned by the misrepresentations of Tallone\u201d and brought this suit against Tallone and a separate suit against two of the others for fraud, misrepresentation and breach of contract. Tallone counterclaimed for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">On August 30, 1993, Trump\u2019s Castle served a subpoena duces tecum and for oral depositions on TropWorld. Trump\u2019s Castle asked TropWorld to produce:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">documents evidencing dollar amount totals (but not names) with respect to (1) the gambling patrons generated by each of the seven ex-employees, and (2) gamblers not generated by each of the seven ex-employees but who had been \u201ccoded\u201d or assigned to each of the seven ex-employees. These dollar amounts should reflect the table drop, slot handle, total expenses (including eomplimentaries paid to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>patrons and other costs attributable to obtaining those patrons, including the salary and bonuses paid to the seven ex-employees) and theoretical win with respect to each of the two categories of patrons.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u201cTheoretical win\u201d refers to the \u201chouse\u201d winnings, not the customer\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">TropWorld immediately moved to quash the discovery subpoena under <em>R. </em>4:10-3(g), claiming that compliance would \u201crequire production of confidential trade secrets,\u201d relying on the definition in the <em>Restatement of Torts </em>\u00a7 757 (1939).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The current <em>Restatement </em>definition is contained at <em>Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition </em>\u00a7 39 (Tentative Draft No. 4, March 25,1993), which defines a trade secret in \u201cblack letter\u201d as \u201cany information that can be used in the operation of a business or other enterprise and that is sufficiently valuable and secret to afford an actual or potential economic advantage over others.\u201d The <em>Restatement, supra, </em>\u00a7 39 comment d at 28 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">A <em>Subject matter. A </em>trade secret can consist of a formula, pattern, compilation of data, computer program, device, method, technique, process, or other form or embodiment of economically valuable information. A trade secret can relate to technical matters such as the composition or design of a product, a method of manufacture, or the know-how necessary to perform a particular operation or service. A trade secret can also relate to other aspects of business operations such as pricing and marketing techniques or the identity and requirements of customers (see \u00a7 42, Comment f).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">TropWorld claimed that the \u201cmethod by which each casino compensates its marketing personnel [and lures customers into the casino] is a closely guarded, confidential aspect of the business conducted by a given casino employer.\u201d After oral argument and some conelusory testimony by Michael Bloom, TropWorld\u2019s mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>keting director, the judge found that the requested information was not a trade secret. She said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">I don\u2019t want to make light of TropWorld\u2019s concerns because I understand that it\u2019s a very competitive world out there. And that when you have eleven businesses, multi-million dollar businesses on a strip competing with each other, day-by-day fighting for customers, that it is a sensitive issue and that there are, certainly, business reasons for wanting to protect any edge that you may have, or that you feel you may have, or any information that may be advantageous to you. But I have considered what you\u2019ve told me and I don\u2019t think any of it\u2019s a trade secret. I don\u2019t think it rises to that level. I don\u2019t think it fits the <em>Restatement </em>[\u00a7 757J definition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">She also found that the information requested was essential to Trump\u2019s Castle\u2019s case. She orally ordered TropWorld to reveal the gross amount of money generated by each ex-employee through both \u201ccoded\u201d (or established \u201chouse\u201d patrons) and new business. The method used by TropWorld to determine which were \u201ccoded\u201d patrons and which were new business patrons did not have to be revealed. The judge also concluded that salary and bonus information was not a trade secret. She further ordered TropWorld to provide the total costs or expense amounts attributable to each employee, but not \u201cto break down expenses into any category other than total expenses....\u201d She also directed that the methodology used to determine what TropWorld considered a \u201ccomp\u201d (complimentary service to a customer) or a cost need not be revealed. Her written order simply stated that: \u201cTropWorld shall turn over to plaintiffs counsel on or before November 22, 1993, the documents demanded in the subpoena.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">As Chief Judge Arnold said in <em>In re Iowa Freedom of Information Council, </em>724 F.2d 658, 662 (8th Cir.1983):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">Trade secrets are a peculiar kind of property. Their only value consists in their being kept private. If they are disclosed or revealed, they are destroyed. Therefore, it makes no sense to say that a determination whether trade secrets are involved should be made in open court, with the hearing to be later closed only if the determination is that they are involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-9\"><em>In camera </em>review by a judge has been approved recently to screen privileged and confidential material not usually subject to disclosure, under the Open Public Meetings Act, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:4-6 to -21. <em>See Atlantic City Convention Center Authority v. South Jersey </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Publishing Co., Inc., </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>53, 66-70, 637 A.2d 1261 (1994); <em>South Jersey Publishing Co., Inc. v. N.J. Expressway Authority, </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>478, 488-89, 591 A.2d 921 (1991) (executive session minutes and memorandum of public authority subject to <em>in camera </em>review); <em>In re Environmental Ins. Actions, </em>259 <em>N.J.Super. </em>308, 318, 612 A.2d 1338 (App.Div.1992) <em>(in camera </em>review to determine if attorney-client privilege waived); <em>Shuttleworth v. City of Camden, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>573, 585-86, 610 A.2d 903 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>429, 627 A.2d 1135 (1992); <em>Coyle v. Estate of Simon, </em>247 <em>N.J.Super. </em>277, 283, 588 A.2d 1293 (App.Div. 1991). The <em>in camera </em>review technique has been used in trade secret cases as far back as <em>Taylor Iron and Steel Co. v. Nichols, </em>73 <em>N.J.Eq. </em>684, 690, 69 A. 186 (E. &amp; A. 1908); <em>see also Multistate Tax Commissioner v. U.S. Steel Corp., </em>659 F.2d 931, 933 (9th Cir.1981); <em>Management Assistance, Inc. v. Computer Dimensions, Inc., </em>546 <em>F.Supp. </em>666, 678 (N.D.Ga.1982), <em>aff'd sub nom., Computer Dimensions, Inc. v. Basic Four, </em>747 <em>F.2d </em>708 (11th Cir.1984); <em>Heyden Chemical Corp. v. Burrell &amp; Neidig, Inc., 2 N.J.Super. </em>467, 470, 64 A.2d 465 (Ch.Div.1949).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">We cannot conclude from this record whether there is merit to TropWorld\u2019s contention that the information relevant to its 1992 marketing techniques or customer procurement methods sought by the subpoena should be protected as a \u201ctrade secret.\u201d We remand and require the judge to take testimony <em>in camera </em>from TropWorld\u2019s appropriate witness concerning the precise information Trump\u2019s Castle seeks and the reasons specifically advanced by the TropWorld witness for non-disclosure. The judge can then analyze the information and make a generalized ruling based on adequate information under the appropriate standard. <em>See Sun Dial Corp. v. Rideout, </em>29 <em>N.J.Super. </em>361, 366, 102 A.2d 90 (App.Div.1954), <em>aff'd, </em>16 <em>N.J. </em>252, 108 A.2d 442 (1954); <em>Boost Co. v. Faunce, </em>13 <em>N.J.Super. </em>63, 80 A.2d 246 (Ch.Div.1951), <em>aff'd, </em>17 <em>N.J.Super. </em>458, 86 A.2d 283 (App.Div.1952). The judge also must consider the factors customarily weighed in considering an application by a nonparty, such as TropWorld here, to limit discovery. <em>See Berrie v. Berrie, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>274, 284, 457 A.2d 76 (Ch.Div. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>1983). But the judge must first know the nature of the confidential information and the precise reasons urged for secrecy before she can effectively evaluate the worth of TropWorld's claim for protection of its proprietary information.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The judge should, after hearing testimony and reviewing the documents, make specific findings of fact and give reasoned conclusions for her generalized ruling. <em>R. </em>1:7-4. These findings and conclusions can be sealed pending any application for a stay or a <em>motion for leave to appeal her </em>ruling to this court. Of course, Trump\u2019s Castle\u2019s representatives and its attorney, and defendant Tallone and his attorney, must be excluded from the <em>in camera </em>proceeding. This exclusion will temporarily protect TropWorld\u2019s \u201ctrade secrets\u201d pending the rendition of a reasoned decision by the judge and any motion for leave to appeal. \u201c[W]e recognize that the right of a litigant to be present at the time his case is heard[ ] is a cherished right.\u201d <em>Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. v. Johnson, </em>296 <em>Pa.Super. </em>405, 442 A.2d 1114, 1128 (1982). But that \u201cright is not absolute.\u201d <em>Ibid. A </em>court may insure \u201cthe means of affording adequate protection against unwarranted intrusion and invasion of the rights of one party by another party.\u201d <em>Bead Chain Manufacturing Co. v.
