The judge of compensation determined that under <em>Bond v. Rose Ribbon &amp; Carbon Mfg. Co., </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>308, 200 A.2d 322 (1964), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>petitioner\u2019s claim for a cumulative occupational disease was properly brought against the current employer when, as <em>Bond </em>states, the disease is disclosed \u201cby medical examination, work incapacity, or manifest loss of physical function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, 200 A.2d 322. The compensation judge determined that Celotex, petitioner\u2019s final employer, satisfied this test. However, since petitioner materially misrepresented his prior employment history and physical condition to Celotex, the compensation judge determined that petitioner was barred from claiming compensation from Celotex and dismissed the petition. Our consideration of this misrepresentation defense is a case of first impression. For the reasons hereafter stated, we reject this defense and remand the matter for a determination of the extent of petitioner\u2019s disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On January 5,1987, petitioner filed a claim petition alleging that he had sustained neurologic, pulmonary, internal, reproductive and neuropsychiatric injuries from his exposure to various deleterious substances while employed by BASF. Over two years later, he filed a new petition alleging an aggravation of the preexisting conditions arising out of his employment with Celotex. During the pendency of this claim, Celotex joined Chemo Dynamics as an additional respondent, and the claim petitions were consolidated for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">When petitioner rested his case, Celotex moved for a dismissal of the consolidated petition on the ground that petitioner had materially misrepresented his medical condition on his Celotex employment application. Celotex contended that it had relied upon the misrepresented information, and that there was a direct causal relationship between the misrepresentation and petitioner\u2019s condition. Initially, the trial judge denied the motion. But following the conclusion of the hearing, and even though petitioner had some permanent pulmonary disability resulting from exposure to deleterious and noxious irritants while in the employ of all three respondents, and also suffered some acknowledged minimal permanent psychiatric disability, the judge determined that the extent of disability could not be fixed or apportioned among the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>respondents. He found that the rule in <em>Bond v. Rose Ribbon &amp; Carbon Mfg. Co., supra, </em>required a dismissal of the petitions against BASF and Chemo Dynamics. The judge then reversed his previous ruling on the affirmative defense of misrepresentation, and dismissed the remaining claim petition against Celotex.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Petitioner, an Egyptian by birth, was a chemist trained in Cairo. He emigrated to the United States in 1969 and took graduate courses in chemistry at the New Jersey Institute of Technology. He then worked for several chemical companies before being hired as a process development chemist by BASF for whom he worked from October 1977 through June 1986. During this employment he inhaled a variety of esoteric chemicals which precipitated an asthma condition and apparently also sterilized him. From 1981 to 1985 petitioner suffered from bouts of dizziness, shortness of breath, and coughing and chest pain for which he was treated by various physicians. By late 1985 he equated the effect on his breathing and his more frequent dizzy spells with the atmosphere in the BASF plant. His physician prescribed inhalers and pulmonary medication. On his last assignment for BASF, petitioner was in charge of a process which generated fumes aggravating his breathing difficulty and chest tightness. Fearing that he would be overcome by the fumes, he asked his supervisor to be relieved of the assignment and transferred to another area. When his request was denied, he left the job with BASF because he could not breathe. Immediately thereafter he returned to his physician and, while his chest x-ray was normal, the physician diagnosed asthma and prescribed various asthma medication.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">While employed by BASF, petitioner was exposed to more than fifty chemicals and, although he had already fathered a child, a later examination disclosed that he was sterile. Petitioner\u2019s expert compared the list of chemicals to which petitioner had been exposed with the literature available on spermatoxic compounds. The expert determined that one or more of the chemicals to which petitioner was exposed at BASF constituted the major cause of petitioner\u2019s azoospermia (sterility). The expert ruled out other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>possible causes such as heredity, mumps, radiation exposure, or endocrine, urologic or pituitary problems, and stated that petitioner\u2019s azoospermia is a permanent condition. When the condition was first disclosed after petitioner left BASF, his treating physician attempted steroid treatments, but later semen analysis continued to reveal azoospermia.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Petitioner\u2019s employment with Chemo Dynamics as an organic chemist lasted for only three weeks in early 1987. However, his employment there required work on reactions producing sulfur dioxide in a poorly ventilated area. The resultant coughing, chest tightness and dizziness necessitated continued medical treatment and his use of inhalers and bronehodilators. When petitioner was asked to work with prohibited chemical substances, he quit, but the termination of this employment was unrelated to his asthma.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Thereafter petitioner went from job to job, working as a security guard and then a store manager. Finally, in August 1987, he applied for employment as a security guard with Celotex. He claimed that he had been an assistant manager of a food store from 1973 through 1987, and did not list BASF or Chemo Dynamics as prior employers. He did not actively misrepresent his medical condition on the application, but rather merely failed to answer the question asking him to describe any physical limitations. The employee relations representative of Celotex was thus unaware that petitioner had asthma. As petitioner appeared qualified for the job, he was referred to the company doctor for a physical. Petitioner filled out a questionnaire in the doctor\u2019s office, but again failed to answer questions concerning chief complaints, symptoms and previous doctors. Furthermore, he misrepresented to the doctor that he was not taking any medication and had no somatic complaints other than being short of breath while climbing stairs. Petitioner claims that he did tell the doctor that he had asthma, but the doctor noted that petitioner stated he had asthma as a child. The physical examination revealed a clear throat and lungs, and the x-ray taken at the time was normal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>The doctor cleared petitioner for employment, and he began working as a security guard for Celotex in August 1987.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">As a security guard, petitioner was required to walk long distances inside and outside the Celotex plant regardless of whether it was cold and windy or hot and muggy. When a sprinkler system was activated, a Celotex security guard was required to run through the plant to determine whether there was a fire. Although respirators were available for security guards, petitioner did not wear one, nor did the chief of security remember any occasion when a security guard had worn a respirator. The Celotex plant manufactured roof shingles and petitioner was constantly exposed to dust from hot asphalt and fumes from trucks entering and leaving the plant. He requested a mask, and his wearing the cloth mask helped him to some extent. After nine months of employment, petitioner was admitted to the hospital for treatment of an acute bronchial asthma attack and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He had bilateral inspiratory and expiratory wheezing, but a normal x-ray. When he was hospitalized he reported his asthmatic condition to Celotex and as a result was laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Petitioner\u2019s present symptoms include depression, mood swings, lack of concentration, social withdrawal, confusion and even a suicidal preoccupation. He is filled with despair, emptiness and guilt which his experts relate to the loss of his job, his asthmatic condition and his azoospermia. He has a deteriorating relationship with his wife which began when he learned of his infertility, and although he had benefitted from psychiatric treatment in the past, he was forced to discontinue the treatment for financial reasons. He had additional hospitalizations and in October 1989 began receiving Social Security disability benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">Given the determination by the workers\u2019 compensation judge, we need not here evaluate petitioner\u2019s claim of complete disability or respondents\u2019 claims of minimal disability. The issue was never resolved by the trial judge and, as noted at the outset, we are remanding this matter and requiring that the judge determine this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>issue. The thrust of our opinion concerns the misrepresentation defense upheld by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">In New Jersey there are theoretically two systems for determining responsibility for a worker\u2019s injury. Under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-1, absent an express or implied agreement for workers\u2019 compensation, employees\u2019 rights to sue their employers for injuries arising out of and in the course of employment and the defenses to such suits are regulated. However, the vast majority of employees in this State fall under the \u201celective compensation\u201d provisions of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 <em>et seq. </em>on the theory that if such workers\u2019 compensation has not been contractually rejected at the time of employment, the parties by agreement, express or implied, have accepted the provisions of elective compensation. In reality, the workers\u2019 compensation scheme has now become so ingrained in our society that it is not a matter of contract; rather it is legislated workers\u2019 protection. For all practical purposes, the employee\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation is a matter of statutory mandate, not voluntary contract. Therefore we reject the simplistic argument that the \u201ccontract\u201d is vitiated by material misrepresentation at the time of hiring.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">There are but a few statutory defenses to an employee\u2019s claim for elective compensation. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 contains three defenses. The first is where \u201cthe injury or death is intentionally self-inflicted, or when intoxication or the unlawful use of controlled dangerous substances ... is the natural and proximate cause of injury or death\u201d compensation need not be paid. The second is willful failure by the employee \u201cto make use of a reasonable and proper personal protective device or devices furnished by the employer\u201d where the device has \u201cbeen clearly made a requirement of the employee\u2019s employment ... and uniformly enforced.\u201d The third is where the injury was occasioned by \u201crecreational or social activities\u201d which were not \u201ca regular incident of employment\u201d and did not \u201cproduce a benefit to the employer beyond improvement in employee health and morale.\u201d Where the claim, as in the case before us, is for an occupational disease there are two additional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>defenses set forth in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-30, namely: where \u201cthe injury or death by occupational disease is caused by willful self-exposure to a known hazard,\u201d and where such injury or death was caused \u201cby the employee\u2019s willful failure to make use of a reasonable and proper guard or personal protective device furnished by the employer which has been clearly made a requirement of the employee\u2019s employment by the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">Since none of the stated exceptions applies in the ease before us, we must here determine whether we should engraft a new defense: material misrepresentation in the employment application.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">Some states have added a statutory misrepresentation defense to their workers\u2019 compensation law. <em>See </em>I <em>Mod.Work.Comp. </em>\u00a7 109:34 at 57-58 (Clark Boardman Callaghan 1993) (listing eleven states with some form of a statutory misrepresentation defense). <em>See also </em>Charles F. Carr and Rhonda K. Pitts <em>\u201cLet the Liar Beware! Lying on Employment Application May Bar Recovery of Workers\u2019 Compensation Benefits,\u201d </em>16 <em>Am.J.Trial Advoc. 737, </em>n. 31-n. 33 (1993), (hereinafter Carr and Pitts) (listing eighteen such statutes, although these statutes mostly impose penalties for the general offense of fraudulently procuring workers\u2019 compensation benefits).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>Other statutes merely deny compensation in the limited instance of occupational disease. <em>See Idaho Code </em>\u00a7 72-441; <em>Md.Code Ann., Lab. &amp; Empty </em>\u00a7 9-502; <em>Mich.Comp.Laws Ann. </em>\u00a7 418.431; <em>Ohio Rev.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 4123.70; <em>S.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 42-11-80. For example the Idaho statute states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-6\">No compensation shall be payable for an occupational disease if the employee, at the time of entering into the employment of the employer by whom the compensation would otherwise be payable, falsely represented himself in writing as not having previously been disabled, laid off, or compensated in damages or otherwise because of such disease.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-7\"><em>[Idaho Code </em>\u00a7 72-441],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">Still other states, however, have adopted a misrepresentation defense by common law. <em>See </em>IC Larson\u2019s <em>Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law, </em>\u00a7 47.53, at 8-393 to 8-404 (1986). According to Professor Larson</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-9\">The following factors must be present before a false statement in an employment application will bar benefits: (1) The employee must have knowingly and wilfully made a false representation as to his physical condition. (2) The employer must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must have been a substantial factor in the hiring. (3) There must have been a causal connection between the false representation and the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b68-10\"><em>[Id. </em>at 8-394 (footnotes omitted) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b68-11\">This \u201cLarson Test,\u201d has been widely adopted. According to Carr and Pitts, <em>supra, </em>seventeen states have judicially adopted Professor Larson\u2019s rule or some form of it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See also </em>Tracy A. Bateman, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Annotation, <em>Eligibility for Workers\u2019 Compensation as Affected by Claimant\u2019s Misrepresentation of Health or Physical Condition at Time of Hiring, </em>12 A.L.R.5th 658 (1993), also collecting the eases that have adopted or rejected Professor Larson\u2019s three-step misrepresentation defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The rationales for the application of the Larson test are varied. Arkansas, Florida and Georgia use the Larson rationale to extend to accident eases a statutory misrepresentation defense applicable only to occupational diseases. Delaware, Florida, Georgia and Minnesota predicate this defense on theories to protect their second injury funds. Neither of these theories, however, is particularly applicable to New Jersey, since there is no statutory defense to be extended, and our Second Injury Fund statute, <em>N.J.S.A </em>34:15-95, has no requirement that the employer have knowledge of the employee\u2019s preexisting physical condition for benefits to be paid. Unlike the funds in the cited states, the employee, not the employer, applies for benefits. <em>N.JA.C. </em>12:235-7.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">Arkansas, Florida and Virginia partially base their adoption of the Larson test upon the employer\u2019s right to decline employment to an employee suffering a physical infirmity which might be aggravated by an industrial accident. The misrepresentation thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>prevents the employer from protecting itself. In New Jersey, however, while the employer also takes the employee as he or she is, the employer gets credit for the \u201cprevious loss of function\u201d in order to encourage hiring workers with preexisting disabilities. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15 \u2014 12d; <em>Abdullah v. S.B. Thomas, Inc., </em>190 <em>N.J.Super. </em>26, 29-30, 461 A.2d 1179 (App.Div.1983). Thus, the rationale of the cases employing this approach is only of limited relevance in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">There are several jurisdictions that have refused to adopt the Larson approach. Carr and Pitts have found ten such examples: <em>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co. v. Hall, </em>674 F.2d 248, 252 (4th Cir.1982) (Congress failed to recognize defense under Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act); <em>Marriott Corp. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n, </em>147 <em>Ariz. </em>116, 121, 708 P.2d 1307, 1312 (1985) (\u201c[Ajbsent express statutory authority, a misrepresentation as to physical health to a prospective employer should present no bar to recovery of compensation benefits for industrial injury.\u201d); <em>Kraus v. Artcraft Sign Co., </em>710 P.2d 480, 482 (Colo. 1985); <em>Teixeira v. Kauikeolani Children\u2019s Hosp., </em>3 <em>Haw.App. </em>432, 435, 652 P.2d 635, 636 (Ct.App.1982) (Such a rule \u201cmust come, if at all, from the legislature, not the judiciary.\u201d); <em>Fontenot v. Cagle Chevrolet, Inc., </em>417 So.2d 1338, 1342 (La.App.1982), <em>writ denied, </em>421 So.2d 1125 (La.1982); <em>Dressler v. Grand Rapids Die Casting Corp., </em>402 <em>Mich. </em>243, 256, 262 <em>N.W.2d </em>629, 634 (1978); <em>Goldstine v. Jensen Pre-Cast, </em>102 <em>Nev. </em>630, 631, 729 P.2d 1355, 1356 (1986). (Adoption of the Larson test is a policy decision which should be considered by the legislature rather than the court.); <em>H.J. Jeffries Truck Line v. Grisham, </em>397 P.2d 637, 642-43 (Okla.1964); <em>In re Stovall, </em>306 <em>Or. </em>25, 38, 757 P.2d 410, 417 (1988). (A workers\u2019 compensation claim is not barred by an estoppel theory.); <em>Blue Bell Printing v. Workmen\u2019s Compensation Appeal Bd., </em>115 <em>Pa. Commw. </em>203, 208-09, 539 A.2d 933, 935-36 (Commw.Ct.1988); (Misrepresentation is not a defense available to an employer under the Act.); <em>State Dept. of Highways &amp; Pub. Transp. v. Thrasher, </em>805 S.W.2d 798, 800 (Tex.Ct.App.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">As is cogently explained by the Supreme Court of Oregon:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>It must be kept in mind that court decisions in cases arising under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Law interpret that statutory law. This seems to have been lost on some of the courts whose decisions are cited by Professor Larson, <em>supra. </em>Some of those courts obviously arrived at decisions denying benefits because those courts believed that they were free to engraft on the statutory schemes of their respective states the courts\u2019 ideas of what the common law or equity might require in the circumstances.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">It also must be remembered that the passage of workers\u2019 compensation legislation, while giving to the worker the right to compensation regardless of fault, deprived the worker of the right to maintain an action for damages for injuries suffered by reason of the employer\u2019s fault. Early on, this court deemed the legislation was for the benefit of the worker. Whether or not it was exclusively so, that concept led this court to pronounce many times over the years that Oregon\u2019s statutory workers\u2019 compensation scheme was to be construed liberally in favor of the worker-claimant____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-7\">In short, we understand the philosophy of the Workers\u2019 Compensation law to be that if a person is hired and is, in fact, working for an employer in the role of an employee and becomes disabled as a result of being so employed, the cost of the workers\u2019 disability is to be borne by the economy through the employing enterprise and not to be borne by the worker. That statutory policy should not be vulnerable to reopening the way in which a worker in fact obtained the employment when the worker is injured or contracts a disabling occupational disease on the job perhaps months or years after the event of hiring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-8\">We conclude that public policy as expressed by the legislature weighs in favor of not defeating a claim for benefits by application of a doctrine not endorsed by the legislature....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-9\"><em>[In re Stovall, supra, </em>757 P.2d at 417-18].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-10\">Other reasons cited by courts for refusing to adopt the affirmative defense of misrepresentation in the absence of a statute creating this defense are: (1) it would advance the disfavored view that the employee must be free from fault in order to receive compensation; (2) it would defeat the purpose of the workers\u2019 compensation system which is to substitute a simplified and speedy administrative process to extend litigation unburdened by a multitude of employer defenses; and (3) it would disturb the existing delicate balance of the compensation system based on the employee\u2019s surrender of common-law right to sue the employer <em>for </em>negligence in exchange for the employer\u2019s surrender of most of its common-law defenses. <em>Marriott Corp. v. Industrial Comm\u2019n of Ariz., supra, </em>147 <em>Ariz. </em>at 121, 708 P.2d at 1312; <em>Goldstine v. Jensen Pre-Cast, supra, </em>729 P.2d at 1356.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>Celotex urges that the United States Supreme Court has adopted a misrepresentation test under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act governing railroads\u2019 liability for negligently inflicted personal injuries on their employees. <em>Minneapolis, St. Paul &amp; Sault. Ste. Mane Ry. Co. v. Rock, </em>279 <em>U.S. </em>410, 49 <em>S.Ct. </em>363, 73 <em>L.Ed. </em>766, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 50 <em>S.Ct. </em>79, \u2014 L.Ed.-(1929) (where an employee rejected for physical condition reapplied under a fictitious name and had a third party take the railroad\u2019s physical examination). On the unique facts in <em>Rock, </em>the Supreme Court stated that such an employee\u2019s \u201c[rjight to recover may not justly or reasonably be rested on a foundation so abhorrent to public policy.\u201d 279 <em>U.S. </em>at 415, 49 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 365, 73 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 770. However, a later examination of this same principle in <em>Still v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., </em>368 <em>U.S. </em>35, 44, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>148, 153, 7 L.Ed.2d 103, 109 (1961), limited <em>Rock </em>\u201cto its precise facts.\u201d Under <em>Still, </em>a railroad cannot defend a-Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act claim by proving that the employee made false representations as to his physical condition upon which the railroad relied in hiring him, even if the misrepresentation contributed to the injury or accident. 368 <em>U.S. </em>at 35-36, 44-45, 82 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 149, 153-154, 7 L.Ed.2d at 104-105, 109-110.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>After reviewing these authorities, we determine that the better-reasoned approach, considering the New Jersey statutory scheme of workers\u2019 compensation as interpreted by the courts, is a rejection of both the Larson test and the misrepresentation defense. In reaching this conclusion we have considered related New Jersey cases, general rules of statutory construction, the liberal construction history of the New Jersey act, and the specific facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In New Jersey, while there are no decisions specifically addressing the affirmative defense of misrepresentation of a health condition, we have considered the related issue of whether a fraudulent misrepresentation of an employee\u2019s age barred the application of the double compensation benefits under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-10 to a minor claimant without an employment certificate. In <em>Fletcher v. Ehrlich, </em>122 <em>N.J.Super. </em>382, 384-385, 300 A.2d 581 (App.Div.1973), we held that such a misrepresentation made by either the minor or someone else will not preclude the recovery of the double compensation. <em>See also Chickachop v. Manpower, Inc., </em>84 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 132, 140, 201 A.2d 90 (Law Div.1964) (reaching a similar result concerning misrepresentations of the employee\u2019s age and special skills); <em>cf. Ferraro v. Zurcher, </em>12 <em>N.J.Super. </em>231, 239, 79 A.2d 473 (App.Div.1951) (dealing with exaggeration or misrepresentation on the witness stand at a workers\u2019 compensation proceeding, and precluding punishment of the petitioner by denying \u201cproper compensation for a disability otherwise sustained by the proofs\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">The Legislature substantially revised the Workmens\u2019 Compensation Act in 1979 but did not include a statutory misrepresentation defense. The generally-recognized rules of statutory construction do not favor our now engrafting such a defense onto the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>existing statute. The statute already provides the enumerated exceptions quoted earlier. The provision for such exceptions in a statute indicates a legislative intent that the statute be applied to all other cases not specifically excepted. <em>State v. Reed, </em>34 <em>N.J. </em>554, 558, 170 A.2d 419 (1961); <em>Eyre v. Bloomfield Sav. Bank, </em>177 <em>N.J.Super. </em>125, 129, 425 A.2d 705 (Ch.Div.1980) (an express exception excludes other exceptions or the enlargement of existing exceptions). These principles were also applied in <em>Martin v. Snuffy\u2019s Steak House, </em>46 <em>N.J.Super. </em>425, 441, 134 A.2d 789 (App.Div.1957), where this court refused to engraft an aggressors\u2019 exception into the text of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>34:15-7 exonerating employers from paying workers\u2019 compensation benefits in accidental injury cases.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Additionally, the cases are legion over the years requiring the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act to be liberally construed in favor of the claimant. <em>See e.g., Squeo v. Comfort Control Corp., </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>588, 596-597, 494 A.2d 313 (1985) and cases cited therein; <em>Close v. Kordulak Bros., 44 N.J. </em>589, 604, 210 A.2d 753 (1965). As noted in <em>Everhart v. Newark Cleaning &amp; Dyeing Co., </em>119 <em>N.J.L. </em>108, 110, 194 A. 294 (E. &amp; A.1937):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b74-7\">Nothing is to be read into the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] by judicial construction because of some supposed reason of policy. The primary subject of inquiry is the legislative intention, as expressed in the statute____ [Tjhere is ... no warrant ... for the inclusion of matters not expressly provided, or reasonably to be implied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">Lastly, the facts of this case also militate for our rejection of the Larson misrepresentation rule. Petitioner\u2019s condition was primarily caused by his employment at BASF, but his expert witness could not definitively apportion the percentage of disability to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>respective employments. It is clear from petitioner\u2019s work history that, due to the problems encountered at BASF, petitioner became no longer employable in the field for which he was trained. If he is to be denied all compensation because of his misrepresentatioii to his final employer, industry as a whole receives a windfall and society a public charge (discounting petitioner\u2019s social security benefits). We must understand that it is only because of the rule, recognized to be arbitrary, in <em>Bond v. Rose Ribbon &amp; Carbon Mfg. Co., supra, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>at 311, 200 A.2d 322, that the last employer is to bear the responsibility for workers\u2019 compensation payments. In another case, Celotex may be the employer that caused the initial injury and the last employer may be BASF. As noted by the Supreme Court, in the aggregate, these claims average out. (\u201cAlthough this test is admittedly arbitrary and may on occasion cause some apparently unfair results, over the years it should result in an equitable balancing of liability. Under the circumstances we conceive it to be the fairest and most workable thesis.\u201d <em>Ibid.). </em>Absent a legislative directive to deny a person in petitioner\u2019s position all compensation, we see no basis to add a misrepresentation defense to the workers\u2019 compensation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In addition to petitioner\u2019s pulmonary and related claims which clearly must be charged to Celotex, in this case petitioner also proved a claim for his azoospermia and associated psychiatric disability for which BASF appears solely responsible. In his dismissal of petitioner\u2019s claim, the trial judge failed to recognize that the claim against BASF for petitioner\u2019s sterility was deserving of adjudication in addition to the claim against Celotex for the asthma-related difficulties. The dismissal of the claim against BASF without findings, while an oversight, needs to be remedied on remand. <em>Lister v. J.B. Eurell Co., </em>234 <em>N.J.Super. </em>64, 73, 560 A.2d 89 (App.Div.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">From this record, it appears that there is no basis of liability against Chemo Dynamics, and the dismissal of the claim against Chemo Dynamics is therefore affirmed. The dismissal of the claim against Celotex is reversed and remanded for findings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>regarding the extent of petitioner\u2019s permanent pulmonary and associated psychiatric disabilities, and for the entry of an award of such compensation benefits as well as any temporary and medical benefits to which petitioner may be entitled. The dismissal of petitioner\u2019s pulmonary and associated psychiatric disability claims against BASF is affirmed; however, the dismissal of petitioner\u2019s azoospermia and associated psychiatric disability claims against BASF is reversed and remanded for findings of fact and an award of compensation, if deemed appropriate by the judge of compensation. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b67-8\"> Some statutes are criminal or <em>quasi-criminal </em>in nature. <em>See Alaska Stat. </em>\u00a7 23.30.250 (guilty of theft by deception); <em>Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 23-1028 (guilty of a class two misdemeanor and forfeits all right to compensation, benefits or payment after conviction of the offense); <em>D.C.Code Ann. </em>\u00a7 36-333 (misdemeanor conviction punished by fine of no more than $1,000 or by imprisonment of no more than one year, or both); <em>La.Rev.Stat.Ann. </em>\u00a7 23:1208 (punishable by imprisonment for six months to ten years and fines between $500-$10,000); <em>Mass.Ann.
