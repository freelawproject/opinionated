The court sentenced defendant to concurrent eighteen-year terms of imprisonment, with eight years of parole ineligibility, for his two convictions for armed robbery. The court also imposed a concurrent five-year term of imprisonment for possession of a handgun without a permit. The court merged defendant\u2019s convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>tions for conspiracy, aggravated assault and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose into his convictions for armed robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The trial judge\u2019s handling of a question from the jury gives rise to the only troublesome issue presented by this appeal. Shortly after it began deliberating, the jury sent a note to the judge which read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-6\">Officer Flipping account of weapon recovery over ear radio.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-7\">Manjit Singh re: one or two people going into Chamberlain\u2019s pockets.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">After reading this note into the record, the judge commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-9\">Candidly, I don't understand what they want. I certainly have an idea that perhaps they want the testimony read over, but I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">However, instead of following the normal procedure of bringing the jury into the courtroom in order to resolve this uncertainty, the judge proposed as an alternative that, if counsel did not object, he would \u201cgo to the jury room and candidly ask and report back to the two of you on the record.\u201d In the absence of any objection to this proposed procedure, the judge proceeded to enter the jury room outside the presence of counsel and defendant and without a court reporter to record his colloquy with the jury. After the judge emerged from the jury room, he advised counsel that the jury did indeed desire to hear a readback of certain testimony. The judge also indicated that while he was in the jury room the foreperson had asked him an additional question not encompassed by the jury\u2019s original note. The judge again expressed some uncertainty as to what information the jury was seeking, and this time he brought the jury back into the courtroom and interrogated the foreperson regarding all three of the jury\u2019s questions. Within a short time after hearing the judge\u2019s responses to its questions, the jury returned its verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">A judge should avoid engaging in any <em>ex parte </em>communications with the jury regarding its deliberations. The Supreme Court of the United States has described some of the dangers inherent in such communications in condemning a federal district court judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>discussions with the foreman of a deliberating jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>Any <em>ex parte </em>meeting or communication between the judge and the foreman of a deliberating jury is pregnant with possibilities for error. ... [E]ven an experienced trial judge cannot be certain to avoid all the pitfalls inherent in such an enterprise. First, it is difficult to contain, much less to anticipate, the direction the conversation will take at such a meeting. Unexpected questions or comments can generate unintended and misleading impressions of the judge\u2019s subjective personal views which have no place in his instruction to the jury \u2014 all the more so when counsel are not present to challenge the statements. Second, any occasion which leads to communication with the whole jury panel through one juror inevitably risks innocent misstatements of the law and misinterpretations despite the undisputed good faith of the participants.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\"><em>[United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>422, 460-61, 98 <em>S.Ct </em>2864, 2885, 57 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>854, 884 (1978).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Recognizing these dangers, our courts have directed that \u201cif supplementary instructions are deemed necessary, they shall be given only in open court in the presence of the parties and their counsel, if they choose to attend, or after affording them an opportunity to be present.\u201d <em>Leonard\u2019s of Plainfield, Inc. v. Dybas, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>135, 137, 31 A.2d 496 (Sup.Ct.1943); <em>accord Guzzi v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., </em>36 <em>N.J.Super. </em>255, 264, 115 A.2d 629 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>19 <em>N.J. </em>339, 117 A.2d 52 (1955); <em>see also State v. Auld, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>426, 431-32, 67 A.2d 175 (1949); <em>State v. Duvel, 4 N.J.Misc. </em>719, 134 A. 283 (Sup.Ct.1926), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>103 <em>N.J.L. </em>715, 137 A. 718 (E. &amp; A. 1927). Indeed, the dangers of any <em>ex parte </em>communications between the trial judge and the jury regarding its deliberations are so great that the judge should not seek the consent of counsel to such a procedure under any circumstances. <em>See R. </em>1:2-1; <em>cf. United States v. United States Gypsum Co., supra, </em>438 <em>U.S. </em>at 460-62, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2885-86, 57 L.Ed.2d at 884-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">However, the trial judge\u2019s improper entry into the jury room does not automatically require the reversal of defendant\u2019s convictions. While some of the earlier cases in this State seem to indicate that a judge\u2019s entry into the jury room during deliberations should be treated as <em>per se </em>reversible error, <em>see, e.g., Leonard\u2019s of Plainfield, Inc. v. Dybas, supra, </em>130 <em>N.J.L. </em>at 138, 31 A.2d 496, our more recent cases indicate that a jury verdict should not be disturbed if it can be shown that the judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>communications with the jury were not prejudicial. <em>See State v. Auld, supra, </em>2 <em>N.J. </em>at 432, 67 A.2d 175 (\u201c[I]f the record shows affirmatively that the communication had <em>no </em>tendency to influence the verdict the judge\u2019s impropriety in communicating with the jury out of the presence of the defendant does not require a reversal.\u201d) (quoting <em>La Guardia v. State, </em>190 <em>Md. </em>450, 58 A.2d 913, 917 (1948)); <em>see also State v. Vergilio, </em>261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>648, 653, 619 A.2d 671 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>443, 627 A.2d 1147 (1993); <em>Guzzi v. Jersey Central Power &amp; Light Co., supra, </em>36 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 264-65, 115 A.2d 629. Similarly, in <em>Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. </em>114, 118-19, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>453, 456, 78 L.Ed.2d 267, 273 (1983), the Supreme Court of the United States stated that \u201c[t]he lower federal courts\u2019 conclusion that an unrecorded <em>ex parte </em>communication between trial judge and juror can never be harmless error ignores [the] day-to-day realities of courtroom life and undermines society\u2019s interest in the administration of criminal justice.\u201d Although some state courts have taken the position that any unrecorded intrusion of a judge into the jury room is <em>per se </em>reversible error, see <em>State v. Hilliard, </em>133 <em>Ariz. </em>364, 651 P.2d 892, 897-98 (Ct.App.1982) (listing cases), most jurisdictions employ a harmless error analysis in determining whether such judicial misconduct requires the reversal of a conviction. <em>See, e.g., United States v. McDonald, </em>933 F.2d 1519, 1523-25 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 112 <em>S.Ct. </em>270, 116 L.Ed.2d 222 (1991); <em>McKinney v. State, </em>629 So.2d 807, 808 (Ala.Crim.App.1993); <em>People v. Delgado, </em>5 Cal.4th 312, 19 Cal.Rptr.2d 529, 540-41, 851 P.2d 811, 822-23 (1993); <em>State v. Estrada, </em>69 <em>Haw. </em>204, 738 P.2d 812, 827-28 (1987); <em>Crease v. State, 252 Kan. </em>326, 845 P.2d 27, 30-35 (1993); <em>People v. France, </em>436 <em>Mich. </em>138, 461 N.W.2d 621, 631 (1990); <em>State v. Patrich, </em>494 N.W.2d 298 (Minn.Ct.App.1992); <em>People v. Aveille, </em>148 <em>A.D.2d </em>461, 538 N.Y.S.2d 615, 616-17, <em>appeal denied, </em>74 N.Y.2d 736, 545 N.Y.S.2d 110, 543 N.E.2d 753 (1989); <em>State v. Burton, </em>112 Wis.2d 560, 334 N.W.2d 263, 265-68 (1983); <em>see generally </em>John P. Ludington, <em>Annotation, Postretirement Out-of-Court Communications Between Jurors and Trial </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number><em>Judges as Grounds for New Trial or Reversal in Criminal Case, </em>43 A.L.R.4th 410, 543-63 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">The record in this case shows that the trial judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with the jury had no capacity to prejudice defendant. The sole purpose of the judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication was to .clarify the meaning of two jury questions. Moreover, the judge\u2019s summarization of that communication, given in open court in front of the jury, counsel and also apparently defendant, confirmed that his communication had been thus limited. Consequently, the record affirmatively shows that the judge\u2019s <em>ex parte </em>communication with the jury did not include any supplemental instructions regarding the applicable law, the facts of the case or the jury\u2019s responsibilities, but was instead confined to clarification of the jury\u2019s prior questions. Furthermore, our courts are loathe to find plain error in a trial procedure to which defense counsel has expressly consented. <em>State v. Corsaro, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>339, 345, 526 A.2d 1046 (1987) (\u201cTrial errors which were induced, encouraged or acquiesced in or consented to by defense counsel ordinarily are not a basis for reversal on appeal____\u201d); (quoting <em>State v. Harper, </em>128 <em>N.J.Super. </em>270, 277, 319 A.2d 771 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>574, 325 A.2d 708 (1974)); <em>see also United States v. Aimone, </em>715 F.2d 822, 829-30 (3d Cir.1983). Therefore, although the judge\u2019s discussion with the jury should have been held in open court, on the record and in the presence of both counsel and defendant, we are unable to conclude under all the circumstances of this case that this discussion had a clear capacity to produce an unjust result, ft. 2:10-2; <em>see People v. Knighten, </em>105 <em>Cal.App.3d </em>128, 164 <em>Cal.Rptr. </em>96 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">Defendant also argues that his pretrial statement to the police should have been suppressed because he was not advised of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that his sentence was excessive. These arguments are clearly without merit and do not require discussion, ft. 2:ll-3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
