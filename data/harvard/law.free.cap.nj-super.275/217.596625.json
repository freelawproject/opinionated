The Law Division judge imposed a $20 fine without motor vehicle points as required by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-76.2j.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A law enforcement officer may only enforce the offense against a driver who has been detained for the suspected violation of some other offense. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3 \u2014 76.2i (the provision) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ad\">Enforcement of this act by State or local enforcement agents shall be accomplished only as a secondary action when a driver of a passenger automobile has been detained for suspected violation of Title 39 of the Kevised Statutes or some other offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Defendant argues that the trial courts erroneously denied his motion to dismiss the complaint. He argued on the motion that the complaint was defective because it did not allege that the police officer had detained him for a suspected violation of another offense when he issued the summons and complaint for the seat belt offense. He also argues on appeal that the evidence does not support the conviction. We affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">The summons and complaint was issued on a form prescribed by the Administrative Director of the Courts as required by <em>R. </em>7:6-1. It describes the offense as \u201cfailure to wear seat belt\u201d and refers to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-76.2f as the statute violated. That statute provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-8\">... [E]ach driver and front seat passenger of a passenger automobile operated on a street or highway in the State shall wear a properly adjusted and fastened safety seat belt system as defined by Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 209.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">The complaint gave defendant adequate notice of the charge. It was not defective. Defendant\u2019s motion was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The provision addresses the authority of an officer to act, <em>ie., </em>an officer has no authority to issue a summons to a driver for the seat belt violation unless the officer had detained the driver on suspicion of committing another offense. The provision does not add elements to the offense of operating an automobile without wearing a seat belt.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-11\">The provision is like the rule that a police officer has no authority to conduct a search unless there is probable cause, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>like a defense under the Code of Criminal Justice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In those instances, the issue is not judicially addressable unless and until the defendant moves to suppress, <em>R. </em>3:5-7, or the defendant raises the defense and there is \u201cany evidence\u201d to support it, <em>State v. Kelly, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>178, 200, 478 A.2d 364 (1984). Defendant here did not raise the issue at trial. He limited his motion to what he asserted was a deficiency in the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">We turn to the evidence at trial. The arresting officer and defendant were the only witnesses. The officer testified that he observed defendant repeatedly move back and forth from his lane over onto part of the oncoming lane of traffic apparently awaiting a propitious moment to pass an automobile he was following. Eventually he passed the vehicle but in doing so exceeded the speed limit. The officer thereupon turned on his overhead lights and had defendant pull over because of these moving violations. He testified that as he walked over to defendant, who was sitting in the driver\u2019s seat,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-6\">I \u2014 I advised him why he was stopped and at that time I also noticed that he wasn\u2019t wearing a seat belt and I \u2014 and I made mention of that to him of which he\u2014 he made a response, a rather profane response, and with all due respect to the Court I won\u2019t repeat in its entirety, but he did say \u2014 now I\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m looking at the back of my summons now. \u201cHe forgot, he was coming from the State of Maine and \u2014 and they don\u2019t have to wear seat belts in Maine.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The officer issued a summons and complaint for only the seat belt violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">Defendant did not contradict the officer\u2019s testimony. Significantly, he did not deny that the officer told him that he was being detained because of the traffic violations. Also, he acknowledged that he had just come from Maine. However, he testified that he was wearing the seat belt while operating his automobile. He claimed that when he brought his vehicle to a stop, he removed the belt in order to reach behind his seat to retrieve a carton of milk to quench his thirst:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Right \u2014 he was \u2014 that\u2019s true, I did \u2014 I was coming from Maine, I did release my seat belt, I \u2014 I released my seat belt to get some milk in back of the seat, okay. I was reaching down, I got it up and then he \u2014 he\u2014then he drove in back of me with his lights on \u2014 flashing light and that\u2019s \u2014 okay, and then he \u2014 he\u2014I\u2014then I pulled over to the side and he came over to ask for the identification.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">Both the municipal court judge and the Law Division judge discredited defendant and found him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\">We must sustain the judges\u2019 findings because they \u201ccould reasonably have been reached on sufficient credible evidence present in the record.\u201d <em>State v. Johnson, </em>42 <em>N.J. </em>146, 162, 199 A.2d 809 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-9\">The Code does not apply to motor vehicle offenses. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:l-14k.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
