Judge Weiss considered the impact of the Tort Claims Act \u201c[ajssuming <em>arguendo\u201d </em>that summary judgment was not otherwise appropriate. 261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 480, 619 A.2d 262. He found the claims barred thereunder by virtue of the \u201cdiscretionary acts\u201d immunity, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-2, the \u201cexecution or enforcement of laws\u201d immunity, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-3, and the \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d immunity, <em>N.J.S.A </em>59:3-10. <em>Id. </em>at 480-81, 619 A.2d 262. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>agree with his conclusion that the acts were \u201cdiscretionary,\u201d <em>see Kolitch v. Lindedahl, </em>100 <em>N.J. </em>485, 495-96, 497 A.2d 183 (1985); <em>Costa v. Josey, </em>83 <em>N.J. </em>49, 55, 415 A.2d 337 (1980). We therefore need not decide if the defendants\u2019 conduct relative to the acquisition, of real property, under <em>N.J.S.A, </em>27:23-5(j), involves \u201cexecution or enforcement of laws\u201d within the meaning of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-3. Nor need we consider whether defendants\u2019 communications necessarily embodied a \u201cmisrepresentation,\u201d as opposed to a \u201crepresentation\u201d of then-present fact or intent, for purposes of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>59:3-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Plaintiff also appeals from the dismissal of the first count of its amended complaint seeking damages for inverse condemnation, which is not a subject of the published opinion. Plaintiff contends that the Turnpike Authority \u201caccomplished a temporary inverse taking of 8.74 acres\u201d of plaintiffs property, and that the \u201cinverse taking ... was a substantial factor in bringing about National\u2019s loss.\u201d It therefore challenges the June 23, 1993 summary judgment for defendants entered on count one.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Before the Turnpike Authority announced its intention to take plaintiffs property, plaintiff had obtained site plan approval and a building permit to build a twelve screen theatre. The parties stipulated that \u201c[o]n or before May 5, 1985, Plaintiff commenced construction of a 12 screen indoor theatre complex on the 18.74 acre tract of the former site of the Newark Drive-In Theatre.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">According to plaintiff, on May 15,1985 it was informally advised by defendants that its entire 18.74 acre tract would probably be condemned, but as a result of discussions commencing on May 30, 1985 plaintiff was told that only 8.74 acres would be taken.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>subsequent written communications between the parties are detailed in Judge Weiss\u2019s opinion, 261 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 471-72, 619 A.2d 262. Defendants advised plaintiff not to develop the property in any way, or to do so without expectation of compensation for the enhanced value. According to the parties\u2019 stipulation, \u201c[o]n or before September 16,1985\u201d plaintiff suspended construction of the twelve theatre complex and commenced \u201cseeking to obtain approval for construction of a 10 screen indoor theatre complex on approximately 10 acres of the site.\u201d In essence, plaintiff declined to follow the defendants\u2019 advice and proceeded with its scaled down construction plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">Plaintiff claims it did not construct on the portion of the property which the Turnpike actually threatened to condemn. It asserts that its decision to seek and obtain, as it did in December 1985, revised site plan approval for a scaled down ten screen theatre on ten acres of its property was premised on communications from defendant Authority relative to the property actually to be taken. Its efforts to build, however, were delayed while a necessary sanitary landfill disruption permit authorizing the construction was obtained from the Department of Environmental Protection and Energy.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The permit was not obtained until September 7, 1990, after which actual construction of the ten theatre complex was commenced. In the interim, in February 1990 the Turnpike Authority abandoned its plans for the widening project which included the need to condemn plaintiffs property, and on March 14, 1990 the Authority notified plaintiff to that effect. Plaintiff ultimately obtained permits to complete construction of a twelve theatre complex on the balance of the 18.74 acre tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Before us, plaintiff does not contend that the defendants\u2019 action or inaction constituted a \u201ctaking\u201d of the entire tract until the Authority\u2019s final decision was rendered. Plaintiff seeks no compensation for the ten acres on which the ten screen complex was ultimately constructed or for any delay incident to its construction. Rather, plaintiff asserts that there was an inverse condemnation of 8.74 acres, that portion of the parcel plaintiff essentially abandoned as a result of the Turnpike\u2019s communications. Plaintiff so argues notwithstanding that defendants\u2019 written communications advising plaintiff not to develop its property pending finalization of the Authority\u2019s plans were not so limited.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-4\">Plaintiff contends there are facts which reflect actual threats affecting its beneficial use of this portion of the property and points out that our Supreme Court has recognized that there can be a \u201cnon-invasive\u201d taking which may occur when there is an \u201c \u2018actual <em>or threatened </em>interference with the use of the property of such a permanent, serious or continuing nature to justify the conclusion that a \u2018taking1 had occurred.\u2019 \u201d <em>Littman v. Gimello, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>154, 166, 557 A.2d 314 (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied </em>493 <em>U.S. </em>934, 110 <em>S.Ct. </em>324, 107 L.Ed.2d 314 (1989), quoting <em>Kingston East Realty Co. v. State of N.J., </em>133 <em>N.J.Super. </em>234, 240, 336 A.2d 40 (App.Div.1975). <em>See also Washington Market Enterprises, Inc. v. City of Trenton, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>107, 122, 343 A.2d 408 (1975) (\u201cthe threat of condemnation\u201d can constitute a taking where it \u201chas had such a substantial effect as to destroy the beneficial use that a landowner has made of his property\u201d). But <em>Littman </em>also recognized that \u201c[government plans ordinarily do not constitute invasion or taking of property.\u201d <em>Littman v. Gimello, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 161, 557 A.2d 314, citing <em>Danforth v. United States, </em>308 <em>U.S. </em>271, 60 <em>S.Ct. </em>231, 84 <em>L.Ed. </em>240 (1939).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\"><em>Littman </em>dealt with declarations that plaintiffs\u2019 properties were potential sites for a hazardous-waste facility. Plaintiffs claimed that a \u201ctaking\u201d occurred because of the delays incident to the testing and evaluation process before ultimate site selection was made. The Court declined under the circumstances to deal with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>\u201cspeculative and hypothetical questions\u201d with respect to governmental practices which delay decisions \u201cconcerning condemnation for an excessively long period of time\u201d so as to constitute inverse condemnation. <em>Littman v. Gimello, supra, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>at 168-69, 557 A.2d 314. The Court upheld the dismissal of plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">As this plaintiff points out, <em>Littman </em>in essence concluded that the claims therein were premature and the Court pointed out that \u201c[i]f the property is not condemned and no decision is made concerning condemnation for an excessively long period of time, then plaintiffs can renew their inverse condemnation claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 169, 557 A.2d 314. As plaintiff further develops, here the delay of a final decision was much longer and its property was not deemed merely a potential site subject to the testing required for a hazardous waste facility. However, we nevertheless conclude that this record does not warrant consideration of plaintiffs legal contentions regarding the scope of a \u201cnoninvasive\u201d or inverse taking, nor even permits reversal for a trial on whether there was such a taking. The record before us simply presents no disputed issue of material fact relevant to the impact of the defendants\u2019 conduct. The undisputed critical facts suggest that plaintiff\u2019s beneficial use of its property was not, in reality, affected by the Turnpike\u2019s delay in formulating its decision making. As Judge Weiss noted in dismissing the first count:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-7\">The uneontradicted record in this case is that Plaintiff applied for a sanitary disruption permit which was not obtained until September 7th, 1990, some six months after the Turnpike announced its abandonment of any proposed expansion of the highway where Plaintiffs property is located. Thus, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that it would have been able to use its property prior to September 7th, 1990, even without the action of the Turnpike. Clearly, the action of <em>the </em>Turnpike, assuming arguendo that it could be considered an inhibition of Plaintiffs right to use its property, was not the proximate cause of any delay in construction by the Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">This is true with respect to the 8.74 acre parcel as well as the balance of the tract.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> Plaintiff says that at the May 30, 1985 meeting it \"tried to limit the taking to the boundaries of the proposed interchange, a parcel of about 8.74 acres adjoining the Turnpike.\" Plaintiff also points to a memorandum to defendant Olarsch from the Turnpike's Supervising Engineer, dated July 3, 1985, indicating that \"the area of taking is about 8.8 acres.\" Plaintiff asserts that subsequent to the May 30 meeting \"the Authority indicated that it required only a part of National's property, namely the indicated parcel,\u201d citing a certification of its vice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>president accompanying the recitation of facts in a trial court brief and the July 3, 1985 memo.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\"> Apparently the need for such permits was called to plaintiff\u2019s attention by the Turnpike Authority. Plaintiff commenced the application process in July 1986. A \"minor\u201d sanitary landfill disruption permit which authorized environmental testing was issued in 1988.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
