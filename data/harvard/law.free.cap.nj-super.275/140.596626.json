We conclude, however, that the conviction for possession of a firearm for an unlawful purpose (count eight) must merge into the murder conviction. In reaching our disposition, we develop only the issues and related facts which warrant extended discussion. <em>R. </em>2:11 \u2014 3(e)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-18\">Defendant was employed by Delta Plastics Co. in Newark as a senior maintenance mechanic. The homicide victim, Galo Herrera, was a night shift supervisor and brother of Delta\u2019s day shift production manager. Defendant had a poor relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>Herrera brothers. Defendant also had problems with his marriage. The evidence revealed that defendant had threatened his wife on numerous occasions in the months before the shooting of Herrera. Defendant was apparently motivated, in part, by a belief that his wife was having an affair with Ed Smith, Delta\u2019s plant manager and defendant\u2019s supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Before Herrera was shot, defendant threatened to kill his wife, Smith, and the victim\u2019s brother who had a close working relationship with Smith. Approximately one week before the homicide, defendant told his daughter that he wanted to kill Galo Herrera. Defendant also told his wife that he was going to kill someone at work.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Defendant had a history of mental illness. He apparently believed that co-workers were entering his home at night, with his wife\u2019s assistance, shooting him with needles, molesting his daughter and forcing him to engage in oral sex. Defendant also believed his co-workers were putting things into his food at work, drugging his coffee and listening in on his telephone calls.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">About a month before Herrera\u2019s death defendant attempted to shoot his wife. On that occasion (which is the subject of count three), defendant took his wife from the house where his children were watching and dragged her into the garage. When his wife denied cheating on him, defendant called her \u201ca liar\u201d and shot twice in her direction. He subsequently explained that the shots constituted a warning and that he was giving her a \u201cbreak\u201d by not killing her then \u201cbecause of the kids.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">At another time before the shooting of Herrera, defendant told his wife that, if she loved him, she would \u201cprove to him that [she] didn\u2019t have anything to do with what was going on,\u201d by killing Smith. Defendant offered his gun for that purpose, and when she declined to do so, defendant became angry. Defendant\u2019s wife testified that during this period defendant would not let her sleep at night and threatened her with his gun because of the perceived infidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>On March 15, 1989, the date of the homicide, defendant left for work early and told his wife that he did not want their children going to school that day. He instructed her to take the children to his mother\u2019s house. Defendant took his gun to work with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Defendant arrived at work about 7:00 a.m. and seated himself at the supervisor\u2019s desk. When Herrera asked defendant to get up from the desk, defendant grabbed decedent\u2019s buttocks, and they both laughed. Dr. Robert Latimer, defendant\u2019s forensic psychiatrist, testified that defendant told him that \u201cwhen I grabbed his ass [Herrera] said stop or I\u2019ll screw you in the mouth.\u201d Dr. Latimer opined that this exchange could have triggered defendant\u2019s homicidal reaction. Defendant immediately left the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">Defendant called his wife around 8:08 a.m. from a pay telephone on the New Jersey Turnpike. Defendant again directed his wife to take the children to his mother\u2019s house. Defendant also telephoned the plant and reported that he was sick. Thereafter, defendant again called his wife and told her that his head was \u201cbothering\u201d him and that \u201che couldn\u2019t take it any more.\u201d Herrera\u2019s brother found decedent in his car in the Delta employee parking lot later that morning.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">As defendant was observed leaving the plant around the time Herrera\u2019s shift ended and his began, defendant became an immediate suspect. The police conducted a search of defendant\u2019s home, with his wife\u2019s consent, which led to the discovery of bullets in defendant\u2019s nightstand which matched one found near Herrera\u2019s car. It was also determined that a bullet hole discovered in defendant\u2019s garage (presumably from the incident where defendant shot at his wife there) was made by a small caliber bullet similar to that taken from Herrera\u2019s body.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-9\">The day after Herrera\u2019s death, defendant\u2019s wife visited him at the jail. Defendant told her she had told the police \u201ctoo much\u201d and threatened to have her killed if she said \u201canything else.\u201d Defendant\u2019s wife also testified that defendant told her that he threw the gun away.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>In August 1989 defendant\u2019s wife filed for divorce. That month she told police that defendant had owned a gun and about his brother\u2019s efforts to remove the bullets from the garage wall on the day of the murder. She also spoke with a detective and appeared in the grand jury. Her cooperation apparently resulted in the superseding indictment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant and his wife were divorced by the time of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Defendant did not testify at the trial. He presented an insanity defense through Dr. Latimer who testified that defendant suffered from \u201ca mild form of dementia,\u201d \u201cbizarre delusions of a persecutory and paranoid nature,\u201d and \u201corganic delusional syndrome.\u201d Latimer concluded that defendant was insane, was unable to understand what he did, and could not distinguish between right and wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">The State\u2019s forensic expert, Dr. Steven Simring, diagnosed defendant as \u201cmalingering,\u201d faking symptoms of mental illness. While he thought defendant suffered from a personality disorder and was a substance abuser, Dr. Simring found \u201cno evidence of organic brain disorder\u201d or schizophrenia. The jury rejected an insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Defendant contends that the joinder of counts one through three (involving acts against his wife occurring before the murder of Herrera on March 15,1989) was improper and that the denial of his motion to sever counts one through three from count six requires reversal. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">Joinder is permissive under <em>R. </em>3:7-6 \u201cif the offenses charged are of the same or similar character or are based on the same act or transaction or on two or more acts or transactions connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan.\u201d However, a defendant can obtain a severance of counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>pursuant to <em>R. </em>3:15-2, when the joinder of offenses is prejudicial, such as when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">1. he may become embarrassed or confounded in presenting separate defenses; 2. the jury may use the evidence of one of the crimes charged to infer a criminal disposition on the part of the defendant from which is found his guilt of the other crime or crimes charged; or 3. the jury may cumulate the evidence of the various crimes charged and find guilt when, if considered separately, it would not so find. A less tangible, but perhaps equally persuasive, element of prejudice may reside in a latent feeling of hostility engendered by the charging of several crimes as distinct from only one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-7\"><em>[State v. Reldan, </em>167 <em>N.J.Super. </em>595, 598, 401 A.2d 563 (Law Div.1979) (quoting <em>Drew v. United States, </em>331 F.2d 85, 88 (D.C.Cir.1964)), <em>aff'd o.b. </em>on this issue, but <em>rev\u2019d o.g. </em>185 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 505-06, 449 A.2d 1317 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>543, 453 A.2d 862 (1982) ].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The decision on whether to grant a severance generally \u201crests within the trial court\u2019s sound discretion and is entitled to great deference on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>118 <em>N.J. </em>595, 603, 573 A.2d 886 (1990) (severance of defendants); <em>see also State v. Pitts, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>580, 601, 562 A.2d 1320 (1989); <em>State v. Moore, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>239, 273-74, 550 A.2d 117 (1988). \u201cMoreover, courts have held that \u2018the mere claim that prejudice will attach\u2019 is not sufficient to support a motion for severance, and require some showing that the joinder of offenses would prejudice the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 274, 550 A.2d 117, quoting <em>State v. Kent, </em>173 <em>N.J.Super. </em>215, 220, 418 A.2d 1322 (App.Div.1980). <em>See also State v. Manney, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>362, 368, 140 A.2d 74 (1958) (\u201cmere possibility of such harm is not enough to bar joinder or consolidation; if it were, nothing would remain of the rule\u201d). Hence, \u201c[a] critical inquiry\u201d in a case like this \u201cis whether, assuming the charges were tried separately, evidence of the offenses sought to be severed would be admissible under <em>Evid.Rule </em>55<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in the trial of the remaining charges\u201d <em>(State v. Pitts, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 601-02, 562 A.2d 1320; <em>see also State v. Oliver, </em>133 <em>N.J. </em>141, 150-51, 627 A.2d 144 (1993); <em>State v. Moore, supra, </em>113 <em>N.J. </em>at 274, 550 A.2d 117), and defendant bears the burden of demonstrating prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 273, 550 A.2d 117.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>The motion judge denied a severance because she felt the prior crimes against defendant\u2019s wife (counts one through three) would be \u201cevidential of the defendant\u2019s motive, plan and intent\u201d in committing the homicide.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In this respect the judge\u2019s ruling cannot be said to constitute an abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Pitts, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 599-602, 562 A.2d 1320 (counts resulting from the threats defendant made two days before the murder not severed from the murder; prior crimes admissible as relevant to defendant\u2019s state of mind, intent and motive in killing the decedents).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Here, defendant believed that his wife was conspiring with his co-employees and was having an affair with at least one of them. Further, defendant accused his wife of permitting his co-workers into their house at night, in part, to engage in oral sex. Defendant\u2019s forensic expert, Dr. Latimer, related the homicidal act to the incident on the morning of the murder when defendant pinched decedent\u2019s buttocks and decedent responded that defendant probably wanted to engage in oral sex. Further, defendant\u2019s beliefs about the relationship between his wife and his co-workers account for his conduct both before and at the time of the murder. Thus, we cannot conclude under these circumstances that the joinder was improper <em>(State v. Baker, </em>49 <em>N.J. </em>103, 104-105, 228 A.2d 339, <em>cert. denied </em>389 <em>U.S. </em>868, 88 <em>S.Ct. </em>141, 19 <em>L.Ed. </em>144 (1967); <em>United States v. Park, </em>531 F.2d 754, 760-62 (5th Cir. 1976)), or that the denial of the motion to sever constituted error. <em>State v. Pitts, supra, </em>116 <em>N.J. </em>at 603, 562 A.2d 1320. Moreover, the judge expressly instructed the jury to \u201c[cjonsider each count of the indictment separately, distinctly, and independently,\u201d and that evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt on one count did not satisfy the State\u2019s burden of proof on any other count or that because he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>committed one offense he probably committed another.' <em>Ibid, </em>at 603, 562 A.2d 1320. We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in permitting defendant\u2019s wife to testify regarding communications made by defendant to her during their marriage. Specifically, defendant contends that the testimony of his wife in this respect was barred by <em>Evid.R. </em>28 as it existed at the time of trial. Defendant argues that a new trial is necessary because of the improper admission of her testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">At the time of trial, <em>Evid.R. </em>28, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22, provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\">No person shall disclose any communication made in confidence between such person and his or her spouse unless both shall consent to the disclosure or <em>unless the communication is relevant to an issue in an action between them or in a criminal action or proceeding </em>\u2014 coming <em>unthin Rule </em>23(2).... A communication between spouses while living separate and apart under a divorce from bed and board shall not be a privileged communication. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">This privilege applied to all confidential communications made between spouses while married, even if the couple was no longer married at the time of trial. Biunno, <em>Current N.J. Rules of Evidence, </em>comment 1 to <em>Evid.R. </em>28 (1993). Hence, even though defendant and his wife were divorced before the trial began,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant contends the Rule barred the introduction, over defendant\u2019s objection, of his confidential statements made to his wife during their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">After defendant\u2019s trial was concluded, <em>Evid.R. 28 </em>(now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>509), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-22, was amended, by <em>L. </em>1992, c. 142, effective on November 17, 1992. <em>See State v. Szemple, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 640 A.2d 817 (1994). The rule, as amended, now provides <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>that communications made \u201cin confidence\u201d between spouses shall not be disclosed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">unless both shall consent to the disclosure or unless the communication is relevant to an issue in an action between them or <em>in a criminal action or proceeding in which either spouse consents to the disclosure, </em>or in a criminal action or proceeding coming within Rule 23(2). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The State argues that the amended rule of evidence controls on this appeal. It is true that the amended rule was made effective immediately and applies \u201cto all criminal actions regardless of the date on which the offense was committed or the action initiated,\u201d <em>L. </em>1992, c. 142, \u00a7 8, but here the trial was concluded before the effective date of the legislation. <em>See generally, R.S. v. Knighton, </em>125 <em>N.J. </em>79, 97, 592 A.2d 1157 (1991); <em>State v. Molnar, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>475, 410 A.2d 37 (1980). It is also true that in <em>State v. Szemple, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>98, 104, 622 A.2d 248 (App.Div.1993), <em>aff'd </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>406, 640 A.2d 817 (1994), we noted that a privileged \u201ccommunication may <em>now </em>be disclosed by the receiving spouse without restriction and thus it is no longer so that the communication is \u2018once privileged, always privileged.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis added.) The Supreme Court subsequently considered only the 1992 version of the rule, referring to the provision concerning application \u201cto all criminal actions.\u201d 263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 103, 622 A.2d at 250. However, <em>Szemple </em>was an interlocutory appeal involving a case mistried before conclusion which will have to be retried under the new rule. <em>Id. </em>at 99, 622 A.2d at 248.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">It is further true that we must recognize that any reversal on this ground alone may be only academic because upon remand the challenged testimony would now be admissible under the amended rule. <em>See State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 146, 578 A.2d 364 (1990). Nevertheless, as the case was tried under the former <em>Evid.R. </em>28, we will assume that we cannot retroactively apply a new rule of law against a criminal defendant already convicted. In any event, we need not decide the issue in light of our disposition, and we therefore need not decide if the marital privilege is merely a rule of evidence and procedural, or has substantive implications. <em>Compare R.S. v. Knighton, supra </em>(dealing with <em>Evid.R. </em>63(33)).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>We nevertheless hold that the trial court properly concluded, under <em>Evid.R. </em>28 as it then existed, that the testimony of defendant\u2019s wife regarding the confidential communications was admissible. The rule expressly provided that the prohibition against confidential disclosures did not apply to a \u201ccriminal action or proceeding coming within Rule 23(2),\u201d and <em>Evid.R. </em>23(2) (now <em>N.J.R.E. </em>501), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-17, then provided that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">The spouse of the accused in a criminal action shall not testify in such action except to prove the fact of marriage unless (a) such spouse and the accused shall both consent, or (b) <em>the accused is charged with an offense against the spotise, a child of the accused or of the spouse, or a child to whom the accused or the spouse stands in the place of a parent, </em>or (c) such spouse is the complainant. (Emphasis added.) <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">The trial court admitted defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s testimony after noting that <em>Evid.R. 28 </em>was made subject by its terms to <em>EvidR. </em>23(2), and concluding that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">I\u2019m satisfied that the wife was an intended victim of sufficiently related conduct to try this ease altogether and certainly, the crimes committed against the wife are part and parcel of and relevant to show the motive and perhaps also state of mind of and two of the elements here, intent and knowledge on the part of the defendant in committing the homicide that he is accused of committing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">I don\u2019t feel that any of the statements that have been put forth in the proffer are properly within the marital privilege under Evidence Rule 28. I think that they are all hopelessly intertwined for the reasons I stated. So I don\u2019t feel that the marital privilege under Evidence Rule 28 is going to bar the State from introducing any of this testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">We agree with the judge\u2019s analysis, although we emphasize that we do not hold that the joinder of offenses can be perfected merely to \u201cbootstrap\u201d the admissibility of a marital communication in a prosecution in which a non-spouse is the victim or complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">In <em>State v. Briley, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>498, 501, 251 A.2d 442 (1969), defendant was charged with atrocious assault and battery of his wife and the murder of her male friend. After defendant found his wife sitting in a car at a motel with the murder victim, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>defendant shot the victim, then chased his wife and struck her with the gun. <em>Id. </em>at 502-03, 251 A.2d 442. Defendant claimed \u201cthat his wife should not have been allowed to testify against him\u201d in the murder prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 504, 251 A.2d 442. In finding her testimony admissible, \u2022 the Court noted that <em>Evid.R. </em>23(2) provided that the spouse of the accused shall not testify in a criminal action \u201cunless ... the accused is charged with an offense against the spouse____\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 506, 251 A.2d 442, and that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-6\">Sensibly construed this language does not restrict the testimony of a wife against a husband to the particular criminal action in which she alone is the victim of his crime. If there is a single criminal event in which she and others are targets or victims of the husband\u2019s criminal conduct in the totality of the integrated incident and formal charges are made against the husband for some or all the offenses committed (one of which charges is for an offense against the spouse), the wife should be a competent and compellable witness against her husband at the trial of all the cases regardless of whether they are tried separately or in one proceeding. And, in this connection, it should be immaterial that the offense against the wife does not reach the same dimensions of criminality as it does against the third-party victim.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-7\"><em>[State v. Briley, supra, </em>53 <em>N.J. </em>at 506-07, 251 A.2d 442.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">We recognize that in <em>Briley </em>the criminal acts were simultaneous in time and place, but the Court found no abuse of discretion in the trial judge\u2019s denial of a motion to sever offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 503, 251 A.2d 442.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">Defendant argues that <em>Briley </em>should be narrowly read so that it applies only to a unitary criminal event in which the spouse and others are victims of defendant\u2019s simultaneous criminal actions. However, we reject such a narrow reading of <em>Briley </em>in light of our Supreme Court\u2019s recent reminder in <em>State v. Szemple, supra, </em>263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 101, 622 A.2d at 249 that \u201cprivileges are to be narrowly construed\u201d and \u201care accepted only to the extent that they outweigh the public interest in the search for the truth.\u201d In <em>Szemple, </em>the Supreme Court unanimously held admissible against a husband a confidential marital communication discovered by the wife\u2019s father and delivered by him to the prosecutor. 263 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 101, 622 A.2d at 249. Promotion of the privilege as necessary for harmony between spouses, neither of whom desired its admission, was not dispositive. We are, therefore, satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>that, in light of the proper joinder of offenses, the testimony was admissible on all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">We find it unnecessary to detail defendant\u2019s other claims of error addressed to the conviction. Suffice it to say that we find no basis for reversal either because there was no undue prejudice by any inappropriate prosecutorial comment, no abuse of discretion by the trial judge in making rulings on discretionary applications, and no improper presentation before the jury not remedied by a curative instruction. We note that there apparently was a discovery rule violation with respect to the failure to provide a complete accounting of all the wife\u2019s pretrial statements known to the prosecutor. <em>See R. </em>3:13-3(a)(8),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> -3(f). However, as evidenced by our lengthy discussion concerning the marital privilege, defendant was fully aware that his wife was communicating with the prosecutor and of the essence of those communications. There was no suggestion at the time that most of the comments attributable to defendant\u2019s wife were unknown to the defense before she testified. Moreover, it appears undisputed that any failure to provide discovery was inadvertent, that the witness did not decline to speak with the defense, and that she did, in fact, talk with defendant\u2019s attorney and investigator long before she testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-9\">Defendant argues that his convictions for unlawful possession of a weapon and murder should merge and that his sentence was otherwise excessive. We reject the latter contention, <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number><em>State v. Ghertler, </em>114 <em>N.J. </em>383, 388, 555 A.2d 553 (1989); <em>State v. Roth, </em>95 <em>N.J. </em>334, 363-65, 471 A.2d 370 (1984), but agree with the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">The trial court sentenced defendant to a life term, with thirty-years to be served before parole eligibility, on the murder conviction. The judge merged count seven (possession of a weapon without a permit) into count eight (possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and defendant was sentenced thereon to a concurrent ten year term of imprisonment, four years of which are to be served without parole. Defendant contends that his conviction for unlawful possession of a weapon should have merged with the murder because there is no evidence that defendant had a broader unlawful purpose than the homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The concept of merger is constitutionally based and is designed to prevent multiple punishment for a single crime. <em>State v. Truglia, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>513, 522, 480 A.2d 912 (1984). <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:1-8a(1) codifies the test for merger set forth in <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 <em>U.S. </em>299, 52 <em>S.Ct. </em>180, 76 <em>L.Ed. </em>306 (1932), but our Supreme Court has followed a more \u201cflexible approach.\u201d <em>See e.g., State v. Cole, </em>120 <em>N.J. </em>321, 327, 576 A.2d 864 (1990); <em>State v. Miller, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>112, 116-18, 527 A.2d 1362 (1987); <em>State v. Davis, </em>68 <em>N.J. </em>69, 81, 342 A.2d 841 (1975). Moreover, while the United States Supreme Court has held that legislative intent controls with respect to the issue of multiple punishment in a single criminal prosecution and while our Supreme Court has held that our constitutional double jeopardy protection is co-extensive with the Fifth Amendment to the federal constitution, our Supreme Court has emphasized that its prior holdings on co-extensivity have been in the context of multiple prosecutions, not multiple punishment. <em>See State v. Dillihay, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>42, 47, 601 A.2d 1149 (1992); <em>State v. Churchdale Leasing, Inc., </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>83, 107-08, 557 A.2d 277 (1989); <em>State v. Capak, </em>271 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 400-403, 638 A.2d 918 (App.Div.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>We can take judicial notice that no issue consumes more of our time than merger, and none is more time consuming or perplexing than the question of merger with respect to possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose and a substantive offense committed with that weapon. <em>See e.g., State v. Wilson, </em>128 <em>N.J. </em>233, 237, 247, 607 A.2d 1289 (1992); <em>State v. Truglia, supra, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>at 521, 480 A.2d 912; <em>State v. Nutter, </em>258 <em>N.J.Super. </em>41, 45-46, 59, 609 A.2d 65 (App.Div.1992); <em>State v. Russo, </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>383, 412, 579 A.2d 834 (App.Div.1990); <em>State v. Jones, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>562, 568-70, 517 A.2d 1219 (App.Div.1986); <em>State v. Johnson, </em>203 <em>N.J.Super. </em>127, 136, 495 A.2d 1367 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>312, 508 A.2d 195 (1985). There is the related question of the impact of a concurrent, as opposed to a consecutive, sentence <em>(State v. Bowens, </em>108 <em>N.J. </em>622, 638-39, 532 A.2d 215 (1987)), although the mere fact a concurrent sentence is imposed does not avoid the necessity of reviewing that conviction. <em>State v. Lewis, </em>93 <em>N.J.Super. </em>212, 213, 225 A.2d 582 (App.Div.1966) (on remand from the Supreme Court), <em>cert. denied </em>386 <em>U.S. </em>986, 87 <em>S.Ct. </em>1297, 18 L.Ed.2d 238 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In <em>State v. Williams, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>30, 35, 516 A.2d 265 (App.Div.1986), <em>certif. denied </em>107 <em>N.J, </em>104, 526 A.2d 177 (1987), we endeavored to announce a workable test for deciding whether convictions for possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose should merge with the substantive offense. We held that to avoid merger four factors must be present:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">(1) the defendant must have been charged in the indictment with possession of the weapon with a broader unlawful purpose, either generally or specifically, than using the weapon to kill or assault the victim of the greater offense, (2) the evidence must support a finding that the defendant had a broader unlawful purpose, (3) the judge must have instructed the jury of the difference between possession with the specific unlawful purpose of using the weapon against the victim of the greater offense and a broader unlawful purpose and (4) the verdict must express the jury\u2019s conclusion that the defendant had a broader unlawful purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\"><em>[State v. Williams, supra, </em>213 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 36, 516 A.2d 265.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">We further stated that in order to prevent merger,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARF\">a judge should ask the jury to determine by separate verdicts whether the possession was solely with the specific unlawful purpose to use the weapon against the victim of the greater offense or with a broader unlawful purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\"><em>[Id. </em>at 37, 516 A.2d 265.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>While there have been numerous cases since <em>Williams, </em>including <em>State v. Wilson, supra, </em>in the Supreme Court, and many opinions of this court in which the absence of a special verdict was not dispositive, we hold that in the absence of a special verdict, authorized by <em>B. </em>3:19-1 (b), by which the jury finds that the unlawful purpose is broader than the substantive offense or offenses on which defendant is convicted,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the possession of a weapon with an unlawful purpose conviction must merge into the substantive offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">Two reasons have been advanced over the years to justify non-merger. First, the State contends that the number of convictions is significant for the release determination by the Parole Board, and, second, that the number of convictions may be significant in the future at the time of sentencing if defendant is convicted of another offense. These factors simply do not apply when defendant is sentenced to the custody of the Department of Corrections for thirty or more \u201creal\u201d years.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Moreover, even if defendant is convicted again, the number of convictions resulting in sentencing at a single prior occasion is never relevant for purposes of consideration of a discretionary extended term for a later offense. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-3a. In fact, the able Deputy Attorney General who argued this case for the State aeknowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>edged that merger or non-merger of count eight has absolutely no practical impact in this ease. That being so, we need not comb the nine days of trial transcripts in an effort to decide if there may have been an unlawful purpose on the day alleged in count eight beyond the murder for which defendant was convicted. Here the murder was the only crime of which defendant remained convicted for the date of the offense in question. Accordingly, we hold that count eight shall merge into count six.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">The conviction on count eight is vacated. The judgment in all other respects is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b174-8\">The indictment superseded a prior indictment which embodied only the March 15, 1989 offenses. Among his pretrial motions, defendant moved to dismiss the superseding indictment or sever certain counts thereof because they were \"unrelated\" and because the joinder was attempted by the prosecutor to secure evidence through defendant\u2019s wife which would otherwise be admissible only on charges with respect to which she was the victim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-9\"> The verdict and verdict sheet reflect \"not guilty\u201d verdicts on the lesser-included charges of aggravated, reckless and passion/provocation manslaughter on the murder count. It appears in context that these decisions were noted in light of the jury\u2019s finding that defendant was guilty of the greatest offense. Defendant does not argue otherwise before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-10\"> Ms. Lado also spoke with defense counsel and her investigator.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-9\"> Evid.R. 55 governed at the time of trial but has been replaced by <em>NJ.R.E. </em>404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-6\"> The motion judge also declined to sever counts nine, ten and eleven from the murder charged in count six, but defendant does not contest that ruling before us. Count eleven charged defendant's brother with hindering apprehension, but he was not tried with defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b181-12\"> Defendant relies on <em>Evid.R. </em>28. He apparently accepts the view that the pretrial divorce precluded any objection under <em>Evid.R. </em>23(2) to her testimony generally. <em>Biunno, supra, </em>comment 1 to <em>Evid.R. </em>28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\"> <em>L. </em>1992, <em>c. </em>142, also amended <em>Evid.R. </em>23(2), so as to permit a person to consent to testify against his or her spouse without the consent of the other.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b185-10\"> The fact that the prosecutor in his opening referred to a statement not supplied in discovery is not dispositive. The particular comment which gave rise to a motion for mistrial, and which the judge told the jury was not evidence, was never the subject of testimony. We add that the record presented to us does not detail what was provided in discovery and what may have been admitted without prior presentation to the defense. In order to assert a discovery rule violation, a better record must be presented.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b186-7\"> Since there is no cross-appeal on this merger, we do not address it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b188-6\"> This is not a special interrogatory prohibited by <em>State v. Simon, </em>79 <em>N.J. </em>191, 398 A.2d 861 (1979). The jury cannot be asked to identify the unlawful purpose or for specific fact-finding, but a special verdict is acceptable. <em>See also State </em>v. <em>Hardison, </em>99 <em>N.J. </em>379, 389-391, 492 A.2d 1009 (1985). While <em>R. </em>3:19-l(b) was adopted after enactment of the Code of Criminal Justice essentially to clarify which degree of offense the jury found applicable, we see no problem with its use in this context, provided that the question addressed to the juiy is limited to an inquiry regarding whether the purpose was or was not limited to the other offense or offenses of which defendant was convicted. <em>See Report Criminal Practice Committee, </em>107 <em>N.J.L.J. </em>441, 447-48 (1981). <em>See also State v.
