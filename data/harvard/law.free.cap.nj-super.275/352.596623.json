The Board found that Ensslin \u201ccould not perform the essential duties of his position\u201d and that \u201caccommodation [to his disability] would not be feasible[.] ...\u201d While plaintiff raises several issues on appeal they can be summarized as follows: 1) whether the Township failed to schedule a departmental hearing within the time required under <em>N.J.AC. </em>4A:2-2.5(2)(d), and 2) whether the ALJ and Board erred in not considering the effect of the Law Against Discrimination (LAD), or, having done so, whether the Board erred in determining that Ensslin was unable to perform the essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>duties of police sergeant and that accommodation for his disability was not feasible.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Ensslin also appeals from the entry of summary judgment in favor of the Township which dismissed his complaint filed in the Law Division alleging that the Township\u2019s termination of his employment with the police department constituted discrimination on the basis of handicap, in violation of the LAD. In that suit Ensslin demanded reinstatement, back-pay, consequential and punitive damages, an injunction to render the police building accessible, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On appeal, Ensslin contends that the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment because there were genuine fact disputes, a <em>prima facie </em>case of handicap discrimination was made out, and there was no reasonable accommodation to Ensslin\u2019s handicap. We now consolidate the two appeals and affirm both judgments under review for the reasons stated herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In February, 1987, Ensslin was injured in a skiing accident which rendered him a paraplegic. At the time, he was employed as a police officer with the rank of sergeant in the Township. The Township gave him one year\u2019s pay, pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement, and kept him on the payroll for an additional five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">Ensslin was then served with a Preliminary Notice of Disciplinary Action, terminating him from his position as police sergeant effective August 1, 1988. On August 16, 1988, he requested a departmental hearing. However, a few days later the parties agreed to hold the hearing \u201cin abeyance\u201d pending settlement discussions. Apparently, Ensslin was subsequently offered the position of civilian dispatcher. However, when it was thought that he would have to take a competitive examination for such position, negotiations ended.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">On May 26, 1989, Ensslin filed a complaint in the Law Division, essentially alleging that his termination was based upon handicap discrimination in violation of the LAD. The first count of the complaint alleged that the Township made no attempt to reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>ably accommodate him by assigning him to administrative duties which he could perform despite his paraplegia. In count two, Ensslin alleged that the Township employed other disabled police officers, and that his discharge was a violation of his right to equal protection. In the third count of the complaint, Ensslin alleged that the Township failed to afford him a hearing on his termination, in violation of the parties\u2019 collective bargaining agreement and his right to due process. In count four, Ensslin alleged that the Township should have rendered the police building accessible to the handicap when it was remodeled.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">The departmental hearing took place on three dates between October 3rd and November 29, 1989. The hearing officer found that Ensslin was unable to perform many of the functions required of a police officer, and that accommodating his handicap would unduly burden the operation of the Township\u2019s police department. He concluded that Ensslin should be removed from his employment. As a result, a Final Notice of Disciplinary Action was issued, removing Ensslin from his position effective August 1, 1988. Ensslin appealed that decision to the Board which, in turn, referred the matter to the Office of Administrative Law as a contested case.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conducted a hearing on thirteen non-consecutive days from May 8, 1990 to November 25, 1991. On June 5, 1992, the ALJ issued her decision. The ALJ found that Ensslin was capable of performing administrative and clerical duties with only slight modifications to the work area, but was unable to intervene in physical situations, such as apprehension and securing of suspects and prisoners. One of Ensslin\u2019s duties if he were assigned to permanent duty as a desk sergeant would be to watch prisoners, including the possibility of subduing them, and rendering first aid to them as needed. The ALJ found that such tasks would be \u201cextremely difficult\u201d for Ensslin to perform. The ALJ also found that Ensslin would be unable to meet the criteria for firearms training as promulgated by the Attorney General\u2019s guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>With respect to administrative and clerical duties other than that of desk sergeant, the AL J found that there were a number of positions within the Township police department requiring administrative and clerical duties. However, each of the positions had a component that was neither administrative nor clerical, and required physical duties Ensslin could not perform. The Township conceded that if all of the administrative hours allocated to the several officers who performed them were segregated and amassed, the hours would be sufficient to fill one full-time position. However, as constituted, the Township\u2019s police department required and expected each officer, regardless of the officer\u2019s assignment, to be capable of responding to \u201cemergency situations\u201d and to be available as a reserve or \u201cback-up\u201d to fellow officers as needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">At the hearing before the ALJ, Ensslin\u2019s position essentially was that his disability, although preventing him from performing all of the functions of a police sergeant, did not prevent him from performing the essential functions of the job with reasonable accommodation. He contended that the Township had a duty to accommodate his handicap, that he could perform the essentials of the job with such accommodation, that the Township failed to observe its duty under the LAD, and, thus, that his termination was illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Ensslin\u2019s proof <em>concerning </em>his physical abilities and limitations was offered primarily through the testimony of Barbara Reuven, a Senior Physical Therapist, and Jackie Hu, an Occupational Therapist, at the Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation. Their testimony focused mainly on Ensslin\u2019s ability to perform as a desk sergeant with certain accommodations. Physical accommodations to the work area included lowering the heights of the filing cabinets and mailboxes, and raising the height of the desk to make it wheelchair accessible. Those accommodations apparently presented no problem from the Township\u2019s standpoint. However, Reuven conceded that, even with such physical accommodations, Ensslin would be unable to perform two tasks set forth in the Township\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>job description for that position: engaging in physical confrontation with prisoners so as to either prevent physical violence by or against them, and rendering aid to prisoners in medical emergencies. She conceded that both of those tasks would have to be delegated by Ensslin to another officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Chief of Police, Angelo Busacco, testified that the duties which Ensslin described he could perform were those of a civilian dispatcher, a position Ensslin was currently performing in Fort Lee. The chief maintained that a police sergeant must be able to perform all of the duties of a police officer as well as the specific physical duties attendant to the job of desk sergeant. He testified that a desk sergeant is not a sedentary position because a sergeant is basically a patrolmen with supervisory capability, who must be able to patrol, inspect operations in the field, back-up other officers, make arrests and respond to calls. He also pointed out that a police officer carries a gun, and is required to respond and take necessary action if an offense is committed whether on or off duty. Further, there was testimony that the Attorney General has strict guidelines for police officers\u2019 qualifications for carrying a firearm: the officer must fire 100 rounds from two positions, kneeling and standing. (Ensslin\u2019s testimony in this respect was that he could shoot from a standing position if placed in a standing wheelchair and could also shoot from a kneeling position, apparently if placed in that position.)</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Chief Busacco maintained that he required every police officer in his department to perform all of the functions of a police officer because the department was understaffed, and that \u201cthe delivery of emergency services to the community ... has to be both effective and efficient.\u201d He concluded that the ability to effectuate an arrest and take care of unruly suspects was a reasonable, legitimate and necessary part of being a police officer in the Township. Without those functions, the fundamental nature of the job would be changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The Board adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact, and agreed that termination was warranted. However, it modified the ALJ\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>determination to the extent that Ensslin is considered to have resigned in good standing. We now address the issues stemming from that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">Ensslin\u2019s claim that reversible error has taken place because the Township failed to provide a hearing as required by <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:2-2.5(2)(d) is without merit. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>4A:2-2.5(d) requires a departmental hearing within thirty days of the Preliminary Notice of Disciplinary Action, not within thirty days of the employee\u2019s request for a hearing. Thus, the lapse of over thirty days between Ensslin\u2019s request and the hearing did not constitute a violation of the regulation. Rather, as the ALJ found, Ensslin waived his right to a hearing within thirty days of the Preliminary Notice of Disciplinary Action when he agreed to hold the hearing \u201cin abeyance\u201d pending settlement discussions. His attorney\u2019s letter of August 18, 1989 admitted as much. In any event, procedural irregularities at the departmental level are considered \u201ccured\u201d by a subsequent plenary hearing at the agency level. <em>See Appeal of Darcy, </em>114 <em>N.J.Super. </em>454, 461, 277 A.2d 226 (App.Div. 1971) (holding that a plenary hearing before the Civil Service Commission cured any deficiencies in the procedural aspects of a prior departmental hearing).</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">Ensslin\u2019s contention that the ALJ and the Board failed to consider the provisions of the LAD is also without merit. Specifically, the ALJ phrased one of the issues presented as: \u201cwhether or not the police department has an affirmative obligation to accommodate this individual by reorganizing their personnel structure to combine all administrative-type duties which are shared by other positions into one administrative-type position which this individual would be able to perform.\u201d Further, by citing <em>Simon v. St. Louis County, Missouri, </em>735 <em>F.</em>2d 1082 (8th Cir.1984), the ALJ acknowledged the existence of a body of case law pertaining to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>discrimination against the physically handicapped, and the duty of employers with respect to reasonable accommodation, specifically in the factual context of employment as a police officer. Moreover, the Board\u2019s interpretation of the ALJ\u2019s findings, its conclusion that Ensslin could not perform \u201cthe essential duties of his position\u201d and that \u201caccommodation would not be feasible\u201d, and its citation to <em>Greenwood v. State Police Training Center, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>500, 606 A.2d 336 (1992), all reflect an appreciation of the requirements of the LAD as it pertains to termination of a physically handicapped employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The critical issue presented by this appeal, as we see it, is whether the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact are sufficiently supported by the record and, if so, whether the application of those facts to applicable principles of law justify the Board\u2019s conclusion that Ensslin was properly terminated. Despite Ensslin\u2019s argument to the contrary, we are satisfied from our review of the record that the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact were sufficiently supported by substantial credible evidence in the record. <em>Henry v. Rahway State Prison, </em>81 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579-80, 410 A.2d 686 (1980). Our standard of review also requires us to defer to the judgment of the Board in applying those facts to the relevant legal principles and reverse the Board\u2019s decision only if it is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. We may not substitute our judgment for that of the Board\u2019s so long as it has applied the correct legal principles to the facts. <em>Greenwood, supra, </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>at 513, 606 A.2d 336 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The New Jersey LAD provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">Unless it can be clearly shown that a person\u2019s handicap ... would prevent such person from performing a particular job, it is an unlawful employment practice to deny an otherwise qualified handicapped ... person the opportunity to ... maintain employment ... solely because such person is handicapped!]] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A </em>10:5-29.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Although no provision of the New Jersey LAD requires it, the regulations promulgated pursuant to the statute provide that \u201c[a]n employer must make a reasonable accommodation to the limitations of the handicapped employee ,..., unless the employer can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>hardship on the operation of its business.\u201d <em>N.J.AC. </em>13:13-2.5(b). The same regulation contains examples of the types of accommodation that an employer should consider, and also contains factors to be considered in determining whether a proposed accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the employer. Each decision concerning the fulfillment of the employer\u2019s duty must be made on a \u201ccase-by-case basis[,]\u201d <em>ibid., </em>and the decision must be consistent with the principles of general construction imposed by the Legislature. Specifically, the Legislature has provided that the LAD should not be construed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJr\">to prohibit the establishment and maintenance of bona fide occupational qualifications ..., nor to prevent the termination ... of any person who in the opinion of the employer, reasonably arrived at, is unable to perform adequately the duties of employment, nor to preclude discrimination among individuals on the basis of competence, performance, conduct or any other reasonable standards[.] ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\">[N.J.S.A 10:5-2.1.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">See <em>Jansen v. Food Circus Supermarkets, Inc., </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>363, 374, 541 A.2d 682 (1988) (providing that the LAD \u201cmust be applied sensibly with due consideration to the interests of the employer, employee, and the public\u201d). \u201c[A]n employer who rejects a job applicant not because of his handicap <em>per se </em>but because of an opinion, reasonably arrived at, that the handicap precludes adequate job performance, ... cannot and should not be found in violation of the Law Against Discrimination.\u201d <em>Andersen v. Exxon Co., U.S.A., </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>483, 496, 446 A.2d 486 (1982) (quoting <em>Panettieri v. C.V. Hill Refrigeration, </em>159 <em>N.J.Super. </em>472, 487, 388 A.2d 630 (App.Div.1978)). The same is obviously true in a case where an employee was terminated under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Where, as here, an employer maintains that it has reasonably concluded that the employee\u2019s handicap precluded performance of the job, and has terminated the employee for that reason, the burden of proof is on the employer. <em>Jansen, supra, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 383, 541 A.2d 682. The ALJ recognized the employer\u2019s burden in this case and appropriately placed it on the Township. In adopting the ALJ\u2019s findings, the Board, we assume, did as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>There is a dearth of New Jersey law on the issue of the employer\u2019s obligation to accommodate the physical handicap of an employee. The only reported case which has come to our attention on the duty of accommodation in this State addresses a totally different consideration. <em>See Matter of Cahill, </em>245 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 585 A.2d 977 (App.Div.1991) (holding that Cahill, a Newark fire fighter, was properly terminated because he was a substance abuser, and further holding that the employer accommodated his disability by reinstating him upon condition that he submit to routine urine monitoring). However, the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights, when it adopted the regulations implementing the LAD, including the employer\u2019s duty to reasonably accommodate a handicapped employee, acknowledged that our regulations were \u201cpatterned after\u201d those promulgated under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. 22 <em>N.J.R. </em>1436.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The Rehabilitation Act prohibits a federally funded State program from discriminating against an otherwise qualified disabled individual solely by reason of his or her disability. 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 794. The United States Department of Health and Human Services passed regulations implementing the statute and provided, in 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 84.12 (1993), a provision for reasonable accommodation. That regulation, although not worded identically, is substantially the same as <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13.T3-2.5. Therefore, in construing our regulation as it applies to the facts of a given case, it is appropriate to refer to case law interpreting federal law on the same point. Indeed, our Supreme Court has suggested a correlation between State and federal law on handicap discrimination. <em>See Andersen, supra, </em>89 <em>N.J. </em>at 497 n. 3, 446 A.2d 486 (noting that its interpretation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-2.1 and -4.1 \u201cis consistent with the current construction of the federal employment discrimination legislation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Thus, the ALJ\u2019s citation to and reliance on <em>Simon, supra, </em>was appropriate. In that case, plaintiff, a commissioned county police officer, who was also rendered a paraplegic as a result of an injury, brought an action for reinstatement under the Rehabilita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>tion Act. That act prohibits discrimination where the employee is \u201can otherwise qualified handicapped individual!,]\u201d essentially the same phrase as used in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-29.1. 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 794.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Although the word \u201cqualified\u201d is not defined in our statute, <em>see N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-5, it is defined in the federal regulations as \u201ca handicapped person who, with reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the job in question!.]\u201d 45 <em>C.F.R. </em>\u00a7 84.3(k)(l) (1993). Likewise, the New Jersey regulation concerning accommodation requires an identification of the \u201cessential requirements] of a job\u201d in order to determine whether the accommodation sought by the handicapped person would impose an undue hardship on the employer\u2019s business. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13\u2014 2.5(b)(3)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>Simon, </em>the issues before the court were essentially the same as those before the Board here: whether the ability to be able to effect a forcible arrest, render emergency aid, and be freely transferable to all positions in the police department are essential functions of the job in question. The Eighth Circuit held that the trial court\u2019s findings that those elements were essential requirements was based on adequate evidence in the record. <em>Simon, supra, </em>735 F.2d at 1085. Consequently, because no accommodation to the employee\u2019s handicap would permit the employee to perform those essential functions, his termination was not unlawful. That is, the employee was not an \u201cotherwise qualified handicapped\u201d individual within the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In <em>School Bd. of Nassau County, Florida v. Arline, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>273, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1123, 94 L.Ed.2d 307 (1987), the United States Supreme Court, quoting <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, </em>442 <em>U.S. </em>397, 99 <em>S.Ct. </em>2361, 60 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>980 (1979), defined an \u201cotherwise qualified person\u201d as \u201c \u2018one who is able to meet all of a program\u2019s requirements in spite of his handicap.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 288 n. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>17, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1131 n. 17, 94 L.Ed.2d at 321 n. 17. With respect to the duty to accommodate, the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-4\">Accommodation is not reasonable if it either imposes \u201cundue financial and administrative burdens\u201d on the grantee ... or requires \u201ca fundamental alteration in the nature of [the] program[.]\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">\n<em>[Ibid.1</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Further, in <em>Coski v. City and County of Denver, By and Through Denver Police Dept., </em>795 P.2d 1364, 1367-68 (Colo.App.1990), the Colorado Court of Appeals, citing <em>Southeastern Community College v. Davis, supra, </em>held that neither a fundamental alteration in the nature of the job, nor the elimination of an essential job function (firing a weapon or making forceful arrest) could be considered a reasonable accommodation. <em>See also, Bellus v. State, </em>843 <em>P.2d </em>119, 122 (Colo.App.1992) (\u201c[njeither a fundamental alteration in the nature of a job nor the elimination of an essential job function is a reasonable accommodation\u201d). This has been the uniform interpretation of the laws in other jurisdictions with laws similar to those in New Jersey. <em>See Shoemaker v. Pennsylvania Human Relations Com\u2019n, </em>634 A.2d 772 (Pa.Commw.Ct.1993) (police department was not required to accommodate permanently disabled police officer by creating a light-duty position which would have been a new job description within the police department); <em>Molloy v. City of Bellevue, </em>859 P.2d 613 (Wash.App.1993), <em>review den., </em>123 <em>Wash.2d </em>1024, 875 <em>P.2d </em>635 (1993) (permanently disabled police officer did not have to be accommodated by creating a special position within the department for him); <em>Matos v. City of Phoenix, </em>859 <em>P.</em>2d 748 (Ariz.App.1993) (a handicapped police officer must, with reasonable accommodation, be capable of performing all of the essential functions of the job for which he was hired, not merely one or two essential tasks, and that the employer need not accommodate the officer by eliminating one or more of the essential functions of the job); <em>Maryland Com\u2019n on Human Relations v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, </em>86 <em>Md.App. </em>167, 586 A.2d 37 (Md.App.), <em>cert. den. </em>323 <em>Md. </em>309, 593 A.2d 668 (1991) (police officer who was unable to perform essential functions of job due to a mental disability was not required to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>reasonably accommodated by offering very limited duty position answering telephones).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">In this case, the Township\u2019s Chief of Police testified that because the department was understaffed, it was necessary to have every department officer available to perform the duties of a police officer if called upon, and that there was no purely administrative duty assigned to any police officer on a permanent basis in the department. Thus, the Board\u2019s conclusion that the \u201capprehension and securing of suspects and prisoners\u201d was an essential duty of Ensslin\u2019s position, and that there was no clerical or administrative duty currently available to accommodate his disability, was supported by the evidence. Further, the Board\u2019s conclusion that accommodation was not feasible in light of the fact that the employer had no obligation to waive performance of essential functions is consistent with case law on the subject. Finally, there was more than adequate evidence in the case to support the conclusion on an objective basis that Ensslin was physically unable to perform the functions identified as essential. Thus, the standard of proof required by <em>Greenwood, supra, </em>was present in this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">The final decision of the Merit System Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">We now address the issues resulting from the dismissal of Ensslin\u2019s action in the Law Division. The Township moved for summary judgment before the ALJ issued her initial decision. In support of its motion, the Township argued that Ensslin failed to make a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination because he was not capable of performing the essential functions of the position of police officer, <em>ie., </em>patrolling, effectuating arrests, subduing prisoners and responding to emergencies. The Township maintained that its police department did not have any positions which were permanently light duty or, in its words, \u201c100% inside or administrative!.] ...\u201d It maintained that any police officer who was assigned some administrative function was expected to be able to, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>and would, \u201cgo out when needed.\u201d The Township argued that it was not required to accommodate Ensslin because he would be unable to perform the essential functions of the position even with accommodation. Thus, the Township reasoned that even if Ensslin had made a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination, it had set forth legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for its action. Finally, the Township contended that prior proceedings before the Board precluded Ensslin from bringing an action in the Law Division where the same issues were to be litigated. Ensslin opposed the motion in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">On November 18, 1992, the Law Division judge issued a letter opinion granting the Township\u2019s motion. In discussing the Township\u2019s arguments of claim and issue preclusion, the judge, citing <em>Hahn v. Arbat Systems Ltd., Inc., </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>266, 491 A.2d 58 (App.Div.1985), held that \u201cissue preclusion should not be applied when dealing with the charge of discrimination ... [because] New Jersey public policy insures complete review and rigorous enforcement in matters of alleged and actual discrimination.\u201d However, finding \u201cno material facts genuinely in dispute,\u201d the judge said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b398-5\">Police work is <em>sui generis. </em>On the facts at bar, neither the court nor the doctors can substitute judgment for that of a township in resolving the township\u2019s safety needs. Police duty involves the security of the municipality. It is for the municipality to determine what accommodations, if any, should be made for this handicapped police officer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The judge also found that \u201c[i]t has been \u2018clearly shown\u2019 that Ensslin\u2019s handicap would prevent him from \u2018performing\u2019 his \u2018particular job.\u2019 <em>N.J.S.A </em>10:5-29.1. This decision renders the alleged violation of <em>N.J.S.A </em>52:32-4 (providing facilities for the handicapped) moot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Further, the judge determined that although defendant had no duty to accommodate plaintiffs handicap, \u201c[i]n any event, there was reasonable accommodation. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>13:13-2.5.\u201d The judge said that he came to his conclusion independently of the decision arrived at by the ALJ and the Board who rendered their decision before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>As our prior discussion on this subject undoubtedly suggests, we disagree with the Law Division judge\u2019s interpretation of the LAD and its relevant regulations. Every employer, including a police department, must demonstrate that the accommodation which the claimant seeks would impose an undue hardship on the operation of its business, <em>and/or </em>that the claimant cannot perform the essential functions of the job, even with the proposed accommodation, and is, thus, not \u201can otherwise qualified handicapped\u201d person as contemplated by the statute. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-29.1. It is imperative in each case to determine what the \u201cessential\u201d requirements of the job are. Such decisions are made on a case by case basis. Here, the parties were in sharp dispute as to what the essential requirements of the job were, and whether the proposed accommodation would either be too burdensome or be insufficient to enable Ensslin to perform the essential requirements of his job. Those factual disputes were genuine and had to be resolved by the ALJ as our prior discussion has indicated. They would be no less genuine in a Law Division proceeding if one were to take place. Thus, we cannot agree with the Law Division judge that there were no genuine fact issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">However, we hold that the Law Division judge should have granted the Township\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the ground of issue preclusion. Generally speaking, a party is precluded by collateral estoppel from relitigating claims or issues which the party actually litigated, were determined in a prior action, and were directly in issue between the parties. <em>Mazzilli v. Accident &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. of Winterthur, Switzerland, </em>26 <em>N.J. </em>307, 314-316, 139 A.2d 741 (1958). It is now generally recognized that judicial determinations by administrative agencies are entitled to preclusive effect if rendered in proceedings which merit such deference. <em>City of Hackensack v. Winner, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>1, 31-33, 410 A.2d 1146 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">In this case, Ensslin requested the administrative process and raised the LAD and its relevant regulations as a bar to the Township\u2019s efforts to terminate him from his position. In doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>so, he invoked the jurisdiction of the Board to determine whether he had established a <em>prima facie </em>case of handicap discrimination, whether, with reasonable accommodations, he could perform the essential functions of his job (including a determination of what those essential functions are), and whether the accommodations requested would be unduly burdensome on his employer. In the same proceeding, he also contended that the Township failed to provide a timely hearing as required by <em>N.J.AC. </em>4A:2-2.5(2)(d). These were essentially the same issues presented in Ensslin\u2019s complaint filed in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">There are five exceptions to the general rule of preclusion recognized by the <em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments, </em>\u00a7 28 (1982). They are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-6\">(1) The party against whom preclusion is sought could not, as a matter of law, have obtained review of the judgment in the initial action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-7\">(2) The issue is one of law and (a) the two actions involve claims that are substantially unrelated, or (b) a new determination is warranted in order to take account of an intervening change in the applicable legal context or otherwise to avoid inequitable administration of the laws; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-8\">(3) A new determination of the issue is warranted by differences in the quality or extensiveness of the procedures followed in the two courts or by factors relating to the allocation of jurisdiction between them; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-9\">(4) The party against whom preclusion is sought had a significantly heavier burden of persuasion with respect to the issue in the initial action than in the subsequent action; the burden has shifted to his adversary; or the adversary has a significantly heavier burden than he had in the first action; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b400-10\">(5) There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue (a) because of the potential adverse impact of the determination on the public interest or the interests of persons not themselves parties in the initial action, (b) because it was not sufficiently foreseeable at the time of the initial action that the issue would arise in the context of a subsequent action, or (c) because the party sought to be precluded, as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances, did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair adjudication in the initial action.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-11\">These five exceptions have been recognized in the case law of this State. <em>Zoneraich v. Overlook Hosp., </em>212 <em>N.J.Super. </em>83, 94, 514 A.2d 53 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>107 <em>N.J. </em>32, 526 A.2d 126 (1986). We are satisfied from our careful analysis of this record that none of the exceptions applies to this case, and that Ensslin\u2019s Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>Division action is precluded by the administrative decision issued by the Board. We address each exception separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">The first exception does not apply because, as is clear from this opinion, Ensslin obtained appellate review of the judgment resulting from the Board\u2019s action. The second exception does not apply because the issue involved is not simply one of law. As we stated previously, there is a strong factual component to the question of whether the law against discrimination has been violated by reason of the employer\u2019s actions in terminating Ensslin. Further, the two proceedings are substantially related. If Ensslin had succeeded in his administrative action, he would have obtained reinstatement and back pay. Similar remedies would have been available to him under the LAD. <em>See N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13, 10:5-17. Further, there is no intervening change in applicable legal principles which justify a separate proceeding in the Law Division.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">The third exception does not apply because there are no significant differences in the quality or extensiveness of the proceedings followed in the administrative agency as compared to proceedings in a civil court. Indeed, the testimony submitted to the ALJ was protracted. Ensslin has made no claim that he was barred from offering testimony before the ALJ that he would have been able to submit in the Law Division. An administrative law judge is a \u201ctrained and independent hearing officer) ].\u201d <em>Zoneraich, supra, 212 N.J.Super. </em>at 96, 514 A.2d 53. The procedural due process afforded by the Office of Administrative Law and the caliber of its hearing officers place those proceedings on a par with plenary judicial proceedings. <em>Compare Taha v. DePalma, </em>214 <em>N.J.Super. </em>397, 519 A.2d 905 (App.Div.1986) (where preclusive effect was not given to an arbitrator\u2019s decision in a statutory auto arbitration proceeding because those proceedings were not intended as \u201ca substitute for litigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">The fourth exception does not apply because the burden of persuasion with respect to justification of Ensslin\u2019s termination was placed on the employer in the administrative proceeding. The same burden would be placed on the employer in a Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>Division proceeding under the LAD. Thus, there has been no shifting of burdens to the disadvantage of Ensslin.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The fifth exception does not apply because there is no potential impact on the public interest resulting from giving the administrative decision preclusive effect. Only Ensslin\u2019s interests are affected by the judgment. Any other claim against the Township for handicap discrimination would have to be addressed on a case-by-case basis as recognized in the regulations previously quoted. Further, because Ensslin initiated the administrative action in which he raised the protection of the LAD and simultaneously initiated the Law Division action, it was obviously foreseeable to him, or his attorney, that identical issues would arise in the context of both actions. Further, because Ensslin initiated the administrative review action and sought the ALJ\u2019s determination on the discrimination issues, Ensslin had the incentive to develop those issues fully and, in fact, did so without undue restriction by the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">It is important to reiterate that this is not a situation in which Ensslin was forced to litigate his discrimination claim in a setting not of his choice. He was under no compulsion to contest his termination under the procedures afforded him through the review procedures afforded by the Department of Personnel. Ensslin contended from the beginning that his termination was a violation of the LAD. Under the LAD, he had the right to initiate suit in Superior Court without going through any administrative procedure as a prerequisite. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">We believe that the holding in <em>Hahn, supra, </em>upon which the Law Division judge relied, can be best explained in the context of the five exceptions to preclusion set forth in <em>Zoneraich, supra, </em>and that the holding of <em>Hahn </em>must be limited to the facts of that case. <em>Hahn </em>involved an administrative hearing before the Division of Unemployment Compensation where the hearings are conducted in an informal fashion by a hearing officer, not an ALJ. Although discrimination was put in issue by the plaintiff in that case, and it was stipulated that the plaintiff was not denied the opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>present evidence on that point, it is not clear whether she was represented by counsel in the administrative proceeding. Further, the Appellate Division was not afforded an opportunity to compare the development of the discrimination issue in the administrative proceeding because the administrative record was not available for review. Finally, the remedies sought by plaintiff in the administrative proceeding were substantially different from the remedies sought by her in the civil proceeding. Thus, we conclude that <em>Hahn </em>is factually inapposite to this case and was not binding on the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">To the extent that <em>Hahn </em>can be read to hold that collateral estoppel cannot be applied in <em>any </em>case dealing with a charge of discrimination, we disagree with its holding. We find nothing in the LAD, its regulations, or the case law of this State which mandates as a matter of public policy that separate litigation in a civil court is required where discrimination is in issue. Indeed, the LAD expresses the opposite view. Where a party elects under the LAD to proceed administratively on the complaint filed with the Division of Civil Rights, the complainant may request a hearing in the Office of Administrative Law where probable cause has been found. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>10:5-13. The language of the LAD makes clear that the Legislature believed a proceeding before an ALJ provided an appropriate forum for hearing discrimination claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Further, to the extent that the Law Division judge believed that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Thornton v. Potamkin Chevrolet, </em>94 <em>N.J. </em>1, 462 A.2d 133 (1983), cited in <em>Hahn, </em>supports the general proposition that issue preclusion stemming from an administrative proceeding is not available where there is a Superior Court claim for discrimination, his reliance was misplaced. <em>Thornton </em>stands for the proposition that the entire controversy doctrine cannot preclude a litigant from asserting a claim for discrimination before the Division on Civil Rights simply because the claimant failed to raise employment discrimination as an issue in a grievance arbitration proceeding where the claimant was represented by a union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>official. Succinctly stated, the Court held: \u201c[t]he entire controversy doctrine is not applicable here because there is no comparability between private contractual arbitration and court <em>or administrative adjudications. </em>The doctrine presumes f\u00f3rums of equal jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 5, 462 A.2d 133 (emphasis added). Although the Court referred to the concept of \u201cpublic interest[,]\u201d its reasoning was based upon the motivation of a State administrative agency to implement the policy of the LAD, in contradistinction to an arbitrator\u2019s function in simply resolving labor disputes. <em>Id. </em>at 5-6, 462 A.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">An important consideration in applying issue preclusion in this litigation, in addition to those already discussed, is the desirability of avoiding a conflict in the results stemming from litigation of the very same issues in two different tribunals. <em>See City of Hackensack v. Winner, supra, </em>82 <em>N.J. </em>at 32-33, 410 A.2d 1146 (recognizing that elimination of conflicts, confusion and uncertainty are important policy considerations supporting the application of issue preclusion in appropriate cases). In this case, not only are the issues identical, but the remedies sought by Ensslin are essentially identical as well. As a result of our affirmance of the Board\u2019s decision, the Township\u2019s decision to terminate Ensslin is vindicated, and the Township incurs no monetary burden. In contrast, if Ensslin were successful in his Law Division action, the very same remedies which plaintiff sought and failed to obtain in the administrative process could be imposed on the Township, notwithstanding that the Township was exonerated in a full, fair and impartial hearing. We are unpersuaded that any concept of public policy should permit that result.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Thus, the judgment of the Law Division dismissing Ensslin\u2019s complaint is affirmed but for reasons other than those stated by the Law Division judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The language of 29 <em>U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 794 was amended in 1992. The amendment does not affect this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
