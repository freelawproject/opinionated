She contends that the district court erred in concluding that (1) the exclusive remedy provision of the Federal Employees Compensation Act barred her recovery under the Federal Tort Claims Act for personal injuries, and (2) the exclusive remedy provision of the Federal Tort Claims Act barred her claim against the United States Postal Service. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-17\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-18\">On October 14, 1987, Benton was an employee of a federal magistrate with offices in the U.S. Postal Service Building in Biloxi, Mississippi. While on her way to lunch, she slipped and fell on a stairway in that building, causing severe injury to her back. On October 10,1989, Benton filed an administrative claim for her injuries under the Federal Employees Compensation Act (\u201cFECA\u201d). Her FECA benefits paid her employee compensation and all of her medical expenses during her disability period.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-19\">After exhausting her administrative remedies, Benton filed the complaint at issue on June 18,1990, alleging that the stairwell that she fell on was negligently maintained, and seeking damages under the Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) for pain and suffering, future earnings, and general loss of enjoyment of life. She brought the action against the Postal Service, as both a co-employee and owner of the Postal Service Building, and against the United States as a substitute defendant for the Postal Service. In response, the defendants moved to dismiss, arguing that the exclusive remedy provision of the FTCA barred her claim against the Postal Service, and the exclusive remedy provision of the FECA barred her personal injury claim against the United States. The district court agreed that the Postal Service was not a proper party to the suit, and that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1) precluded her claim against the United States as substitute defendant for an unnamed co-employee. Consequently, the district court dismissed Benton\u2019s claims with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">Benton challenges this dismissal on three grounds: (1) the FECA exclusive remedy provision does not bar her claim under the FTCA for injuries not compensable under the FECA; (2) the FECA does not bar her claim against the United States because the Postal Service was not her employer; and (3) the FECA\u2019s prohibition against judicial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>review of the Secretary of Labor\u2019s decisions to award individual benefits, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b), violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. We address each of these challenges in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We review a dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) under the same standard used by the district court: a claim may not be dismissed unless it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief. <em>Conley v. Gibson, </em>355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 102, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). We employ the same standard in reviewing dismissals for lack of subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1). <em>Hospital Bldg. Co. v. Rex Hosp. Trustees, </em>425 U.S. 738, 742 n. 1, 96 S.Ct. 1848, 1851 n. 1, 48 L.Ed.2d 338 (1976). So, taking Benton\u2019s factual allegations as true for the purposes of this appeal, we independently review her claims to determine whether the district court correctly dismissed it under Rule 12(b)(1) and (6).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">First, Benton argues that because she did not receive compensation under the FECA for the injuries claimed in the instant suit, the FECA exclusive remedy provision, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c), does not bar her claim. This provision states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b93-7\">The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereon ... with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or instrumentality because of the disability or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a, civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen\u2019s compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AqT\">5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(c). In <em>Grijalva v. United States, </em>781 F.2d 472 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 822, 107 S.Ct. 89, 93 L.Ed.2d 42 (1986), we held that this provision bars an individual who has received an award of compensation benefits under the FECA from suing the United States for that injury under the FTCA. <em>Id. </em>at 474. Moreover, we found that it also barred the claimant\u2019s daughter from recovering damages for loss of her mother\u2019s support and services. <em>Id. </em>at 475. The FECA benefits received by the claimant were not intended to compensate the daughter for any personal loss resulting from her mother\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Nonetheless, we adopted the reasoning of the Sixth Circuit in <em>Woerth v. United States, </em>714 F.2d 648, 650 (6th Cir.1983), that the proper inquiry is \u201cwhether the claim is \u2018with respect to the injury or death of an employee.\u2019 \u201d 781 F.2d at 475; <em>see also Sheehan v. United States, </em>896 F.2d 1168 (9th Cir.1990) (reversing dismissal of an FTCA claim based on negligent infliction of emotional distress not compensated under the FECA because it was \u201cdivorced from any claim of physical injury\u201d). We agree with the district court that the exclusive remedy provision of the FECA bars Benton\u2019s claim for pain and suffering, future earnings, and general loss of enjoyment of life \u2014 injuries which derived from her physical injury for which she was already compensated under the FECA.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-11\">Second, Benton contends that the FECA exclusive remedy provision does not bar her suit against the United States in its capacity as substitute defendant for the negligence of the Postal Service, a co-employee. Benton relies on our holding in <em>Allman v. Hanley, </em>302 F.2d 559 (5th Cir.1962), to support this contention. In <em>All-man, </em>we held that absent specific statutory command, workers\u2019 compensation statutes are not construed to abrogate the common law rights of employees to bring negligence suits against their fellow employees. <em>Id. </em>at 563. Accordingly, we allowed the plaintiff\u2019s negligence action against a fellow government employee to proceed notwithstanding the FECA. As the district court observed, the Federal Employees Lia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>bility Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1), precludes Benton from obtaining the same result. This provision provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b94-4\">The remedy against the United States provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 of this title for injury ... arising or resulting from the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting in the scope of his office or employment is exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding for monetary damages by reason of the same subject matter against the employee whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2679(b)(1). Because this specific statutory command prohibits Benton\u2019s claim against the United States as substitute defendant for an unnamed co-employee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we agree with the district court that the claim should be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Finally, Benton challenges the constitutionality of the FECA\u2019s prohibition against judicial review of decisions concerning the award of payments under the Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8128(b). She contends that this provision allows the Secretary of Labor to put an arbitrary cap on the amount of coverage available to a federal employee. Moreover, she asserts that access to the FTCA is essential to ensure that federal employees receive full compensation for their work-related injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-7\">It is well settled that \u201cCongress has the power, through a \u2018clear command of the statute,\u2019 to preclude review of policy decisions_\u201d <em>Paluca v. Secretary of Labor, </em>813 F.2d 524, 527 (1st Cir.) (quoting <em>Barlow v. Collins, </em>397 U.S. 159, 167, 90 S.Ct. 832, 838, 25 L.Ed.2d 192 (1970)), <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 943, 108 S.Ct. 328, 98 L.Ed.2d 355 (1987); <em>see also Rodrigues v. Donovan, </em>769 F.2d 1344 (9th Cir.1985) (\u201cThe structure of the FECA and the language of section 8128(b) convince us that Congress\u2019s intent was that the courts not be burdened by a flood of small claims challenging the merits of compensation decisions, ... and that the Secretary should be left free to make the policy choices associated with disability decisions.\u201d) (citations omitted). A statute may prohibit review of adjudications made in conformity with policy decisions, so long as it does not prohibit review of constitutional questions. <em>See Paluca, </em>813 F.2d at 526, 527 (confirming validity of \u00a7 8128(b)\u2019s bar of judicial review because it refers to statutory, and not constitutional, action) (citing <em>Johnson v. Robison, </em>415 U.S. 361, 366, 94 S.Ct. 1160, 1165, 39 L.Ed.2d 389 (1974)). Because \u00a7 8128(b) prohibits review only of compensations decisions wholly within the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, we find that Benton\u2019s challenge lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-11\">Benton also suggests that the exclusive remedy provision of the FECA deprives federal employees of their equal protection and due process rights because only federal employees are barred from suing under the FTCA when they are injured by negligent acts of the government. However, the FECA bar applies only to those claims arising out of injuries incurred in the scope of employment. The government has a legitimate reason for maintaining a federal worker\u2019s compensation program in this manner. In <em>Gill v. United States, </em>641 F.2d 195 (5th Cir.1981), we observed that the FECA program is akin to state workers\u2019 compensation programs. In <em>Gill, </em>we recognized that \u201c[t]he heart of the system is an implicit bargain: employees are granted surer and more immediate relief in return for foregoing more expensive rewards outside the system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 197. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Benton\u2019s constitutional challenge provides no convincing reason for us to question the legitimacy of the purpose underlying the FECA program, as expressed in <em>Gill. </em>Therefore, we find this claim without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Benton\u2019s claim with prejudice.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\">.
