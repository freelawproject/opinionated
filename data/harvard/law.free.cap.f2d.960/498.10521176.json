We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-19\">In April 1987, Parker was indicted on four counts, and in August 1987 he was convicted, on his guilty plea, of counts one and three of the indictment. Pursuant to the plea bargain, the two remaining counts were dismissed. He was sentenced to consecutive terms of five years on count one and ten years on count three. Parker\u2019s section 2255 motion attacks his sentence on the ground that his counsel was ineffective for having failed to urge at or before sentencing that the double jeopardy clause barred sentencing for both counts one and three.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-20\">The offenses charged in counts one and three were each alleged to have been committed by Parker \u201con or about March 22, 1987, in Lauderdale County\u201d Mississippi. Count one charged that Parker, then convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than a year, \u201cdid receive a firearm, to-wit: a Smith and Wesson ... revolver ... which had been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce, all in violation of Section 922(g) ... Title 18, United States Code.\u201d Count three alleged that Parker \u201cknowirigly possessed a Stevens Model 95A .410 shotgun ... with a barrel less than 18 inches in length and an overall length of less than 26 inches ... not registered to\u201d Parker \u201cin the National Firearms and Transfer Record, in violation of Sections 5861(d) and 5871, Title 26, United States Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b559-21\">Accepting, <em>arguendo, </em>Parker\u2019s implicit premise that the receipt of the revolver charged in count one and the possession of the unregistered sawed-off shotgun charged in count three each refer to Parker\u2019s possession of both weapons at the same time and place, we nevertheless conclude that the relevant statutes authorize, and the double jeopardy clause does not prohibit, his conviction and punishment for both offenses in the same prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-22\"><em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), states that \u201c[wjhere the same act or transaction constitutes a violation of two distinct statutory provisions, the test to be applied to determine whether there are two offenses or only one is whether each provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>sion requires proof of an additional fact which the other does not.\u201d Here, the two counts are clearly under \u201cdistinct statutory provisions.\u201d Count three deals only with provisions of Title 26; count one only with Title 18. Hence, <em>Blockburger\u2019s </em>predicate for its test is met. <em>Cf. United States v. Evans, </em>854 F.2d 56, 58-59 (5th Cir.1988) <em>(Blockburger </em>not applied where act or transaction does not violate two distinct statutory provisions). Applying the <em>Block-burger </em>test, it is plain that there are two offenses. Not only does each count involve an entirely different weapon, but count one requires proof that Parker was a convicted felon and count three does not, while count three requires proof that the shotgun was smaller than a certain size (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(a)(1) &amp; (2)) and was not registered to Parker and count one does not require proof of either size or nonregistration.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">Parker relies on <em>United States v. Hodges, </em>628 F.2d 350 (5th Cir.1980) and <em>Rollins v. United States, </em>543 F.2d 574 (5th Cir.1976). These cases are inapposite. <em>Rollins </em>involved a single possession of the same weapon in violation of two subdivisions of section 5861; we held that a combined sentence on those two counts could not exceed the maximum authorized by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5871, the penalty statute applicable to section 5861. In <em>Hodges, </em>there were two weapons possessed at the same time and place, but the statutes violated, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 1202(a), were essentially redundant as to the conduct proscribed. <em>See United States v. Batchelder, </em>442 U.S. 114, 99 S.Ct. 2198, 2201, 60 L.Ed.2d 755 (1979) (noting \u201cthe partial redundancy of \u00a7\u00a7 922(h) and 1202(a)\u201d and that \u201c\u00a7\u00a7 922(a) and 1202(a) both prohibit convicted felons ... from receiving firearms\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Here, in contrast to <em>Rollins </em>and <em>Hodges, </em>we deal with statutes contained in wholly different titles of the United States Code. Moreover, the focus and subject matters of each statute are clearly distinct from those of the other. The focus of section 922(g) is on the defendant\u2019s status at the relevant time as a convicted felon (or as having some other disqualifying personal characteristic, such as being a fugitive or adjudicated mental defective, not related to anything about the particular weapon); this is irrelevant under section 5861. Registration is the focus under section 5861(d), but is immaterial under section 922(g). Moreover, the statutes generally cover different types of firearms. Those covered by section 922(g) \u201care generally innocent, lawful items,\u201d <em>Evans </em>at 60, while section 5861 <em>excludes </em>most ordinary firearms. <em>See United States v. Anderson, </em>885 F.2d 1248, 1250-51 (5th Cir.1989) (en banc). Possession of the revolver involved in count one would not have violated section 5861(d). Congress has in general prohibited two separate and distinct categories of conduct in \u00a7\u00a7 922(g) and 5861(d): the possession of any firearm by a felon; and the possession by anyone of any of a small class of especially dangerous weapons, if the particular weapon is not registered to the possessor. Further, section 922(g) is plainly not a taxing statute, and explicitly relies on and requires a relationship to interstate or foreign commerce. By contrast, \u201cSection 5861(d) making possession of an unregistered weapon unlawful is part of the web of regulation aiding enforcement of the transfer tax provision in [26 U.S.C.] section 5811\u201d and \u201cthe constitutional bedrock for the statute\u201d is \u201cthe power to tax\u201d rather than \u201cthe commerce power.\u201d <em>United States v. Ross, </em>458 F.2d 1144, 1143 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir.1972). <em>See also Sonzinsky v. United States, </em>300 U.S. 506, 57 S.Ct. 554, 81 L.Ed. 772 (1937); <em>United States v. Rock Island Armory, Inc., </em>773 F.Supp. 117 (C.D.I11.1991). Thus, the different statutes involved here are distinct from each other in a far more significant manner and to a far greater extent than was the case with respect to the different statutory provisions involved in <em>Rollins </em>and <em>Hodges. </em>Accordingly, it is appropriate to apply the <em>Blockburger </em>presumption of congressional intent as to the separateness of the offenses charged in counts one and three. <em>See Evans </em>at 58 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Parker makes a confusing argument to the effect that count three, charging a violation of section 5861(d), must be regarded as a lesser included offense of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>section 922(g) because possession by Parker of the sawed-off shotgun covered by count three would also violate section 922(g). Parker would then, we infer, have us treat both counts one and three as charging violations of section 922(g), with the result that, under the <em>Hodges </em>rationale, he could not be punished for both offenses even though they involved different weapons. The difficulty with this argument is that one offense is not lesser included of another unless each statutory element of the lesser offense is also a statutory element of the greater offense. <em>See United States v. Schmuck, </em>489 U.S. 705, 109 S.Ct. 1443, 103 L.Ed.2d 734 (1989); <em>United States v. Browner, </em>937 F.2d 165, 168 (5th Cir.1991). Here the putative lesser offense, that under section 5861(d), has at least two statutory elements, namely non-registration and the \u201csawed-off\u201d nature of the shotgun, neither of which is a statutory element under section 922(g). Thus the lesser included offense argument necessarily fails.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">In the present setting, the result is not changed by <em>Grady v. Corbin, </em>495 U.S. 508, 110 S.Ct. 2084, 109 L.Ed.2d 548 (1990). There, in the context of successive state prosecutions, the Supreme Court looked to the actual \u201cconduct\u201d that would be proved to obtain a conviction, rather than merely the statutory offense elements, to determine whether the second prosecution was constitutionally barred by the double jeopardy clause. <em>Id. </em>110 S.Ct. at 2093-94. <em>Grady </em>is of no avail to Parker. To begin with, on a strictly \u201cconduct\u201d basis it is clear that counts one and three are different offenses, most obviously because each count involves a different weapon. <em>Hodges </em>does not suggest otherwise; it merely concluded \u201cthat Congress intended, whether wisely or not, to punish the undifferentiated possession or receipt of multiple firearms in violation of either section 1202(a) or section 922(h) no more severely than the possession or receipt of a single firearm ... unless they were received at different times or stored in separate places.\u201d <em>Id. </em>628 F.2d at 352.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But no one has ever suggested that Congress lacks the constitutional power to impose a greater sentence for two firearms received in a single transaction contrary to section 922(g)(1) than for one so received.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Relatedly, <em>Grady </em>does not apply to multiple punishments imposed in a single prosecution. This is implicit in the language of the opinion, which goes to some pains to distinguish between multiple and single prosecutions, to emphasize the greater, independent concerns posed by the former, and to raise no question as to the viability of <em>Blockburger </em>in the single prosecution context.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> So far as we are aware <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>every circuit court that has spoken to the problem has expressed the view that <em>Grady </em>is limited to successive prosecutions. <em>See United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon, </em>917 F.2d 651, 653-54 (1st Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, </em>922 F.2d 934, 981 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Luskin, </em>926 F.2d 372, 377 (4th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Sammons, </em>918 F.2d 592, 604-5 n. 21 (6th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. Barrett, </em>933 F.2d 355, 359-60 (6th Cir.1990); <em>United States v. McKinney, </em>919 F.2d 405, 417 n. 13 (7th Cir.1990). <em>See also Heaton v. Nix, </em>924 F.2d 130, 133-34 (8th Cir.1991); <em>United States v. Edmond, </em>924 F.2d 261, 269 (D.C.Cir.1991). We have not previously spoken to this issue, other than to note and reserve it. <em>See Taylor v. Whitley, </em>933 F.2d 325, 328-29 n. 6 (5th Cir.1991); <em>Browner, </em>937 F.2d at 171 n. 10. We now join the other circuits and hold that <em>Grady </em>leaves undisturbed the prior law of double jeopardy as applied in the context of multiple punishments imposed in a single prosecution. Accordingly, <em>Grady </em>is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">Parker\u2019s sentence to consecutive terms on counts one and three was lawful and not contrary to the double jeopardy clause, as the district court correctly held. Parker\u2019s complaint on appeal respecting ineffective assistance of counsel is only \u201cthat counsel failed to object to the imposition of two separate sentences on double jeopardy grounds.\u201d Because Parker\u2019s sentence was lawful and not subject to any double jeopardy objection, counsel was not ineffective for failing to so object, and Parker could not have been prejudiced by that failure. Consequently, Parker presents no basis for reversal of the district court\u2019s determination that he was not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment denying Parker section 2255 relief is</p>\n<p id=\"AJx\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-5\">. Parker argues that we should disregard non-registration because felons are not eligible for registration (presumably under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5841). He cites no authority for this proposition, only a case holding that, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20), one whose civil rights have been restored under state law is not a felon for purposes of section 922(g)(1). <em>See United States v. Edwards, </em>745 F.Supp. 1477 (D.Minn.1990). <em>Edwards </em>has nothing to do with section 5841 or section 5861(d), except for the coincidence that the prior offense there was a violation of section 5861(d). Even if Parker were correct in his assumption respecting eligibility for registration under section 5841, his conclusion would not follow. There could well be an opportunity to register the firearm (as defined in section 5845) before the felony conviction. Further, Parker\u2019s argument amounts to an invitation, which we cannot accept, to judicially create an exemption from section 5861(d) for felons, something Congress obviously neither authorized nor intended.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b561-6\">. For the reasons previously stated, the conclusion concerning congressional intent is otherwise when the question is whether a section 5861(d) violation is a separate offense from a section 922(g)(1) violation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b561-9\">. Other \"conduct\u201d differences between counts one and three are that count one requires proof of Parker\u2019s status as a felon, while count three does not; and count three requires proof that the weapon was subject to required registration <em>(i.e., </em>was \u201csawed-off\") but not registered, while count one does not. Even if we hypothesize that the same weapon was involved in each count \u2014 not the case here \u2014 these differences might be sufficient to constitute separate offenses for <em>Grady </em>purposes, but we need not, and do not, decide that question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b561-10\">. <em>See, e.g., </em>the following from <em>Grady, viz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-11\">\"The <em>Blockburger </em>test was developed 'in the context of multiple punishments imposed in a single prosecution.\u2019 <em>Garrett v.
