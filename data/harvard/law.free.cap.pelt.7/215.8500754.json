Justified his moving away^and that the wort had been done with all\u201cproper care and deligenoe. 1st. The conclusions which we have reaohed upon the second point render it unnecessary for us to consider the first point.</p>\n<p id=\"ANE\">It Is a general 4*\u00abb4i44y rule <em>ini' </em>law that no legal liability results from the exercise of a legal right,unless that right has been exercised in a negligent manner or through malice.11 A 711-35A 646-28 A 424-15 A 559-27-A 442-15 A 618 38 A 753 ( brief ) 46 A 521-146 La 818- Cooley onj\u00e9orts.P 81 39 Dalloy P 2<em>93.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b226-12\">Thus, a ooproprietor of a wall may demolish it and build a higher and whicker wall to support a- heavier building.In the case of Levy vs Fenner 48 A 1389 the Supreme Court, said on Page 1404 : \"</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-13\">*In demolishing the old and building the new party wall, under the conditions .fully proved in this oase,the plaintiff exercised an absolute right conferred upon him by the law.

refill^and that suoh earth was continuously removed and that,at no time was the gate obstructed for any length of time^and that in the spaoe of one hour they could have removed the mud shown in'photograph P.S^and that Mr Jung never complained to them of obstructions}that the obstructions, if any were all of a temporary character.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In the language of Major Sarsaud:* What I did was what I was required to do,and that was to oxoavate the dirt and placo it on St.Louis Street as it was being excavated,and at the same time have the necessary \u00f3arts,eaoh and every
