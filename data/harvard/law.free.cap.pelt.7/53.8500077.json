I feel that the balance due on\u2019the mortgage notes of John D. Eix, Jr., should be paid by preference over the judgment of Petrie &amp; Co. The jury has evidently subordinated Eix's' claim to that of Petrie &amp; Co. by deducing the amount of his claim by the amount of Petrie &amp; Company's. However,, the matter oan better be determined by the Court on appeal rather than by submission to another Jury, and the motion for a new trial, will, therefore, be refused.\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-11\">E.O., la., May 8, 1922.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-12\">(Signed) Columbus Reid, Judge...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-13\">An examination of ^the exhibits and\u2019 testimony' herein filed is conclusive that the total amount due ,Hlx on;th,e items of expenses such as taxes in the sum of $55.92.and- t\u00abpaii|iii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>in the sum of $150, and of the total mortgage interest, attorney's fees and costs of $728, should he allowed, bringing the total amount due Nix, including 8$ of $299.28 on the principal debt, to the sum of $933.92. Against this amount, the evidence shows that Nix collected rents while in the aotual, but illegal posession. of the property, to the extent of $371.50, whioh amount, when deducted from the above total of $933.92, leaves a balance due Nix on the above items of $562.42. We are of the opinion that the Judgment of the lower Court' should therefore be amended, increasing the allowance to Nix from $395 to $662.42.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-2\">On the appeal herein taken, Nix urges here, as he did in the trial of the ease as remanded, that he should also be allowed 20$ damages on $562.42, or the sum of $112.48, for the illegal issuance of the injunction taken out in this pro* seeding by the plaintiff in injunction to Petrie &amp; Co., now in liquidation. This latter claim, in our opinion, is not well founded, for the reason shown by the unusual and protracted litigation in this case, and which establishes a Justification of the injunction proceedings recognized by this Court in the decree rendered on Ootober 31, 1921, in the consolidated cases Nos. 8389 and 8419, Orl. App.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-3\">While it is true that the final trial before Jury Justifies the Judgment setting aside the injunction, the original granting of the same was, in our opinion, Justified, and therefore cannot carry with it at this time the statutory damages herein claimed on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">The liquidators of Petrie &amp; Co., ltd., ap-pellees herein, have answered the appeal, and it is contended by them that they are entitled to <em>5fa </em>interest on rents collected by Mr. Nix, but this must be denied, for the reason that the record discloses that all rents collected during each year were added at the end of the year and deducted from Mr. Nix's claim, thereby reducing his claim by the amount of the rents, and stopping interest whioh would otherwise have been due on said amount of rents.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>The further contention of appellees herein that Nix is only entitled to 6$ interest on his claim from the time of the adjudication of the property to Petrie &amp; Co. rather than <em>8tfo </em>contractual interest under the mortgage, is, in our opinion, not sound in law nor justified hy the facts of this case, and the authority cited in support of said contention - the case of Morris v. Cain, 39 Am. 713 - is not applicable to the facts of this case, Nix's suit under his non-alienation pact via ordinaria being against Madison, his debtor, and not against the original adjudicates, Petrie &amp; Co,</p>\n<p id=\"b66-2\">Our exhaustive consideration of the most unusual and protracted litigation which has existed in the several suits involved in this case, running for over five years, and in which no less than five appeals have been taken to this Court, results in our conviction that the verdict and judgment herein appealed from is correct in every respect except as to the insufficient amount for which Nix's vendor's lien has been .recognized. We have already noted above the proper increase which should be given to the monied judgment .in favor of Nix. In all other respects, the judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-3\">It Is therefore ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the judgment herein appealed from be, and the same hereby is amended, so as to allow John D. Nix, Jr., plaintiff herein, the sum of $562.42, with <em>&amp;fo </em>interest on $299.\u00a38 of said amount, from January 1, 1922, until paid. It is further ordered, adjudged and decreed that the injunction herein sued out by the liquidators of Joseph Petrie &amp; Co., ltd,, be, and the same hereby is dissolved, without damages against them and their surety. It is further ordered, adjudged and deoreed, that all oosts of this appeal and the costs of the lower court herein incurred, shall be borne in solido by the liquidators of Joseph Petrie &amp; Oo.,ltd., successors of Joseph Petrie &amp; Co.'.and the surety on the injunction bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">JP1SMENT AMENDED.
