injury suffered by the plaintiff at the hands of one of the nurses while he was undergoing an operation at the defendant Infirmary.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">The petition alleges that in August 1920 he entered the Touro Infirmary for the purpose of undergoing an operation <em>k </em>to be performed ubn him by Dr Rudolph Matas,a surgeon of said Infirmary^employad by him;that he was a pay_patient and had engaged a room for which he stipulated to pay a fixed price, and In addition thereto agreed to pay for the use of the operating room,and for the services of an employee of the infirmary to administer the anesthetis;that during the operation one of the muiaea employed by the Infirmary in attendance upon him negligently inflicted upon him painful and permanent injuries by placing at his feet certain heating appliances which burned and blistered his feet as as to partially disable him for llfe^ the whole while he was undsr the influence of aneathetie^and helpless.For all of which he claims $28,000.00</p>\n<p id=\"b208-9\">The defendant first filed an exception of no cause of action which was overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-10\">For answer the defendant admitted that the plaintiff had entered the lnflmary as a pay-patient paying a fixed price per day for the use of his room and for the use of the operating room,but denied all the other allegations of the petition.. Further answering defendant averred :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b208-11\">^ And for further answer defendant avers that it- is a charitable association,organised for charitable purposes under1 and as authorised by tie laws of this State by act before Felix J.Dreyfoua,Notary Public^on March 6th 1893 as per certified It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>\u2022epy o\u00ed oaarter annexed hereto}that aald defendant 1b a benevolent or charitable association or corporation,and is not incorporated for profit,nor does it operate any bunlness for profit, but that all its revenues,including the dues of its members and .patrons,donations and legacies,contributions by the City of Hew Orleans, and all receipts from pay-r-patients,and from all other sources whatever,are devoted'exclusively to charitable and benevolent purposes and to the care and treatment of Charity patients and inmates,and that no part of its revenues is paid out to its members or patrons for profit or otherwise} that the finds reoeived from said donors and all other Bourses,constitute trust funds devoted to charitable purposes,and which cannot be diverted from the uses and purposes to which the same have been dedicated}that defendant used all due diligence and reasonable care in the seleotion ofa its employees}and that this defendant is not liable for the'alleged injuries described in plaintiff\u2019s petition,even if they were suffered by him,which is denied,\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9K\">There was judgment for defendant and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">The above answer contains three propositions of legal defence}</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">First: That the nurse was not the servant of the defendant within the meaning of Article C.0.2320</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Seoond: That even if she was.the defendant was not liable for <em>' O-</em>her negligence, inasmuch as it had exercised due ^fars in the selection azffet of this nurse,and that she was oonpetent to fulfill the duties of her employment}</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Third: That there was no negligence on the part of -cue nurse.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">He shall consider the third point in discussing the first and seoond,inasmuch as under the jurisprudence adopted by us,as we shall see below,the defendant is.-not liable even if the nurse was negligent in the discharge of her duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>The defendant baa established tha character of the infirmar\u00bb bv its charter and by testimony.By Artiale IX * The object of thia Association and the purposes for which it has beam crea/ted are deolared to be the giving of relief and protection and the affording of needful surgical and medical aid and comfort to destitute and deser\u00bbing persons \"</p>\n<p id=\"AqqS\">Article III of the By Laws .provides that \" all funds derived from the payment of duos by members and patron's,aswell as by life members.and all donations,bequests or legacies to the association-and all fonda derived from any of the privileges \u2022heretofore provided for or from any other source,shall^ except as hereing otherwise provided.be paid over to the Treasurer of the Association,for such disposition and use as the Board of Managers shall direct.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\">There is no other, provision either in the Charter or in the By-Laws relative to the receipt or disposition of. the money of the Association.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Fmanual 7.Benjamin testified that he had been President of the Touro infirmary,tne defendant herein for the last twelve yearsj.that it depended for its receipts on the money collected <em>c/i-i </em>. from the pay-patients $a the hospital,from contributions, bequests,and money it got from the Oity^and gifts jthat it liad no stockholders, and deolared no dividends 5 that it paid nothing to its patrons or members or supporters,and that the
