Thereafter, the Defendant/Appellee herein received notice that his trial was scheduled for August 13, 1982. Defendant/Appellee\u2019s counsel did not receive a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>formal written notice of trial. The Defendant/Appellee appeared at the hearing on August 13, 1982 without his counsel being present with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-3\">The trial court did not inquire into the availability of counsel, or the availability or willingness of the Appellee to proceed without counsel. Solely on the basis of the Clerk\u2019s failure to give written notice to Appellee\u2019s counsel (even though the Appellee himself had been notified of the trial date), the trial court continued and charged the continuance to the Appellant, the State of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">Thereafter, the trial court granted the Defendant/Appellee\u2019s Motion to Discharge, made on September 1, 1982. The trial court granted the motion solely on the basis of the prior judge\u2019s notation on the Court file that the continuance (of August 13, 1982) had been charged to the Appellant, the State of Florida. The Appellant maintains that this action by the trial court was in error. We agree. <em>State v. McCoy, </em>369 So.2d 1027 (3d DCA 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Reversed and Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
