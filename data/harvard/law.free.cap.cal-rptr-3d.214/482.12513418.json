BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    A. County Employee Service Disability Retirements\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Public employee retirement boards have plenary authority regarding, and fiduciary responsibility for, the administration of their retirement systems. (Cal. Const., art. XVI, \u00a7 17.) A county's retirement system is administered by a county retirement board, under the County Employees Retirement Law of 1937. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31450 et seq. (hereafter the CERL).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   County retirement systems formed under the CERL provide both service retirements based on age and years of service (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31670 et seq. ) and disability retirements based on an employee becoming permanently incapacitated for the performance of his or her work duties. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31720 et seq. )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   When the statutory requirements are met, an employee member of a county retirement system who is permanently incapacitated may separate from county service and receive either a service-related disability retirement and allowance, or a general disability retirement and allowance. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31720.) An application for either type of disability retirement must be made \"[1] while the member is in service, [2] within four months after his or her discontinuance of service, [3] within four months after the expiration of any period during which a presumption is extended beyond his or her discontinuance of service, or [4] while, from the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application, he or she is continuously physically or mentally incapacitated to perform his or her duties.\" (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31722.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Because a county retirement board is \"required to administer the retirement system 'in a manner to best provide benefits to the participants of the plan,' \" (\n   <em>\n    McIntyre v. Santa Barbara County Employees' Retirement System\n   </em>\n   (2001)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"226395\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/91/730/#p734\">\n    91 Cal.App.4th 730\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 734,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=110%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20565\">\n    110 Cal.Rptr.2d 565\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    McIntyre\n   </em>\n   ); see also Cal.

The board may require such proof as it deems necessary to determine the existence of a disability. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31723.) \"Permanent incapacity for the performance of duty shall in all cases be determined by the board.\" (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31725.) The applicant bears the burden of proving his or her disability and that it is service related. (\n   <em>\n    Masters v.

If the board is not satisfied that the member is permanently incapacitated according to the proof received, the request for disability retirement must be denied. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31725.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Government Code section 31724 governs the timing of disability retirements and allowances. The statute provides that when a county retirement board is satisfied that the member is permanently incapacitated and grants the member a disability retirement,\n   <em>\n    the retirement\n   </em>\n   is \"effective on the expiration date of any leave of absence with compensation to which [the member] shall become entitled ... or effective on the occasion of the member's consent to retirement prior to the expiration of such leave of absence with compensation.\" (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31724.) In the\n   case of a member who has been granted or is entitled to sick leave, the statute provides that the\n   retirement is not effective until the expiration of such leave with compensation, unless the member consents to an earlier date. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Government Code section 31724 also states the general rule that the member's \"disability retirement\n   <em>\n    allowance\n   </em>\n   shall be effective as of the date such application is filed with the [county retirement] board, but not earlier than the date following the last day for which [the member] received regular compensation.\" (Italics added.) In other words, a retiree's disability retirement allowance will typically be effective on the latter of two dates: the actual application date or the date following the last day for which regular compensation was received after separation. However, \"[w]hen it has been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the board that the filing of the member's application was delayed by administrative oversight or by inability to ascertain the permanency of the member's incapacity until after the date following the day for which the member last received regular compensation, such date will be deemed to be the date the application was filed.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid\n   </em>\n   .) Here we are concerned with the latter provision-delay due to the inability to ascertain the permanency of the disability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Flethez Matter\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In 1990, Flethez became an employee of San Bernardino County (County). He worked as an equipment operator from 1991 until 2000. In 1998, he was injured while performing his job duties. His last day of work was on January\n   28, 2000. He underwent spinal surgery for his 1998 injury on February 1, 2000. His last day of regular compensation was July 14, 2000. Flethez underwent additional surgeries in 2001 and 2002 and received physical therapy through 2004.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   More than eight years after he last worked for the County, on June 12, 2008, Flethez filed an application with SBCERA for a service-related disability retirement and allowance. It was rejected for omission of a signed medical records authorization. A little more than one year later, Flethez filed a complete application, including a signed medical records authorization and a supporting physician's report. In August 2010, SBCERA granted Flethez's application for service-related disability retirement benefits, effective as of the date of his initial application in 2008. That is, Flethez's retirement allowance was made effective under the general rule of Government Code section 31724 granting retroactive benefits back to the date of his June 2008 application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Flethez then filed a request for review and reconsideration limited to the question of the\n   starting date for his benefits. Flethez does not dispute that this was the first time he contended that his retirement allowance should be retroactive, under the inability to ascertain permanency clause of Government Code section 31724, to July 15, 2000, the date following his last day of regular compensation. When SBCERA, in April 2011, maintained its original decision setting June 12, 2008 as the commencement date for his benefits, Flethez requested a formal administrative hearing on the issue. An administrative hearing was held and the hearing officer subsequently issued proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, and a recommended decision denying Flethez's request for benefits retroactive to July 15, 2000. On October 4, 2012, SBCERA adopted the hearing officer's proposed decision and maintained the original June 2008 date as the effective date of Flethez's disability retirement benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Flethez filed a petition for writ of mandate in the superior court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, seeking a writ ordering SBCERA to set aside its decision and grant him service-related disability retirement benefits effective as of July 15, 2000. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31724.) He also sought interest at the legal rate on all retroactive amounts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The superior court found that the evidence submitted in the mandamus proceeding showed Flethez had not been able to ascertain the permanency of his incapacity by the date he stopped working and when he received his last compensation. It determined that the question of when Flethez thereafter became able to ascertain the permanency of his incapacity was irrelevant under Government Code section 31724 because under the unambiguous words of the statute, it was the \"inability to ascertain the permanency\" until\n   after the date following the day of last regular compensation that triggers retroactive payments under the inability to ascertain\n   permanency clause. The court further determined that the CERL sets no deadline for filing an application based on the date permanency is eventually ascertained. (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31722 [an application is timely if from \"the date of discontinuance of service to the time of the application,\" the member is \"continuously\" incapacitated].) The superior court issued a peremptory writ commanding SBCERA to grant Flethez a service-connected disability retirement allowance retroactive to July 15, 2000, the date after the last day he received regular compensation, i.e., the date that was deemed to be his application date under the inability to ascertain permanency clause of Government Code section 31724. SBCERA complied with the writ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The superior court also ruled Flethez was entitled to prejudgment interest under section 3287(a) at the legal rate from the date that each payment of retroactive disability retirements benefits would have been due, starting from July 15, 2000. The interest payments on all retroactive amounts totaled $132,865.37. SBCERA timely filed a notice of appeal \"limited to the issue of interest.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Court of Appeal reversed the judgment insofar as it awarded prejudgment interest retroactive to July 15, 2000. It concluded that \"in the context of disability retirement benefits, a retiring member is entitled to recover section 3287(a) prejudgment interest on a court award of disability retirement benefits from the day on which his or her right to recover those benefit payments became vested,\" which was \"not until the retiring member establishes his or her entitlement\" to those benefits. The Court of Appeal remanded the matter to the superior court for further proceedings to determine the date that Flethez had established his right to receive retroactive disability retirement benefit payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As noted earlier, we granted review to consider how prejudgment interest under section 3287(a) should be calculated when a retroactive award of service-connected disability retirement benefits under the CERL is ordered in an administrative mandamus proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The interpretation of the prejudgment interest provisions of section 3287(a) as\n   it relates to the provisions of the CERL is, as the parties acknowledge, a question of law subject to our independent review.

The parties advance, however, very different views as to\n   <em>\n    when\n   </em>\n   the right to such retroactive benefits was \"certain\" and \"vested\" for purposes of calculating the amount of interest due under section 3287(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Flethez argues that county employees have a vested property right in a disability retirement pension from the inception of their employment.

Flethez asserts that absent such an award of interest here, he will be denied the benefit of the natural growth and productivity of the retroactive benefits withheld by the SBCERA and correspondingly, the remainder of the members of the SBCERA retirement system will be unjustly enriched by the use of his retirement allowance in the interim.\n   SBCERA argues that county employees have only an inchoate right to a disability retirement pension, which vests only when the last contingency to the pension is removed. Specifically, SBCERA asserts that under the CERL, the right to a disability retirement and accompanying allowance is not vested until the retirement board to which an application is submitted has reviewed the submitted evidence and finally acts on the application, or at least has the opportunity to do so. Until such time, SBCERA contends, the applicant's benefits claim is also \"not certain or capable of being made certain\" as required by section 3287(a). According to SBCERA, it is only when the board\n   <em>\n    wrongfully\n   </em>\n   denies such an application and withholds disability retirement payments that prejudgment interest begins to run as damages under section 3287(a). SBCERA argues that this distinguishes the instant case from those cases awarding section 3287(a) interest on wrongfully withheld salary, wages, or service pensions-payments that do not require conditions precedent or the inherent delay of an administrative process to determine the plaintiffs' entitlement to them in the first instance.

Flethez first applied for a service-related disability retirement in June 2008. He did not at that time request a starting date for his benefits earlier than his actual application date. In accordance with its duties under the CERL, SBCERA evaluated and granted his application for benefits retroactive to June 2008.

Only then, did Flethez request an earlier starting date for his benefits pursuant to the inability to ascertain permanency clause of Government Code section 31724. If SBCERA had thereafter granted him the requested start date, as the trial court later determined it should have done, Flethez would have received an additional lump-sum payment for benefits calculated retroactively from the new deemed application date in July 2000. But Flethez would not have been entitled to receive the benefit payments in 2000 or in any of the years preceding the decision of SBCERA. SBCERA could not by law pay Flethez\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   benefits before he applied for them (Gov. Code, \u00a7 31722 ) and carried his burden (\n   <em>\n    Rau v.

For purposes of prejudgment interest as a component of damages under section 3287(a), until the SBCERA made its eligibility determination on his request, there were no damages stemming from an underlying monetary obligation \"capable of being made certain\" and his right to an award of retroactive disability benefits under the inability to ascertain permanency clause did not vest.
