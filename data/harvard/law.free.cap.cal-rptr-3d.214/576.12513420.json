The gain of a conviction at trial led to a loss on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In rebuttal, during closing argument, the prosecutor told the jury, \"Let me tell you that presumption [of innocence] is over. Because that presumption is in place only when the charges are read. But you have now heard all the evidence. That presumption is gone.\" She buttressed this grossly inaccurate explanation of reasonable doubt with the erroneous statement that the jury's decision regarding defendant's guilt is just an ordinary decision people make \"a hundred times a day.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A prosecutor may not mislead jurors with false and misleading statements concerning the law.

The trial court read to the jury the proper instruction concerning reasonable doubt, among other numerous instructions. The court told the jury that its instructions prevail if there are conflicts between its instructions and counsel's arguments. But this was before the prosecutor argued to the jury her misguided version of reasonable doubt. The court's earlier instruction was insufficient to overcome the prejudice the prosecutor's grossly improper argument bought to the minds of the jurors. The prosecutor's definition was the last explanation of reasonable doubt the jury heard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At that moment the trial judge would have been well advised to inform the jurors that the prosecutor had misstated the law and to again read to the jurors the reasonable doubt instruction. We offer this suggestion not as a rule to follow in every case when counsel misrepresents the law or evidence. In the extreme case, however, when the law is so misrepresented\n   that the case is likely infected with prejudicial error, the trial court must intercede to ensure a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We caution prosecutors to observe and respect the law and not rely on harmless error as a safety net to ensure a conviction. The integrity of our system of justice demands nothing less.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A jury found Ronald J. Cowan guilty of one count of sodomy of a person under age 10 (Pen. Code, \u00a7 288.7, subd. (a)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   ); two counts of oral copulation with a person under age 10 (\u00a7 288.7, subd. (b) ); and two counts of lewd acts on a child (\u00a7 288, subd. (a)). The jury also found true that both counts of lewd acts on a child involved substantial sexual conduct. (\u00a7 1203.066, subd. (b).) The trial court sentenced Cowan to 65 years to life. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cowan had a relationship with a woman named Keena. After the relationship ended, Cowan continued to visit Keena's family. He paid particular attention to Keena's younger brother D., who was then eight years old. He bought D. clothes and other gifts and took him on outings. D. and his friends stayed overnight at Cowan's home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When D. became a teenager, Cowan turned his attention to D.'s cousin, A.J., who was born in November 2007. A.J. lived with his mother, his grandmother, and periodically with his grandfather.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Cowan would visit A.J. five times a week for hours at a time. He would bring him gifts every week and took him places. Between the time A.J. was two and four, Cowan was alone with him on more than 10 occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When A.J. was three or four, he spent the night at Cowan's home. Cowan called A.J.'s mother to tell her he was bringing A.J. back because he was crying. Cowan returned A.J. between 11:30 p.m. and midnight. When A.J. got home, he could not stop crying. He kept touching his buttocks and saying it hurt. A.J.'s mother and grandmother thought A.J. might have a rash. A.J.'s mother put diaper rash cream on him, but she saw no sign of anything wrong. It took several hours for A.J. to fall asleep.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In March 2012, A.J.'s mother was incarcerated and lost custody of her children. A.J., who was four and one-half years old, and his two-year-old sister were placed in foster care with C.C. A.J. lived with C.C., her husband and children for 18 months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Within days of A.J.'s arrival, C.C. noticed A.J. exhibited sexualized behavior. A.J. was playing with toys and said, \"I want to sex you.\" He would frequently do pelvic thrusting. Almost every time he got into the bathtub, he played with his penis. He would rub his bottom on people, the furniture and the wall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   C.C. first met Cowan at a social services meeting about a week after A.J. was placed with her. Cowan asked if he could take care of A.J. and his sister part-time. The person running the meeting said he would consider it. In the parking lot after the meeting, Cowan came up to C.C. Cowan was teary-eyed and said he missed A.J. He gave her some toys for A.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On another occasion, Cowan walked up to C.C. teary-eyed, said that he missed\n   A.J. and really wanted to see him. He asked C.C. if she could arrange a visit. C.C. told Cowan it was against social services' rules. Cowan told C.C. that he was a mentor for boys. He used to be in the Big Brothers program, but now he was doing it on his own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   C.C. said Cowan was present almost every time A.J.'s mother had unsupervised visits with her children. A.J.'s mother had two visits a week. She also saw Cowan at A.J.'s birthday party. C.C. said, \"[Cowan] was there at every possible visit he could be.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On the night of the birthday party, C.C. was putting A.J. to bed when he asked if he could sleep in her bed. When C.C. said no, A.J. told her that he had been in Cowan's bed. She asked A.J. why he was in Cowan's bed. A.J. said because there was nowhere else to sleep. When C.C. asked what they were wearing, A.J. replied that they were both wearing pajamas, but Cowan's pants fell down.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Shortly thereafter, one of C.C.'s sons reported that he and his brothers were in their bedroom with A.J. They were talking about school when A.J. blurted out, \"[A] guy named Ron put his wiener in [my] butt.\" C.C. talked to A.J. the next morning. A.J. confirmed that what he said the previous night was true. C.C. called A.J.'s social worker to report what A.J. said. While C.C. was waiting for the social worker to return her call, she put A.J. down for a nap. One of C.C.'s sons walked into the room and A.J. said, \"Ron put his wiener in my butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The social worker returned C.C.'s telephone call and told her to call the police. The police interviewed A.J. and took him for a physical examination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   C.C. spoke with A.J. on the evening after the physical examination. She asked A.J. if he ever touched Cowan's \"wiener\" or if Cowan had touched\n   his. A.J. said Cowan put A.J.'s penis in his mouth and let A.J. touch his penis. A.J. said it happened at Cowan's house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.C. testified A.J. frequently lied. When she would see him do something wrong, he would lie and deny he did it. His eyes would dart all around the room when he lied. When he told her about what Cowan did, his demeanor was different. He was very serious, humble and calm. She believed A.J. was telling the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.J.'s mother testified that after she completed a substance abuse program, Cowan helped her get an apartment so she could get her children back. Cowan purchased furniture, food, clothes and toys for the children. At one point Cowan asked A.J.'s mother, if he stayed the night, \"what if [A.J.] wanted to sleep in the same bed [with] him.\" She replied that if Cowan stayed the night he would have to sleep on the couch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   A.J.'s grandmother testified that her husband sometimes watches pornography. The pornography does not involve children. A.J. saw the pornography for a period of seconds before grandmother's husband turned it off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Grandmother's husband testified that A.J. would turn on the pornography and view it for about five minutes before he told him to turn it off.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   District Attorney Investigator Tracy Nix interviewed A.J. twice. The interviews were recorded and the recordings were played for the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   A.J. told Nix that Cowan put his \"pee pee in [his] butt.\" A.J. said that it felt disgusting and that his penis felt like a hard baseball bat. Using two anatomical dolls, A.J. demonstrated what Cowan had done to him. A.J. also said that he and Cowan had touched each other's penises. After the interview, A.J. took two anatomically\n   correct dolls and had one orally copulate the penis of the other. In the second interview, A.J. described acts of oral copulation that Cowan had committed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A.J. was physically examined by Dr. Niska Abdul-Cater, an expert in evaluating child sexual abuse. She found no physical signs of abuse. She testified, however, that there are often no signs of sexual trauma in the anal area. Even when the victim is examined within 72 hours, findings are made in only 5 to 30 percent of the cases. Oral copulation generally leaves no physical signs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A.J. testified at trial. He was six years old at the time. At first he denied remembering speaking to Nix. Then he said he spoke to her about Cowan, and told her the truth. A.J. also initially denied Cowan did anything to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   But when asked if Cowan \"put his pee-pee in [his] butt at some point,\" A.J. said yes; it happened at Cowan's house and made him feel \"[n]ot comfortable.\" A.J. said Cowan did nothing else to his private parts. After the recording of A.J.'s interview with Nix was played before the jury, A.J. said he told Nix the truth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   DEFENSE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Cowan denied the allegations. He said he had been in the court-appointed special advocate program, but he decided to leave the program and mentor D. on his own. There was less paperwork.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   D. had been at his home alone one time. A few other times, D. and his friends slept at his house. When D. was around 17 years old and A.J. was two, Cowan started to spend more time with A.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A.J. had been to Cowan's home only twice. Once was with his mother. The other time they planned for A.J. to spend the night. There was a bedroom on the third floor of Cowan's house. A.J. had been there on the night of the sleepover. Cowan watched television with A.J., but later A.J. started whining and wanted to go home. Cowan could not calm him, so he called A.J.'s mother and took him home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Cowan helped A.J.'s mother get an apartment so that she could get her children back from foster care. Cowan never asked A.J.'s mother about sleeping in the same bed as A.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Dawn Clove knew Cowan because her son was one of D.'s friends. Her son spent time with Cowan. She trusted Cowan and did not believe he did what he was accused of doing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Raymond Glove testified he has known Cowan for 10 years and has seen him interact with children. He does not believe Cowan would do anything sexually inappropriate with children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Doris McIntyre had been Cowan's neighbor for 28 years. She had seen him interact with children in her family. She does not believe he would have committed the charged offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   A forensic computer expert testified he recovered approximately 20,000 images from Cowan's computer hard drives. There was some adult pornography. But there was no child pornography.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Cowan contends the prosecutor committed misconduct in closing argument by misstating the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   It is improper for the prosecutor to misstate the law, and in particular to attempt to reduce the People's burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.

(\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The prosecutor argued the most basic tenet of criminal law. She told the jury that the presumption of innocence is in place \"only when the charges are read\" and that the \"presumption is gone\" thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The presumption of innocence is a fundamental component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.

But Cowan objected that the prosecutor was misstating the law. That is sufficient to preserve the issue. The defendant is\n   not required to use the word \"misconduct\" in raising the objection. The trial court did not sustain the objection, but told the jury \"this is argument,\" and cautioned the jury only to consider its instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The People argue the prosecutor's comments here were similar to those declared not to be misconduct in\n   <em>\n    People v.

Our Supreme Court concluded it was error for the prosecutor to suggest that a reasonable account of the evidence satisfies the prosecutor's burden of proof.

(See CALCRIM No. 224, stating in part: \"[B]efore you may rely on circumstantial evidence to find the defendant guilty, you must be convinced that the only reasonable conclusion supported by the circumstantial evidence is that the defendant is guilty.\") The prosecutor made the statement immediately before discussing what is reasonable. The jury would understand the prosecutor's discussion of the reasonable interpretation of the evidence to be linked to her statement that the jury must be firmly convinced that guilt is the only reasonable interpretation of the evidence. But the prosecutor told the jury reasonable doubt ends when the case begins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We acknowledge that the prosecution evidence here is stronger than that in\n   <em>\n    Centeno\n   </em>\n   . Cowan showed an obsessive interest in victim A.J. He would visit A.J. five times a week for hours at a time; he would bring him gifts and take him places. When A.J. was placed in foster care, Cowan asked if he could take care of A.J. part-time. He tearfully approached A.J.'s foster\n   mother, C.C., and asked if he could visit A.J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   When A.J. spent the night at Cowan's house, Cowan brought him home crying late at night. A.J. kept touching his buttocks and saying it hurt. It took A.J. several hours to fall asleep. Thereafter, A.J. blurted out to C.C.'s sons that \"a guy named Ron put his wiener in his butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Cowan points out that A.J.'s testimony was inconsistent about what occurred. But A.J. was only six years old when he testified. Most adults would find it difficult to testify about sexual matters in front of a jury, no less a six-year-old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Cowan claims A.J. learned about sex while observing his grandfather watch pornography. But Cowan brought A.J. back to A.J.'s mother's house after spending the evening alone with Cowan. A.J. was crying inconsolably and complaining that his buttocks hurt. That was not the result of viewing pornography and appears to be consistent with A.J.'s spontaneous statement that \"a guy named Ron put his wiener in his butt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Evidence that supported the defense include Cowan pointing out that C.C. testified A.J. frequently lied. Initially, C.C. did not know whether to believe A.J. when he told her what Cowan had done. But C.C. also testified that, after speaking with A.J., she became convinced he was telling the truth. A.J. did not behave as he did when he was lying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Centeno\n   </em>\n   , the main thrust of the opinion was the prosecutor's use of a diagram showing the geographical outline of California.\n   <em>\n    Centeno\n   </em>\n   pointed out that \"[c]ourts have repeatedly cautioned prosecutors against using diagrams or visual aids to elucidate the concept of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" (\n   <em>\n    Centeno\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , 60 Cal.4th at p. 662,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=180%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20649\">\n    180 Cal.Rptr.3d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=338%20P.3d%20938\">\n    338 P.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The prosecutor argued that, even if the evidence of what the diagram showed was filled with inconsistencies, omissions and inaccuracies, the jury would have no reasonable doubt that the state was California. Our Supreme Court determined that the presentation constituted misconduct. It invited the jury to conclude without evidence that the diagram showed the state of California and failed to reflect the evidence in the case, which was \"far from definitive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 670,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=180%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20649\">\n    180 Cal.Rptr.3d 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=338%20P.3d%20938\">\n    338 P.3d 938\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Here the prosecutor's inaccurate definition of reasonable doubt left in the minds of the jurors an image as graphic as a map.
