There were certain liens upon the property. The sale was for cash, but for the conyenience of the parties new judgment bonds were given by the purchaser to these lien creditors, for the amount of their respective claims. Each of the judgment bonds thus given contained a recital that they were for the purchase-money of the property sold. A certain amount remained charged on the land, and another judgment was given to the guardian of the minor children of the decedent to secure their interest. The purchaser made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, and upon a sale of the real estate by the assignee, claimed his exemption of \u00a7300 out of the proceeds, which the court allowed. <em>Held, </em>that this was error.</headnotes>\n<otherdate data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b173-8\">May 6th 1879.</otherdate>\n<judges data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"Acs\">Before Sharswood, C.

Wiley, Esq., guardian of the children of said Andrew Stewart, deceased, for $687.02, which was two-thirds of the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate of said Andrew Stewart, deceased, remaining after payment of his debts, and which money was, in fact, never paid by said Henry Andrews to said administratrix, but said William B. Wiley, Esq., guardian, as aforesaid, took said Henry Andrews\u2019s judgment as .security for the same, and it formed part of. the consideration of the said purchase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-7\">And that on April 7th 1875, another judgment was entered on a bond containing warrant of attorney, &amp;c., against said Henry Andrews, in favor of said Catharine Stewart, for $450.

Wiley, Esq., under which the sheriff levied on all the personal pi\u2019operty of said Henry Andrews, consisting of his household furniture and store goods. That said defendant claimed the benefit of the Act of Assembly of April 9th 1849, exempting property to the value of $300 from levy and sale under execution, and that under the provisions of said act all of said defendant\u2019s personal property was appraised at the sum of $120, and set apart for him, which property said defendant retained, and has ever since used and enjoyed as his own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-10\">Tha.t on October 25th 1877, said Henry Andrews and wife executed a deed of voluntary assignment of all the property and estate of said Henry Andrews, in trust for the benefit of the creditors of said assignor; which deed contains the following clause: \u201c Excepting and reserving real or personal estate to the value of $300, under Act of April 9th 1849.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b174-11\">That on November 10th 1877, the Court of Common Pleas of said Lancaster county, granted an order of sale under Act of 17th of February 1876, to said assignee, in pursuance and by virtue of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>which order he sold said premises, on which said three several judgments were liens, consisting of the house and lot of ground hereinbefore mentioned, on December 4th 1877, for $2800, subject to the ground-rent and dower, as above mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b175-6\">That said Henry Andrews, the assignor aforesaid, now claims the balance of his $300 exemption out of the proceeds of the real estate aforesaid, that is to say: such a sum, out of said proceeds, that if added to said sum of $120, the amount at which his said personal property was appraised, would together make $300.

J., inter alia, said: \u201cAre these judgments, judgments for purchase-money ? What constitutes a judgment for purchase-money under our statute? In Nottes\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 362, Woodward, J., says: \u2018Liens for purchase-money may be by mortgage, judgment, or by executory articles of bargain and sale, but they are always created in favor of vendors, and exist for their protection and benefit, or that of their assignees or other legal representatives. The possessors of such liens are a well-defined class of creditors. They are those who have parted with their lands in consideration of the price agreed to be paid. The sound principle (said he), was, however, asserted in Stansall <em>v. </em>Robert, 13 Ohio R. 148, that a third person advancing money to the purchaser of real estate cannot claim a vendor\u2019s lien.\u2019 It is argued that this decision is overruled by, or in conflict with the later decision in Ulrich\u2019s Appeal, 12 Wright 489. We do not so understand it. * * * In the case before us the administratrix of the estate of Andrew Stewart, deceased, under and by virtue of an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, was the vendor of the real estate. Henry Andrews was the purchaser. \u2022 These judgment-creditors cannot claim, in the character of vendors, they never had any interest in or title to the property sold. They are, therefore, the loan-creditors of Henry Andrews, and nothing more; their liens are the liens of third parties loaning Henry Andrews money, to pay for real estate purchased by him from the administratrix of the estate of Andrew Stewart, deceased. And the fact that they have called the money loaned, in each bond, the purchase-money of a house and lot therein designated, to which they never had title, never sold or conveyed, does not make it so. Said judgments, in our opinion, not being liens for the purchase-money of real estate, do not prevent or preclude Henry Andrews, the assignor, from claiming and receiving out of the funds, in the hands of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>assignee, the sum of $180, the balance of the $300 reserved by him in his assignment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-6\">In accordance with this, our judgment, we do, therefore, direct, order and decree, that in the distribution of the funds in the hands of the assignee, he shall first pay to Henry Andrews the balance of his claim, excepted and reserved in the deed of assignment, under the Exemption Law of April 9th 1849, to wit: the sum of $180, and that he shall distribute the balance of the funds among the judgment-creditors, in the order of their priority of lien at the time of the assignment.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b176-7\">From this decree this appeal was taken.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-8\"><em>\u2022I. Hay Brown, </em>for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2q\">The children of Andrew Stewart were not strangers lending money to Henry Andrews to pay for the property purchased. They were the owners of the property sold, the vendors of Henry Andrews, so to speak; and all that Nottes\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 361, and similar cases decide, is \u201c that a third person, advancing money to the purchaser of real estate, cannot claim a vendor\u2019s lien.\u201d If they as the former owners of the property sold, allowed, through their guardian, their share of the purchase-money to remain in the property sold, the judgment given by Henry' Andrews, the vendee, to secure the payment of the same, is in every sense of the word a judgment for purchase-money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-9\">In Ulrich\u2019s Appeal, 12 Wright 489, judgments not given directly to the vendor, but to strangers who advanced money to pay for the property, were found.by the court to be for purchase-money, and as such it was held that the defendant could not claim the benefit of the Act of April 9th 1849, against them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b176-10\"><em>J. B. (rood </em>and <em>M. Brosius, </em>for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxM\">Liens for purchase-money are always created in favor of vendors, and for their protection. The possessors of such liens are a well-defined class of creditors. They are those who have parted with their lands in consideration of the price agreed to be paid: Nottes\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 361; Stansell <em>v. </em>Robert, 13 Ohio R. 148; Dungan <em>v. </em>Am. Life Insurance Co., 2 P. F. Smith 253.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-11\">The children of Andrew Stewart, deceased, are not vendors in this case. The real estate of their father descended to them heavily encumbered with liens. It was the duty of the administi-atrix to sell: Act of 24th February 1834, Pamph. L. 76; Purdon 427, pi. 110. The administratrix who sold under- order of court for the payment of debts was the vendor.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AEQ\">June 23d 1879.</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b176-12\">Mr. Justice Paxson</author>\n<p id=\"AXD\">delivered the opinion of the court,</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">We need not discuss the question whether the judgment of the appellant against Henry Andrews for. $687.02, is a purchase-money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>judgment as to other lien-creditors. We have only to consider it as between the parties. The judgment is clearly a part of the consideration Andrews was to pay for the real estate. The administratrix sold' the latter in pursuance of an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, for the sum of $3800. There were certain liens upon the property; one in favor of Abram Denlinger for $1500, and one in favor of Catharine Stewart for $450. The sale was for cash, but for the convenience of the parties, new judgments were given by the purchaser to Denlinger and Catharine Stewart for the amount of their respective claims; $343.51 remained charged upon the land for the benefit of the widow, and the judgment of $687.02 was given to the appellant as guardian of the minor children to secure their interest. Andrews, the purchaser, having made an assignment for the benefit of creditors, claimed, and was allowed $120' exemption out of his personal estate, and now demands the balance of the exemption, $180, out of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate. To allow it would reduce the fund applicable to the plaintiff\u2019s judgment by a corresponding amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">That there is no equity in his claim is manifest. He has not paid for the property out of which he claims the exemption, and he seeks to get it from the parties to whom the purchase-money belongs, to wit, the minor children of Andrew Stewart, deceased, the intestate, whose property was sold and purchased by Andrews. There is no exemption as to purchase-money creditors, the proviso expressly excepting such debts from the operation of the enacting clause of the statute: Nottes\u2019s Appeal, 9 Wright 361; Ulrich\u2019s Appeal, 12 Id. 489. The appellee contends, however, that the appellant\u2019s judgment was not for purchase-money. In this he is flatly contradicted by his own bond, which contains this clause: \u201cThe same being for purchase-money on house and lot of ground, southwest corner of West Orange and Mulberry streets, Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\u201d While it may be that in a contest between lien-creditors, this statement in the bond might not amount to much,\u2018yet, as between the parties it is important. As to them, it is an agreement that the judgment shall have the force and effect of a purchase-money lien. We are of opinion that it amounts to an estoppel, and that the application of this principle meets the justice of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">The decree is reversed at the cost of the appellee; and it is now ordered and decreed that the said sum of $180 be distributed to the lien-creditors in the order of their priority.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
