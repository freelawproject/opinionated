Price against William S. Kirk.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-13\">The claimed filed set forth:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-14\">\u201c The amount claimed to be due is $195, for drawings, plans and specifications, and for labor and services in and about directing and overseeing the same, furnished from October 5th 1874, to November 29th 1875, by the claimant as an architect, for and about the erection and construction of said building.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-15\">The defendant pleaded that the work and labor set forth in the claim were not the subject of a mechanic\u2019s lien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-16\">The case was heard without a jury by Butler, P. J., who found the following facts:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-17\">\u201c That the plaintiff is an architect; that his claim is for preparing drawings and specifications for the house against which his lien <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>is entered and (in his own language) three visits to West Chester to locate the building and explain the drawings to mechanics. We find, however, that he visited West Chester but once to explain the drawings; that this was before the building was commenced and consumed a very short period of time. He did not superintend the construction of the house or have anything to do with it, other than has been stated.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-6\">The court also found that the lien was not filed in time, but this question was not raised at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-7\">In an opinion the court, inter alia, said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-8\">\u201c It is difficult to see how plaintiff can be held to have performed \u2018work for or about the construction of the building.\u2019 The claim filed is for \u2018 drawings, plans and specifications, and for labor and services in and about directing and overseeing the same.\u2019 It is further stated that these plans were for the construction of a building. The drawings of plans and specifications of itself, is not \u2018 work\u2019 within the meaning of the statute; not work in the ordinary sense of the term. An architect is not a mechanic or laborer. The plaintiff here has no better claim to a lien than the scrivener who copies specifications or draws contracts for the building or the surveyor who draws the plan upon the ground. Judgment must, therefore, be entered for the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b48-9\">This action was assigned for error by the plaintiff who took this writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-10\"><em>R. Jones Monaghan, </em>for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AgH\">This case seems to be ruled by Bank <em>v. </em>Gries, 11 Casey 423. Services of the kind for which the plaintiff seeks the lien are embraced in the meaning of the statute. In rendering such services, a party certainly \u201c performs labor,\u201d and furnishes labor and skill. The labor is performed and labor and skill furnished \u201cfor erecting\u201d and \u201cconstructing\u201d a building: Knight <em>v. </em>Norris, 13 Minn. 473.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b48-11\"><em>William B. Waddell, </em>for defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZ\">It is submitted that the cases referred to by the plaintiff in error, were dependent on something more being done by the architect than merely drawing plans and specifications. He either superintended or assisted in superintending the erection of the building.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b48-12\">In Bank <em>v. </em>Gries, <em>supra, </em>the work was overseen and directed by the architect. See Rush <em>v. </em>Able, <em>post, </em>page 153.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"A1WU\">May 5th 1879,</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b48-13\">The judgment of the Supreme Court was entered</p>\n<author id=\"b48-14\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AKC\">Without referring to the finding of the court that it would appear from the record and evidence that the lien was not filed within the time provided by the statute, we are of opinion that upon the facts'as found by the learned judge, to whom it was submitted without the intervention of a jury, the plaintiff had no lien. In Bank <em>v. </em>Gries, 11 Casey 423, the architect was employed not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>only to make plans and specifications for the building, but to direct and oversee its erection in accordance therewith. His claim, therefore, was for work done about the erection of the building within the words of the law. The mere drawing of the plan and writing' out the specifications is no more of this character than would be the work of an attorney in preparing the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
