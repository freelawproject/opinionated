After a preliminary examination, a magistrate held him to answer to the charge in respondent court. When an information accusing him of murder was filed, respondent court suspended the proceedings pending a determination of his present mental competence pursuant to Penal Code section 1368. The issue was tried by a jury, which found that he was competent to stand trial on the murder charge. He thereupon moved the court for an order setting aside the information, pursuant to Penal Code section 995, on the ground that he had not been legally committed by the magistrate because he had been mentally incompetent when the preliminary examination was conducted. He also requested an evidentiary hearing on the issue of his past incompetence as alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-10\">Respondent court denied the motion without conducting the requested hearing. Petitioner now seeks an appropriate writ which would require the court to grant the motion or to conduct the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>\n<em>The Record</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">The record made on the section 995 motion included a sworn declaration by petitioner\u2019s attorney in which she summarized the procedural sequence of his prosecution and described the preliminary ex\u00e1min\u00e1tion; the magistrate\u2019s minutes and a reporter\u2019s transcript of the examination; and psychiatric reports on petitioner which had been filed in the superi- or court before the motion was heard. These sources support the recitals captioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">\n<em>The Preliminary Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">In a complaint filed in the Municipal Court for the Central Judicial District of Marin County on April 22, 1980, petitioner was charged with having murdered Tracy Lee Jones on April 17 in violation of section 187 of the Penal Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A preliminary examination was conducted in that court on May 20. The prosecution presented evidence supporting the inferences that petitioner had shot and killed Tracy Lee Jones on April 17, and that he had then attempted to commit suicide. Petitioner presented no evidence. The magistrate ordered him held to answer for murder as charged in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Petitioner\u2019s behavior was aberrant and disruptive throughout the preliminary examination. He appeared in shackles, which the magistrate ordered removed over the objection of a custodial officer who stated that petitioner had \u201callegedly committed some injuries upon himself.\u201d Petitioner then addressed the magistrate in a rambling discourse on irrelevant subjects. He also expressed dissatisfaction with his attorney (a deputy public defender), and said that he did not \u201cwant to live.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">The magistrate conducted an <em>in camera </em>hearing on petitioner\u2019s complaints about his attorney. Petitioner and the attorney were present at the <em>in camera </em>hearing, but the magistrate excluded the prosecutor on defense counsel\u2019s representation that \u201cit would be appropriate to conduct the inquiry in that way in order that the court may satisfy itself as to the ground or lack of grounds for Mr. Bayramoglu\u2019s dissatisfaction and simultaneously protect him and his privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>The magistrate made no order or comment after the <em>in camera </em>hearing had been concluded. When the preliminary examination was resumed at that point, petitioner interrupted and berated the prosecution\u2019s first witness. Moments later, he leaped from his chair and struggled with officers in a noisy and violent episode. When he had been subdued, he complained that he had been hit \u201con the head\u201d and that \u201cthey will kill me in the jail.\u201d The magistrate called an early recess for lunch \u201c[s]o that everyone can calm down,\u201d and ordered petitioner examined by a physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">When the proceedings were convened after the recess, the magistrate reported that petitioner had been examined as directed and that he had \u201cno significant injuries as a result of any event this morning whatsoever.\u201d He was less obstreperous during the afternoon session, but he again interrupted the proceedings on several occasions. In the public phases of the preliminary examination, no one referred at any time to the possibility that he was not mentally competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">\n<em>The Section 1368 Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The information charging petitioner with murder was filed in respondent court on June 2. When he appeared for arraignment on June 3, the court appointed the public defender to represent him; suspended the criminal proceedings; and made orders appointing Drs. Gutstadt and Blinder as \u201cMedical Examiners\u201d and directing them to examine petitioner \u201cto determine his mental competency <em>at the present </em>time\u201d (italics added) and \u201cto report ... to the court ... prior to June 23 ... . \u201d The record does not include a reporter\u2019s transcript of these proceedings, but it shows without dispute that the court acted pursuant to section 1368.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>Petitioner had meanwhile been confined in the Marin County jail. He was transferred from there to Atascadero State Hospital on June 10, before either court-appointed psychiatrist could examine him. He remained at Atascadero until June 25, when he was returned to the jail. Drs. Gutstadt and Blinder examined him separately, and filed written reports with the court, during the month of July.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Dr. Gutstadt reported that petitioner had been transferred to Atascadero State Hospital \u201cfor his own protection\u201d because his behavior in the jail had been \u201cpsychotic, agitated, and uncontrollable,\u201d and he had \u201cappeared to be compulsed [sze] to kill himself.\u201d Dr. Gutstadt further stated, however, that \u201c[a]t this point ..., there is no evidence to suggest that the manifestations of Mr. Bayramoglu\u2019s psychotic process are such that he is unable to understand the nature of the proceedings against him or that he is unable to cooperate with his attorney and assist in his own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Dr. Blinder reported his opinions that petitioner was \u201cclearly psychotic,\u201d and that his understanding of the charges against him, and his ability to participate in the court proceedings and to cooperate with counsel, were \u201cintermittent and rather tenuous\u2014sufficient for him to be found insane within the meaning of Section 1368 ... .\u201d Dr.. Blinder deferred to the judgment of petitioner\u2019s attorney in some respects, but he recommended that petitioner \u201cbe found mentally incompetent for reasons stated in Section 1368 . .. .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">In August, on motion by petitioner\u2019s attorney, the trial court relieved her as defense counsel and appointed another attorney to represent petitioner in the section 1368 proceedings. A jury trial on the issue of his competence was commenced on October 2. He called as witnesses his original attorney, Drs. Blinder and Gutstadt, and two other experts. In a verdict returned on October 7, the jury found that \u201cthe defendant <em>is </em>mentally competent to be tried for the criminal offense charged against him.\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Petitioner was arraigned on the information two days later. His original (and present) attorney again appeared as defense counsel. He entered pleas of not guilty and not guilty by reason of insanity. Pursuant to section 1027, respondent court made orders appointing Drs. Blinder and Gutstadt as \u201cMedical Examiners\u201d and directing them to examine petitioner and report to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">\n<em>The Section 995 Motion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Petitioner\u2019s motion for an order setting aside the information, pursuant to section 995, was filed on November 14. It was made on the ground that he \u201chad not been legally committed by the magistrate\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because he had been incompetent, \u201cas a result of mental disorder,\u201d when the preliminary examination was conducted on May 20. The moving papers included an express request for an evidentiary hearing \u201con the issue of his competency\u201d at that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">On January 5, 1981, before petitioner\u2019s motion was heard, Drs. Blinder and Gutstadt filed separate written reports in which each stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>that he had reexamined petitioner pursuant to the orders made in the arraignment proceedings. Each reported his conclusion that petitioner had been psychotic when the homicide was committed and afterward.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">The motion was heard on January 9, 1981. Petitioner\u2019s attorney made an extensive oral presentation of the events summarized above. She referred to a sealed transcript of the <em>in. camera </em>hearing conducted by the magistrate during the preliminary examination, and asked respondent court to read it. She also asked leave to present testimony by one Jan Jackson, whom she identified as \u201cthe Criminal Justice Supervisor of the Mental Health Department.\u201d Counsel explained that Jackson had spent an hour and a half with petitioner during the recess after the disruptive episode at the preliminary examination, that she (Jackson) was consequently \u201cone of the few percipient witnesses to his mental state\u201d at that time, and that she would testify to her observations. The court stated that \u201cI have to first determine whether or not a hearing should be granted.\u201d The motion was thereupon taken under submission.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">On January 12, 1981, the court denied the motion in a minute order which stated only that \u201cDefendant\u2019s motion to set aside the information filed herein November 14, 1980 is denied.\u201d The court explained this ruling in a \u201cSupplemental Minute Order\u201d filed later on the same day.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">Petitioner commenced the present proceeding by filing a timely \u201cPetition For Writ Of Prohibition, And/Or Mandamus ...\u201d in this court. We stayed further proceedings below and issued an alternative writ of mandate. The Attorney General has filed a return on behalf of the People as real party in interest..</p>\n<p id=\"b678-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>\n<em>Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\"> The conduct of a preliminary examination when the defendant is mentally incompetent violates his right to due process of law. <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1975) 15 Cal.3d 221, 228 [124 Cal.Rptr. 57, 539 P.2d 817]; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1979) 91 Cal.App.3d 925, 930 [154 Cal.Rptr. 476]; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Municipal Court </em>(1974) 43 Cal.App.3d 809, 813 [118 Cal.Rptr. 120].) He is nevertheless unable to demonstrate his incompetence, as a bar to the preliminary examination before it occurs, because proceedings \u201cto determine mental competence may not be held until after the information ... has been filed.\u201d (\u00a7 1368.1, subd. (a); <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 226.) If he is found to be incompetent in such proceedings conducted after the information has been filed, he is entitled to have the information set aside, on his subsequent motion made pursuant to section 995, on the ground that he has not been lawfully committed. <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 81 Cal.App.3d 132, 134-137 [146 Cal.Rptr. 253]; see <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 809.)</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">The converse situation is presented here because petitioner was found to be competent in the section 1368 proceedings conducted in respondent court. After it had been determined in those proceedings that he was <em>presently </em>competent for purposes of section 1368, he made his section 995 motion on the ground that he had not been \u201clegally committed\u201d by the magistrate because he had not been competent when his preliminary examination was conducted <em>previously. </em>The first question is whether he waived the right to make the section 995 motion, on that ground, when he waited as described.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">Section 1368, subdivision (c), provides that \u201can order for a hearing into the present mental competence of the defendant\u201d shall operate to suspend \u201call proceedings\u201d in his prosecution \u201c[ejxcept as provided in Section 1368.1.\u201d Section 1368.1, subdivision (a), provides in pertinent part that he \u201cmay\u201d make a motion pursuant to section 995 \u201ceven though\u201d a proceeding to determine his mental competence is \u201cpending.\u201d In the context of the statute, the word \u201cmay\u201d imports that he is <em>permitted </em>to make a section 995 motion while section 1368 proceedings are pending but that he is not <em>required </em>to do it at that time. (See <em>Ostrander </em>v. <em>City of Richmond </em>(1909) 155 Cal. 468, 470 [101 P.452]; <em>In re Marriage of Banks </em>(1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 631, 634 [117 Cal.Rptr. 37]; compare <em>Uhl </em>v. <em>Badaracco </em>(1926) 199 Cal. 270, 282 [248 P. 917].) There is accordingly nothing in the statutory scheme commanding the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>conclusion that he waives the right to make the motion if he waits until the section 1368 proceedings are concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">The defendant in <em>Miller </em>allowed section 1368 proceedings to run their course without making a section 995 motion, but they produced a determination that he was currently incompetent for purposes of section 1368 and he made a section 995 motion after he had subsequently been found competent and his prosecution had been resumed in the superior court. (See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 132 at p. 134.) <em>Miller </em>therefore sheds no light on the present question of waiver because it did not arise in that case. It did not arise in <em>Hale </em>or <em>Chambers </em>because the issue decided in each case was joined before section 1368 proceedings were commenced. (See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 221 at p. 223; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 809 at p. 811.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">In <em>Hale, </em>however, the defendant claimed a denial of due process in the operation of the language of section 1368.1, subdivision (a), which the Supreme Court described as providing that \u201ca hearing into a felony defendant\u2019s mental competency may not be held until an indictment or information has been filed against him.\u201d <em>(Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal.3d 221 at p. 223.) The court rejected this claim, holding that \u201c[rjather than denying due process, the statute promotes it by insuring that a felony defendant will not be committed for incompetency unless there is <em>probable cause </em>to believe he committed the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>{Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The <em>Hale </em>holding effectively establishes that the provision of section 1368.1, subdivision (a), which authorizes a felony defendant to make a section 995 motion notwithstanding the pendency of section 1368 proceedings, was intended by the Legislature to permit him to challenge the information on the second ground provided in section 995\u2014i.e., that he has been \u201ccommitted without ... probable cause\u201d (see fn. 5, ante)\u2014with a view to avoiding commitment pursuant to section 1368 if his challenge on that ground is sustained and his prosecution is terminated accordingly. (See <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>15 Cal. 3d 221 at p. 226; Parker, <em>California\u2019s New Scheme For The Commitment of Individuals Found Incompetent To Stand Trial </em>(1975) 6 Pacific L.J. 484, 490, 496; <em>Review of Selected 1974 California Legislation </em>(1975) 6 Pacific L.J. 125, 276.) It follows that he does not waive his right to challenge the information on the first ground provided in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>995\u2014i.e., that he was not \u201clegally committed\u201d by the magistrate (see fn. 5)\u2014if he defers to the section 1368 proceedings and makes his section 995 motion, on that ground, after they have been concluded. This is what petitioner did. He did not waive his right to make the motion by waiting.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\">The second question is whether the determination that petitioner was competent, reached in the section 1368 proceedings, foreclosed him from asserting on the section 995 motion that he had been incompetent when his preliminary examination was conducted five months earlier. The statutory scheme includes no language commanding this result, and it explicitly provides that section 1368 proceedings are to be commenced after a preliminary inquiry concerning \u201cthe mental competence of the defendant <em>at that point in time\u201d </em>(\u00a7 1368, subd. (a), italics added.) It also includes an explicit provision that the issue to be determined in the section 1368 proceedings is \u201cthe question of the <em>present </em>mental competence of the defendant .. . (\u00a7 1368, subd. (c), italics added.) Respondent court\u2019s order appointing Drs. Gutstadt and Blinder, on June 3, consequently directed them to examine petitioner \u201cto determine his mental competency <em>at the present time .. . </em>(Italics added.) The reports they filed in July were framed in the present tense, and neither referred to petitioner\u2019s competence when the preliminary examination was conducted in May.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The statutory scheme is also explicit in contemplating that a finding that a defendant is mentally incompetent at one point (i.e., at a given \u201cpoint in time\u201d), which will result in the suspension of his prosecution, may be followed by his \u201crestoration to competence\u201d which will require its resumption. (See \u00a7 1370, subd. (a)(1); \u00a7 1372, subds. (a)(1) and (a)(2); see also \u00a7 1370, subd. (b)(1) [providing for periodic examinations of a committed defendant and reports on his \u201cprogress toward recovery of mental competence\u201d].) The scheme thus demonstrates an acknowledgement by the Legislature that mental incompetence may be intermittently episodic, and mental competence intermittently recurrent, in the context of a criminal prosecution. It follows that an adjudication that a defendant <em>is </em>competent at one point in his prosecution (i.e., at one \u201cpoint in time\u201d) does not establish that he <em>was </em>competent at another. The result reached in the section 1368 proceedings therefore did not foreclose petitioner from subsequently challenging the information on the ground that he had been incompetent when the preliminary examination was conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>At least one of the first psychiatric reports on petitioner expressly supported an inference that his mental competence in July was \u201cintermittent.\u201d The later reports supported an inference that he had been incompetent (\u201cpsychotic\u201d) between the commission of the homicide in April and his transfer to Atascadero State Hospital in June. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>The preliminary examination was conducted during that period. The record of the examination, and counsel\u2019s account of it, supported a specific inference that petitioner was incompetent on May 20. In sum, his section 995 motion was accompanied by a substantial prima facie showing that he was mentally incompetent when the preliminary examination was conducted. If he can establish that fact, the motion should be granted on the ground that he \u201chad not been legally committed\u201d by the magistrate. (\u00a7 995; see <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>supra, 15 Cal.3d 221 at p. 228; <em>Stevenson </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>91 Cal.App.3d 925 at p. 930; <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>81 Cal.App.3d 132 at pp. 134, 137; <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Municipal Court, supra, </em>43 Cal.App.3d 809 at p. 813.) He is entitled to an evidentiary hearing, on the motion, at which he may present testimony and other evidence to establish the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">An evidentiary hearing on the section 995 motion will be conducted pursuant to the writ of mandate ordered below. The sealed transcript of the <em>in camera </em>hearing before the magistrate was made available to this court at oral argument. Respondent court has not read it (see fn. 5, <em>ante), </em>and the People objected to our inspecting it on the ground that they should be entitled to see it and to cross-examine on its contents. Whether it should be read for evidence of petitioner\u2019s mental competence on May 20, and the People\u2019s objection, are matters to be decided in the discretion of respondent court when the evidentiary hearing is conducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">A peremptory writ of mandate will issue commanding respondent court to set aside its order denying the section 995 motion and to conduct further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">Caldecott, P. J., and Poch\u00e9, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied September 30, 1981, and the petition of real party in interest for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied October 28, 1981.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Dates mentioned refer to the calendar year 1980 except where another year is shown.
