Petitioner\u2019s application was in the form required by California Rules of Court, rule 982(a)(17).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On her application petitioner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1065\">*1065</page-number>marked the appropriate box labeled 2(a) to establish that she was receiving financial assistance under the aid to families with dependent children program.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">On that same day respondent court filed an order granting the application in part and denying it in part. Petitioner was permitted to proceed in action No. 67092 without payment of any court fees or costs listed in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), except for a library fee of $7 and a reporter\u2019s fee of $12. No reasons were given in the order for denying the application in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Petitioner paid the library fee and the reporter\u2019s fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-7\">On July 30, 1981, petitioner filed a writ of mandate in this court seeking to compel respondent court to grant her application as to all fees listed in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), and to grant all similar applications in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-8\">On August 10, 1981, respondent court filed an order <em>sua sponte </em>in action No. 67092 directing that the court reporter\u2019s fee of $12 be refunded to petitioner. In that order the respondent court held that in the future all of the fees and costs listed in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), will be waived when box 2(a) on an application pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 982(a)(17), is marked.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-9\">The library fee paid by petitioner has not been refunded by respondent court.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b871-11\">The Constitution of the State of California vests in the Judicial Council the power to \u201cadopt rules for court administration, practice and procedure, not inconsistent with statute.\u201d (Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 6.) (1) The Rules of Court promulgated by the Judicial Council have the force of positive law and must be complied with provided they do not conflict with any act of the Legislature. <em>(Brooks </em>v. <em>Union Trust etc. Co. </em>(1905) 146 Cal. 134, 138 [79 P. 843]; cf. <em>In re Marriage of McKim </em>(1972) 6 Cal.3d 673, 678, fn. 4 [100 Cal.Rptr. 140, 493 P.2d 868].)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1066\">*1066</page-number>In Government Code section 68511.3<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the Legislature directed the Judicial Council to formulate and adopt rules of court to enable litigants to proceed in forma pauperis. Government Code section 68511.3 requires \u201cthat permission to proceed in forma pauperis be granted ... to litigants who declare under penalty of perjury that they are receiving benefits pursuant to ... the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program ....\u201d (Gov. Code, \u00a7 68511.3, subd. (5)(a).) Government Code section 68511.3 also requires, \u201c... in the event of a denial of such permission, a written statement detailing the reasons for denial and an evidentiary hearing where there is a substantial evidentiary conflict. ..(Gov. Code, \u00a7 68511.3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Pursuant to the statutory mandate in Government Code section 68511.3, the Judicial Council adopted rule 985, California Rules of Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The above quoted provisions of Government Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1067\">*1067</page-number>68511.3 are incorporated in California Rules of Court, rules 985(b) and 985(d). California Rules of Court, rule 985, is therefore consistent with statutory law, and strict compliance with that rule is required. <em>{Brooks </em>v. <em>Union Trust etc., Co., supra, </em>146 Cal. at p. 138.)</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">California Rules of Court, rule 985, provides that when the court grants an application to proceed in forma pauperis the applicant shall be relieved of the requirement that he or she pay the fees and costs listed in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i). The issue before this court is what fees and costs are included in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1068\">*1068</page-number>This court rejects the argument of respondent that California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), should be construed narrowly to exclude library fees (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6320 et seq.), judges\u2019 retirement fees (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26822.3) and mediation fees (Gov. Code, \u00a7 26840.3) (hereafter \u201cdisputed fees\u201d). One category of fees and costs which are waived under subdivision (i) on appropriate application is \u201cClerk\u2019s fees for filing papers.\u201d (Cal. Rules of Court, rule 985(i)(l).) California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), encompasses any fee which an indigent must pay in order to take any step which is essential to initiating or maintaining a civil action. (Cf. Cal. Rules of Court, rule 985(i), with rules 985(b) and 985(j).) The disputed fees were required to be paid to the county clerk before petitioner could initiate her action in superior court. (Gov. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 6100, 26820, 26822.3, 26840.3, Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 6321.) Therefore, the disputed fees come within the class of fees and costs which are waivable under California Rules of Court, rule 985(i). Furthermore, since the county clerk was required to collect the disputed fees before petitioner would be allowed to file her action, those fees amount to \u201cClerk\u2019s fees for filing papers\u201d and come within the express language of California Rules of Court, rule 985(i)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">Respondent contends that if the Judicial Council had intended the disputed fees to be included in the fees waived pursuant to California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), the Judicial Council would have included in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), the term \u201ctotal fees\u201d as defined in Government Code section 26820.6.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> California Rules of Court, rule 985, became effective on the same day that Government Code section 26820.6 became effective. When the Judicial Council drafted California Rules of Court, rule 985, the term \u201ctotal fees\u201d had not been defined by any established law. Therefore, the absence of the phrase \u201ctotal fees\u201d from California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), does not establish that the Judicial Council intended to exclude the disputed fees from rule 985(i). Therefore, respondent\u2019s contention is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1069\">*1069</page-number>Petitioner filed in respondent court the appropriate application for permission to proceed without payment of the court costs and fees specified in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i). California Rules of Court, rule 985, required respondent court to waive the requirement that petitioner pay all fees included in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i). As discussed above, library fees constitute one of the fees encompassed by California Rules of Court, rule 985(i). Respondent granted the application in part but erroneously required petitioner to pay a library fee of $7. Therefore, the trial court abused its discretion when it required petitioner to pay a library fee of $7.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b875-5\">It would be inappropriate to grant petitioner\u2019s request to issue a writ directing respondent to approve in the future all applications to waive the payment of the fees listed in California Rules of Court, rule 985(i), which are supported by affidavits establishing that the applicants are indigent, unless there is good cause to doubt the truthfulness of said affidavits. Such a writ would merely direct respondent to conform to the law as declared in this opinion. Mandamus should not issue upon the possibility that respondent will act contrary to the law. (Cf. <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Rolph </em>(1920) 184 Cal. 557, 562-564 [194 P. 1005]; <em>Northridge etc. Water Dist. </em>v. <em>McDonell </em>(1958) 158 Cal.App.2d 123, 127 [322 P.2d 25].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">Respondent\u2019s argument that the petition in this action should be denied because petitioner failed to petition the superior court for relief is meritless. The application filed by petitioner pursuant to California Rules of Court, rules 982(a)(17) and 985, was made to the superior court and denied. Another request to the superior court would be futile. (Cf. <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1972) 24 Cal.App.3d 492, 495 [101 Cal.Rptr. 227].)</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Petitioner is entitled to appropriate relief. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1085; see <em>Whitney\u2019s at the Beach </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 3 Cal.App.3d 258, 266 [83 Cal.Rptr. 257].) A peremptory writ of mandate is proper and should issue. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1088, <em>Goodenough </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1971) 18 Cal.App.3d 692, 697 [96 Cal.Rptr. 165].)</p>\n<p id=\"b876-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1070\">*1070</page-number>Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the Merced County Superior Court to vacate its \u201corder on application for waiver of court fees and costs\u201d filed in Merced County Superior Court action No. 67092 on July 23, 1981, to enter a new order in said action granting in accordance with this decision petitioner\u2019s \u201capplication for waiver of court fees and costs\u201d filed in said action on July 23, 1981, and to enter an order in said action directing the County Clerk of Merced County to refund to petitioner the $7 petitioner paid as a library fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Insofar as the petition requests relief in addition to that granted above, said petition is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b870-13\">Before Franson, Acting P.
