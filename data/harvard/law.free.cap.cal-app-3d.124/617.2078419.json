J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATA\">Petitioner seeks a writ of mandate directing the Appellate Department of the Orange County Superior Court to vacate its order disqualifying the State Labor Commissioner from representing petitioner in an appeal from a judgment of .the municipal court denying him severance pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">For more than eight years petitioner was an ordained minister of the Worldwide Church of God, Inc.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (church or real party in interest), receiving compensation for his services from the church. In April 1979 he was discharged for alleged insubordination, heresy and disloyalty to the church. He was promised one week of severance pay for each year of service if he returned all property of the church to it and caused no further confusion or division within the church. Thereafter petitioner filed a complaint with the Labor Commissioner<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> claiming the church owed him $11,936.38 in unpaid wages and benefits.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> After hearing, the Labor Commissioner awarded petitioner $3,269 in severance pay and denied, his other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Real party appealed the award to the municipal court pursuant to Labor Code section 98.2 which provides for review by a de novo hearing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Presumably at petitioner\u2019s request, the Labor Commissioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>undertook to represent petitioner in the de novo proceedings pursuant to section 98.4<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> after determining that petitioner met the statutory condition that he be \u201cfinancially unable to afford counsel.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">In the de novo proceedings real party filed a motion for summary judgment and a motion to disqualify or, in the alternative, to enjoin the Labor Commissioner from representing petitioner. Real party\u2019s motion for summary judgment was granted. There was no formal ruling on the disqualification/injunction motion although apparently the trial court indicated that it would have denied that motion. Summary judgment was entered in favor of real party.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">Petitioner, still represented by the Labor Commissioner, then appealed the municipal court judgment to the appellate department of respondent superior court. Real party filed a motion to disqualify and/ or enjoin the commissioner from representing petitioner on the appeal on grounds that: (1) section 98.4 does not authorize representation of a claimant by the Labor Commissioner on appeal from the judgment rendered in the de novo proceedings, so representation of petitioner by the commissioner in the appeal would constitute an illegal expenditure of state funds; (2) the commissioner\u2019s representing the petitioner in the appeal would be violative of the establishment and free exercise of religion clauses of the state and federal Constitutions; and (3) in any event petitioner was financially able to afford counsel and was therefore ineligible for representation by the Labor Commissioner under section 98.4. Petitioner opposed the disqualification motion on numerous bases, including that the court lacked jurisdiction to grant the relief requested. By minute order the appellate department issued its ruling, stating: \u201cThis Court has determined that it does have jurisdiction to grant the relief requested and the motion to disqualify the State Labor Commissioner from representing [petitioner] on Appeal is granted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">\n<em>Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">On review petitioner first asserts that the order precluding the commissioner from representing petitioner in the appeal is, in effect, an injunction and contends: (1) that an appellate court is not authorized to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>issue injunctions and (2) that Code of Civil Procedure section 526, subdivision 4 prohibits the issuance of this injunction because the injunction would \u201cprevent the execution of a public statute by officers of the law for the public benefit.\u201d Next, petitioner contends the appellate department lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because the motion was, in effect, an attempt to take a belated appeal or cross-appeal from the \u201cdenial\u201d of real party\u2019s disqualification motion in the municipal court. Petitioner also urges the court was without authority to entertain the motion because granting it would be an unwarranted interference with the attorney-client relationship. Finally petitioner contends that even if the appellate department had jurisdiction to entertain the motion, its determination was erroneous as a matter of law because section 98.4 does authorize the Labor Commissioner to represent an applicant on appeal from a judgment entered in the de novo proceedings; the commissioner\u2019s doing so in this case does not violate the establishment or free exercise of religion clauses of the state or federal Constitutions; and the commissioner\u2019s determination that petitioner was \u201cfinancially unable to afford counsel\u201d was not subject to review by the court in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">Petitioner\u2019s initial contentions are not meritorious. His final contention, however, is sound and dispositive. Accordingly, a peremptory writ of mandate will issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">\n<em>Initial Contentions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">Petitioner\u2019s contention that the appellate department as an appellate court is unauthorized to issue an injunction and that the code prohibits issuance of an injunction preventing a public officer from exercising his statutory duty are both founded on the premise that the court\u2019s order was an injunction. The premise is incorrect, and the contentions fail. What real party sought was either an order disqualifying the commissioner or, in the alternative, an order enjoining the commissioner from representing petitioner. Although they would have the same effect, the two modes of relief are distinct (see 1 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (2d ed. 1970) Attorneys, \u00a7 56, p. 64), and the court did not issue an injunction; it simply granted the motion for disqualification of the commissioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">Equally unmeritorious is the contention that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion because it constituted a belated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>appeal or cross-appeal from the denial of real party\u2019s disqualification motion in the municipal court. In the first place, we have considerable doubt that real party\u2019s motion in the municipal court was actually ruled on. More importantly, however, although a number of the arguments were the same, the motion made in the appellate department was a different motion than that made in the municipal court. It sought to preclude the commissioner from representing petitioner in the appeal as distinguished from the de novo hearing. One of the prime bases for the motion in the appellate department was that section 98.4, which authorizes the commissioner to represent an indigent claimant at the de novo hearing, does not authorize representation of a claimant by the commissioner on appeal. The motion in the appellate department was a new motion, not a belated appeal from the \u201cdenial\u201d of the motion in the municipal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">We also reject petitioner\u2019s contention, based on the sanctity of the attorney-client relationship, that the appellate department lacked jurisdiction to entertain the motion. As previously observed, one basis for the motion was that the statute does not authorize representation of a claimant by the Labor Commissioner on appeal. While we agree with petitioner that the commissioner\u2019s determination that petitioner was financially unable to afford counsel was not subject to review by the court, the question whether representation on appeal by the commissioner is authorized by the statute was a proper matter for judicial determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">\n<em>Judicial Review of Determination of Financial Eligibility for Representation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">Real party contends that the declarations in the record indicating that petitioner receives from his employment more than $2,000 a month, receives child support payments and has some valuable assets establish as a matter of law that petitioner is not \u201cfinancially unable to afford counsel\u201d as required by section 98.4 (see fn. 5, <em>ante). </em>It is pointed out that the only thing in the record to the contrary is a declaration by a deputy labor commissioner, unsupported by any factual averments, that she had determined that petitioner was eligible for representation by the commissioner under the statute. We do not pass upon the question of petitioner\u2019s financial eligibility as shown by the record because we have concluded that the determination by the Labor Commissioner that petitioner is financially unable to afford counsel is not subject to judicial review in these proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>We find dispositive <em>Ingram </em>v. <em>Justice Court </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 832 [73 Cal.Rptr. 410, 447 P.2d 650, 36 A.L.R.3d 1391], in which the Supreme Court held that when a public, defender is representing an accused at his request rather than by court appointment, the public defender\u2019s determination of the accused\u2019s indigency is not reviewable by the court in the proceeding occasioning the representation. <em>{Id., </em>at pp. 838-842.) Here, as there, the court was not called upon to appoint counsel, which would have imposed upon it the responsibility to determine financial eligibility. Here, as there, the statute reposes responsibility for determining financial eligibility in the governmental officer charged with the duty of affording representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Real party expresses the concern that if the determination of financial eligibility is not reviewable in these proceedings, the commissioner may with impunity disregard the statutory prerequisite as it is suggested was done in this case. However, it is not to be presumed that the Labor Commissioner will be anything less than conscientious in determining the financial eligibility of claimants under the statute. Moreover, the fact the the commissioner\u2019s determination of financial eligibility for representation is not judicially reviewable in the proceeding occasioning the representation does not mean that the commissioner\u2019s practices in this regard are free from scrutiny. As pointed out in the <em>Ingram </em>decision (69 Cal.2d at pp. 841-842), they are subject to appropriate review through the political process and, of course, the Labor Commissioner as a public officer is subject to suit for the illegal expenditure of public funds. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 526a; <em>Central Valley Chap. 7th Step Foundation </em>v. <em>Younger </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 212, 232 [157 Cal.Rptr. 117].)</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">\n<em>Statutory Authorization for the Commissioner to Represent Claimants on Appeal</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\"> When the statutory conditions are met, section 98.4 authorizes the Labor Commissioner to \u201crepresent such claimant <em>in the de novo proceedings </em>provided for in Section 98.2.\u201d (See fn. 5, <em>ante-, </em>italics added.) Real party would limit the authorization to representation at the de novo hearing. But the statutory language is not \u201chearing\u201d but, rather, \u201cproceedings.\u201d Real party argues that \u201cde novo proceedings\u201d literally means \u201ca new hearing or a hearing the second time\u201d and cannot possibly include appellate review of that hearing. That interpretation is possible in our view only because of the words following \u201cde novo proceedings,\u201d \u201cprovided for in section 98.2.\u201d Arguably the only \u201cproceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>ings provided for in section 98.2\u201d is a de novo hearing in the justice, municipal or superior court. (See fn. 4, <em>ante.) </em>That interpretation, however, flies in the face of the ordinary meaning of \u201cproceedings,\u201d and is contrary to both the statutory purpose and analogous decisions. Accordingly, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">As noted by the California Supreme Court in <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1903) 140 Cal. 1, 6 [73 P. 597]: \u201cTn its more general sense, in law, it [the word \u201cproceeding\u201d] means all the steps or measures adopted in the prosecution or defense of an action.\u2019\u201d In Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1951) \u201cproceeding\u201d is defined as \u201cincluding all possible steps in an action from its commencement to the execution of judgment.\u201d  Thus, a legal proceeding may well have several stages. The de novo proceedings referred to in section 98.2 and 98.4 obviously were intended to result in a judgment; a judgment imports a judgment correct under the law; and it will in some cases require an appeal to obtain a legally correct judgment. It is established that an appeal from the judgment entered in the de novo proceedings is appropriate <em>{Peer </em>v. <em>California Industries for the Blind, Inc. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 945 [157 Cal.Rptr. 464]), and there is nothing in either section 98.2 or 98.4 suggesting that an appeal from the judgment rendered in the de novo proceedings is not to be considered one stage of those proceedings. (Cf. <em>In re Jacqueline H. </em>(1978) 21 Cal.3d 170, 175-176 [145 Cal.Rptr. 548, 577 P.2d 683]; <em>In re Simeth </em>(1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 982 [115 Cal.Rptr. 617].)</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The best that can be said of real party\u2019s argument is that the statute is ambiguous in this regard.  In the event of ambiguity, however, a statute is to be construed in accordance with the legislative intent, and a strong indicator of legislative intent is the purpose of the statute. <em>{Klarfeld </em>v. <em>Berg </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 893, 900 [176 Cal.Rptr. 539, 633 P.2d 204]; <em>Cossack </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 732, 733 [114 Cal.Rptr. 460, 523 P.2d 260]; see <em>In re Jacqueline H., supra, </em>21 Cal.3d at pp. 174-175.)  The manifest purpose of section 98.4\u2019s authorizing the Labor Commissioner to represent claimants in the de novo proceedings is to insure that employees will not have to abandon wage claims already found legitimate at the administrative level on account of financial inability to pursue the claim in litigation. The statutory purpose would be largely defeated by an interpretation limiting the commissioner\u2019s authority to represent claimants to the de novo hearing itself. To serve its purpose, the statute must be construed to authorize representation of financially eligible claimants by the commissioner on appeal as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Both the <em>Jacqueline H. </em>and <em>Simeth </em>decisions, previously cited, indicate the propriety of this interpretation of the statute. In the <em>Simeth </em>case the question was whether the appellate court was authorized to appoint counsel on appeal by the statutes (primarily Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 634) authorizing court appointment of counsel for an indigent parent in certain juvenile court proceedings. Notwithstanding that the statute did not even mention an appeal and that its language seemed to make reference to the juvenile court hearing itself, the court concluded that the appointment of counsel on appeal was authorized by the statute. (40 Cal.App.3d at pp. 984-985.)</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In the <em>Jacqueline H. </em>case the question was whether Civil Code section 237.5 authorizing court appointment of counsel for an indigent parent in free-from-custody proceedings authorized court appointment of counsel for such a parent on appeal. The language of Civil Code section 237.5 referred far more plainly to the hearing in the trial court than does the statute with which we are concerned.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless the court held that appointment of counsel on appeal was authorized stating: \u201cAlthough Civil Code section 232 et seq. do not in express terms provide for the appointment of appellate counsel, the right to such appointment appears implicit in the Legislature\u2019s entire statutory scheme for the removal of children from the custody and control of their parents.\u201d (21 Cal.3d at p. 175.) We are not here concerned with the court appointment of counsel on appeal; however, the problem of statutory interpretation confronting us is virtually identical to those in the cited cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>Constitutionality of the Statute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Real party contends here as it did below that section 98.4 as applied constitutes an impermissible interference with the employment relationship between a church and its ministry, which is a matter of purely private ecclesiastical concern, and thus violates the establishment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>and free exercise clauses under state and federal Constitutions.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">It is of course true that the cited constitutional provisions preclude civil courts from adjudicating disputes over questions of church practice or religious discipline, faith or doctrines. \u201cHowever, when the dispute to be resolved is essentially ownership or right to possession of property, the civil courts appropriately adjudicate the controversy even though it may arise out of a dispute over doctrine or other ecclesiastical question, provided the court can resolve the property dispute without attempting to resolve the underlying ecclesiastical controversy. <em>(Eldership </em>v. <em>Church of God at Sharpsburg, </em>396 U.S. 367 [24 L.Ed.2d 582, 583, 90 S.Ct. 499]; <em>Presbyterian Church </em>v. <em>Hull </em>Church, 393 U.S. 440, 449 [21 L.Ed.2d 658, 665, 89 S.Ct. 601]; <em>In re Metropolitan Baptist Church of Richmond, Inc., </em>supra, 48 Cal.App.3d at pp. 858-859 [121 Cal.Rptr. 899]; see <em>Serbian Orthodox Diocese </em>v. <em>Milivojevich, supra, </em>426 U.S. at pp. 709-710 [49 L.Ed.2d at p. 163, 96 S.Ct. 2372]; <em>Samoan Congregational etc. Church in U.S. </em>v. <em>Samoan Congregational etc. Church of Oceanside, supra, </em>66 Cal.App.3d at pp. 75-77 [135 Cal.Rptr. 793]; cf. <em>Wheelock </em>v. <em>First Presb. Church, </em>119 Cal. 477, 482 [51 P. 841].)\u201d <em>(Presbytery of Riverside </em>v. <em>Community Church of Palm Springs </em>(1979) 89 Cal.App.3d 910, 920 [152 Cal.Rptr. 854], cert, den., 444 U.S. 974 [62 L.Ed.2d 389, 100 S.Ct. 469]; accord: <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Wolf </em>(1979) 443 U.S. 595, 602-603 [61 L.Ed.2d 775, 783-785, 99 S.Ct. 3020], cert. den. (1980) 444 U.S. 1080 [62 L.Ed.2d 763, 100 S.Ct. 1031.)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Real party argues that permitting the Labor Commissioner to represent its former minister in these proceedings constitutes an impermissible state involvement in religious affairs and will have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion\u2014the church\u2019s discharge of a minister who fails to abide by the tenets of the church. We believe not. The argument might be persuasive if the dispute were over the question of whether or not the church had the right to discharge petitioner, but no such question is involved. The only questions appear to be whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>church is required to pay severance pay conditionally promised and whether the conditions were performed. That is a contract matter that can be resolved without resolving the ecclesiastical controversy between petitioner and the church. We are unable to accept the argument that requiring a church to pay its discharged minister in accordance with its contract will have a significant chilling effect upon the church\u2019s exercise of its right to discharge its ministers on account of doctrinal or other ecclesiastical differences.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">\n<em>Disposition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue to the Appellate Department of the Superior Court in and for the County of Orange commanding it to vacate its order disqualifying the Labor Commissioner from representing petitioner on appeal.
