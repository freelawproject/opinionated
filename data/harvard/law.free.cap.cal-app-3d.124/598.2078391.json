The respondent on this appeal is her former husband, Joseph A. Brennan (Joseph).</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">We commence with the facts as detailed by Susan in her opening brief on appeal because their accuracy is not challenged by Joseph.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">Joseph and Susan were married on August 10, 1962, in Monrovia, California.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>After a marriage of thirteen years and five months, and the birth of two children, Joseph H. Brennan, age. eleven, and Keith S. Brennan, age eight, they separated on January 23, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">On January 29, 1976, Joseph filed a petition for dissolution of the marriage, and listed in his petition that there were 15 items of community property and no separate property.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">Susan was served with the dissolution papers in the early part of February 1976, along with an order to show cause restraining her from selling, transferring or disposing of community property.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\n<em>r</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">Joseph contacted Susan and in substance stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-8\">A. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to hire an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-9\">B. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you come with me to the office of my attorney, Laurence Clark, and let\u2019s discuss the case with him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\">C. \u201cI am bankrupt. The assets, except for the residence listed in the petition are worthless. The shares of Graphic Marking and Graphic Marketing Service are not worth the paper they are written on.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\">D. \u201cLet\u2019s go to Mr. Clark\u2019s office, my attorney, and whatever agreement you enter into will mean nothing, because I am doing all this to prevent you from losing the house where you and the children can live,\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\">E. \u201cIf we don\u2019t proceed at once and make some kind of a deal my creditors will surely take away the house and you\u2019ll be out in the street.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\">Susan went to Mr. Clark\u2019s office in Monterey Park, California, and Mr. Clark, acting as her husband\u2019s attorney, made the following statements:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\">A. \u201cI am going to be over fair with you.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\">B. \u201cI am going to talk your husband into letting you live in the house until the youngest child becomes eighteen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\">C. \u201cAt that time the house will be sold and you and your husband can divide the proceeds.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>D. \u201cI am the attorney for your husband\u2019s business and I can tell you that it\u2019s worthless.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">E. \u201cYou will receive spousal support of $600.00 for one (1) year, and then $400.00 a month for two (2) years, and after that the Court will retain jurisdiction for three and one-half (3-1/2) more years, a total of six (6) years.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">Susan asked Mr. Clark if that kind of support seemed sparse, and he responded: \u201cThat\u2019s all you would receive from the Court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">When Susan left the attorney\u2019s office she stated that she was displeased with what she had heard. Joseph then said: \u201cDon\u2019t hire a lawyer, don\u2019t do anything. Go along with me and you won\u2019t be sorry. And if I go through this bad period now and the company becomes successful you won\u2019t be sorry. In fact, let\u2019s go to Court on February 17, 1976, which is the date set for the Order To Show Cause hearing, don\u2019t hire a lawyer and we\u2019ll hire a lawyer and we\u2019ll enter into an agreement, but it won\u2019t mean anything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">Susan appeared in court on February 17, 1976, without an attorney. Her husband was present with his lawyer, Mr. Clark, and they told the commissioner that the parties had entered into an agreement, and a complete stipulation settling the entire case, in which [\u00edzc] Mr. Clark and Joseph entered into the following colloquy.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-8\">\u201cQ. Now, you\u2019re getting the stock of the two corporations, that is, Graphic Marking and Graphic Marketing; is that correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-9\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">\u201cQ. And you have a share, you\u2019re jointly and severally liable for that debt, to the best of your knowledge?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-11\">\u201cA. Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-12\">\u201cQ. But the book value of that stock, both stock, at this time is zero?</p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">\u201cA. Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-14\">\u201cQ. Has a negative book value.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>The court then requested Mr. Clark to prepare an interlocutory judgment reflecting the stipulation of the parties to date, plus the little Chico property, and to submit it to Susan for her signature prior to presentation to the court. Thereafter, Laurence Clark sent a proposed judgment to Susan and Susan contacted her husband and told him that she was not going to sign the proposed judgment, and stated to her husband as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-4\">\u201cI don\u2019t think that I am protected if I sign that agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">Joseph then said to her: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about what happened in Court. I\u2019ll advise Mr. Clark not to proceed, not to do anything. The whole matter will be dropped.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">In April 1978, approximately two and one-half years after the parties appeared in court, Susan received in the mail a notice that the interlocutory and final judgment had just been entered. She contacted Joseph and asked him why she was receiving papers. He said: \u201cDon\u2019t pay any attention to them, that\u2019s a mere formality.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">In June 1978, two months after he had arranged to have the interlocutory and final entered, Joseph came to Susan and stated that he was ill with high blood pressure and wished to reconcile. Susan told him that she was delighted and they lived together full time as husband and wife from June 1978 until June 1979. -</p>\n<p id=\"b562-8\">In June 1979, Susan and Joseph finally did separate. During the year that the parties were living together Joseph one day told Susan that the stock in his company was worth a minimum of $250,000. She said to him: \u201cI thought the stock was worthless?\u201d He said: \u201cWell we got lucky and found some new investors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">On November 6, 1979, Susan filed a notice of motion to set aside and vacate the interlocutory judgment of dissolution of marriage on the ground of fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">As reported earlier Joseph\u2019s response does not challenge the accuracy of Susan\u2019s factual allegations. Instead it is more in the form of a declaration by Joseph\u2019s attorney, Laurence E. Clark. The gist of the response is that Joseph and Susan came to his office and told him that they had reached an agreement concerning division of their community property. Based upon this so-called agreement he prepared a proposed interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>tory judgment of dissolution of marriage. On the day of trial Joseph, Susan and Mr. Clark appeared in court and Joseph took the stand. Under Mr. Clark\u2019s questioning Joseph stated that he and Susan had agreed to the terms of the interlocutory judgment and that in his opinion it was a fair and equitable division of the community property. The court then noted that Susan had not signed the proposed interlocutory judgment so she was asked if she read and understood it to which she responded \u201cYes.\u201d Susan was then asked by the court if she agreed to it and again her response was \u201cYes.\u201d The court then granted the interlocutory judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">Contentions of the Parties</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Susan on appeal argues that the above facts demonstrate that the interlocutory judgment was obtained through \u201cextrinsic fraud\u201d which she defines as conduct by Joseph and his attorney that deprived her of an opportunity to fully present her case in a court of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Susan is not seeking to set aside the dissolution of the marriage but only that part of the judgment awarding and dividing the community property and the support provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">Joseph contends Susan is not entitled to equitable relief because she had a reasonable opportunity to litigate her claims or defense. Any fraud occurring in the course of the action was intrinsic which does not entitle a party to equitable relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b563-9\">The two parties to this appeal have correctly stated the basic difference between extrinsic fraud and intrinsic fraud. The essence of extrinsic fraud is that a party has been denied by his opponent or otherwise an opportunity to be heard or to fully present a claim or defense. Intrinsic fraud or mistake on the other hand is not grounds for relief when such fraud or mistake \u201cgo to the merits of the prior proceedings, which should have been guarded against by the plaintiff at that time.\u201d <em>{In re Marriage of Wipson </em>(1980) 113 Cal.App.3d 136 [169 Cal.Rptr. 664].) While the distinction between extrinsic and intrinsic fraud is easily defined, the facts of a given case can often make it difficult to identify the fraud involved. This is the situation in our present case, however we are satisfied that extrinsic fraud does exist and that the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>We first address the problem of independent representation in a marriage dissolution proceeding because of its continuous appearance in appeals where fraud is an issue.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> When a fiduciary relationship exists between two parties and one gains advantage over the assets of another by way of a property settlement, gift, testamentary disposition or other means, the courts have uniformly held that independent legal advice to the disadvantaged party is not indispensable; however, it is a circumstance to be considered. <em>(Pfingst </em>v. <em>Goetting </em>(1950) 96 Cal.App.2d 293, 309 [215 P.2d 93].) Until 1975, California recognized that there was a fiduciary duty between spouses; however, the 1975 amendment to Civil Code section 5125 requires only that they act in good faith towards each other. In dissolution proceedings, the parties may elect to deal with each other at arms\u2019 length, and when they do so any fiduciary obligation otherwise owing is thereby terminated. <em>(In re Marriage of Connolly </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 590, 600 [153 Cal.Rptr. 423, 591 P.2d 911].) We do not believe this change in the duty owed by one spouse to the other necessarily modifies the abov\u00e9 rule as stated in <em>Pfingst </em>v. <em>Goetting, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.2d 293. In other words, we still agree that independent advice is not indispensable in a marriage dissolution proceeding, but it is a circumstance to be considered in determining whether fraud has been practiced on a disadvantaged party.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">\u201cThe extrinsic/intrinsic fraud rule is a doctrine developed in courts of equity governing the basis for successful collateral attack on a final judgment by way of an independent proceeding. The rule is that fraud internal to the adversary proceeding, such as perjury committed during trial or error or mistake during the trial, is intrinsic and is not a basis for relief; but fraud that prevented the trial of a claim or prevented the defrauded party from getting into court at all, is extrinsic to the proceeding and is a basis for relief. <em>Obviously, where there has been little or no judicial time invested in trial of a cause or an issue, </em>the factor of judicial economy which otherwise weighs in favor of finality is less strong, and the equitable considerations of fair hearing and of penaliz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>ing fraud weigh more compellingly.\u201d <em>(Los Angeles Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hughes Tool Co. </em>(1979) 95 Cal.App.3d 1, 7 [156 Cal.Rptr. 805].) (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">The court in <em>Pico </em>v. <em>Cohn </em>(1891) 91 Cal. 129 [25 P. 970, 27 P. 537] explains why extrinsic fraud justifies equitable relief, but intrinsic fraud does not: \u201cWhat, then, is an extrinsic or collateral fraud, within the meaning of this rule? Among the instances given in the books are such as these: Keeping the unsuccessful party away from the court by a false promise of a compromise, or purposely keeping him in ignorance of the suit; or where an attorney fraudulently pretends to represent a party, and connives at his defeat, or, being regularly employed corruptly sells out his client\u2019s interest....</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">\u201cIn all such instances the unsuccessful party is really prevented, by the fraudulent contrivance of his adversary, from having a trial; but when he has a trial, he must be prepared to meet and expose perjury then and there. He knows that a false claim or defense can be supported in no other way; that the very object of the trial is, if possible, to ascertain the truth from the conflict of the evidence, and that, necessarily, the truth or falsity of the testimony must be determined in deciding the issue. The trial is his opportunity for making the truth appear. If, unfortunately, he fails, being overborne by perjured testimony, and if he likewise fails to show the injustice that has been done him on motion for a new trial, and the judgment is affirmed on appeal, he is without remedy.\u201d (91 Cal. at pp. 133-134.)</p>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Dicta in <em>In re Marriage of Connolly, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 590, is also in point. Relief from a judgment dissolving petitioner\u2019s marriage pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 473 (fraud resulting in excusable neglect or mistake) was denied her because petitioner (wife) had an attorney and the facts established that husband and wife chose to deal with each other as legal adversaries. During negotiations wife, as distinguished from our present case, never relied on any relationship of confidentiality or mutual trust. The court in distinguishing <em>Vai </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1961) 56 Cal.2d 329 [15 Cal.Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247], stated (p. 601): \u201cThe present case differs. Here, after the dissolution action was filed, wife was never led to believe that she could or should rely on husband. The dispute over the property lasted almost three years, during which time wife and her counsel pursued their own independent investigation of the community property, ...\u201d The <em>Connolly </em>opinion does not disavow <em>Vai. </em>To the contrary it cites with approval a portion of <em>Vai </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>that succinctly captures the concept of our ruling here. The court stated (p. 601): . \u201cdiscovery is different from knowledge, [so] that where a party defrauded has received information of facts which should put him upon inquiry, and the inquiry if made would disclose the fraud, he will be charged with a discovery as of the time the inquiry would have given him knowledge.\u201d [Citation omitted.] \u201cThe circumstances must be such that the inquiry becomes a duty, and the failure to make it a negligent omission.\u201d [Citation omitted.] \u201cWhere no duty is imposed by law upon a person to make inquiry, and where under the circumstances \u2018a prudent man\u2019 would not be put upon inquiry, the mere fact that means of knowledge are open to a plaintiff, and he has not availed himself of them, does not debar him from relief when thereafter he shall make actual discovery.\u201d [Citation omitted.]\u2019 (P. 343.) Since the wife in <em>Vai </em>had been reasonably led by the affirmative actions of her husband to rely on him, under the circumstances she was not \u2018put on inquiry.\u2019\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\">We are satisfied that Susan did not have a trial or \u201cher day in court\u201d within the meaning of the above cases, and others. It is true Susan appeared in court but not to engage in battle. Relief is denied for intrinsic fraud because the very object of the trial is to ascertain the truth from the conflict of evidence. <em>{Pico </em>v. <em>Cohn, supra, </em>91 Cal. 129.) Susan, because of the representations of Joseph and his attorney, believed no trial was necessary. She was in court merely to put her stamp of approval on an agreement she briefly thought was fair due to her reliance on the representations made to her. In addition to Joseph\u2019s statements that they were bankrupt, that the business Graphic Marking and Graphic Marketing Services was worthless and that he was proceeding with the dissolution to prevent her from losing the house until the youngest child became 18, are the representations of Joseph\u2019s attorney. He said: \u201cI am going to be over fair with you .... I am going to talk your husband into letting you live in the house until the youngest child becomes eighteen. ... I am the attorney for your husband\u2019s business and I can tell you that it\u2019s worthless.\u201d When Susan questioned the fairness of the offered spousal support, he stated: \u201cThat\u2019s all you would receive from the court.\u201d Clearly these statements by Joseph and his attorney to Susan were designed primarily to prevent a trial of the issues normally contested in a dissolution proceeding. Although Susan was obviously naive in accepting their representations, this does not preclude her from raising the issue of extrinsic fraud. There was no meaningful judicial time invested in trial of a cause or an issue; therefore, as stated in <em>Los Angeles Airways, Inc. </em>v. <em>Hughes Tool Co., supra, </em>95 Cal.App.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>1, the equitable considerations for granting a hearing and penalizing fraud are quite compelling.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-4\">Joseph has relied heavily on a recent case by this division entitled <em>In re Marriage of Wipson, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d 136, where we denied similar relief on the grounds that the fraud was intrinsic and not extrinsic. The case is inapposite for two compelling reasons: We stated (p. 142): \u201cUsually when a party is represented by counsel and has the opportunity to appear and litigate his case, any fraud or mistake occurring in the proceeding is considered intrinsic. [Citation.]\u201d Susan was without counsel and for reasons stated above she did not have the opportunity to appear and litigate her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">Joseph next contends that the court was correct in denying Susan\u2019s motion because, like the wife in <em>Wipson, </em>she did not exercise due diligence in seeking relief. This is a puzzling argument in view of Joseph\u2019s rather strange behavior. To begin with, after the court hearing Joseph\u2019s attorney sent Susan a proposed judgment for her signature. She returned it to her husband stating that she did not think she would be protected if she signed the agreement. His response was, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about what happened in court. I\u2019ll advise Mr. Clark not to proceed, not to do anything. The whole matter will be dropped.\u201d Joseph then waited approximately two and one-half years before entering the interlocutory and final judgment of dissolution. Two months after the judgment was entered Joseph returned to Susan stating he wished to reconcile. Susan was delighted and they lived together for one full year. It was close to the end of this one-year period that Joseph told Susan that the stock in his company had a minimum worth of at least $250,000. A few months later, and after Joseph had left, Susan filed her notice to set aside and vacate the interlocutory judgment. The picture that emerges is that Susan continuously placed a great deal of faith in Joseph\u2019s actions and representations. His delay in filing the final judgment and his return to Susan for one full year undoubtedly led Susan to believe that he was acting in good faith. She wanted to believe him. She wanted the marriage to continue. There was no compelling reason for her to take any legal action prior to the last separation at which time he told her about the value of the business.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Finally, Joseph contends Susan must show that a more favorable result would probably result in a trial of the issues. <em>{In re Marriage of Wipson, supra, </em>113 Cal.App.3d 136.) Susan has made a prima facie showing in this respect. She had no hearing on her right to spousal sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>port. Whether she gets more support or the same when this issue is actually tried is not the question. What is important is that she have her day in court on a matter that can <em>only </em>be determined by a court.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">It is quite possible that the facts will establish that the stock of Graphic Marking and Graphic Marketing Service was valueless at the date of separation. On the other hand, it is also quite possible that evidence will establish it did have a market value. If this is the case, the division of the community property must be redetermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-5\">The judgment denying the motion is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">Stephens, Acting P. J., and Ashby, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b564-5\">This is not a case where Attorney Clark was representing both parties.
