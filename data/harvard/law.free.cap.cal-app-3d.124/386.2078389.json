He poses one issue which was raised in a motion pursuant to Penal Code section 1538.5, whether the use of a copy of his driver\u2019s license picture for confirming an eyewitness identification is a violation of his right to privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Federal drug enforcement agents met with their informant and a co-defendant in this case for the purpose of purchasing heroin. The codefendant was the link between the purchaser and the supplier, who subsequently was identified as defendant Herrera. The supplier drove to a predesignated location and exchanged heroin for money, the exchange being made with the codefendant who then gave the heroin to the agents. The agents were in the immediate proximity of the transaction and witnessed the exchange. This occurred on November 2, 1978, and November 7, 1978.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">During a surveillance after the first sale, it was determined that a suspect vehicle was registered to Carlos Herrera. Agent Plattos obtained a copy of defendant Herrera\u2019s driver\u2019s license from a fellow agent who had it in another investigation file. Agent Plattos confirmed that the person pictured on the driver\u2019s license was in fact the supplier of the heroin in the transaction he had earlier witnessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\"><em>Is a Warrantless Obtaining of a Copy of a Person\u2019s Driver\u2019s License a Violation of That Person\u2019s Right to Privacy </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">We find that such use of a driver\u2019s license does not violate a person\u2019s right of privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">Warrantless seizure of bank records and telephone company records was denounced in <em>Burrows </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1974) 13 Cal.3d 238 [118 Cal.Rptr. 166, 529 P.2d 590] and <em>People </em>v. <em>McKunes </em>(1975) 51 Cal.App.3d 487 [124 Cal.Rptr. 126]. These decisions were based on the fact that telephone records and bank records could provide a virtual biography of a person\u2019s life, and warrantless seizure of them most certainly would be an unreasonable intrusion into a person\u2019s privacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Information contained on a driver\u2019s license does not give such rise to a person\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. Drivers\u2019 licenses are displayed routinely for purposes of identification. A license must be presented for inspection upon demand of a peace officer enforcing the Vehicle Code, and to a magistrate before whom the licensee is brought. (Veh. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 12951, subd. (b), 12952).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">With a few minor exceptions all records of the Department of Motor Vehicles relating to registration of vehicles, information contained on applications for drivers\u2019 licenses, abstracts of convictions and accident reports are public records and open for inspection. (Veh. Code, \u00a7 1808.) There can be little expectation of privacy when the records are made public by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">Even if such use of a driver\u2019s license were an unreasonable intrusion into one\u2019s privacy, in this particular case that conclusion would not require suppression of any evidence. It is abundantly clear from the testimony of the drug enforcement agent at the preliminary hearing that his identification of defendant was unequivocal and was not in any way tainted by his viewing the driver\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">Elkington, Acting P. J., and Grodin, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-11\">Assigned by the Chairperson of the Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
