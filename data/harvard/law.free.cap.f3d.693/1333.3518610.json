The district court found that dismissal was warranted because the complaint\u2019s allegations were conclusory and insufficiently factual. We disagree and reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-8\">Liz Marie and Appellants (her parents and brother) took a vacation aboard a Carnival cruise ship, the <em>M/V VICTORY. </em>Appellants allege that an unidentified Carnival employee encouraged Liz Marie\u2019s father and brother to visit Coki Beach and Coral World upon disembarking the ship in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands. On July 12, 2010, Appellants left the ship and traveled to Coki Beach independently of the ship\u2019s sponsored excursions in St. Thomas. On their way back to the ship from Coki Beach, Appellants and Liz Marie rode an open-air bus past a funeral service of a gang member who recently died in a gang-related shooting near Coki Beach. Cars of funeral attendees were parked along the narrow road, blocking the bus\u2019s passage. While stuck in traffic, gang-related, retaliatory violence erupted at the funeral, shots were fired, and Liz Marie was killed by gunfire while she was a passenger on the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-9\">Appellants sued Carnival in the Southern District of Florida, claiming that Carnival negligently failed to warn them about the crime problem, reported gang-related violence, and potential for public shootings in St. Thomas generally, and Coki Beach specifically. They further alleged that Carnival\u2019s negligent failure to warn resulted in Carnival\u2019s negligent infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted Carnival\u2019s motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), giving Appellants leave to amend their complaint. Appellants chose not to amend their complaint; rather, they timely appealed the district court\u2019s order dismissing their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-12\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, accepting the complaint\u2019s allegations as true and construing them in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Cinotto v. Delta Air Lines Inc., </em>674 F.3d 1285, 1291 (11th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1381-14\">The district court concluded that dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) was appropriate because many of the complaint\u2019s key allegations were conclusory rather than factual, and thus, the pleading failed to satisfy the requirements of <em>Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009). Appellants contend that the complaint\u2019s allegations are more than adequate to survive a motion to dismiss. Carnival, rather than discussing the sufficiency of the pleading, argues that Appellants\u2019 case is based upon a heightened duty of care that exceeds the reasonable ordinary care standard recognized by controlling maritime law. Before discussing the pleading standard under <em>Iqbal, </em>we first address the more fundamental issue raised by Carni<em>val </em>\u2014 i.e., whether Carnival has a duty to warn passengers of known dangers at ports of call.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>\n<em>A. The duty to warn</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-4\">In Count I of their complaint, Appellants allege that Carnival negligently failed to warn them of general and specific dangers of crime in St. Thomas and Coki Beach. \u201cIn analyzing a maritime tort case, we rely on general principles of negligence law.\u201d <em>Daigle v. Point Landing, Inc., </em>616 F.2d 825, 827 (5th Cir.1980).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To plead negligence, a plaintiff must allege that (1) the defendant had a duty to protect the plaintiff from a particular injury; (2)the defendant breached that duty; (3) the breach actually and proximately caused the plaintiffs injury; and (4) the plaintiff suffered actual harm. <em>Zivojinovich v. Barner, </em>525 F.3d 1059, 1067 (11th Cir.2008) (per curiam) (citing <em>Clay Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Johnson, </em>873 So.2d 1182, 1185 (Fla.2003)). Concerning the duty element in a maritime context the Supreme Court held in <em>Kermarec v. Compagnie Generate Transatlantique, </em>358 U.S. 625, 630, 79 S.Ct. 406, 409, 3 L.Ed.2d 550 (1959), that \u201ca shipowner owes the duty of exercising <em>reasonable care </em>towards those lawfully aboard the vessel who are not members of the crew.\u201d (emphasis added). We have likewise said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASS\">the benchmark against which a shipowner\u2019s behavior must be measured is <em>ordinary reasonable care under the circumstances, </em>a standard which requires, as a prerequisite to imposing liability, that the carrier have had actual or constructive notice of the risk-creating condition, at least where ... the menace is one commonly encountered on land and not clearly linked to nautical adventure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1382-17\"><em>Keefe v. Bahama Cruise Line, Inc., </em>867 F.2d 1318, 1322 (11th Cir.1989) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-18\">More specifically a Florida intermediate appellate court has said that a cruise line owes its passengers a duty to warn of known dangers beyond the point of debarkation in places where passengers are invited or reasonably expected to visit. <em>Carlisle v. Ulysses Line Ltd., S.A., </em>475 So.2d 248, 251 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1985). In spite of Carnival\u2019s objection that <em>Carlisle </em>is an improper expansion of a shipowner\u2019s liability to passengers, the Southern District of Florida has often acknowledged and applied the standard articulated in <em>Carlisle. See, e.g., Koens v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 774 </em>F.Supp.2d 1215, 1219-1220 (S.D.Fla.2011); <em>McLaren v. Celebrity Cruises, Inc., </em>No. 11-23924-CIV, 2012 WL 1792632, at *8-9 (S.D.Fla. May 16, 2012); <em>Gentry v. Carnival Corp., </em>No. 11-21580-CIV, 2011 WL 4737062, at *3 (S.D.Fla. Oct. 5, 2011). It is true that federal courts are not bound by a Florida state court\u2019s admiralty decision, <em>see E. River S.S. Corp. v. Transamerica Delaval, Inc., </em>476 U.S. 858, 864, 106 S.Ct. 2295, 2299, 90 L.Ed.2d 865 (1986), but the rule in <em>Carlisle </em>is consonant with the federal maritime standard of \u201cordinary reasonable care under the circumstances,\u201d <em>see Keefe, </em>867 F.2d at 1322.</p>\n<p id=\"b1382-23\">Carnival also argues that dismissal was appropriate because Liz Marie\u2019s shooting death was unforeseeable, and that there is no duty to warn of an unforeseeable danger. <em>See Daigle, </em>616 F.2d at 827 (stating that a failure to warn does not constitute a breach in the duty of care \u201cunless the resultant harm is reasonably foreseeable\u201d). Appellants have alleged, however, that Carnival was aware of gang-related violence and crime, including public shootings, in St. Thomas generally and near Coki Beach specifically. At the pleading stage of litigation, we ask only if plaintiffs have adequately stated a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>for which relief can be granted. Carnival\u2019s argument on foreseeability is more appropriate after discovery at the summary judgment stage or at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-5\">\n<em>B. The sufficiency of the pleading</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-6\">Having established the scope of Carnival\u2019s duty, we next address the district court\u2019s findings on the sufficiency of Appellants\u2019 complaint. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a complaint provide \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Rule 8\u2019s pleading standard \u201cdoes not require \u2018detailed factual allegations,\u2019 but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (citing <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)). A complaint that provides \u201clabels and conclusions\u201d or \u201ca formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\u201d is not adequate to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 555, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. Rather, \u201c[t]o survive ... a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to \u2018state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019\u201d <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. at 1974). A facially plausible claim must allege facts that are more than merely possible. <em>Iqbal, </em>556 U.S. at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949. Factual allegations that are \u201c \u2018merely consistent with\u2019 a defendant\u2019s liability\u201d fall short of being facially plausible. <em>Id. </em>at 678, 129 S.Ct. at 1949 (quoting <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 557, 127 S.Ct. at 1966). The plausibility standard \u201ccalls for enough fact to raise a reasonable expectation that discovery will reveal evidence\u201d of the defendant\u2019s liability. <em>Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. But if allegations are indeed more conclusory than factual, then the court does not have to assume their truth. <em>See Mamani v. Berzain, </em>654 F.3d 1148, 1153-54 (11th Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1383-9\">Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges the following: a Carnival employee encouraged Appellants to visit Coki Beach in St. Thomas; Carnival was familiar with Coki Beach because it sold excursions to passengers to Coki Beach; Carnival generally knew of gang violence and public shootings in St. Thomas; Carnival knew of Coki Beach\u2019s reputation for drug sales, theft, and gang violence; Carnival knew or should have known of the gang member\u2019s shooting and funeral taking place near Coki Beach; Carnival failed to warn Appellants of any of these dangers; Carnival knew or should have known of these dangers because Carnival monitors crime in its ports of call; Carnival\u2019s negligence in encouraging its passengers to visit Coki Beach and in failing to warn disembarking passengers of general and specific incidents of crime in St. Thomas and Coki Beach caused Liz Marie\u2019s death; and Appellants have suffered various damages, including the loss of Liz Marie\u2019s life. This negligent failure-to-warn claim is more than a mere recitation of the elements of the cause of action. The facts alleged in the complaint are plausible and raise a reasonable expectation that discovery could supply additional proof of Carnival\u2019s liability. <em>See Twombly, </em>550 U.S. at 556, 127 S.Ct. at 1965. We consequently conclude that the district court erred in dismissing Appellants\u2019 negligence claim under <em>Iqbal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1383-10\">The district court also dismissed Count II, the claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress, because that claim requires an adequately pled underlying claim of negligence. Because Appellants pled negligence sufficiently, we conclude that they likewise stated a valid claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress. Such a claim requires \u201cmental or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>emotional harm (such as fright or anxiety) that is caused by the negligence of another and that is not directly brought about by a physical injury, but that may manifest itself in physical symptoms.\u201d <em>Consol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, </em>512 U.S. 532, 544, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 2405, 129 L.Ed.2d 427 (1994) (discussing tort claims brought under the Federal Employers\u2019 Liability Act). Common law standards vary in what sort of harm the plaintiff must suffer (an actual \u201cphysical impact,\u201d presence in the \u201czone of danger,\u201d or status as a mere bystander), but federal maritime law has adopted Gottshall\u2019s application of the \u201czone of danger\u201d test which allows recovery if a plaintiff is \u201cplaced in immediate risk of physical harm by [defendant\u2019s negligent] conduct.\u201d <em>Stacy v. Rederiet Otto Danielson, </em>AS., 609 F.3d 1033, 1035 (9th Cir.2010); <em>Williams v. Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc., </em>907 F.Supp. 403, 406 (S.D.Fla.1995). The complaint alleges that Appellants were trapped in the bus during the shooting near Coki Beach, that they feared for their lives, that they witnessed Liz Marie\u2019s shooting and death, and that they have consequently experienced various physical manifestations of their emotional distress. Thus, we hold that Appellants\u2019 claim for negligent infliction of emotional distress also was dismissed erroneously.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-5\">Appellants\u2019 complaint sufficiently states claims for which relief can be granted. Therefore, we reverse the district court\u2019s judgment of dismissal and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1384-6\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1382-21\">.

City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1207 (11th Cir.1981) (en banc), the Eleventh Circuit adopted as binding precedent the decisions of the Fifth Circuit rendered prior to October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
