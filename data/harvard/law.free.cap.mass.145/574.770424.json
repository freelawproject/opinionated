Percival, on June 15, 1886, at Boston, on June 25, 26, 27, 1886, at Revere, on June 26,1886, at Boston, and on September 21,1886, at Revere. The case was heard before <em>jField, </em>J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b592-12\">The libellant offered evidence that sexual intercourse was had by the libellee with said Percival, at a hotel in Boston, in the forenoon -of the day of the marriage, and before the marriage, which was on June 15,1886, and also offered evidence of certain familiarities with Percival, consisting of visits by the libellee to the room of Percival in said hotel, within a short time preceding said marriage. To this evidence the libellee objected, and the judge admitted the same solely on the ground that it tended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>prove sexual intimacy with the same person who was charged in the libel with acts of adultery with the libellee, after marriage, to support which other evidence was offered and received without objection.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b593-4\">The judge found, as a fact, that the libellee was guilty of adultery with Percival, after marriage. The libellee alleged exceptions to the admission of this testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-5\"><em>S. Dunham, </em>for the libellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b593-6\"><em>W. Graston \u00a7\u2022 T. E. G-rover, </em>for the libellant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b593-7\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvD\">It is settled that evidence of indecent familiarities with the person with whom adultery is charged, and even of sexual intercourse with him, at other times after marriage, is admissible to explain the character of ambiguous conduct relied on as evidence of the act of adultery in issue. <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>101 Mass. 111. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Nichols, </em>114 Mass. 285. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Merriam, </em>14 Pick. 518. There can be no doubt that evidence of sexual intercourse on the morning of the marriage, and of acts of familiarity shortly before, tends in like manner to explain doubtful conduct shortly after it. The objections based on the general rules of evidence are answered by <em>Thayer </em>v. <em>Thayer. </em>It is said that marriage operates as an oblivion of all that is passed. But there is no reason for making of this rule a veil of fiction which prevents the facts from throwing their natural light on subsequent events. See <em>Weatherley </em>v. <em>Weatherley, </em>1 Spinks 193, 196; <em>Van Epps </em>v. <em>Van Epps, </em>6 Barb. 320. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
