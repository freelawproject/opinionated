The property alleged to have been converted was removed from where the plaintiff had used it during the erection of said building, and where he claimed the right to use it in the completion of the building, which he had contracted to do, and which the defendants had requested him to perform, to another part of the lot of the town ; and there was evidence tending to show that it was necessary for him to use the tools, implements, and other personal property in the completion of said contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-5\">The plaintiff asked the judge to rule, that so long as the plaintiff had the right of possession of the premises, either under the contract of the town with the general contractors, or with the plaintiff as sub-contractor, the defendants had no right to interfere with the plaintiff\u2019s reasonable use of the premises for his tools, implements, and machinery necessary to the proper performance of his work under said contract of the town.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-6\">The judge refused to rule as requested, but instructed the jury as follows: \u201c The plaintiff, upon the evidence, had only an implied license to keep his engine and other property upon the property of the town, which might be at any time revoked altogether, or as to any particular portion of the lot. If the town, for any cause, required of the plaintiff the removal of that property from the lot, or from any particular part of the lot, and the plaintiff unreasonably neglected so to remove it, and thereupon the defendants removed it to another part of the lot, doing no unnecessary damage to the property, the plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>The jury returned a verdict for the defendants; and the plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b545-4\"><em>W.

Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A9ia\">The property of the plaintiff alleged to have been converted by the defendants was on land belonging to and occupied by the defendant town. The town requested the plaintiff to remove the property to another place on the same parcel of land, and the plaintiff refused to do so, whereupon the defendants removed it to the place assigned by the town. The instruction, that, if the plaintiff unreasonably neglected to remove the property, and the defendants removed it to another part of the lot, doing no unnecessary damage, the plaintiff could not recover, was sufficiently favorable to the plaintiff, even if he occupied under a license which had not' been revoked. The evidence negatived a conversion of the property by the defendants, and showed that they claimed no title to it, assumed no dominion over it, and did nothing in derogation of the plaintiff\u2019s title to it, and that all that was claimed by the defendants was the right to remove the goods from one place to another on their own land. All that was done was in assertion of their right in the land, and in recognition of the plaintiff\u2019s right of property in the chattels. If the plaintiff had the right to occupy the land which he claimed, the act of the defendants was wrongful, and they would be liable to the plaintiff for damages for breach of contract, or for the trespass, but not for the value of property converted to their own use. <em>Farnsworth </em>v. <em>Lowery, </em>134 Mass. 512. <em>Fouldes </em>v. <em>Willoughby, </em>8 M. &amp; W. 540. <em>Heald </em>v. <em>Carey, </em>11 C.
