The government introduced evidence, which was not controverted, that all the ballots cast at the municipal election in the city of Boston, in December, 1886, were destroyed by the city clerk, in January, 1887, as required by the St. of 1884, <em>c. </em>299, \u00a7 26. The judge refused to rule as requested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\">The government introduced other evidence, tending to show that, during the day, and while the polls were open, there were on duty at said precinct the defendant, as an inspector, the warden, named Hibbard, a clerk named Woods, and another inspector named Harris; that when the polls were closed, the ballots were emptied by said officers out of the ballot-box on to a table, for counting; and that the defendant, while counting a pile of ballots, made the alteration charged in the indictment. The defendant requested the judge to rule that there was not sufficient evidence in the case that the ballot alleged to have been altered was \u201c cast,\u201d within the intent and purpose of the statute.

This request was refused.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\">The government introduced evidence, which was uncontroverted, that Nelson S. Wakefield was the candidate for aider-man at said election from the eleventh aldermanic district of the city of Boston, and was defeated; and there was no other evidence in the case that he held any office.

The judge refused so to rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\">It appeared in evidence, which was uncontroverted, that the warden, Hibbard, ordered that the ballot be, and it was accordingly, counted and returned for Nelson S.

It is now objected, that such destruction must be deemed to have been the act of the prosecutor, namely, the government, and that therefore the government could not properly be allowed to introduce secondary evidence of what the ballot was. But a destruction of ballots, under this general provision of law, cannot be deemed a wrongful or negligent destruction of a document, or one which involves any fault upon the part of the government or its agents; and the case does not fall within the doctrine, which has sometimes been declared or implied, that a document which has been destroyed through the fault of the prosecutor cannot be proved by secondary evidence. See 3 Greenl. Ev. \u00a7 107; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Snell, </em>3 Mass. 82; <em>Joannes </em>v. <em>Bennett, 5 </em>Allen, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>2. It was not necessary to show that the ballot had been can-celled by a mechanical device, as provided in \u00a7 10 of the statute. Such cancellation is not essential to insure the counting of a ballot, since \u00a7 12 makes provision for the case where a ballot-box containing such mechanical device cannot be furnished. Besides, the evidence showing that the ballot came from the ballot-box which was actually used in the election would warrant the inference that it had been duly cast within the meaning of \u00a7 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">3. The alteration was sufficient to sustain the indictment. If the ballot had been originally cast, with the erasure shown, it. could not properly have been counted as a ballot for Mr. Wake-field. The erasure was sufficient to \u201c alter \u201d the ballot, so that the voter\u2019s intention would have been defeated if the fraud had not been observed or discovered. The name upon the ballot is to be taken as a whole. If the lines and marks drawn across it were sufficient to show an apparent intention upon the part of the voter to erase the name, so that the ballot would not be counted as a vote for Mr. Wakefield, that is sufficient to support the charge of altering the ballot by drawing lines and marks across the words and name \u201c Nelson S. Wakefield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">4. The objection that the vote for Mr. Wakefield was not a \u201c ballot cast for any officer,\u201d because he was merely a candidate for office, and was not elected, cannot prevail. The statute merely uses a short form of expression, and the meaning is not open to doubt; otherwise the statute would only apply to existing officers who might be candidates for re-election. The phraseology of \u201c voting for any officers to be then chosen \u201d is common and familiar in the legislation of this Commonwealth. Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 55. . Gen. Sts. <em>c. </em>7, \u00a7 28. See also St. 1884, <em>c. </em>299, \u00a7 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">5. The fact that the fraud of the defendant did not succeed, and that, by direction of the election officer, the ballot was counted and returned for Mr. Wakefield, cannot avail the defendant in defence to the indictment. The ballot was altered with intent to cheat and defraud, although the fraud was discovered at once. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
