Sts. <em>c. </em>112, \u00a7 214, for goods destroyed by fire while in its possession under a contract for carriage. The question in this ease is whether the plaintiffs\u2019 property, at the time of the fife, was in the defendant\u2019s possession under such a contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">The plaintiffs were large shippers of merchandise over the defendant\u2019s road, and the defendant built for their use, as an addition to its depot, a storehouse separated from the general ireight-house by a brick wall. This the plaintiffs had occupied lor two years in connection with their business, and, up to October 1, 1886, they had paid an agreed price per month for it. It can hardly be contended that, during this period, they were not the defendant\u2019s tenants, and in exclusive possession and control of all that the storehouse contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">On September 21, 1886, they notified the defendant that, by reason of the completion of a new building elsewhere, they should not need the storehouse after October 1. On November 1 following, the station agent at Chicopee presented them a bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>for the rent of the premises for the month of October, which had been sent him for collection by the defendant\u2019s auditor, in accordance with a usual practice, and without special directions from the president or superintendent regarding it. The plaintiffs declined to pay it, referring to their previous notification, and no bill was afterwards sent. The station agent informed the superintendent by letter of their refusal, and of their saying that \u201c they would pay no more rent for the storehouse, thinking they should have it free now and would keep the cars cleaned out.\u201d He also inquired if there was any error in sending the bill, and asked the superintendent to advise the plaintiffs of the company\u2019s position. Ho reply was sent to the agent, nor communication to the plaintiffs, and they continued until the time of the fire, in March, 1887, \u201c to use and occupy the storehouse in the same manner and for the same purposes as before, which use was known by the station agent, but the agent did not know whether or not any arrangement had been made with the president or superintendent for such use, but such use was without any objection on the defendant\u2019s part, and no other persons used the storehouse.\u201d The property destroyed \u201c had been received by the plaintiffs in the course of their said business by or for transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-3\">Upon these facts, the plaintiffs were in possession and control of the property in the storehouse, as well after as before October 1, 1886. The goods which had come over the defendant\u2019s road had been \u201c received \u201d by the plaintiffs and kept in the storehouse, some of them a day or two at the time of the fire, and some of them for months. There is nothing to indicate that the contract under which the defendant carried them had not been fully performed, and, so far as appears, the defendant did not seek to retain a lien upon them, but allowed the plaintiffs to take them into their absolute control; and the facts do not find that the goods in the storehouse \u201c received by the plaintiffs \u201d for transportation had ever been delivered to the defendant so that the parties had come into relations of contract regarding them. The defendant did not use the storehouse, nor have the custody of anything in it. It is quite immaterial whether the relation of landlord and tenant continued to exist between the parties, or whether the plaintiffs, after receiving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>freight which had been transported over the defendant\u2019s railroad, left it in one of the defendant\u2019s buildings by sufferance. The test question is, as to the goods which had been transported over the railroad, whether they had been given up to the owner so that the contract for carriage, and incidentally for storage for a reasonable time or until delivery, no longer applied to them, and, as to those which were intended for transportation,, whether they had been delivered to the corporation so that the contemplated contract had taken effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">If, as contended by the defendant, contributory negligence of the plaintiffs would bar their recovery, which we do not decide, we find in their conduct no want of due care.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">The property having been destroyed by fife communicated by a locomotive engine of the defendant, and not having been at the time in the possession of the defendant under a contract fixing the rights and liabilities of the parties regarding it, the plaintiffs may recover the value of it, and the entry must be,</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
