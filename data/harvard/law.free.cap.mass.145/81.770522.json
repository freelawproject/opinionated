A. died before his mother, leaving a will, by the first clause of which he gave to his wife, \u201c except as otherwise provided in the subsequent articles \u201d of the will, the use during life of all the property of which lie should die possessed or entitled to, or which he could dispose of, and also the income of all property devised by his father\u2019s will of which he could direct the disposition, \u201cnot included in the foregoing gift to her of a life estate therein ; \u201d and in case any subsequent gift or direction in the will should fail, he gave the use or income of all the property in respect to which the gift or direction should so fail to his wife for life. The third article of A.\u2019s will, after reciting that, whereas by his father\u2019s will certain property, including his homestead at W., was devised to be held in trust for the benefit of his mother during her life, and that one half of the same or the proceeds thereof might be disposed of by A. subject to his mother\u2019s interest therein, directed that his wife, if living at the time of his mother\u2019s death, should have the use and enjoyment of that part of said property \u201c which is thus liable to be disposed of by me, or of the income thereof, if my power extends no further than to dispose of the income,\u201d until the eldest of his children who survived him attained his majority, at which time, if his wife was still living, his executors were directed \u201cto set apart, out of the said property, a fund for the benefit of said child, consisting of money or securities, or partly of money and partly of securities,\u201d to the amount or value of 8100,000; and when his second child who survived him attained his majority, his executors were directed \u201c to set apart \u201d for his benefit a \u201c similar \u201d fund of 8100,000; and so on in succession as each child attained his majority, until a fund of 8100,000 had been set apart for each of his children who should attain majority; and further provided that his wife should continue to have the use and enjoyment during life of the remainder of the property, or its income, after such funds were successively set apart; and that, at any time after his mother\u2019s death, his wife might give to any of his children, or their issue, absolutely and indefeasibly, any part of the capital mentioned in this article or in the first article, \u201c except such portion thereof as may have been set apart to constitute any of the funds mentioned in this article, or which it is necessary to retain in order to constitute all of said funds,\u201d and that every division subsequently provided for in the will should be made without reference to such gift.

By his will, which was duly admitted to probate, he devised his homestead estate in West Roxbury to his widow for life, with remainder in fee to his two sons, Samuel Dexter Bradford and John H.

At his or her death, leaving surviving issue, such issue shall take absolutely the capital and unexpended income of such fund or share. But if such child leaves no surviving issue, he or she may dispose of the capital and unexpended income by a last will and testament, but not otherwise.

L. </em>Rand, as guardian <em>ad litem </em>for persons not known and not in being, contended that the legacies to the three children of the testator, given by article 3 of his will, were specific, and not demonstrative, and were confined to the fund of $125,000.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b106-6\"><em>P.

Stimson, </em>for the children of the testator,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ApU\">contended that the legacies were demonstrative, and were to be paid out of the whole fund derived from the residuary estate of the testator\u2019s father.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b106-7\">Holmes, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvZ\">It may be conjectured with some plausibility that what the testator really had in mind in the third article of his will was the whole trust pf one quarter of the residue under his father\u2019s will, \u2014 a fund which would be sufficient to give all the children their legacies, even on the view that the legacies to them were specific. But, in the opinion of the majority of the court, the description of the fund is so definite as to exclude this construction, which could be reached only by a somewhat violent transposition of language which is plain as it stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">The case between the widow and children, therefore, must depend upon the question whether the legacies to the children are specific or demonstrative.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-9\">We must assume that the testator remembered that, before the date of the will, he had conveyed away the West Roxbury homestead mentioned in article 3, as the will does not necessarily imply the contrary. The homestead is only mentioned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>as part of the property left by the testator\u2019s father to be disposed of by the testator, subject to his mother\u2019s life interest, and serves to identify the fund referred to. But the testator only affects to dispose of the property which \u201c is \u201d liable to be disposed of by him, or of the income if his power \u201c extends \u201d no further than to dispose of the income, \u2014 using the present tense and words which are satisfied without attributing to him an attempt to devise the homestead which he no longer owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-4\">The fund in question, therefore, could not be more than $150,000, or possibly $175,000, because that was the largest sum which could come to him under the clauses of his father\u2019s will referred to. And as he directed that his wife should receive the whole income of the fund until the time for setting apart the first $100,000, and the income of what remained after each sum of $100,000 was set apart, the testator could not have expected the fund to be increased by accumulations. It follows that he could not have expected the three funds of $100,000 each to be raised from property by no possibility amounting to more than $175,000. We may add a further consideration. The testator contemplates in terms the possibility that his power may extend no further than to dispose of the income of the specific property mentioned. This makes it still harder to suppose that he relied on this property alone. The reason for the testator\u2019s doubt points the same way. The property which he deals with in the third article did not come to him as a separate fund, but was left to him along with that which he disposes of in article 1, as part of the residue under his father\u2019s will. For, although his father\u2019s will created a separate fund of $300,000, at least $250,000 of it was to be paid into the residuary fund upon his father\u2019s widow\u2019s decease, and his own title was only under the residuary clause, making the present testator and his brother residuary legatees, and giving one half of his half to the present testator outright, and the other half in trust for him or his family, &amp;c. Hence the testator actually received his share of the $300,000 as part of a larger fund, and the separation of a part of the residue from the rest with reference to its remote origin is purely imaginary.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">The testator does not say that the sums for the other children after the first shall be raised from the property mentioned in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>article 3, but simply that they shall be set apart.' \u2022 He then goes on to empower his wife to give his children any part of the capital mentioned in this or in the first article, \u201c except such portion thereof \u201d as may have been set apart, or may be needed to constitute the funds of $100,000. \u201c Thereof \u201d refers grammatically to the capital mentioned in the first article, as well as to that mentioned in the third; and on its face the clause imports that a portion of the capital mentioned in the first article may be needed to constitute the funds. In view of the arbitrary character of the separation between the capitals mentioned in the two articles, and the certainty that the fund mentioned in the third article would be insufficient, this interpretation seems not only grammatical, but reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">The whole difficulty is raised by the direction, when the first child reaches majority, \u201cto s'et apart out of the said property,\u201d i. e. out of the $150,000, \u201c a fund for the benefit of said child, consisting of money or securities, or partly of money and partly of securities, to the amount or value of one hundred thousand dollars.\u201d It is argued that this legacy is specific ; and that the direction to \u201c set apart \u201d \u201c similar \u201d funds for the other children must be taken to mean legacies of the same character, and is further shown to have this meaning by the provision that the testator\u2019s wife shall continue to have the use, &amp;c. of the remainder of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">\" Whether the legacy to the first child is specific or not, it cannot be allowed to cut down or to limit the legacies of like amounts to the other children, which are not made specific in terms. The testator shows by articles 4 and 5 that he means his children to share his property equally, while the result of holding all the legacies specific would be to give the first child $100,000, if the fund was sufficient, the second not more than $75,000, and the third nothing, and the facts leading to this result were known to the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The gift of the use of the remainder of the property to the testator\u2019s wife is made sensible by taking \u201c the property \u201d to include that mentioned in the first article, of which also she is given the use for .life. When the specific property of $150,000 is referred to earlier in the article, it is referred to as \u201c the said property.\u201d In. this connection, again, the arbitrary character <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of the separation of the property mentioned in article 3 should be kept in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-4\">There is enough to pay the legacy to the first child, upon any construction of the will. The result will be the same, whether we suppose that the testator began by specifically disposing of the fund described, and then, for the sake of equality, gave to the other children general legacies of the same amount as the specific legacy to the eldest, or say that all the legacies are demonstrative. Many cases of weight, although not binding upon us as authority, go far towards deciding that the legacy to the first child, if it stood alone, even, should be regarded as demonstrative. It is unnecessary to consider how far they are reconcilable with <em>Bliss </em>v. <em>American Bible </em>Society, 2 Allen, 334, and other Massachusetts cases. See <em>Boys </em>v. Williams, 2 Russ. &amp; Myl. 689; <em>Cunliffe </em>v. <em>Cunliffe, </em>23 W. R. 724; <em>Sparrow </em>v. <em>Josselyn, </em>16 Beav. 135; <em>Vickers </em>v. <em>Pound, </em>6 H. L. Cas. 885; <em>Mytton </em>v. <em>Mytton, </em>44 L. J. Ch. 18; <em>Bowen </em>v. <em>Dorrance, </em>12 R. I. 269.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">For these reasons, a majority of the court are of opinion that, as article 1 is in the nature of a residuary clause, and the gift, to the testator\u2019s widow is subject to the provisions of the other articles, the legacies of $100,000 to each of the children must be paid in full.</p>\n<p id=\"AKn\">\n<em>Decree accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
