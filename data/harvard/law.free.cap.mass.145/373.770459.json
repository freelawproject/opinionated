The officers took samples of dirty water, one from a tank under the bar near which the defendant stood, and the other from the bottom of an ice-chest. These samples were sealed up in two bottles, one of which, one of the officers subsequently left in the office of the State Assayer, one Sharpies, in Boston, and when he left it there he did not see the assayer. On each occasion when the officers visited the shop, as above stated, they saw the defendant go to said tank and go through the motion of rinsing a two-quart can, which was also kept under said bar. On one occasion when they visited the shop, they found in the ice-chest an empty can which smelt of whiskey, and a sample of the water taken from the bottom of the ice-chest also smelt of whiskey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Sharpies testified, for the government, that he analyzed the contents of the two bottles, and that they contained more than three per cent of alcohol.

It was required to prove that the defendant kept the premises, and used them for the illegal sale or illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors; but this burden of proof may be met by other evidence than that of specific sales. The instructions given at the trial were sufficient and appropriate. The evidence excepted to was clearly competent. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
