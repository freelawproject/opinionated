Carroll, wife of William T. Carroll, his agent to care for said property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-5\">On December 11, 1883, the defendant procured a replevin writ, in which writ the defendant was named as plaintiff and Frances C. Carroll was- named as defendant, and caused the same to be served, and the property described in the mortgages aforesaid to be taken thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-6\">There was no evidence of the conversion of said property by the defendant, except that the officer replevied it on said replevin writ; and it was in evidence that no demand was ever made upon the defendant by the plaintiff for said property before the bringing of this action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-7\">It also appeared in evidence, that the defendant recovered judgment in the Central District Court of Worcester on August 23, 1884, in an action upon said note for the sum of $51.23. It appeared that a greater part of said sum was due when said renlevin writ was sued out by the defendant; and that the defendant procured said writ for the purpose of enforcing his right against said property under his mortgage, and for the purpose of foreclosing said mortgage and applying the proceeds of said sale toward the payment of the debt thereby secured.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-8\">The defendant contended, and asked the judge to rule, that a demand upon him for said property before bringing this action was necessary; that this action could not be maintained; and that the title, if any, which the plaintiff took under his several mortgages, was subject to the prior mortgage of the defendant, which was then in force between the parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b238-9\">The judge ruled that the plaintiff\u2019s title was subject to the unrecorded mortgage of the defendant, and that, upon the whole evidence, the action could not be maintained; and ordered a verdict for the defendant. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b238-10\"><em>J.

The first two mortgages given to the plaintiff, we think, clearly purport to convey to the plaintiff the property, subject to the mortgage to the defendant; or, in other words, only to convey the mortgagor\u2019s right of redeeming the property from the mortgage to the defendant. The third mortgage to the plaintiff is of \u2018\u2018 all the personal property mortgaged to grantee by mortgage dated October 13, 1883, and recorded with Worcester city mortgages of personal property, to which reference is had for a description.\u201d The mortgage dated October 13, 1883, is made expressly subject to the incumbrances mentioned in the prior mortgage of October 12, 1883, and the mortgage to the defendant is an incumbrance expressly mentioned in this mortgage of October 12,1883. The mortgage of October 17,1883, therefore, only conveyed to the plaintiff the mortgagor\u2019s right of redemption from the mortgage to the defendant. The case is governed by <em>Tuite </em>v. Stevens, 98 Mass. 305, <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Chase, </em>104 Mass. 249, and <em>Pecker </em>v. <em>Silsby, </em>123 Mass. 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
