A police officer. testified to an admission of the fact by the defendant at a certain interview when no one else was present. The defendant and two other witnesses testified to a conversation between the defendant and the police officer differing essentially from the version given by the latter. The defendant contended in his argument to the jury that the officer was mistaken. The district attorney contended that, if the jury acquitted the defendant, they would brand th'e officer as a perjurer. The defendant asked the judge to instruct the jury that it was not necessary for the jury to disbelieve the officer in order to acquit; that, if all the evidence left their minds in doubt as to what was said, the defendant was entitled to the benefit of it. The judge did not instruct the jury as requested, but instructed them that the material allegations of the complaint were to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and that they were to consider the intelligence of the officer, and whether he understood and interpreted the conversation correctly; and that they were not responsible for the effect, if any, of their verdict upon witnesses. <em>Held, </em>that the defendant had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b251-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>Complaint for keeping intoxicating liquors on September 10, 1887, at Haverhill, with intent to sell the same unlawfully in this Commonwealth.
