But the judge declined so to rule, and found as a fact that the services rendered on the Lord\u2019s day were works of necessity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-10\">The defendant also asked the judge to rule that there was no evidence to warrant a finding that the shaving of the beard of the defendant\u2019s intestate on the Lord's day was a work of necessity. But the judge declined so to rule; and found for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b371-11\">The defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b371-12\"><em>JE. F. P. </em>Smith, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AlqL\">The doing of \u201c any manner of labor, business, or work, except works of necessity and charity,\u201d on the Lord\u2019s day, is prohibited by the Pub. Sts. <em>o. </em>98, \u00a7 2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-13\">In <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Innes, </em>4 Cl. &amp; Fin. 233, it was held that shaving and hair-cutting were not works of necessity. Lord Chancellor Cottenham said : \u201c This work [shaving] is not a work of necessity, nor is it a work of mercy, it is one of mere convenience.\u201d See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Jacobus, Leg. Gaz. Rep. 491.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b371-14\">It is no sufficient excuse for work on the Lord\u2019s day, that it is more convenient or profitable if then done than it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>be to defer or omit it. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>10 Allen, 18. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sampson, </em>97 Mass. 407. <em>McGrath, </em>v. <em>Merwin, </em>112 Mass. 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-4\">\u201c The necessity contemplated by the exception in the statute was the necessity of the person who worked, and not of him who compelled the work.....Gain, in fact, was the object of the master; and such work, being for hire merely,\u201d is not a work of necessity. Lord Brougham, in <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Innes, ubi supra.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b372-7\">The ordinary business of the plaintiff being that of a shoemaker, it was not necessary for him to do the work of a barber on the Lord\u2019s day.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b372-8\"><em>H.

Moulton, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"ALB\">Field, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIA\">It appears that Graves, the defendant\u2019s intestate, was an old man, whose shoulder had been injured, and who could not well shave himself; and that the work of shaving him was done by the plaintiff, not in a public shop, but in the house of Graves. If Graves wished <em>to be </em>shaved on the Lord\u2019s day in his own house, we cannot say, as matter of law, that it was not morally fit and proper that the plaintiff should shave him.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
