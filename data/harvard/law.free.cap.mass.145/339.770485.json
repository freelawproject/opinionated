At the request of the bankrupt, after the price was paid, the land was conveyed to the bankrupt\u2019s wife, and the deed was delivered to him as Ms wife\u2019s agent. <em>Held, </em>that the conveyance was valid, and that the bankrupt could not maintain an action for a subsequent trespass committed on the land.</headnotes>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b357-8\"><em>J.

The defendants claim title as devisees of the plaintiff\u2019s wife, to whom the plaintiff\u2019s assignees in bankruptcy conveyed the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The first difficulty which the plaintiff has to encounter in the attempt to maintain an action at law is, that, if the conveyance were void, the legal title would be in the assignees, not in him. <em>Bacon </em>v. Abbott, 137 Mass. 397. But the conveyance was valid. \u2022It was authorized by the decree giving the assignees leave to sell to the plaintiff, as the plaintiff requested that it should be made to his wife, after the price was paid as required by the decree. For the same reason, the plaintiff could not set up that the conveyance was against the terms of the assignees\u2019 contract with him, if it was, and if that fact would make any difference on a question of legal title. The court found that the deed was delivered to the plaintiff as his wife\u2019s agent, and the exceptions state that there was evidence to support the finding. We see nothing in the case requiring discussion. The suggestion that a conveyance by assignees to the bankrupt\u2019s wife is void, on the same grounds as a sale .on execution to the debtor\u2019s wife, is plainly unfounded. In the latter case the officer has only a power, and the title would pass direct from husband to wife. <em>Stetson </em>v. O'Sullivan, 8 Allen, 321. In the former, the assignees have title in themselves. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
