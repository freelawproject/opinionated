The defendants contended that one defendant was in the employ of the other; and asked the judge to rule that, \u201c if B. was employed by A. as an assistant, on wages, and did not act in the absence of A., nor at any time have sole charge of the premises, he cannot be convicted.\u201d The judge declined so to rule; but instructed the jury that, if B. assisted A. in keeping and maintaining the premises as a nuisance, he would be liable to conviction upon the complaint. <em>Held, </em>that B. had good ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-6\">Complaint to the Police Court of Gloucester, against Michael J. Murphy and David C. Godfrey, for keeping and maintaining a common nuisance, to wit, a certain tenement in Gloucester, used for the illegal sale and illegal keeping of intoxicating liquors, on October 1, 1885, and on divers other days and times between that day and March 26, 1886.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-7\">At the trial in the Superior Court, on appeal, before <em>Hammond, </em>J., evidence was introduced showing that both defendants had been seen in and about the premises in question. The defendants contended that one defendant was in the employ of the other; and requested the following ruling: \u201c If Godfrey was employed by Murphy as an assistant, on wages, and did not act in the absence of Murphy, nor at any time have sole charge of the premises, he cannot be convicted.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-8\">The judge declined to give the instruction requested; but instructed the jury that, if the defendant Godfrey assisted Murphy in keeping and maintaining the premises as a nuisance, he would be liable to conviction upon this complaint.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b268-9\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty against each defendant; and they alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b268-10\"><em>H.

The case therefore falls within <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Galligan, </em>144 Mass. 171, which was decided after the ruling excepted to. See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Churchill, 136 Mass. 148, 151. This is the only exception argued, and is admitted not to affect the defendant Murphy.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\">\n<em>Exceptions of Q-odfrey sustained.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">\n<em>Exceptions of Murphy overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
