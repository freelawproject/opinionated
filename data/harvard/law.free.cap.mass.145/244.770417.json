Trial in the Superior Court, before <em>Brigham, </em>C. J., who allowed a bill of exceptions, in substance as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-4\">The defendant was a licensed innholder, and also held a license of the first class for the sale of intoxicating liquors during the time charged in the complaint, which license contained the provision of the statute in regard to innholders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-5\">The complainant, Jules Giquel, testified that he went to the premises described in the license, on Sunday, May 9,1886, about noon, with one Partridge and three sailors, whom he and Partridge found in one of the public streets of New Bedford, and invited to go with them where liquor could be sold; that, after visiting one or more places, they\" came to the defendant\u2019s place; that the curtains to the front windows on the east side of the defendant\u2019s saloon were drawn so as to cover the entire windows, and the defendant stood inside the saloon, near the window just north of the door leading into the saloon ; that as he, Partridge, and the three sailors stopped in front of the defendant\u2019s place, the defendant pulled the curtains aside, and moved his hand towards the gate leading to a rear door on the south side of the building, which they interpreted to mean to go into the gate into the yard and round the house; that they did so, and went into the defendant\u2019s place at the back door, and found in the saloon or bar-room some twenty-five other persons ; that others came in and went out, some through the front door and some through the back door; that while they were in there five persons got whiskey, drank it, and paid for it; that two or three of the.sailors who went with him got whiskey or rum, and he paid for it; that the curtains to the windows were drawn so as to cover the entire windows at the time of said sales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-6\">The bar-room in which the sales were testified to have taken place was the front room on the first floor next to the street; and the windows above referred to were windows looking out of said room.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-7\">The complainant further testified, that he was employed with Partridge by the Law and Order League of New Bedford to obtain evidence against liquor sellers in New Bedford, and to prosecute such for illegal sales of intoxicating liquor; that they were furnished by said league with money to pay their expenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>and were paid by the day for their labors; that the money they paid out for liquor drank and food eaten by the sailors was money furnished by said league.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">Partridge testified to similar matters and things; and both he and Giquel testified that the windows to the saloon were about six feet from the sidewalk, and that the house was some three or four feet back \u201cfrom the line of the street; and another wit- ' ness testified that, standing on the sidewalk in front of the house, one could see into the saloon only a few feet, and could see only down to the waist of a person standing near the window.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">There was some other testimony as to Sunday, April 25, and May 2, in regard to the use of the saloon on those days. The defendant and his bar-tender were called, and testified, directly contradicting the evidence of Giquel and Partridge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">The defendant asked the judge to give the following instructions to the jury: \u201c 1. An innholder, under a license to sell intoxicating liquor, has a right to sell on any part of the Lord\u2019s day, night as well as day, in any part of his inn, to a guest.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">2. He has a right to sell to a guest on any part of any day of the week. 3. A guest is one who has resorted to his house for either food or lodging, as lodger, or boarder, or for lunch. 4. One is a guest who goes into such a place for food alone, or for lodging alone, and he would be a guest if only for a lunch or for an hour\u2019s rest; and to such a person the innholder may sell intoxicating liquor under his license. 5. If one goes to an inn for food, and gets it, he may be furnished with liquor under a license to an innholder. 6. Upon Sunday a licensed innholder has a right to have screens or curtains on the windows on his premises in the room in which intoxicating liquor is usually sold, and the law does not apply on that day to an innholder. 7. If curtains to a window that were up would not cut off a view of the premises, or the business done within the room to a passer-by, because they were so high one could not see in, or for any other cause, then the license would not be void or the sale illegal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\">8. If the curtains were up, but not for the purpose of preventing persons passing by in the street from obtaining a view within the rooms or a view of the business done therein, then it would not make the license void, or the sale for that cause illegal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>9. Persons employed by an association or league to induce the defendant and others to sell liquor for the purposes of prosecuting the defendant and others for violations of their license, are not such persons as are entitled to belief, and a jury should not convict upon the testimony of such hired witnesses.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-4\">The judge declined to give the instructions requested, and instructed the jury as follows: \u201c The license of the defendant as an innholder would be violated, if, in the building to which that license applied, he sold intoxicating liquors to persons not guests, who had resorted to that building, either for food or for lodging, between the hours of eleven o\u2019clock at night and six o\u2019clock in the morning, or on the Lord\u2019s day, or when the windows of the room in which defendant or his servants thus sold intoxicating liquors were so screened by curtains as to interfere with a view of the business conducted in that room, or with a view of the interior of that room. A person, who for a considerable and substantial period of time violates, in the sale of intoxicating liquors, or in the keeping of intoxicating liquors for sale, the conditions of his license in the building to which that license applies, may be convicted of keeping and maintaining that building, at times when that building is so used in the violation of that license, as a common nuisance.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-5\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-6\"><em>S. L. </em>Barney, for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-7\"><em>S. G. </em>Bliss, Assistant Attorney General, for the Commonwealth.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b265-8\">Morton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiN\">The instructions given were appropriate and sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">The case made by the government was that the defendant sold intoxicating liquors on the Lord\u2019s day to several persons who w\u00e9nt into his premises for the purpose of procuring and drinking liquor. Such persons were not guests within the meaning of the statute, and there was no occasion to instruct the jury, as requested by the defendant, as to the rights of an innholder to sell to his guests. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. Hagan, 140 Mass. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-10\">The instructions requested as to curtains were properly refused. If the defendant placed or maintained curtains in his windows in such a way as to interfere with a view of the business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>conducted upon the premises, or with a view of the interior of the premises, it was a violation of his license, and it is immaterial for what purpose he maintained the curtains. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Worcester, </em>141 Mass. 58. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>141 Mass. 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">The last request of the defendant was properly refused. The court had no right to instruct the jury that the government\u2019s witnesses were not entitled to belief. The credibility of the witnesses on either side was a matter entirely for. the jury, and the instruction requested would have been erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
