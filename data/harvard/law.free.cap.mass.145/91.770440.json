They went across the street and stood for a time watching some other boys at play, the elder child not having &gt;id of the younger\u2019s hand. The younger child, without being noticed by the elder, left his side and started to cross the street alone, and, upon being seen and called by the elder, who ran after him, he ran, fell down, and rolled into a gutter at the side of the street, which had been filled with water for a long time by reason of an obstructed culvert, and received injuries which caused his death. Both of the child\u2019s parents and the elder brother knew of the existence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of this water. <em>Held, </em>in an action against the town, under the Pub. Sts. c. 52, \u00a7 17, that it could not be ruled as matter of law that the child\u2019s parents or his brother were not in the exercise of due care; and that it was competent for the jury to find that the children were travellers on the highway.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-4\">Tort, by the administrator of the estate of Frank E. Bliss, under the Pub. Sts. <em>c. </em>52, \u00a7 17, for the loss of the life of his intestate on April 22, 1885, occasioned by an alleged defect in Grant Street and Bridge Street, in South Hadley.

The plaintiff resided, with his wife and four children, of whom the intestate was one, in Grant Street, and about five rods from its intersection with Bridge Street. On the opposite side of Grant Street, and extending to Bridge Street, the gutter between the worked roadway and the sidewalk was filled with water by reason of an obstructed culvert, and had remained so for many days. The intestate fell into this water; and there was evidence tending to show that that was the cause of his sickness and death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">The plaintiff testified' that, at the time of the accident, he had lived in the same house about three and a half years;

that she had noticed this water on the opposite side of Grant Street and towards Bridge Street, and saw it that morning about half-past eight o\u2019clock ; that Frank was accustomed to play with Leon ;

and that he knew that this water was on the street in the ditch near the sidewalk, but had not known of any one\u2019s falling into it before his brother fell in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b111-6\">Hannah Cummings testified that she lived at the comer of Grant Street and Bridge Street; that she saw the children as they went out, and saw them go across Bridge Street, and stand there with other boys; that they were over there a few minutes, she did not know exactly how long; that she looked up and saw Frank coming across the street, and hallooed, but Leon did not hear her; that she hallooed again, and Leon ran ; that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>she saw Frank fall into the water; that she had seen the children about together a great many times; and that Leon always took good care of his brother, but did not keep hold of his hand always.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-4\">There was no other evidence on the question of due care, or whether the intestate was a traveller on the highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-5\">The defendant asked the judge to rule that there was no evidence that the plaintiff's intestate was in the exercise of due care; that there was no evidence that he was a traveller on the highway; and that, on all the evidence on these points, the plaintiff could not recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-6\">The judge refused so to rule, and submitted the case to the jury, with full instructions, not otherwise excepted to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b112-7\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-8\"><em>J. 0. Hammond, </em>for the defendant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-9\"><em>B. W. Bond, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b112-10\">Morton, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkS\">It cannot be said, as matter of law, that it was negligence on the part of the parents of the intestate to send him into the street for air and exercise in the charge of his brother Leon, who was eight years old. It was a question of fact, depending upon how much the street was used, and upon the intelligence, capacity, and experience of Leon, and was properly submitted to the jury. The evidence does not disclose any decisive act of negligence on the part of Leon, and it was for the jury to determine whether he was exercising reasonable diligence in the care of his infant brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">It was competent for the jury to find that the boys were travellers. They were using the street for air and exercise. The fact that they stopped for a few minutes to watch other boys at play was one of the natural and ordinary incidents of travel, and did not divest them of their rights as travellers. <em>Gulline </em>v. <em>Lowell, </em>144 Mass. 491.</p>\n<p id=\"ANT\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
