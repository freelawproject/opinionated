The defendant, in testifying in his own behalf, denied that such a conversation took place; and, on cross-examination, he was asked \u201cif he had been engaged in stock gambling \u201d at a place named. The defendant objected to this question, but was required to answer it. <em>Held, </em>that he had no ground of exception.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-7\">Indictment, in two counts, for the embezzlement, on December 15,1886, and on January 15,1887, respectively, of \u201cthirteen hundred and twenty pairs of shoes, each pair of the value of one dollar, of the property\u201d of Warren D.

J., it was not contended by the government that more than thirteen hundred and twenty pairs of shoes were embezzled. It appeared in evidence that Warren D. Hill, one of the persons from whom it was alleged that said goods were embezzled, after the time of the alleged embezzlement, charged the defendant, in a certain conversation, with having spent the money he had collected from the sales of said embezzled property in gambling in stocks. The defendant, in testifying in his own behalf, denied that such a conversation took place; and, on cross-examination, among other things, he was asked if he had been engaged in stock gambling at J. P. Welsh\u2019s office, in Lynn. He was also asked if he had been engaged in stock gambling at Wood\u2019s office, in Boston. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>defendant objected to said questions; but the objection was overruled, and the defendant was required to answer the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b368-4\">The jury returned a verdict of guilty; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b368-5\"><em>J. 3.

This is a sufficient description. The word \u201cshoes\u201d must be taken to mean shoes for the feet of human beings, and a description of a chattel by its proper and special name is sufficient. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Butterick, </em>100 Mass. 1. 3 Chit. Crim. Law, (2d ed.) 961.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We do not clearly understand what is meant by stock gambling in the exceptions, but the point of the inquiry is shown by the statement that there was evidence that Hill had \u201c charged the defendant, in a certain conversation, with having spent the money he had collected from the sales of said embezzled property in gambling in stocks.\u201d The defendant, testifying in his own behalf, could be asked, on cross-examination, if he had not spent considerable sums of money in stock gambling, or in anything else, and could be asked how he obtained the money. Such an examination should be confined to a period of time subsequent to that of the embezzlement. The questions asked were general, but it does not appear that the defendant was compelled to answer questions concerning any stock gambling in which he was engaged before the time when the evidence tended to show that he had embezzled the property described in the indictment. <em>Exceptions overruled.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
