That shortly after their marriage, they commenced keeping house in Danville, Pa., when one child was born to this marriage, which later, died. They continued to live together until August 13, 1913, when she left his house and home, and went to her mother\u2019s home, who lived four doors away from where the libelant lived. That libelant\u2019s children, by a former wife, are living with his mother at Danville, Pa. That his, the libelant\u2019s business, is that of motorman, and he has followed that for about six years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>Ruth M. Mauser was called as a witness and sworn on behalf of libelant. She testified in part, that she was fourteen years old, and resided at Danville, Pa.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-4\">She further testified that she came to Towanda, on the day she testified, with her father.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-5\">Other witnesses from Danville, Pa., were called and testified to conduct of respondent, and of libelant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-6\">The master, in his report, recommended a decree of divorce.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-7\">When this case was presented to the court, and after reading the testimony, we suggested to counsel that we were not satisfied that the residence of the libel-ant was in Bradford county, at the time he filed his libel in this case. Some time later, counsel for libelant took the deposition of Thomas Crotty, and asked to have it attached to the evidence previously taken in this case, which we permitted. This evidence was for the purpose of establishing the residence of the libelant in Bradford county, and in part is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-8\">\u201cQ. Mr. Crotty, where do you reside? A. In Towanda, Pa. Q. What is your business? A. Hotel business. Q. Have you charge of a hotel here in Towanda? A. Yes, sir. Q. Wfiiat hotel is it? A. Tidd House. Q. Do you recall of meeting a man by the name of William H. Mauser? A. Yes, sir. Q. About when? A. Along the latter part of August. Q. Through whom did you meet him? A. David E. Kaufman. Q. Did he stop at your hotel at that time? A. Yes, sir. Q. Does his name appear upon your register as staying there the night of August 25? A. The register does not show it but I recall of him being there that night; that is, it was the latter part of August, and I remember you brought him there.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b318-9\">This is all the testimony there is, bearing upon the question of the residence of the libelant. There is no dispute but what the libelant is a bona fide resident of the state of Pennsylvania, and has been a resident for more than one year previous to the filing of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>libel, but the evidence discloses that the libelant\u2019s residence was in Danville' on August 13, 1913, when his wife left him. That his mother lives in Danville, his daughter by the former wife lives with her grandmother in Danville.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-4\">That there is no trolley line in Towanda, where the libelant could be employed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-5\">We think, that in order to give the court of this county jurisdiction to entertain the proceedings in the case at bar, the libelant must have become a bona fide resident of the county of Bradford at some time however short, before the filing of his libel, or petition in this case. While residence is a matter of intention, yet we think there should appear sufficient facts and circumstances to warrant the court in believing that the residence of the libelant in the county where the libel is presented, was bona fide, and in good faith.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-6\">In the case at bar, the libelant has not even testified that he intended to make Towanda his home, at any time. He was not engaged in any business at Towanda, Pa. He had no room, or dwelling, other than he stopped one night at a hotel, paid his bill, presumably for the time he occupied it, and for the meals that were furnished him. He testified that his residence was at Towanda, Pa., and when asked where it was, he gave the Platt Hotel as his place of residence, and when his deposition was subsequently taken, he showed by Thomas Crotty, that some time the latter part of August he stayed one night at the Tidd Hotel, and this was so casual, that his name did not even appear on the hotel register.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-7\">So that, taking all the facts and circumstances we are not convinced that the libelant has a bona fide residence in Bradford county, Pa., and that he did not have such a residence at the time he filed the libel, in this case, on August 26, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b319-8\">We think the fact that the subpoena of divorce in this case was served., personally, upon the respondent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>at Danville, Pa., would not give the court jurisdiction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-3\">\u201cThe consent of the parties, even with the consent of the court added, cannot give the court jurisdiction of a libel in divorce, based on the allegations of cruel and barbarous treatment, or of indignities to the person, unless the libelant should have resided in the state at least one whole year previous to the filing of his or her petition or libel. This prerequisite is not in the nature of a personal privilege or safeguard which the respondent may waive, or the court, in its discretion, dispense with:\u201d English v. English, 19 Pa. Superior Ct. 586.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b320-4\">Our attention has been called, by counsel, to the Act of Assembly approved May 9, 1913, P.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">1. The ground upon which the court based its decree dismissing the libel in this case was that the libelant was not a bona fide resident of the county of Bradford at the time it was filed, but that he and the libelee were domiciled and resident in Montour county. True, the libel, which was sworn to, asserts \u201cthat he is a citizen of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and county of Bradford, and hath resided in the said commonwealth for the period of one whole year and upwards previous to the filing of this his petition or libel.\u201d Even if it be conceded that this averment was sufficient, prima facie, to give the court jurisdiction to entertain the libel, it does not stand on any higher plane as to conclusiveness than any other essential averment, and, therefore, it did not preclude the court from dismissing the libel if, upon hearing, it was shown the libelant was not a bona fide resident of the county. The evidence given on the hearing is recited in the opinion filed by the learned judge, and need not be restated. In our judgment it amply sustains his finding of fact. His legal conclusion, that under sec. 2 of the act of 1815 the court of Bradford county did not have jurisdiction, necessarily and logically follows. The question is not complicated by appearance and answer of the libelee, and the case is plainly distinguishable in its essential facts from Ames v. Ames, 7 Pa. Superior Ct. 456. The decision was in exact accord with Sherwood\u2019s App., 17 W. N. C. 338, s. c. Sadler\u2019s Reps. 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">2. It is claimed that the provision of the act of 1815 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to which we have referred was abrogated by the Act of May 9, 1913, P. L. 191, and therefore now the libelant may present his or her libel to any court of common pleas of the commonwealth. The language of the act of 1913, \u201cThat the several courts of common pleas shall have jurisdiction in any action of divorce,\u201d is similar in import to the language of the act of April 26, 1850, \u201cThe jurisdiction of the several courts of common pleas shall hereafter extend,\u201d to the language of the act of May 8, 1854, \u201cit shall be lawful for the courts of common pleas of this commonwealth to grant divorces,\u201d and to the language of the act of March 9, 1855, \u201cit shall be lawful for the several courts of common pleas in this commonwealth to entertain jurisdiction of all cases of divorce from the bonds of matrimony.\u201d Such expressions, which very frequently appear in statutes, are used to designate the common pleas as distinguished from other courts of the commonwealth, and not with a view of abrogating common-law distinctions between local and transitory actions or statutory regulations designating, according to the residence of one or both of the parties, the particular court of common pleas in which a proceeding shall be instituted. Clearly, this language does not compel the conclusion for which counsel for appellant contend.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">Allusion is made by them to the provision of sec. 2 of the act of 1913 relative to residence of one year in the commonwealth. If this section stood alone there would be considerable force in the appellant\u2019s argument that residence in the county where the petition is presented is not an essential. But the section does not stand alone. It is part of the general system of laws relating to divorce, and it is a familiar principle that statutes in pari materia, though passed at different sessions of the legislature, are to be construed together and so as to give effect to them all, if that be possible. If the later statute contains no repealing clause and its provisions are not irreconcilable with the provisions of a. former <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>statute belonging to the system of laws relating to the same general subject, it will not, in general, be deemed to repeal it. There is no inconsistency between the provision of the act of 1913 and the provision of the act of 1815. Both are to be regarded, and, as there is no express repeal and no clear intention of repeal, we hold that the latter provision was not abrogated.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">The decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
