Meehan; that neither did the said deponents, or either of them, nor any of their codefendants in any wise personally enter into any agreement with the said plaintiff for the purchase of said machinery, or any part thereof, or any of the articles set forth in said agreement, but did purchase said machinery and articles and signed said agreement to purchase as a committee appointed by the said Polish Publishing Company under the direction of the resolution passed by the board of directors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\">The court discharged the rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defense.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the order of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b356-6\"><em>George J.

This action involves the question of the personal liability of the five defendants who signed the paper set forth in plaintiff\u2019s statement. The cases show them to be personally liable: Quigley v. DeHaas, 82 Pa. 267; Ulam v. Boyd, 87 Pa. 477; Barclay v. Pursley, 110 Pa. 13; Crelier v. Mackey, 243 Pa. 363; Tippets v.

J.,</author>\n<p id=\"b357-3\">The instrument sued on begins: \u201cI, F. E. Meehan, agree to furnish to the Polish Publishing Co. . . . the following:\u201d Then, after enumerating and describing the articles and stating the prices and terms of payment, the paper concludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-4\">\u201cAny of the above can be returned, if not satisfactory.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-5\">\u201c Witness:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-6\">\u201c Antoni S. Smolczgnski W. L. Raczynski</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">\u00a3\u00a3 Alexsander Dutkiewicz Joseph Witkowski. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\">\u201cStanislaw J. Cienkowski</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-9\">This paper does not, on its face, import an agreement to sell to these defendants or an agreement on their part to pay. It imports simply an undertaking on the part of the plaintiff to sell to the Polish Publishing Co., and their signing of the paper, unexplained, could be more plausibly interpreted as a witnessing of his undertaking than as a promise on their part to pay the price. Even if no significance is to be attached to the word \u201c witness,\u201d still, as the paper contains no obligatory words applicable to the defendants personally, or indeed to any one other than the plaintiff, an essential part of a contract which bound them was lacking: Hopkins v. Mehaffy, 11 S. &amp; R. 126. In that case, Chief Justice Gibson pointed out the difference between the covenant of an agent who describes himself as contracting for his principal and the covenant of a principal through the means and by the instrumentality of an agent, and says: \u201cThe first is the individual covenant of the agent, the second is the individual covenant of the principal.\u201d But further on in his opinion he suggests the principle which is applicable here and which distinguishes this case from all of those cited by plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The question was whether the paper was the defendant\u2019s deed, and regarding this Chief Justice Gibson said: \u201cHe sealed and delivered it, undoubtedly; but there is something more than sealing and delivery necessary to a deed. It ought to contain the proper parts of a con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>tract; and in this instrument there are no obligatory words, applicable to the person of the defendant. Even the sealing and delivery were as the president, and in behalf of the corporation.\u201d Clearly, the instrument in question did not contain all the essentials of a contract. Undoubtedly, it would be pertinent evidence on the trial, but, without something more than was contained in it, it would not sustain an action against these defendants. Hence, it was not a contradiction or denial of anything legally implied from their signing this unilateral instrument, for them to allege in their affidavits of defense that the goods were sold and delivered to the Polish Publishing Co., a corporation, and not to them; that in making the agreement under which the goods were sold and delivered they were acting in the capacity of agents of the corporation duly authorized so to act by resolution of its board of directors; and that the fact that they were so authorized and acting was made known to the plaintiff. Assuming the truth of these allegations, it may be as appropriately said here, as it was in Hopkins v. Mehaffy: the plaintiff did not treat on the basis of the defendants being personally answerable, and to permit him to maintain this action would permit him to have what was not in contemplation of either party, recourse to the person of the agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-3\">The appeal is dismissed at the costs of the appellant, without prejudice, etc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
