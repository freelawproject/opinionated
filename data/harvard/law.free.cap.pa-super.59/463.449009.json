The estate was not given to her for life. If the bequest had been made to Louisa Laub for life, then the position of the court below might have been correct, but it was given to her absolutely, and in such a case it would not pass to the heirs of her sisters or brothers: Mengel\u2019s App., 61 Pa. 248; Smith\u2019s App., 23 Pa. 9.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b506-13\">Under the will, Louisa Laub had the right to consume the entire fund bequeathed to her; therefore, we take it that that was an absolute estate: Hambright\u2019s App., 2 Grant, 320; Welsh\u2019s Est., 239 Pa. 616.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b506-14\"><em>Frank S.

The construction placed on these items, cut down to a life estate the absolute estate given to Louisa Laub by earlier items (9th and 10th) of the will. The view taken by the court was evidently the same as that held by counsel for the trustee of Louisa Laub when its account was filed, and is in accord with the clearly expressed intention of the testator.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The decree of the orphans\u2019 court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
