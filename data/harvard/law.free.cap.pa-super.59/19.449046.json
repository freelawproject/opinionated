The services rendered by Mr. Brennan are set forth in his statement hereto annexed, from which it appears that he rendered no unusual services except in connection with the contest over the probate of the alleged codicil above referred to and the making of careful inquiry into the value of ten shares of stock of the Columbus Securities Company and ten shares of stock of the Burgoyne-Bingham Company, the latter company being in process of liquidation and the former having had receivers appointed for it subsequent to testator\u2019s death. While commissions are frequently, indeed usually, allowed upon unconverted securities, yet the fact that they have not been converted is to be taken into consideration in determining the rate at which commissions should be allowed. In the present instance, as the stock is specifically bequeathed, whatever commissions are allowed must be borne by the residuary legatees, or rather by the trust estate for John O\u2019Brien, as there are not sufficient assets to pay in full the bequest for his use. The chief responsibility which an executor must assume with respect to stock belonging to his testator\u2019s estate is in ascertaining, first, whether the stock is of such a character that it should be held or sold, and if the latter, then to exercise discretion in determining the time to sell; but in the present instance responsibility is reduced to a minimum, the only obligation imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>on the accountant being to keep the stock safely and to transfer it (all except five shares), to himself as testamentary trustee. Counsel for the accountant urges that the auditing judge should take into consideration, in fixing the compensation to be allowed the accountant, the fact that upon the termination of the trust he will not be entitled to any further commissions on principal. This may be conceded as being the usual rule, but here, again, the services to be rendered by the trustee are not likely to be very burdensome, so far as principal is concerned, as the trust has less than four years to run; and so far as income is concerned, the accountant will, of course, be entitled to commissions on any dividends received while the trust continues. Commissions of two and one-half per cent are usually allowed for responsibility (Oliver\u2019s Estate, 20 W. N. 318; Wooten\u2019s Estate, 21 Pa. Dist. Rep. 1035), and if to this is added one-half of one per cent the auditing judge is of the opinion that the accountant will be amply compensated for services rendered and to be rendered in connection with this stock; and with regard to the other assets, the auditing judge believes that commissions should be allowed at the usual rate of five per cent; awards will therefore be made accordingly. In reaching this conclusion the auditing-judge assumed that the stock is worth its appraised value, no testimony having been submitted to show the contrary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-5\">On exceptions Anderson, J., filed an opinion as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b61-6\">Exceptions were also filed on the subject of commissions, by the executor against the reduction of commissions to three per cent, and by the pecuniary legatee against the allowance of any commissions on the specific legacies on the ground that no services had been rendered with respect thereto that justified compensation at this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>The argument on behalf of the accountant was founded largely on the fact that as trustee he would hold the stock for five years, and under the act of assembly would be unable to get other commissions than those now allowed. We think, however, that the question here is not one of commissions, but rather compensation under the peculiar facts of this case. The specific legacy on which the commissions were claimed has not been, and in all probability will not be, converted by the executor either as executor or as trustee. As said by Mr. Justice Strong in McCauseland\u2019s Appeal, 38 Pa. 466, \u201cCommissions are given as a compensation for labor and responsibility, and where neither the one has been performed, nor the other incurred, there is nothing to be compensated.\u201d And by Mr. Justice Gordon, in Montgomery\u2019s Appeal, 86 Pa. 230, \u201cThe compensation of a trustee of any character may be arrived at, as a matter of convenience, by way of a percentage on the amount of the receipts and disbursements. But after all, on all authorities, it is a question not of percentage but of compensation. . . . Whilst a percentage is constantly spoken of and used because of its convenience, yet, it is compensation, nothing more or less, that is steadily kept in view.\u201d See also Taylor\u2019s Estate, 17 Pa. Dist. Rep. 395. We think under the circumstances of this case, the sum of $250 would fully compensate the trustee for any labor and responsibility in reference to the stock to be retained by him as trustee. As to the specific legacy deliverable to the legatee, we think the compensation allowed by the auditing judge, three per cent of the appraised value, is neither too large nor too small for the trouble which the accountant will have in transferring the stock.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b62-4\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were in dismissing exceptions to adjudication.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b62-5\"><em>Horace M.

But it is equally clear that whenever it has been necessary to define the legal status of a trustee in this respect, the courts have uniformly held that what such trustee is by law entitled to receive is compensation for responsibility necessarily assumed and services performed in the execution of the trust: Harland\u2019s Accounts, 5 Rawle, 323; Montgomery\u2019s App., 86 Pa. 230; Harrison\u2019s Est., 217 Pa. 207. In the case last cited Mr. Justice Mestrezat reviews the decisions and clearly points out the reasons on which the true rule rests. It follows the major proposition advanced by the able counsel for the appellant, to wit, \u201cThe executor of this estate, who is also a testamentary trustee, is entitled to a commission of five per cent of the corpus of the estate, etc.,\u201d cannot be accepted as a strictly accurate statement of the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">We may concede that in most respects, save perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>in the probable duration of the trust and the difficulty of ascertaining the heirs who might ultimately be entitled, Davis\u2019s App., 100 Pa. 201, resembles the case at bar. There the learned orphans\u2019 court, in view of all of the circumstances, fixed the compensation of the executor trustee at a sum equal to five per cent of the corpus of the estate. On appeal, the Supreme Court said: \"In view of all of the circumstances it is not clear that the amount allowed was unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">So in the present case, where the learned court below fixed the compensation of the appellant at less than five per cent, we are compelled to say, after an examination of the entire record and arguments of counsel, it has not been made clear to us that there has been any abuse of discretion or that the compensation fixed by the court below is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">The decree is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
