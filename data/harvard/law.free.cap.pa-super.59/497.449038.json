T., 1914, by defendants, from judgment of C. P. Bradford Co., Dec. T., 1913, No. 223, for plaintiff on case stated in suit of David J. Armstrong v. George N. Bird et al., Commissioners of Bradford County.</summary>\n<judges data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aa07\">Before Rice, P.

J., filed the following opinion:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-10\">It is agreed by the case stated, that the defendants are, and on January 1, 1913, were the county commissioners of the county of Bradford, and state of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b537-11\">That the plaintiff was a resident of Herrick township, on January 1, 1913, upon which date he killed a fox, and thereafter, to wit: on the same day, and in order to secure the reward or bounty named, and provided for by sec. 1 of the act of the general assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved April 10, 1907, produced the entire pelt before P. D. Hurley, justice of the peace in and for said county, and then and there made an affidavit before the said justice, that he killed the said fox, at the time and place aforesaid. Whereupon, the said justice of the peace, in the presence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>the plaintiff, and of an elector of the said county, cut off the ears of said pelt and burned the same, all of which was done in conformity to the provisions of sec. 2 of the act of assembly of April 10, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-4\">It was further alleged in said case stated, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-5\">3. That upon the destruction of said ears the said justice of the peace gave to the plaintiff a certificate for the killing of said fox directed to the commissioners of said county, setting forth clearly the facts, that the provisions of said act of assembly had been complied with, naming the kind of animal killed, the name of the person who killed it, the time it was killed and the name of the place in the said commonwealth where it was killed: that such certificate was in proper form, and in all respects agreeably to and in conformity with the requirements and provisions of said act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-6\">4. That the plaintiff on or about the same day on which he received the said certificate presented it to the defendants at and in their office and demanded an order in his favor on the county treasurer of said county directing the payment of the reward and bounty provided for by the said act of assembly for killing said fox by him, to wit, the sum of $2.00.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-7\">5. That the defendants refused to accept said certificate, and to draw an order on the county treasurer for the payment of the said bounty and reward in favor of the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-8\">6. The defendants now contend and aver, inter alia, in answer to the plaintiff\u2019s claim of right to a writ of mandamus, that the said act of assembly, approved April 10, 1907, was and is repealed by the act of the general assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved July 25, 1913, and that no duty of the defendants to issue orders for the payment of bounties or rewards for killing noxious animals under the act of 1907, now exists, or has since the passage of the act of 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b538-9\">7. If the court be of the opinion that under the fore<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>going statement of facts, agreed upon, it was the duty of the defendants to issue an order, drawn upon the county treasurer, in favor of or payable to the plaintiff, directing the payment of $2.00 to him for killing one fox under the provisions of the act of assembly approved April 10, 1907, when he presented the certificate mentioned in the foregoing statement of facts to them, and that they have not been discharged or relieved from its performance by the passage of the act of general assembly approved July 25, 1913, then and in that case an order and decree shall be made and entered by the court granting and awarding a peremptory mandamus against the defendants, commanding and requiring them to issue the same to the plaintiff for the sum of $2.00, for killing the one fox mentioned in the foregoing statement of facts, otherwise the court is to enter judgment in favor of the defendants, costs to follow the judgment, order or decree, and each party reserves the right of appeal from such judgment, order or decree to the Superior or Supreme Court, either or both, of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-4\">The right of plaintiff to recover in this case, arises entirely under and by virtue of the provisions of the act of April 10, 1907, providing for the payment of bounties, for the killing of noxious animals, and prescribing the manner of proof necessary to procure the same from the county, and the county in turn from the commonwealth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">It will not be denied, that if the act of April 10, 1907, is repealed by implication, by the act of July 25, 1913, the plaintiff has no case, as the following afithorities establish: Com. v. Beatty, 1 Watts, 382; Abbott v. Com., 8 Watts, 517; Fenelon\u2019s Petition, 7 Pa. 173; North Canal Street Road, 10 Watts, 351; Com. v. Leech, 24 Pa. 55; Grim v. Weissenberg School Dist., 57 Pa. 433.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">The act of July 25, 1913, provides for future cases, and of course, repeals all inconsistent laws; but this does not avoid the liability of the county under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>former act of April 10, 1907, as to rewards and bounties earned prior to July 25, 1913. Neither is there any language or provisions in the latter act, to indicate that the legislature intended any such application.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\">The liability of the county, in the first instance, has not been taken away, the form of procedure and remedies, are not changed. The liability, if any, under form, directed by the new act, where it applies, is the same as under the old law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">So far as wild cats, gray foxes and weasels are concerned, the latter act may be regarded as repealing the former. As to those killed after July 25, 1913, it provides for the payment of same bounties on wild cats and gray foxes, as the act of 1907, and on weasels increases the bounty from $1.00 to $2.00. It omits mink from its bounty list, but includes hawks and owls. The bounty claimed in this case, is for the killing of a fox, on January 1, 1913, and manifestly, the plaintiff\u2019s right to it, under the act of 1907, is not affected by the act of 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\">The bounties for killing foxes before the act of 1913 was approved, must be paid just the same as if the latter act had never been passed. This act only deals with animals killed after its passage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-7\">Implied repeals are not favored. If the two statutes can stand together, the latter does not abrogate the former: Erie v. Boots, 72 Pa. 196; Com. v. Vetterlein, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 587.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-8\">The leaning of the court is strongly against repealing the positive provisions of a former statute by construction. To repeal the prior statute by implication, there should be such a manifest and total repugnancy in the provisions of the new statute as to lead to the conclusion that the latter abrogated, and was designed to abrogate the former: Hendrix\u2019s Account, 146 Pa. 285; In re Contested Election of Barber, Prothonotary, etc., 86 Pa. 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-9\">Where a late statute is absolutely repugnant to a former one only in part, it repeals the former one, only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>so far as the repugnancy extends, and leaves all the remainder in force: In re Contested Election of Barber, Prothonotary, etc., 86 Pa. 392.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-4\">It has been said that an act repealing or anywise modifying the remedy of a party by action or suit, should not be construed to affect actions or suits brought before the repeal, or modification. Whilst this statement is probably too broad, it is nevertheless true, that, where the effect of the new legislation is not to take away the jurisdiction or right previously existing, nor to deny a remedy for its enforcement, substantially like the one previously allowed, but merely to change the remedy, the right and the jurisdiction continuing under the former, directed by the new act, where it applies, or else under the old law: Endlich on Interpretation of Statutes, sec. 482.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-5\">Where a proceeding founded upon one act of assembly, is commenced, and while pending another act is passed, taking away the jurisdiction, the proceedings fail; but where the remedy only is changed, it continues under the form directed by the new act, where it applies, or else under the old law: The Hickory Tree Road, 43 Pa. 139; Uwehlan Township Road, 30 Pa. 156.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-6\">There is but slight difference between the act of April 10, 1907, and the act of July 25, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-7\">Section 1 of the act of July 25, 1913, fixes the amount of the reward or bounty, to be paid for each wild cat, and for each fox, the same as the act of April 10, 1907; for each weasel, it doubles the amount of the bounty, and omits all bounties for killing of minks, and also provides for each goshawk or sharp shinned hawk, the sum of fifty cents, and for each gray horned owl, the sum of fifty cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b541-8\">Sections 2 and 3 of above acts, are substantially the same in their provisions. Section 4 of the act of July 25, 1913, provides for the payment of the bounty by the state, out of the funds realized from hunters' licenses. The same section of the act of 1907, required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>an appropriation by the legislature, to reimburse the different counties. This is substantially the only difference there is, between these two sections, in the different acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-3\">Section 5 of the two acts, relates to the penal provisions for violation of the act, and while they do not read alike, yet the provisions are substantially the same. Therefore, we cannot see wherein the act of July 25, 1913, is in any way repugnant to the act of April 10, 1907, so far as bounties for killing foxes prior to July 25, 1913, are concerned. While sec. 1 extends the provisions of the bounty to noxious birds, and increases the bounty upon weasels, yet the procedure provided ip secs. 2 and 3 of the act of 1913, is really a reenactment of the provisions contained in the act of 1907. The form of proof, and the liability of the county, in the first instance, is the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-4\">The act of 1907, required an appropriation from the legislature, to reimburse the counties, for the money paid out, and the act of 1913, provides that the counties shall be reimbursed from the money received by the state, from hunters\u2019 licenses. Therefore, we can see no repugnance between the two acts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-5\">While it is true that for all noxious animals killed prior to July 25, 1913, the party claiming the bounty must proceed under the act of 1907, and for all noxious animals killed after the approval of the act of 1913, proof must be made under the provisions of the latter act, yet in each instance, the liability of the county is the same and the form of the records, and the requisition of the county, upon the state, for reimbursement, is substantially the same. All the difference there is, the state reimburses the county from a different fund than it did under the act of 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b542-6\">The more natural, if not necessary inference, in all such cases, is that the legislature intended the new law to be auxiliary to and in aid of the purposes of the old law. There should therefore be such a manifest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>and total repugnancy in the provisions of the new law, as to lead to the conclusion that the latter abrogated, and was designed to abrogate the former: Hendrix\u2019s Account, 146 Pa. 285.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-4\">There appears to be no such repugnancy between the provisions of the act of 1913, and those of the act of 1907, so far as bounties for killing foxes prior to July 25, 1913. These two acts may well stand together. They are not inconsistent, at least to this extent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-5\">We are therefore of the opinion, that the act of July 25, 1913, P. L. 1036, does not repeal the act of April 10, 1907, either by express provisions, nor by implication, so far as the claim of the plaintiff in this case is concerned, for the bounty for the killing of one fox, on January 1, 1913.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-6\">The sole purpose of the act of July 25, 1913, as we view it, was undoubtedly to extend the law to cover certain noxious birds, and to raise the bounty on weasels, from $1.00 to $2.00, and to discontinue the bounty on mink, and to provide a permanent fund, out of which the counties could be reimbursed, by the state. The legislature surely knew of the existence of the act of April 10, 1907, and if it intended the repealing of the act of 1907, it could easily have provided for its repeal. The whole naturally, if not necessary inference in all such cases, is that the legislature intended the new law to be auxiliary to and in aid of the purpose of the old: Com. v. Vetterlin, 21 Pa. Superior Ct. 587.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-7\">And now, to wit: June 24, 1914, upon consideration of the foregoing facts, we are of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this case, from the county of Bradford, the $2.00 claimed for the bounty for one fox killed on January 1, 1914.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b543-8\">It is therefore ordered, that a peremptory writ of mandamus issue in the above case, directed against the defendants as county commissioners of Bradford county, requiring them to issue to the plaintiff, an order upon the county treasurer of Bradford county, Pa., for $2.00 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>bounty, due and payable to him, for the killing of one fox, on June 1, 1913, as required by the provisions of the act of assembly of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, approved April 10, 1907, and that the county of Bradford pay the costs.</summary>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AF7D\">April 19, 1915:</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b544-4\"><em>Error assigned </em>was the judgment of the court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b544-5\"><em>Rodney A.
