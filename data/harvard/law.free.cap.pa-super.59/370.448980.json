It is not averred in the affidavit of defense that the defendants disclosed to the plaintiff the names of the principals for whom they were acting. The plaintiff\u2019s employment antedated the signing of the agreement by the bondholders, and considerable expense was. incurred before the date fixed by the circular letter (May 31, 1908), when the bonds were to be deposited in the trust company in Philadelphia. The subsequent serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>ices rendered by plaintiff were in the continuance of the same employment under the direction of the defendants as a committee. While the plaintiff knew he was acting under the direction of a committee composed of prominent lawyers, he did not demand the names of their principals, and he was satisfied to pay out his money for costs and traveling expenses on the faith of his employment by these defendants who were acting for principals he did not know, and they were satisfied that he should expend his private funds in the interest of their principals without disclosing to him the names of the persons they represented in this important litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-3\">As far back as Eichbaum v. Irons, 6 W. &amp; S. 67, it was held that the members of a committee appointed by a political meeting to provide a free dinner for a party, are personally liable for the bill. Which was followed in Beeson v. Lang, 85 Pa. 197.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">The defendants assumed to act for undisclosed principals and employed the plaintiff to do the necessary work, which involved the right to incur necessary expenses, and which expenditures were in the interest of their undisclosed principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Under the terms of the agreement the committee was self-perpetuating, in case of death or resignation of a member, and they were given necessary power to represent, or act as agents or attorneys for bondholders, and to employ all necessary agents, attorneys, and other expert advisors, to the end that proper steps be taken to protect the bondholders\u2019 interests. The proceedings could only be instituted by the payment of fees and expenses, and when they directed the plaintiff to institute the suit they must stand between him and their undisclosed principals.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">It further appears from the affidavit that the committee did receive the sum of $10,000, and purchased real estate therewith; from which fund in their hands they could well have protected themselves from. this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>claim, and paid the debt they had incurred by the plaintiff\u2019s expending his money.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\">It is also to be noted, this claim is only for necessary expenses paid by the plaintiff, and does not include any claim for the professional services rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
