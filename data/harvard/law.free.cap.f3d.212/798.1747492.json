The District Court, which had earlier dismissed all claims against the other defendants and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>the official capacity claim against Cyrus, granted summary judgment in favor of Cyrus on the section 1983 claim and state tort law claims against him in his individual capacity, holding that the facts of record did not establish a constitutional violation. Nicini appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">In February 1990, fifteen-year-old Anthony Nicini, Jr., was admitted to the John F. Kennedy Hospital\u2019s Crisis Center (JFK) after an apparent suicide attempt. DYFS became involved when JFK notified it of Nicini\u2019s allegations that his father had physically abused him. Two DYFS caseworkers responded to JFK, and Nicini told them that he was afraid of his father, who \u201cpunches a lot\u201d and \u201calways hits with closed fist.\u201d App. at 212. Nicini also said that he had attempted suicide before. DYFS notified the prosecutor\u2019s office of Nicini\u2019s allegations and assisted his mother in obtaining a temporary restraining order against Nicini\u2019s father. DYFS also assigned caseworker Frank Cyrus to Nicini\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">Nicini continued to have difficulty at home and in school. According to a DYFS report dated September 27, 1990, Nicini slashed his wrists that month in an apparent suicide attempt and thereafter left home after an argument with his mother. The report states that Nicini \u201chas no where to go and needs placement.\u201d App. at 214. DYFS was informed on October 9, 1990, that Nicini was not at school and that he had previously told the assistant principal that he would not return home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 10, 1990, DYFS received a call from the police in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, that Nicini had been located and that he had repeated his refusal to return home and again stated that his father was abusive. Ex. at 28. That same day, a DYFS caseworker contacted Nicini\u2019s mother, who said that she did not want Nicini to return home, and his father, who could not identify any relatives with whom Nicini could stay. Nicini\u2019s father came to DYFS to sign a foster care placement agreement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b839-11\">DYFS placed Nicini in the foster home of Dennis Armente but Nicini ran away on or before November 2, 1990. After Nicini was located, his aunt, Catherine Livingston, agreed to DYFS\u2019s request that Nici-ni stay with her. On or before December 31, 1990, Nicini ran away once again. Livingston had apparently become ill and DYFS arranged for Nicini to stay with Bonnie Nicini, another aunt. Cyrus then arranged that Nicini be evaluated by a psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Trigiani. Dr. Trigiani was unsure after Nicini\u2019s first appointment on January 3, 1991, whether Nicini required inpatient psychiatric care but agreed to recommend Nicini\u2019s evaluation at JFK. On January 10, 1991, Cyrus informed Nicini\u2019s mother of Dr. Trigiani\u2019s recommendation and requested that she bring Nicini to JFK.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-12\">What happened thereafter is not clear from the record or the appendices submitted with the parties\u2019 briefs, but apparently Nicini was not admitted to JFK at that time. However, a DYFS report dated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>January 30, 1991 notes that Nicini was at JFK Hospital with an infected hand and might require admission to treat the infection. Bonnie Nicini reportedly stated that the plan was to hospitalize Nicini for depression. The report also states that when the hospital sought consent from Ni-cini\u2019s mother for his treatment, she refused and claimed he was in DYFS custody. At some point thereafter, Nicini was transferred to JFK\u2019s psychiatric unit for evaluation. On February 5, 1991, DYFS learned that Nicini had run away from the psychiatric unit after JFK recommended the possibility of admitting Nicini to treat his depression.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">Nicini ran to the home of Edward and Dolores Morra in Cherry Hill, New 'Jersey. Nicini\u2019s older brother Danny had gone to school with their children and had stayed with them while experiencing similar family problems. On February 9,1991, the police notified DYFS that they had located Nicini at the Morra home. According to a DYFS incident report, Nicini had been taken to JFK but was \u201cready for discharge.\u201d Ex. at 72. A DYFS caseworker (not Cyrus) contacted Catherine Livingston, who stated that she had known Nicini was at the Morra home and that she would not permit him to return to her home. The caseworker then spoke to Ni-cini\u2019s father, who expressed his belief that the Morras were \u201cnot [a] good placement but [who] <em>agreed to weekend </em>placement.\u201d Ex. at 69 (emphasis in original). After being given the option of taking Nicini home or locating a relative with whom Nicini could stay, Nicini\u2019s father told the caseworker to speak to Livingston. She, of course, had already refused to take Nicini back.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">The caseworker then permitted Nicini, who \u201cwas refusing to go anywhere else,\u201d Ex. at 69, to return to the Morra home that day, Saturday, February 9, 1991. The incident report states that \u201cFrank Cyrus will contact[the Morras] on Monday [February 11].\u201d Ex. at 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">Between February 9,1991 and February 28, 1991, Cyrus visited Nicini twice at the Morra home. He also had telephone contacts with Nicini and the Morras. App. at 226.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Cyrus\u2019s first visit was apparently on Monday, February 11, 1991. App. at 250 (expert report). It was Cyrus\u2019s overall impression that \u201ceverything was positive,\u201d App. at 226-27, and that everything \u201cpointfed] towards[Nieini] doing well there and becoming stabilized and progressing ...,\u201d App. at 228. Additionally, a counsel- or from an outreach center visited Nicini once a week at the Morra home. During that same- time period, Cyrus performed a perpetrator (\u201cPERP\u201d) check on the Mor-ras, which would have revealed any criminal record of sexual abuse in the state of New Jersey, including any reports of such abuse to DYFS. The PERP check revealed nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">Cyrus interviewed the Morras during a home visit. He did not remember asking whether they had ever had any contact with any law enforcement agency but he recalled asking Edward Morra if anything would prevent him from becoming a foster parent, and Morra replied in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">On February 28, 1991, Nicini appeared at a hearing before the Honorable Vincent D. Segal in the Family Part of the Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey. Although the record does not make clear the purpose of the hearing, the proceedings were apparently related both to certain criminal conduct by Nicini and to where he should be placed. As a result of the hearing, Judge Segal sentenced Ni-cini to two years probation and also concluded that Nicini should remain with the Morras.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>Cyrus was present and testified at the hearing along with Nicini, Nicini\u2019s mother, and Catherine Livingston, Nicini\u2019s aunt. Also present were the Assistant Prosecutor for Camden County, New Jersey, and Ronald DeSimone, an attorney representing Nicini. Cyrus informed the court of Nicini\u2019s prior placements and that Nicini:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-4\">is currently with a friend and the family, the Morra family.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He\u2019s not with a foster family. Tony was with the foster family initially, Mr. Dennis Armento, and he left the home unofficially....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-5\">Tony found his way to the Morras, who I guess was a friend of his. The Morras indicated they would \u2014 they knew him, they liked him and they wouldn\u2019t mind him staying there. He\u2019s been there now for a couple of weeks. They have indicated that he\u2019s doing very well there, no problems. But that is not an official foster home, that\u2019s an unofficial home.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">App. at 154-55.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">In response to the court\u2019s query whether the Morras would qualify as para-foster parents, Cyrus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-10\">Yes they would, your Honor. We\u2019ve \u2014 so far the only thing I\u2019ve done is a perp check, perpetrator check, and there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s come up. There\u2019s no\u2014 nothing we\u2019ve seen in terms of any problem with the law. Although I think, and Mrs. Nicini can speak for herself, I think she has some objections about it on a full time basis. But the family seems to show an interest towards Tony, they have said they wouldn\u2019t mind keeping him \u2014 keeping him on a temporary basis. He has been stable since he\u2019s been with them. But like I say that\u2019s \u2014 right now they are not an official foster family, although I\u2019m sure they would \u2014 they would apply for para-foster custody if the parents are willing to let them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">App. at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">When Judge Segal asked Nicini\u2019s mother for her comments, she stated as to the Morras:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-15\">[T]hey have harbored my oldest son on several occasions when he had taken off.... I don\u2019t know them personally, only \u2014 only what I had heard. My oldest daughter knows \u2014 goes to school with kids that are friends with Eric Morra, their son, which I believe is 16 or 17, and I\u2019ve been told that he\u2019s into drugs. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, but it\u2019s just what I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t know, something just seems strange about these people, why they would \u2014 if they don\u2019t know Tony, why they would even take him in.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b841-16\">App. at 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-17\">Nicini\u2019s attorney suggested to the court, in light of these concerns, that Nicini \u201cshould also be monitored for drugs periodically and \u2014 and maybe something should be looked in with this Morra family, in light of what Mrs. Nicini<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> had said I think maybe a closer investigation on whether or not that\u2019s an appropriate placement....\u201d App. at 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">Nicini\u2019s own testimony regarding his stay with the Morras was positive. After recounting the difficulties he experienced with his parents and with his prior placements, Nicini described his relationship with the Morras:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b841-19\">I don\u2019t love them or anything, but they\u2019re people I can talk to. I mean ever since I been there almost every night I\u2019ve been up talking to Mr. Morra, his name is Ed. I\u2019ve been up most of the time talking to him about how I feel about my parents and the way I\u2019ve been living and how I\u2019ve been treated and all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b842-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>App. at 164. Nicini also told Judge Segal that the Morras were tutoring him until he was re-enrolled in school.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">Judge Segal then summarized the history of physical abuse at the hands of Nici-ni\u2019s father and summarized a report prepared by Nicini\u2019s outreach counselor (not Cyrus), which stated that Nicini was no longer suicidal and had made a \u201cfine adjustment to the location where he\u2019s presently located.\u201d App. at 166. Judge Segal ruled that Nicini would \u201ccome[ ] under the care and supervision\u201d of DYFS, that he would remain with the Morras \u201cfor so long as [DYFS] thinks that\u2019s an appropriate placement,\u201d App. at 167, and that \u201c[u]nder no circumstances is[DYFS] to return the boy to the home of his parents without the authority of the Court,\u201d App. at 169. Judge Segal specifically declined to order drug monitoring despite the request of Nicini\u2019s attorney because there was no indication that drugs were involved in the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">The record is once again sparse regarding the time period after the February 28, 1991 Family Court hearing. On March 11, 1991, less than two weeks after the hearing, Cyrus forwarded to the Morras an application to become para-foster parents. The para-foster application process, as summarized in Cyrus\u2019s letter to the Mor-ras, requires completion of an application form, a financial statement, an authorization for release of information, a police reference form, and an agreement between the state of New Jersey, DYFS, and the foster parent. The applicant must also schedule a visit to DYFS for fingerprinting, and DYFS conducts a Home Study Evaluation. The applicant\u2019s fingerprints are used to conduct a National Crime Institute Check (NCIC). The Morras never returned the application, and, as we know from hindsight, there was no opportunity for Cyrus to follow up.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">On March 15, 1991, four days after Cyrus sent the application to the Morras, Nicini fled the Morra home. He later told investigators that since the second or third day of his arrival there, Edward Morra had been providing him with drugs and alcohol and assaulting him sexually. Further investigation revealed that Edward Morra had been convicted in New York in 1975 for corrupting the morals of a minor and for distribution of controlled substances to minors.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In March 1994, following the events described here, Edward Morra was convicted in New Jersey of sexual assault and is currently serving a forty-year state prison term with a period of parole ineligibility of twenty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">On May 19, 1995, Nicini filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against Edward Mor-ra, the New Jersey Department of Human Services (\u201cDHS\u201d), DYFS, and Cyrus. Ni-cini alleged a substantive due process violation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 and various state tort law violations. In particular, Nicini alleged that Cyrus \u201chad actual and/or constructive knowledge\u201d of objections by Nicini\u2019s parents that \u201cawarding custody to defendant, Edward Morra, was inappropriate in that ... [he] permitted illicit narcotic and alcoholic use by minors at his residence.\u201d App. at 136, 137. Nici-ni also alleged that Cyrus \u201cfailed to fully and properly investigate the background of Morra before [placing him] ... in Morra\u2019s care\u201d and that Cyrus \u201chad access to or could have requested an authorization from Morra to conduct a criminal record background check.\u201d App. at 137. Nicini further alleged that DHS and DYFS had a policy and practice that \u201cno criminal background check would be conducted of volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>tary guardians of children in the custody of defendants if the guardian was a resident of the State of New Jersey.\u201d App. at 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">By order dated May 29, 1996, the District Court dismissed all claims against DHS, DYFS, and Cyrus in his official capacity based oh Eleventh Amendment immunity. Although Nicini\u2019s complaint did not explicitly seek damages against Cyrus in his individual capacity, the court construed it as stating such a claim. The court held that Cyrus was not entitled to Eleventh Amendment immunity and denied his requests for absolute and qualified immunity on the section 1983 claim. The court also held that Cyrus\u2019s request for immunity under New Jersey law as to Nicini\u2019s state'law claims was premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">After discovery, Cyrus moved for summary judgment. In support, he submitted an affidavit in which he stated that he conducted a PERP check with the DYFS Central registry as required by DYFS policy when a child is in a home which is not a DYFS placement, that the PERP check revealed no criminal information regarding the Morras, and that a more complete criminal background check was unavailable to him at that time. Nicini filed no counter affidavit with respect to those aver-ments.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">In an order dated October 29, 1997, the District Court granted summary judgment for Cyrus, holding that Nicini had failed to establish a constitutional violation and that his state law claims were barred by qualified immunity under the New Jersey Tort Claims Act, N.J.S.A. 59:1-1 <em>et seq. </em>The court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that \u201cDYFS policies only require a PERP check of families not associated with the state foster care program, and Cyrus conducted such a check.\u201d <em>Nicini v. Morra, </em>Civ. No. 95-2303, slip op. at 13 (D.N.J. Oct. 29, 1997) [hereafter \u201cSlip op\u201d]. The court held that the facts adduced by Nicini, even when viewed most favorably to him, failed to demonstrate that Cyrus \u201cknew or suspected the threat of sexual abuse which awaited plaintiff in the Morra home.\u201d Slip op. at 15. The court held that, at most, Cyrus was negligent and that negligence was insufficient to establish section 1983 liability or to defeat the New Jersey statutory immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Nicini\u2019s claims against Edward Morra proceeded and, on February 11, 1998, the court granted Nicini\u2019s motion for a default judgment against Morra. The case was then referred to a Magistrate Judge to conduct a hearing to determine the amount of Nicini\u2019s damages. In an order dated March 6, 1998, the Magistrate Judge entered judgment by default against Morra and awarded Nicini $500,000 in compensatory and $500,000 in punitive damages. The Magistrate Judge, pursuant to the District Court\u2019s orders of May 29, 1996 and October 29, 1997, also entered judgment in favor of the other defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-9\">Nicini appealed from the order of March 6, 1998. ' Although his notice of appeal stated his intent to challenge the court\u2019s May 29, 1996 order dismissing the claims against DHS, DYFS, and Cyrus in his official capacity, as well as the court\u2019s October 29, 1997 order granting summary judgment in favor of Cyrus in his individual capacity, Nicini has limited his challenge before us to the latter order. We have jurisdiction to review the final order of the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">We review an order granting summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard used by the District Court. <em>See Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Int'l Assoc. Local 19 v. Herre Bros., Inc., </em>201 F.3d 231, 239 (3d Cir.1999). We may affirm the District Court on any grounds supported by the record. <em>See Hedges v. Musco, </em>204 F.3d 109, 116 (3d Cir.2000). Summary judgment is proper where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>admissions, and affidavits show there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). In conducting our review, we view the record in the light most favorable to Nici-ni and draw all reasonable inferences in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-5\">NICINI\u2019S SECTION 1983 CLAIM</p>\n<p id=\"b844-6\">To establish a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, a plaintiff must demonstrate a violation of a right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States that was committed by a person acting under the color of state law. <em>See Kneipp v. Tedder, </em>95 F.3d 1199, 1204 (3d Cir.1996). The first step in evaluating a section 1983 claim is to \u201cidentify the exact contours of the underlying right said to have been violated\u201d and to determine \u201cwhether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all.\u201d <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 841 n. 5, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-7\">Nicini\u2019s section 1983 claim rests on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. He invokes the substantive component of due process, which \u201cprotects individual liberty against \u2018certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u2019\u201d <em>Collins v. City of Marker Heights, Tex., </em>503 U.S. 115, 125, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992) (quoting <em>Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 331, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986)). Specifically, Nicini alleges that Cyrus, acting under color of state law, deprived him of \u201cthe right to be free from the infliction of unnecessary pain or abuse ... and the fundamental right to physical safety.\u201d App. at 52 (Nicini\u2019s brief in opposition to summary judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-8\">In denying Cyrus\u2019s request for qualified immunity on that claim, the District Court interpreted Nicini to assert a right \u201cto be free from deprivation of liberty by reason of a foster care placement preceded by an investigation so lacking in thoroughness and precision that it can be said to shock the conscience,\u201d and held that such a right was clearly established at the time of Cyrus\u2019s alleged violation. App. at 95. Indeed, Cyrus does not dispute that the rights Nicini asserts are protectable under section 1983. <em>Cf. DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 195, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989) (right to \u201c \u2018free[dom] from ... unjustified intrusions on personal security\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Ingraham v. Wright, </em>430 U.S. 651, 673, 97 S.Ct. 1401, 51 L.Ed.2d 711 (1977)). Nor does Cyrus dispute that he was acting under color of state law. He contends, however, that Nicini has not established a constitutional violation because \u201c[tjhere is no way that Mr. Cyrus should or could have known about the tragic events that would occur at the Morra home.\u201d Appellee\u2019s Br. at 13. Nicini replies that Cyrus violated his constitutional rights by \u201cfailing] to conduct a full and complete investigation of Morra....\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 16. Nicini\u2019s argument relies on the principle that \u201ca state\u2019s role in \u2018placing children in foster homes\u2019 gives rise to a constitutional right of protection to the child-\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 13. Although Cyrus does not contest that proposition, we must first determine whether this principle is valid, an open question in this circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">As a general proposition, a state\u2019s failure to protect an individual against private violence does not constitute a violation of due process. <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 202, 109 S.Ct. 998. Thus, in <em>De-Shaney </em>the Court held that a child who was beaten so severely by his father that he suffered permanent brain damage did not have a claim against the state agency for violation of his substantive due process rights by failing to remove him from his father\u2019s custody although agency personnel had reason to know of the abuse. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>However, the Court recognized that \u201cin certain limited circumstances the Constitution imposes upon the State affirmative duties of care and protection with respect to particular individuals.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 109 S.Ct. 998. As examples of situations in which the state has such a duty, the Court cited its decision in <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976), which held that the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment required the state \u201cto provide adequate medical care to incarcerated prisoners,\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 198, 109 S.Ct. 998, and <em>Youngberg v. Romeo, </em>457 U.S. 807, 102 S.Ct. 2452, 73 L.Ed.2d 28 (1982), which held that substantive due process \u201crequires the State to provide involuntarily committed mental patients with such services as are necessary to ensure their \u2018reasonable safety\u2019 from themselves and others,\u201d <em>DeShaney, </em>489 U.S. at 199, 109 S.Ct. 998 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">The state\u2019s affirmative \u201cdut[y] of care and protection,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 198, 109 S.Ct. 998, in those cases stemmed \u201cnot from the State\u2019s knowledge of the individual\u2019s predicament or from its expressions of intent to help him, but from the limitation which it has imposed on his freedom to act on his own behalf.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 109 S.Ct. 998. In holding that the state did not have such a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with Joshua DeSha-ney, the Court explained that \u201c[w]hile the State may have been aware of the dangers that Joshua faced in the free world, it played no part in their creation, nor did it do anything to render him any more vulnerable to them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201, 109 S.Ct. 998.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Of particular significance to the matter before us, the Court also suggested that \u201c[h]ad the State by the affirmative exercise of its power removed Joshua from free society and placed him in a foster home operated by its agents, we might have a situation sufficiently analogous to incarceration or institutionalization to give rise to an affirmative duty to protect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 201 n. 9, 109 S.Ct. 998. The Court noted that several courts of appeals had already found such a duty in the foster care context but declined to comment on the merit of those decisions. <em>See id. </em>(citing <em>Doe v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>649 F.2d 134 (2d Cir.1981); <em>Taylor v. Ledbetter, </em>818 F.2d 791 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc)).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">After <em>DeShaney, </em>many of our sister courts of appeals held that foster children have a substantive due process right to be free from harm at the hands of state-regulated foster parents. <em>See, e.g., Lintz v. Skipski, </em>25 F.3d 304, 305 (6th Cir.1994); <em>Norfleet v. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>989 F.2d 289, 293 (8th Cir.1993); <em>Yvonne L. v. New Mexico Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>959 F.2d 883, 891-93 (10th Cir.1992); <em>K.H. v. Morgan, </em>914 F.2d 846, 848-49 (7th Cir.1990). These courts have accepted the analogy between persons the state places in foster care and those it incarcerates or institutionalizes. <em>See, e.g., K.H., </em>914 F.2d at 849 (\u201cOnce the state assumes custody of a person, it owes him a rudimentary duty of safekeeping ...\u201d); <em>Yvonne L., </em>959 F.2d at 891-93 (discussing and approving cases imposing liability in foster care context).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">We have suggested, although never directly held, that state actors owe a duty to children placed in foster care. In <em>D.R., </em>972 F.2d at 1368-73, we held that a public high school student who was allegedly sexually molested by other students during <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>school hours could not maintain a claim against school officials based on a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d theory. We held that public high school students were not comparable to prisoners or the involuntarily committed because \u201cparents remain the [students\u2019] primary caretakers,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1371, and because students \u201cmay turn to persons unrelated to the state for help on a daily basis,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1372. We also noted that this court has principally read <em>DeShaney </em>as \u201csetting out a test of physical custody.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1370. For this proposition, we cited our decisions in <em>Philadelphia Police &amp; Fire Association for Handicapped Children, Inc. v. City of Philadelphia, </em>874 F.2d 156, 168 (3d Cir.1989) (refusing, to apply the special relationship exception to impose upon the state an affirmative duty \u201cto protect the mentally retarded living at home\u201d), and <em>Fialkowski v. Greenwich Home for Children, Inc., </em>921 F.2d 459 (3d Cir.1990) (entity that performed mental health intake services for the county and which referred plaintiffs\u2019 mentally retarded adult son owed him no affirmative duty of care because his parents voluntarily placed Mm in the institution and were free to remove him).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">In <em>D.R., </em>we recognized that \u201csome courts have imposed a constitutional duty to protect foster children by analogy to involuntarily institutionalized individuals,\u201d 972 F.2d at 1372, and stated, albeit in dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b846-5\">\u25a0A relationship between the state and foster children arises out of the state\u2019s affirmative act in finding the children and placing them with state-approved families. By so doing, the state assumes an important continuing, if not immediate, responsibility for the child\u2019s well-being. In addition, the child\u2019s placement renders him or her dependent upon the state, through the foster family, to meet the child\u2019s basic needs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b846-6\"><em>Id. </em>(citations omitted); <em>see also Horton v. Flenory, </em>889 F.2d 454, 457 (3d Cir.1989) (holding that <em>DeShaney </em>is limited \u201cto situations in which the state is not involved in the harm, either as a custodian or as an actor\u201d and that plaintiff was functionally in state custody where he was forcibly detained and beaten by bar owner, with police approval).</p>\n<p id=\"APH\">We find our discussion in <em>D.R. </em>and the numerous decisions of the other courts of appeals on this issue persuasive. Foster children, like the incarcerated or the involuntarily committed, are \u201cplaced ... in a custodial environment ... [and are] unable to seek alternative living arrangements.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Ledbetter, </em>818 F.2d 791, 795 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc). We now hold that when the state places a child in state-regulated foster care, the state has entered into a special relationship with that child which imposes upon it certain affirmative duties. The failure to perform such duties can give rise, under sufficiently culpable circumstances, to liability under section 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">We recognize that the analogy between foster children on the one hand and prisoners and institutionalized persons on the other is incomplete. For example, foster children, especially older ones, enjoy a greater degree of freedom and are more likely to be able to take steps to ensure their own' safety. Nonetheless, any distinctions between children placed in foster care and the prisoners at issue in <em>Estelle </em>or the institutionalized mentally retarded persons at issue in <em>Youngberg </em>are matters of degree rather than of kind. <em>See Norfleet, </em>989 F.2d at 292 (although there is a closer relationship between the state and prisoners than between the state and foster children, \u201cthe situations are sufficiently analogous\u201d). In each of these cases the state, by affirmative act, renders the individual substantially \u201cdependent upon the state ... to meet [his or her] basic needs.\u201d <em>D.R, </em>972 F.2d at 1372.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">We are aware that Nicini came to stay with the Morras on his own initiative and that the Morras were not officially approved by the state as either foster or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>para-foster parents.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, Cyrus does not contest that Nicini was in DYFS custody throughout the relevant period. Furthermore, the record is replete with evidence that Nicini was substantially dependent upon DYFS and that DYFS acquiesced in Nicini\u2019s stay at the Morra home. At least by October 10, 1990, when Nicini\u2019s father signed a foster care placement agreement, DYFS was able to arrange for his foster placement. At some point, the Superior Court of New Jersey awarded custody of Nicini to DYFS and DHS.App. at 136. Nicini was thereafter placed on several occasions with DYFS-approved foster parents and with relatives. It also appears that after the police located Nicini at the Morra home and took him to JFK, . DYFS returned him to their home over the objections of his aunt and his father.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Under these facts, we believe Nicini\u2019s situation is sufficiently analogous to a foster care placement to fall within the \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exception to <em>De-Shaney.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b847-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Having established that Nicini has alleged a protected interest and a sufficient relationship with the state to state a cause of action under section 1983, we turn to the District Court\u2019s determination that summary judgment was appropriate because Cyrus\u2019s actions did not amount to a violation of Nicini\u2019s constitutional rights. We must first determine what level of conduct is egregious enough to amount to a constitutional violation and, then, whether there is sufficient evidence that Cyrus\u2019s conduct rose to that level.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">We begin with the decision in <em>County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998), where the Supreme Court granted certiorari \u201cto resolve a conflict among the Circuits over the standard of culpability on the part of a law enforcement officer for violating substantive due process in a pursuit case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 839, 118 S.Ct. 1708. In <em>Lewis, </em>the Court emphasized that \u201c \u2018[t]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government.\u2019\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 845, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (quoting <em>Wolff v. McDonnell, </em>418 U.S. 539, 558, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974)). It then noted that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>where the challenge is to executive rather than legislative action, \u201conly the most egregious official conduct can be said to be \u2018arbitrary in the constitutional sense.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 846, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (quoting <em>Collins v. Harker Heights, </em>503 U.S. 115, 129, 112 S.Ct. 1061, 117 L.Ed.2d 261 (1992)). Mere negligence is never sufficient for substantive due process liability. <em>See Daniels v. Williams, </em>474 U.S. 327, 106 S.Ct. 662, 88 L.Ed.2d 662 (1986). Under <em>Lewis, </em>substantive due process liability attaches only to executive action that is \u201cso ill-conceived or malicious that it \u2018shocks the conscience.\u2019\u201d <em>Miller v. City of Philadelphia, </em>174 F.3d 368, 375 (3d Cir.1999) (quoting <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 846, 118 S.Ct. 1708).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">The \u201cexact degree of wrongfulness necessary to reach the \u2018conscience-shocking level depends upon the circumstances of a particular case.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. At issue in <em>Lewis </em>was the conduct of police officers engaged in a pursuit, which the Court contrasted with the conduct of prison officials who face liability under the Eighth Amendment if they are \u201cdeliberately indifferent to the medical needs of their prisoners.\u201d Lew<em>is, </em>523 U.S. at 850, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (citing <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 104, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). The Court noted that \u201c[a]s the very term \u2018deliberate indifference\u2019 implies, the standard is sensibly employed only when actual deliberation is practical,\u201d and \u201cin the custodial situation of a prison, forethought about an inmate\u2019s welfare is not only feasible but obligatory.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851, 118 S.Ct. 1708. The Court also noted that \u201c \u2018the State\u2019s responsibility to attend to the medical needs of prisoners ... does not ordinarily clash with other equally important governmental responsibilities.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 851-52, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (quoting <em>Whitley v. Albers, </em>475 U.S. 312, 320, 106 S.Ct. 1078, 89 L.Ed.2d 251 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">In the police pursuit context, the issue presented in <em>Lewis, </em>officers do not have \u201cthe luxury enjoyed by prison officials of having time to make unhurried judgments, upon the chance for repeated reflection, largely uncomplicated by the pulls of competing obligations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 853, 118 S.Ct. 1708. It followed that \u201chigh speed chases with no intent to harm suspects physically or to worsen their legal plight do not give rise to liability under the Fourteenth Amendment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 854, 118 S.Ct. 1708. The Court recognized, however, that in some contexts conduct falling within a middle range of culpability \u2014 that is, involving more than negligence but less than intentional conduct \u2014 can be shocking in the constitutional sense. As the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b848-7\">Rules of due process are not ... subject . to mechanical application in unfamiliar territory. Deliberate indifference that shocks in one environment may not be so patently egregious in another....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b848-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 850,118 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-13\"><em>Lewis </em>therefore makes clear that a plaintiff seeking to establish a constitutional violation must demonstrate that the official\u2019s conduct \u201cshocks the conscience\u201d in the particular setting in which that conduct occurred. In some circumstances, conduct that is deliberately indifferent will shock the conscience.. Indeed, in the foster care context, most of the courts of appeals have applied the deliberate indifference standard, although they have defined that standard in slightly different ways. <em>See, e.g., White v. Chambliss, </em>112 F.3d 731, 737 (4th Cir.1997) (liability if defendant was \u201cplainly placed on notice of a danger and chose to ignore the danger\u201d); <em>Taylor, </em>818 F.2d at 796 (foster child must show \u201cactual knowledge of abuse or that agency personnel deliberately failed to learn what was occurring in the foster home\u201d); <em>Doe v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>649 F.2d 134, 145 (2d Cir.1981) (deliberate indifference \u201ccannot exist absent some knowledge triggering an affirmative duty to act.... Defendants may be held liable [for]' ... deliberate indifference to a known injury, a known risk, or a specific duty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-14\">In <em>Miller, </em>we evaluated the actions of a social worker who after receiving allega<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>tions of abuse separated a child from her natural parent under a standard that \u201cex-ceedfed] ..... deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Miller, </em>174 F.3d at 375. We held that the worker would be liable only if his conduct reached \u201ca level of gross negligence or arbitrariness that indeed shocks the conscience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375-76 (quotation omitted). We also stressed that although \u201ca social worker acting to separate parent and child does not usually act in the hyper-pressurized environment of a prison riot or a high speed chase ..., he or she rarely will have the luxury of proceeding in a deliberate fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 375. Cyrus, unlike the social worker in <em>Miller, </em>had time \u201cto make unhurried judgments\u201d in investigating whether to permit Nicini to remain with the Morras. <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 853, 118 S.Ct. 1708. In the context of this case, we agree that Cyrus\u2019s actions in investigating the Morra home should be judged under the deliberate indifference standard.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-7\">In <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), the Court clarified the deliberate indifference standard applicable in suits challenging prison conditions under the Eighth Amendment. It adopted a subjective standard of liability consistent with recklessness as that term is defined in criminal law. The Court held that \u201ca prison official cannot be found liable ... unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health and safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a' substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b849-8\">This case does not require us to determine whether an official\u2019s failure to act in light of a risk of which the official should have known, as opposed to failure to act in light of an actually known risk, constitutes deliberately indifferent' conduct in this setting.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We will assume <em>arguendo </em>that Ni-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>cini\u2019s proposed standard of \u201cshould have known\u201d is applicable. Nevertheless, as <em>Lewis </em>makes clear, the relevant inquiry is whether the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cshocks the conscience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">Under the circumstances of this case, we cannot agree that Cyrus\u2019s conduct meets that standard. To the contrary, we conclude that Cyrus\u2019s conduct in investigating the Morras amounted, at most, to negligence. For the same reason, we need not . consider whether failure to perform a specific duty can ever amount to deliberate indifference, <em>see Taylor, </em>818 F.2d at 797; <em>Doe, </em>649 F.2d at 145, as there is no evidence that Cyrus failed to perform any required duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The District Court held that the evidence, viewed most favorably to Nicini, failed to establish that Cyrus\u2019s conduct was \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to Nicini\u2019s rights. The court held that Nicini \u201cfail[ed] to establish that Cyrus knew or suspected the danger that awaited [Nicini] in the Morra home,\u201d slip op. at 12, and that \u201cby following standard DYFS procedures and informing a family court judge of the scope of his investigation, Cyrus\u2019s failure to discover that conviction does not shock the conscience or demonstrate his deliberate indifference to or reckless disregard of [Nicini\u2019s] constitutional rights,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-7\">On appeal, Nicini contends that the District Court too narrowly construed Cyrus\u2019s responsibility by looking to whether Cyrus knew or suspected that Morra had a history of abusing children rather than whether Cyrus knew or suspected that the placement was unsafe. In its opinion granting summary judgment, the District Court stated the exclusive focus of the complaint involved Cyrus\u2019s, failure to discover Mor-ra\u2019s criminal background. Slip op. at 9. Even if we accept Nicini\u2019s broader view of the complaint, it would not change the outcome of the appeal, which still revolves around whether Cyrus was deliberately indifferent in any respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-9\">In his affidavit, Cyrus stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-10\">The DYFS policies and procedures required that I conduct a perpretrator [sic] \u201cPERP\u201d check with the DYFS Central Registry when a child ends up at a home which is not a DYFS placement. I conducted one. The PERP check revealed no criminal information regarding the Morras. DYFS can not access National Crime Institute Check (\u201cNCIC\u201d) ... nor a State criminal background check.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-11\">App. at 145. Nicini does not argue that Cyrus failed to act in accordance with applicable DYFS policy and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-12\">To establish Cyrus\u2019s liability, Nicini offered only the report of Dr. Atkins, the psychologist he proffered as an expert, that Cyrus should have done more than was required of him by DYFS\u2019s practices and procedures. The relevant portion of that report states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-13\">In light of the information available to Frank Cyrus at the time of his investigation of the Morra household, particularly the criminal record of Morra which was a matter of public record and which could have been obtained by an appropriate national police record search with the permission of Morra being required by Cyrus prior to placement, it is the opinion of this clinician that this investigation was conducted with total indifference to all available facts that were clearly material to any social worker who would be called upon to make such a placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-14\">App. at 253. As is evident, Dr. Atkins believed that Cyrus should have undertaken a national police search (which the psychologist recognized required Morra\u2019s consent) even though the Morras were not applicants to become an official DYFS foster family or para-foster family. Dr. Atkins never explained how Cyrus could have performed what the psychologist termed the \u201cappropriate national police record search\u201d without Morra\u2019s cooperation and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number>never responded to Cyrus\u2019s sworn statement that he could not access the National Crime Information Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Unable to point to a state requirement or a DYFS policy or procedure violated by Cyrus, Nicini argues that Cyrus nonetheless should have been on notice that a more detailed investigation of the Morras was required. As to the period from the date DYFS learned where Nicini was, February 9, 1991, and the date of the Family Court hearing that approved Nici-ni\u2019s temporary placement status, February 28, 1991, the record reveals consistent monitoring and oversight by Cyrus and DYFS. On February 9, Nicini was located at the Morra home and, after being taken to JFK, \u201cwas refusing to go anywhere else\u201d than back to the Morra home. Ex. at 69. On that day, a DYFS caseworker visited with the Morras and made detailed notes about the condition of the home and the Morra family\u2019s willingness \u201cto help Tony.\u201d Ex. at 69. Cyrus visited Nicini twice during the following nineteen days and also made contact by telephone during that period. An outreach counselor also visited Nicini once a week and filed a report that supported Cyrus\u2019s testimony at the February 28 hearing that Nicini appeared to be doing well there.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">Nicini did not tell Cyrus of the sexual assaults during the visits Cyrus made with him or during the phone conversations Cyrus made to him while he was at the Morra home, although the assaults began within two or three days of Nicini\u2019s arrival there. Nicini, albeit a minor, was not of such tender years that he was unable to communicate this information. He was fifteen years old and had left an earlier placement to find the Morras on his own. Significantly, although Nicini testified at the February 28, 1991 hearing he did not inform the court of the assaults. Nor, apparently, did he inform his attorney, who likewise mentioned nothing of the assaults at the hearing. Thus, the record reveals little from which Cyrus could have inferred that Nicini faced a \u201csubstantial risk of serious harm.\u201d <em>Farmer, </em>511 U.S. at 837, 114 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-8\">Nicini relies on two factual bases for imposition of liability on Cyrus. He points to Cyrus\u2019s testimony at the February 28 hearing that there was nothing the agency saw \u201cin terms of problems with the law.\u201d App.' at 156.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> There is nothing in the record to support Nicini\u2019s argument that Cyrus made an affirmative representation that he \u201cchecked out\u201d Morra. The record reflects that Cyrus was frank and forthright as to the extent of his inquiry into the appropriateness of the Morra home. He advised the judge that he had done a PERP check and advised what that check disclosed. There is no suggestion that the judge was unaware of the extent of investigation that the PERP check entailed, as it appears this is a routine investigation. Cyrus testified that the Morras were not a foster care family but that Nicini needed a stable environment before DYFS could attempt to resolve the larger family problems. When the court asked whether the Morras would qualify as para-foster parents, Cyrus responded that they would but cautioned that he had only completed the PERP check.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-9\">The other basis for Nicini\u2019s claim against Cyrus is that he was \u201cplaced on notice\u201d about the Morra home by the allegations of Nicini\u2019s mother. However, Cyrus alerted the judge to the fact that Nici-ni\u2019s mother objected to placement with the Morras. When the judge asked Mrs. Nici-ni for her views, she informed him of reports that the Morras\u2019 son took drugs and that \u201csomething just seems strange <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>about these people\u201d in light of their willingness to take an unknown child into their home. App. at 158. Mrs. Nicini voiced concern and suspicion but never made anymore specific allegations, and did not advise Judge Segal of all of her concerns when she had the opportunity to do so.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b852-4\">Nicini argues that Cyrus should have elicited alcohol and substance abuse through a urine analysis. But Nicini completely ignores the fact that the judge heard Mrs. Nicini\u2019s objections and expressly declined to require drug monitoring as requested by Nicini\u2019s attorney because there was \u201cno indication that drugs are involved in this matter.\u201d App. at 168. The judge then approved placement of Ni-cini at the Morra home, specifically holding that Nicini would \u201ccome[ ] under the care and supervision\u201d of DYFS and that he would remain at the Morras as long as DYFS thought it \u201cappropriate.\u201d App. at 167. Nicini points to nothing else in the post-hearing period that should have put Cyrus or DYFS on notice that continued placement with the Morras was inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">In her vigorous dissent, our colleague would have us second-guess Cyrus\u2019s actions from hindsight. That is not our task. Nor is it called for in the circumstances of this case. The dissent relies heavily on the report by Dr. Atkins to assert that despite his compliance with DYFS policies Cyrus should be liable for failing to engage in a \u201cheightened level of inquiry, interview and investigation.\u201d Dissenting Op. at 818. But Dr. Atkins, who never interviewed the persons involved, focuses \u201cparticularly\u201d on Cyrus\u2019s failure to obtain Morra\u2019s consent to a criminal background check without pointing to specific facts from which Cyrus should have inferred that such a check was necessary. The fact that Nicini\u2019s \u201cproblems went well beyond those of the average troubled juvenile\u201d under DYFS care and supervision, Dissenting Op. at 817, furnished Cyrus no clue about the appropriateness <em>vel non </em>of the Morra home as a placement. Given that the only reason Cyrus had to question the appropriateness of the Morra home was the suspicions of Nicini\u2019s mother and father,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Nicini\u2019s insistence on remaining at the Morra home, and Cyrus\u2019s first-hand impression that Ni-cini was \u201cdoing well there,\u201d App. at 155, an impression corroborated by Nicini\u2019s TRIS worker and by Nicini himself at the hearing before Judge Segal, a jury could not permissibly conclude that Cyrus\u2019s investigation was so inadequate as to manifest deliberate indifference to Nicini\u2019s rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">Nor are we persuaded by the cases cited by the dissent in which other courts determined a jury could reasonably find deliberate indifference because the facts in those cases are not analogous to those in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number>case.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It may be dramatic to attempt to analogize Cyrus to a caseworker who \u201callow[s] a child to starve before his eyes,\u201d Dissenting Op. at 822 n. 14, but, so far as the record reveals, there was nothing \u201cbefore [Cyrus\u2019s] eyes\u201d that suggested that Nicini faced a substantial risk of serious harm. To the contrary, Nicini\u2019s TRIS worker confirmed that while at the Morra home Nicini was no longer suicidal, no longer depressed, and appeared to be adjusting well.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-4\">The evidence adduced by Nicini, even when interpreted most favorably to him, not only falls short of the demanding standard for deliberate indifference set forth in <em>Farmer, </em>it also fails to establish that Cyrus was more than negligent, if it even establishes that. The District Court did not err in holding Nicini failed to prove a case for subjecting Cyrus to substantive due process liability. Because the period between the court hearing and Nicini\u2019s flight from the Morra home was a limited one, spanning barely over two weeks, we express no view of a caseworker\u2019s responsibility over a longer stretch of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">\n<em>Nicini\u2019s State Law Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">We likewise conclude that the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment for Cyrus on Nicini\u2019s state tort law claims based, on qualified immunity. The District Court noted that \u201c[t]he exact nature of [Nicini\u2019s] state law claims against Cyrus is not readily apparent on the face of his complaint,\u201d slip op. at 17, but Nicini agrees that the court properly characterized his claims as relying on the \u201csame factual bases ... which supported the 1983 actions,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-9\">Cyrus asserts that he is entitled to immunity under section 59:3-3 of the New. Jersey Tort Claims Act, which provides that \u201c[a] public employee is not liable if he acts in good faith in the execution or enforcement of any law.\u201d N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 59:3-3. Negligence is insufficient to defeat the immunity provided by section 59:3-3. <em>See Canico v. Hurtado, </em>144 N.J. 361, 365, 676 A.2d 1083, 1085 (1996) (\u201cA public employee, although negligent, may still act in good faith.\u201d). Instead, to overcome immunity under this section, \u201ca plaintiff must prove more than ordinary negligence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Summary judgment under section 59:3-3 is appropriate if a public official establishes that his or her \u201cacts were objectively reasonable or-that they performed them with subjective good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b853-10\">Nicini has not argued that Cyrus is ineligible for the immunity provided by this statute, which applies to public officials engaged in the execution or enforcement of the law. Rather, he contends that Cyrus\u2019s conduct amounted to \u201creckless indifference.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 19. We have concluded that Cyrus\u2019s conduct amounted, at most, to negligence. Therefore, the District Court did not err in granting summary judgment in his favor on the state law claims based on qualified immunity. <em>See B.F. v. DYFS, </em>296 N.J.Super. 372, 385-86, 686 A.2d 1249, 1256-57 (N.J.Super.1997) (DYFS employees immune for efforts to terminate parental rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the order of the District Court entering judgment in favor of Frank Cyrus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b839-8\">. <em>See </em>Exhibits to Nicini\u2019s Brief in Opposition to Summary Judgment at 27 [hereafter \"Ex.\u201d].</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b839-9\">.

Ni-cini\u2019s brief on appeal characterizes it as corrupting the morals of a minor and distributing controlled substances to minors. Nicini's complaint in this action, however, alleges Morra was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor, endangering the welfare of a minor, and distributing illicit drugs to a minor. The District Court's opinion describes Morra\u2019s conviction as for endangering the welfare of a child. The precise nature of Morra's conviction is irrelevant to the result we reach.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b845-7\">. Courts have seized upon this language in <em>DeShaney </em>to fashion another exception to the general rule absolving state actors of liability for harm caused by private parties: the state-created danger theory. This theory is \"predicated upon the states\u2019 affirmative acts which work to plaintiffs\u2019 detriments in terms of exposure to danger\u201d rather than upon a special relationship between the state and the victim. <em>D.R. v. Middle Bucks Area Vocational Tech. Sch., </em>972 F.2d 1364, 1374 (3d Cir.1992) (en banc). Nicini has not argued in this case that we should apply the state-created danger theory. Rather, he has proceeded solely under the \"special relationship\u201d theory.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b847-6\">. The parties' briefs are silent as to the precise meaning of \"foster\u201d and \"para-foster\u201d care. At argument, we were informed that foster parents are approved for the general placement of foster children rather than approved for the placement of a particular child. <em>See also </em>N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 122B-1.4 (DYFS regulations defining foster parent as \"any person approved by the Division for the general placement of children in his or her own home\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">\"Para-foster\u201d care is not defined in the statute or regulations governing DYFS. The current regulations, however, refer to \"para care,\u201d defined as \"a service involving the placement of a child in a private family home by anyone other than DYFS, and which DYFS approves for payment after an approval process is completed.\u201d N.J. Admin. Code tit. 10, \u00a7 10:15-1.2. This is similar to a definition of \"para-foster care,\u201d effective March 9, 1987, contained in a DYFS Field Operations manual submitted to us as part of the appendix in this appeal which refers to \"foster care service involving the placement of a child in a private family home by anyone other than DYFS, regardless of whether the child is already under DYFS supervision, and which DYFS approves for payment after an approval process is completed.\u201d App. at 171. Unlike foster parents, para-foster parents are \"approved by DYFS for the income maintenance and services to [a] particular child and not for the placement of other foster children.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nicini does not suggest that DYFS was precluded from approving his stay with the Mor-ras if they were neither foster parents or para-foster parents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b847-11\">.

We applied this test on facts virtually identical to those in <em>Youngberg </em>in <em>Shaw v. Strackhouse, </em>920 F.2d 1135, 1142-46 (3d Cir.1990). <em>See also Winston v.

We recognize that the deliberate indifference standard applicable in <em>Farmer </em>to challenges to prison conditions does not necessarily apply to the substantive due process claims of a foster child. <em>See City of Revere v.

App. at 250 (expert report). Nicini\u2019s mother also testified that she expressed \"other concerns about the drinking and the drug use that I felt went on over there, about the juveniles that hung around over there....

Unfortunately for Anthony Nicini, however, the majority does not appear to have considered whether the real-life controversy before us \u2014 whether Frank Cyrus\u2019s conduct actually fell below this standard\u2014 should be heard or decided by a jury under the legal principles it espouses. This is because Cyrus was, in the majority\u2019s view, merely negligent, and maybe not even that. I dissent because I believe that more than one reasonable inference can be drawn from the facts, including an inference of deliberate indifference that shocks the conscience, making it inappropriate to dispose of Nicini\u2019s case on summary judgment. <em>See United States v. Diebold, Inc., </em>869 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962) (per curiam). Having used Ni-cini\u2019s case as a vehicle to explore and analyze a particularly complicated legal standard, have we given short shrift to, and failed to appreciate the complexities of, applying the legal standard to the facts of the case itself? I suggest that we have.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Nicini\u2019s story as chronicled by the majority leads neatly to its conclusion that Cyrus was, at most, merely negligent. But there is more than one way to view or perceive what Cyrus did, or failed to do, in furtherance of his duty to Nicini, who, although not of \u201ctender years\u201d as the majority notes, was a suicidal and \u201chigh risk\u201d adolescent in need of hospitalization or intensive outpatient care.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Due process is contextual and due process rules should not be applied mechanically. <em>See, e.g., County of Sacramento v. Lewis, </em>523 U.S. 833, 850, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998); <em>Rochin v. California, </em>342 U.S. 165, 172, 72 S.Ct. 205, 96 L.Ed. 183 (1952). Although mere negligence is not sufficient to be a substantive due process violation, \u201cculpability falling within the middle range, falling from something more than negligence but \u2018less than intentional conduct, such as recklessness or gross negligence\u2019 ... is a matter for closer calls.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708 (citation omitted). \u201c[T]he fact that there can be instances where glaring negligence may not constitute deliberate indifference does not mean that a fact finder is barred from equating negligence of a certain dimension with deliberate indifference.\u201d <em>Doe v. New York City Dep\u2019t of Social Servs., </em>649 F.2d 134, 143 (2d Cir.1981). Considering the facts in the light most favorable to Nicini, the non-movant, as we are required to do on summary judgment, it certainly appears possible that Cyrus\u2019s conduct might cry out \u201cindifference\u201d to a reasonable jury. Indeed, whether or not a defendant\u2019s conduct amounts to deliberate indifference has been described as a \u201cclassic issue for the fact finder\u201d and \u201ca factual mainstay of actions under S 1983.\u201d <em>Armstrong v.

An unrebutted expert report in the .record, which receives scant attention in the majority opinion, does much of the work for us. This 13-page, single-spaced report of psychologist Elliott L. Atkins, Ed.D., P.A., provides a detailed account of the facts and opines , unequivocally that Cyrus\u2019s conduct was far more egregious than the majority suggests is conceivable. I believe that this unrebutted expert opinion evidence by itself can, and does, create a genuine issue of disputed fact sufficient to defeat Cyrus\u2019s motion for summary judgment. <em>See Thomas v. Neioton Int\u2019l Enters., </em>42 F.3d 1266, 1270 (9th Cir.1994).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the very least, however, the Atkins expert report takes us on a .guided tour through the record, including DYFS records and Cyrus\u2019s own testimony, exposing what Cyrus knew or should have known about Nicini and the Morras and making it glaringly obvious that some investigation was necessary before placing a suicidal teenager in a home where children were permitted to \u201cdrink and party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">Atkins focuses first on Nicini\u2019s condition and particular needs. Nicini\u2019s problems went well beyond those of the average troubled juvenile. As such, Nicini required a heightened level of attention by those<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> charged with responsibility for his care. The DYFS records depict Nicini as the victim of repeated physical abuse at the hands of his father. They explain how Nicini made several attempts at suicide and self-harm, including slashing his wrists and stomach, drinking peroxide, and ingesting pills. App. 212-214, 243-244. They reflect that Nicini had both long term and recent problems of such severity as to require intensive outpatient care, or, more likely, hospitalization. A DYFS-paid psychiatrist\u2019s report from January 9, 1991 \u2014 shortly before Cyrus acquiesced in Nicini\u2019s placement with the Morras \u2014 noted that Nicini:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-7\">[I]s actively suicidal, in a major depression, very impulsive and bored. Outpatient treatment is not enough.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-8\">App. 245.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cyrus\u2019s own contact sheet entry stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>Worker conferred with supervisor who directed worker to contact Crisis (JFK) for evaluation of Anthony Nicini today. Worker contacted parent (Helen Nicini) and advised her [sic.] recommendations of Dr. Trigiani and parent was asked to pick Anthony up from aunt\u2019s home and take him to JFK Crisis \u2014 parent agreed to do this. Worker contacted JFK crisis and indicated that Dr. T\u2019s evaluation and recommendation would be faxed to them \u2014 this was done. Worker advised parent (Helen) upon request of abuse unit that she would have to stay with child in case he needed to be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUI\">App. 222, 245.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">Atkins also explains how Nicini escaped through the window of the JFK psychiatric unit, deciding by himself that he \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like staying in the hospital.\u201d App. 164, 224-225.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In addition to the medical evidence, Nicini\u2019s relatives expressed concerns about Nicini\u2019s severe health to DYFS and at the family court hearing, noting that Nicini was not likely to voluntarily succumb to the treatment he desperately needed. App. 160, 246-247.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">Cyrus acceded in Nicini staying with the Morras in the face of Cyrus\u2019s awareness of Nicini\u2019s \u201chistory of mistreatment, physical abuse, depression, self-destructive behavior and suicidality, as well as his protracted absence from school ... [and] the longstanding history of rejection, neglect, and abuse.\u201d App. 248. Atkins explains that it should have been \u2014 and was \u2014 clear to Cyrus that a caregiver for Nicini needed to provide a secure, emotionally-stable, and supportive environment, and needed to be able to provide skillful and knowledgeable intervention. To determine whether the Morras could provide such an environment and intervention in light of Nicini\u2019s high-risk \u25a0 situation likely entails a heightened level of inquiry, interview and investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">As Atkins helps to document, however, Cyrus made little or no effort to discover whether the Morra householdfit any of the requisite characteristics. Cyrus failed to address the most basic issues when he interviewed the Morras after Nicini went to their home upon escaping from the hospital. Any information about the Cyrus-Morra interview comes from Cyrus himself because the routine written documentation of such an interview is curiously absent from the DYFS records.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Cyrus could not recall if he asked the Morras whether they had ever been arrested, convicted, or otherwise had contact with law enforcement, nor did he ask the Morras how long they had lived in New Jersey to gain perspective on the helpfulness of the PERP check, apparently because he \u201cjust didn\u2019t think to ask them that.\u201d App. 251. Instead, Cyrus remembered asking the Morras whether there was anything that would prevent them from becoming foster parents, to which he received a negative response. Cyrus did not ask what the Morras did for a living. He did not ask whether they owned or rented their residence. Cyrus could not even recall with certainty that he had talked to the Morras about Nicini\u2019s mental health history. In essence, there hardly was a meaningful investigation, let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>alone a heightened inquiry, of the Morras\u2019 fitness to be Nicini\u2019s caregivers. Does it not matter that Cyrus failed to make inquiries fundamental to placing any child, let alone a physically-abused and suicidal teenager in desperate need of a stable environment? Did this conduct merely fall below an acceptable standard, as the majority concludes, or was Cyrus indifferent over a period of several weeks when he should have detected a problem and when he could and should have acted?</p>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">Cyrus would have us forgive any weaknesses in his inquiry because \u201cno one knew or even remotely suspected that the Morra home was a dangerous environment,\u201d Brief for Appellee at 14, but the undisputed facts belie Cyrus\u2019s assertion, at least for purposes of summary judgment. Putting aside whether Cyrus would have had reason to suspect that the Morra home was 'a dangerous environment had he asked them even one or two more basic questions, both of Nicini\u2019s parents relayed express concerns to DYFS about the Morras, and about placing Nicini with the Morras. According to her deposition testimony, Mrs. Nicini had told Cyrus prior to the family court hearing about an answering machine cassette tape with a message to Nicini\u2019s aunt from Nicini saying that he is \u201cpartying and having a good time over there drinking\u201d at the Morra residence. App. 250. Mrs. Nicini says she also made Cyrus aware in advance of the family court hearing about:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-5\">[M]y other concerns about the\u2019 drinking and the drug use that I felt went on over there, about the juveniles that hung around over there, young kids all hours of the night and how Danny used to come home from that place. ' I expressed a lot of concerns to him about the Morra home and Tony\u2019s placement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALjC\">App. 250. Mrs. Nicini explained some of her concerns at the family court hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-7\">\u25a0And now these people that he\u2019s with now, the Morras, they have harbored my oldest son on several occasions when he had taken off, and at one point even have had their house surrounded and went in and got him. Now maybe he didn\u2019t tell these people that he was runaway or anything. I don\u2019t know them personally, only \u2014 only what I had heard. My oldest daughter knows \u2014 goes to school -with kids that are Mends with Eric Morra, them son, which I believe is 16 or 17, and I\u2019ve been told that he\u2019s into drugs. I. don\u2019t know if it\u2019s true or not, but it\u2019s just what I\u2019ve heard. I don\u2019t know, something just seems strange about these people, why they would \u2014 -if they don\u2019t know Tony, -why they would even take him in. I\u2019m sure that Tony knows them through my oldest son Danny. '</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">App. 158-159. In light of Mrs. Nicini\u2019s concerns, Nicini\u2019s counsel commented that \u201cmaybe something should be looked in [sic.] with this Morra family, in light of what Mrs. Nicini had said I think maybe a closer investigation on whether or not that\u2019s an appropriate placement for Anthony.\u201d App. 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-9\">At the hearing, Cyrus acknowledged the existence \u00f3f Mrs. Nicini\u2019s objections, but was somewhat dismissive, instead emphasizing that the Morras had an interest in Nicini and would not mind having him there, and that Nicini was stable at the Morra home. App. 155-156.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In any event, the information provided by Mrs. Nicini to Cyrus prior to the family court hearing apparently did not make a lasting impression on Cyrus, as he could not articulate her concerns about the Morras at his deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">[I]t seems like it is more like something that she had heard about him or heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>about the family or something like that, but I don\u2019t know any specifics.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">App. 250.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">Mr. Nicini had expressed concerns to DYFS about the Morras as well. According to the deposition testimony of Nicini\u2019s father, as recounted by Atkins, Mr. Nicini told DYFS that the Morra home was a \u201chaven for runaway juveniles.\u201d App. 250. DYFS records indicate that Mr. Nicini said the Morra home was not a good placement, although he would agree to weekend placement.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> According to Mr. Nicini, this was not the first time he had ever relayed concerns about the Morras, an earlier time being in connection with Nicini\u2019s brother Danny:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-6\">Q: If it was around 1988 give or take a year that Danny stayed or visited the Morra home, was it around that time in which you suspected that Mr. Morra was [sic.] pedophile?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">A: I suspected that he was exploiting children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-8\">Q: Did you suspect that there might be drugs in the household at that time? A: I felt that these children were going over there and in some way they had access to drugs and alcohol.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-9\">A: Around that time Danny was already involved wit h DYFS; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-10\">Q: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-11\">A: Was his case worker Frank Cyrus at that time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-12\">A: I believe so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-13\">Q: Did you notify anyone at DYFS regarding your concerns that you have shared with me regarding the Morra household that there might have been some child sex there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-14\">A: During what period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-16\">Q: You indicated that Danny might have been staying at the Morra household and that you had your suspicions that there might be sexual abuse or some type of child abuse at the home; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-17\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-18\">Q: Did you notify or tell anyone at DYFS about tho se suspicions that you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-19\">A: I had mentioned it to a social worker....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-20\">Q: Do you recall what concerns or concern exactly you expressed to that person?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-21\">A: About the placement of children into foster care. My concern with my son as far as what he was doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b858-22\">App. 230-231.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b858-23\">Mr. Nicini\u2019s objections apparently left even less of an impression on Cyrus than Mrs. Nicini\u2019s, as Cyrus initially disavowed in his deposition having any recollection of objections by Mr. Nicini to placing his son with the Morras. After having the aforementioned DYFS record entry read to him, Cyrus recalled that he was likely aware of Mr. Nicini\u2019s objection but did not bother to pursue it further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-24\">Q. Were you ever aware of that particular objection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-25\">A. Yeah, I think I was, now that I read this over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-26\">Q. Okay. Did you ever contact Mr. Ni-cini to discus s with him the basis of his objections?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-27\">A. No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-28\">Q. Was there any reason for that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-29\">A. No. No, I think, you know, like I was saying, w e were feeling, you know, good about the placement because everything was positive, everything was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>pointing toward him doing well there and becoming stabilized and progressing, and so we had no real concerns at that time about that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-4\">App. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">Failing to follow up on specific concerns communicated to him and to DYFS about the Morras as an acceptable placement for Nicini who, only weeks beforehand, was said to be actively suicidal and in need of hospitalization, Cyrus advocated that Nici-ni stay with the Morras, about whom he knew little or nothing, telling Judge Segal that Nicini was stable at the Morra house, that he was \u201cdoing very well there, no problems.\u201d App. 155.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> And, largely on the basis of Cyrus\u2019s position and representations, Judge Segal ordered Nicini to remain with the Morras \u201cfor so long as [DYFS] thinks that\u2019s an appropriate placement.\u201d App. 167. Judge Segal had asked Cyrus if the Morras\u2019 home would qualify as a para-foster home, to which Cyrus responded \u201c[y]es they would.\u201d App. 156. Although Cyrus qualified his answer by saying that the only thing he had done was a PERP check, Cyrus assured Judge Segal that \u201c[tjhere\u2019s no \u2014 nothing we\u2019ve seen in terms of any problem with the law .... right now they are not an official foster family, although I\u2019m sure they would\u2014 they would apply for para-foster custody if the parents are willing to let them.\u201d App. 156-157. Cyrus explained again in his deposition that he had received updates from the Morras themselves. App. 226-227.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">Concluding that the \u201cbackground information available to Frank Cyrus which was completely ignored was substantial,\u201d Atkins opines as follows at the conclusion of his detailed report.on Cyrus\u2019s handling of Nicini\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-9\">The ongoing disregard of pertinent information at various .stages of the investigation demonstrates not a simple negligent breach but a pattern of deliberate indifference to the right of Anthony Ni-cini to be secure in a safe environment and to be offered the same opportunity for protection/supportive services from DYFS as any other child.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">App. 253.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Although this expert report illustrates how the facts could produce an inference of deliberate indifference, the majority swiftly dismisses the relevance of Atkins\u2019 report in its entirety, apparently based on the fact that Atkins did not explain how Cyrus could have performed a national police search without the permission of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>Morras.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Interestingly, Cyrus would have obtained the requisite permission, or been confronted with the refusal of permission, had Cyrus conducted a proper interview at the outset and asked basic questions that reasonably should have been explored before entrusting Nicini to the Morras, such as those posed to a para-foster applicant. Yet, Cyrus neither asked the pertinent questions, nor sought permission to do the search, until it was too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">The majority properly concludes, in my view, that Cyrus and DYFS had a special relationship with Nicini and thus were charged with affirmative duties. Nicini was in the care and custody of the state. However, in light of its recognition of this duty, and in light of what the facts and expert witness testimony suggest that Cyrus knew or should have known about Nicini and the Morras, can one so facilely conclude as well that no reasonable jury could infer \u201cdeliberate unconcern for plaintiffs welfare from a pattern of omissions revealing deliberate inattention to specific duties imposed for the purpose of safeguarding plaintiffs from abuse\u201d? <em>See Doe, </em>649 F.2d at 144; <em>Taylor v. Ledbetter, </em>818 F.2d 791, 797 (11th Cir.1987) (en banc) (adopting <em>Doe </em>articulation of deliberate indifference and finding that a foster child may bring a section 1983 action alleging that government officials were deliberately indifferent regarding her foster home placement).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As the Supreme Court noted in <em>Lewis, </em>\u201c[w]hen such extended opportunities to do better are teamed with protracted failure even to care, indifference is truly shocking.\u201d <em>Lewis, </em>523 U.S. at 853, 118 S.Ct. 1708. By rejecting the valid competing inference clearly raised by the facts and concluding at this juncture that Cyrus\u2019s conduct was at most merely negligent as a matter of law, I believe the majority has short-circuited the process of addressing Anthony Nicini\u2019s substantive due process rights.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b854-6\">. Other courts similarly have characterized this question as one for the fact finder when the issue is less than clear-cut. <em>See, e.g., Weyant v. Okst, </em>101 F.3d 845, 857 (2d Cir.1996) (reversing grant of summary judgment because a reasonable jury could infer from the record, taken in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, that the defendants were deliberately indifferent); <em>Wood v. Ostrander, </em>879 F.2d 583, 588 n. 4 (9th Cir.1989) (reversing grant of summary judgment because defendant's conduct could be construed to be deliberately indifferent; \u201ca jury presented with these facts might find Ostrander\u2019s conduct to have been 'deliberately indifferent,\u2019 'reckless,' 'grossly negligent,\u2019 or merely 'negligent.' \u201d) (citing <em>Fargo v. City of San Juan Bautista, </em>857 F.2d 638, 641 (9th Cir.1988) (\"When reasonable persons may disagree as to whether particular conduct constitutes negligence, gross negligence, or recklessness, the question is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>one of fact to be decided by the jury.\u201d)).. The Supreme Court recently likened section 1983 actions to tort claims for purposes of Seventh Amendment application, and explained that as a general historical matter, juries decided questions of liability, which \"preserved the jury's role in resolving what was often the heart of the dispute between plaintiff and defendant.\u201d <em>City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., </em>526 U.S. 687, 718-719, 119 S.Ct. 1624, 143 L.Ed.2d 882 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b855-5\">. <em>See generally Chavez v. Cady, </em>207 F.3d 901, 905 (7th Cir.2000) (concluding that a material fact existed as to whether the treatment provided by the defendant was a substantial departure from accepted professional judgment based on the substance of the <em>defendant's </em>expert's testimony); <em>Russo v. City of Cincinnati, </em>953 F.2d 1036, 1047 (6th Cir.1992) (reversing grant of summaiy judgment in section 1983 action alleging failure to train police officers, and noting that \"expert testimony may prove the sole avenue available to plaintiffs to call into question the adequacy of a municipality's training procedures. To disregard expert testimony in such cases would, we believe, carry with it the danger of effectively insulating a municipality from liability for injuries resulting directly from its indifference to the rights of citizens. Reliance on expert testimony is particularly appropriate where, as here, the conclusions rest directly upon the expert's review of materials provided by the City itself.\u201d). <em>Compare Fagan v. City of Vineland, </em>22 F.3d 1296, 1307 (3d Cir.1994) (en banc) (affirming grant of summaiy judgment in police pursuit case, and noting that the only evidence introduced by the plaintiffs to show arbitrary, intentional, and deliberate action by the defendants was expert witness testimony, but their expert witness \"expressly disclaimed any such characterization\u201d of the defendants' conduct).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b855-10\">. During Nicini's family court hearing, Judge \u2022Segal reported on a telephonic report from a TRIS worker who opined that Nicini was no longer depressed or suicidal at that particular time and had \"made a fine adjustment to the location where he\u2019s presently located,\u201d but also mentioned that the \"the option of placement in a longer term facility like the residential placement ... like Ranch Hope is a very good option\u201d and noted that Nicini. needed continuing psychotherapy and perhaps antidepressants \u201cif things do not clear up for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number>him.\u201d App. 166-167. Judge Segal also noted that \u201call the doctor has is an assessment of Tony and he doesn't have a full basis on which to make an evaluation. But he had sufficient information from his assessment to indicate that it will be a long time before this boy goes back home.\u201d App. 167.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b856-7\">.A psychologist at JFK held a bed for Nicini after he ran away, and the police picked up Nicini at the Morra residence, yet Cyrus gave Nicini permission not to go back to the hospital but, rather, to stay at the Morras\u2019 home. App. 225, 246.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b856-10\">. .One of Nicini's aunts also stated at the hearing that she believed Nicini had attacked her daughter: \"This isn't just something that\u2019s happened all of a sudden, it's been going on for at least a year and a half ... and he doesn't mean this, he doesn\u2019t.\u201d App. 161.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b856-11\">. When asked about this absence, Cyrus said that he remembered \"writing something, but I don't know if its in here or not.\u201d App. 252.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b857-6\">. Indeed, it appears that Cyrus may have characterized the Morras as a friend of the Nicini family, although it is not entirely clear due to a possible error in transcription. <em>See </em>App. 154, lines 13-14. <em>See also </em>App. 155 (Cyrus explaining that Nicini \"found his way to the Morras, who I guess was a friend of his.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b858-15\">. The DYFS record entry also reflected that Mr. Nicini was \"not pleased, Anthony not in hospital. He\u2019s going to call JFK Crisis to find out who psychiatrist is that released child.\u201d App. 227.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b858-30\">. Mr. Nicini made clear in this deposition that he and his wife had never authorized Nicini's brother Danny to stay with the Mor-ras. App. 231.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">. A jury might wonder on what basis Cyrus could report to Judge Segal that everything was positive. Cyrus's explanation seems to be premised on an assumption, embraced by the majority to some extent, that no further action was necessary to discharge his duties to Nicini as long as certain parties professed to be content. Nicini claimed he liked staying at the Morras, and, as Cyrus noted in his deposition, \"Nicini refused to go elsewhere.\u201d App. 145. The Morras were willing to have him remain there and reported that there were \"no problems.\u201d Of course, when the Morras gave that report to Cyrus, Mr. Morra already had been giving Nicini drugs and sexually abusing him, telling Nicini he would have no place to go if he disclosed these activities. App. 232, 238. Could not a jury find Cyrus's attitude to be an indictment rather than a satisfactory explanation for Cyrus's inaction? After all, on Cyrus's theory, a case worker would never unearth a problem until it is too late. Should not the concern have been the stability of the environment for this suicidal youngster who had just climbed out the window of the psychiatric ward, rather than whether he professed to be content there?- In light of Cyrus's weak and ineffectual \u2014 and perhaps even indifferent \u2014 responses provided with respect to the numerous signposts of potential danger with the Morra placement, it would not be difficult to imagine a jury concluding that Cyrus\u2019s inaction rose to the level of deliberate indifference if, during a trial, Cyrus were to provide similar responses and to demonstrate a similar attitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b859-13\">. Atkins also opined that Cyrus's \"multiple breaches constituted a pattern of indifference to his statutory and/or professional duty such that I conclude with a reasonable degree of psychological probability that this pattern of conduct arose not from mere negligence but from deliberate indifference to his obligation to conduct a proper investigation and directly caused the injuries claimed by Anthony Nici-ni.\u201d App. 242</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b860-11\">. The majority further characterizes the report as \"focus[ingj \u2018particularly\u2019 \u201d on this issue \"without pointing to specific facts from which Cyrus should have inferred that such a check was necessary.\u201d I can only wonder whether the majority is reading the same detailed, comprehensive report that I have described.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">. Although Nicini does not specifically challenge whether Cyrus complied with certain DYFS requirements <em>ie.g., </em>conducting a PERP check), and thus <em>Doe </em>is distinguishable in that respect, the substantive due process violation would be based on the state\u2019s alleged failure to provide for basic human needs of those in its custody, <em>see DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dept. of Social Servs., </em>489 U.S. 189, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989), regardless of whether the state has specifically regulated regarding all of those needs. Surely we do not allow states to defeat substantive due process allegations by setting minimal standards for child welfare case workers. Would it not violate substantive due process for a state welfare case worker, with the requisite level of culpability, to allow a child to starve before his eyes, notwithstanding the absence of a specific state regulation requiring the feeding of children in the custody of the state? In light of other evidence giving rise to a strong inference of deliberate indifference, the fact that Cyrus took certain minimal steps required by DYFS regulations will not, by itself, defeat that inference or remove Cyrus\u2019s conduct from the realm of consideration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
