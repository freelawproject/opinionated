Robertson, prays for a writ, of mandamus to Mr. Justice Barnard, holding a special term of the supreme court of the District of Columbia, to compel him to take jurisdiction of, and grant a trial to, petitioner in a cause appealed to said court from a justice\u2019s court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b30-13\">It appears from the petition and return that petitioner had instituted a suit in the justice\u2019s court against one Southerland, and procured the levy of a writ of attachment upon 'certain chat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>tels of the defendant, and that said writ had been quashed by the justice of the peace upon defendant\u2019s motion. The action for the debt remaining rmdisposed of, the plaintiff took an appeal to the supreme court of the District from the order quashing the attachment. In that court, Mr. Justice Barnard presiding, a motion to dismiss the apj&gt;eal was sustained on the ground that the order appealed from was not an appealable one.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-4\">Plaintiff took an appeal therefrom to this court, which was also dismissed on November 5, <em>1003, </em>for the reasons given in the opinion then filed. <em>Robertson </em>v. Southerland, 22 App. D. C. 595. Without intimating any opinion in respect of the appellant\u2019s right to appeal from the order of the justice\u2019s court, it was suggested that, owing to the peculiar conditions of the case, the only way in which the question could be brought before us for review would be by a petition for mandamus to compel the court to take jurisdiction in the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-5\">This petition is the result of that suggestion, and presents the question whether an order of a justice of the peace quashing a writ of attachment can be apjjealed from</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-6\"><em>Mr. Leo Simmons </em>for the petitioner.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b31-7\"><em>Mr. Henry E. Davis </em>and <em>Mr. Edward B. Kimball </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b31-8\">Mr. Justice Shepard</author>\n<p id=\"Au\">delivered the opinion of the Court:</p>\n<p id=\"b31-9\">The petitioner\u2019s contention is that it [the order appealed from] is a final order within the meaning of \u00a7 30 of the Code, which reads thus: \u201cWhere the debt or demand or the value of personal property claimed exceeds five dollars * * * either party who may think himself aggrieved by the judgment or other final order of a justice of the peace may appeal to the supreme court of the District.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b31-11\">Notwithstanding the order in question may have some of the elements of finality, we agree with the learned justice, whose action is sought to be controlled, that it is not a final order within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>the contemplation of \u00a7 30. That section must be construed in the light of other statutes, existing at the time and re-enacted in the Code, and of the settled practice of the courts under the operation of the said statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">Orders dissolving attachments, though possessing some of the elements of finality, as has been conceded, have always been regarded as interlocutory, and not final. The practice was settled and unquestioned. When the court of appeals was created it was deemed advisable to vest it with the jurisdiction to entertain appeals from interlocutory orders of the supreme court of the District. From those of a certain character the right of appeal was made absolute; from all others the allowance of the appeal was subject to the discretion of the appellate court. In those of the first class orders dissolving writs of attachment are specially enumerated. See act approved February 9, 1893 (D. C. Code, \u00a7 226).</p>\n<p id=\"b32-6\">No similar provision is found in the Code relating to appeals to the supreme court of the District from justice\u2019s courts. In that chapter, however, a special provision is made for the trial of issues between the plaintiff in the writ and a claimant of the attached property who is not a defendant in the action. These are given the standing of suits between the respective parties, to be tried as such (Code, \u00a7\u00a7 33, 34) ; and appeal from judgments that may be rendered therein is expressly provided for. Code, \u00a7 35. In the chapter of the Code relating to attachments issued out of the supreme court of the District provision is also made for trials of issues between the claimant of attached property and the parties to the action. \u00a7 462. And these may be tried separately (\u00a7 462), or at the same time with all the issues of the action, \u201cas the convenience of the court may require.\u201d \u00a7 475. It is to be remarked that no appeal is specially provided from the orders determining issues between claimants and others, as given from similar orders made by justices of the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-7\">This difference may be accounted for by the fact that such orders had been made appealable as interlocutory orders by \u00a7 226, referred to above.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-8\">Whatever hardship there may be in denying the right of ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>peal from an order of tbe kind under consideration from the justice\u2019s court to the supreme court in special term, we are constrained to hold that it can be remedied only by additional legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b33-4\">The petition must therefore be dismissed with costs, and it is so ordered. <em>Petition dismissed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
