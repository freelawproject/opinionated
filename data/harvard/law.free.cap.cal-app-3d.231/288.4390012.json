We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">Using a fishing knife, the defendant inflicted three lacerations to the neck and chin of the prosecuting witness, Mr. Waiter, ranging from three and one-half to about eight inches in length. Waiter claimed that the defendant had attacked him without warning or provocation. The defendant testified that, to the contrary, he had slashed Waiter to defend himself against Waiter\u2019s sudden attack on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">The defendant was charged with attempted murder (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664 and 187, subd. (a)) and attempted robbery (Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664 and 211). It was further alleged that the defendant committed those offenses while using a dangerous weapon and while inflicting great bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-9\">Following a jury trial, the defendant was found guilty of assault with a deadly weapon as a lesser offense related to the charge of attempted murder, but not guilty of the attempted robbery charge. The jury also found the allegation that the defendant had intentionally inflicted great bodily injury during the commission of that assault to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-10\">Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b261-11\">Whether the trial court erred (1) by giving lesser included offense instructions over the defendant\u2019s objections, or (2) by permitting testimony regarding alleged domestic violence between the defendant and his wife which was unrelated to the offenses charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-12\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b261-13\">A. The Alleged Instructional Error</p>\n<p id=\"b261-14\">The defendant contends that the trial court erred by instructing the jury regarding several lesser included offenses even though the defense had specifically requested that no such instructions be given. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-15\">1. <em>Facts and Contentions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b261-16\">During a break in the middle of the trial, the trial court advised the defense that it believed that it had a sua sponte duty to instruct the jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>regarding lesser included offenses. Two days later, at the conclusion of the trial, the defendant expressly objected to any instructions being given concerning any lesser included offenses. However, the trial court again opined that it was obligated to give those instructions despite the defendant\u2019s objections, and advised that it would be instructing as to both assault and attempted voluntary manslaughter. In response to that ruling, the defense requested that the court also instruct the jury regarding assault with a deadly weapon as a lesser related offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-4\">The defendant appears to make four arguments to support his claim that the instructions should not have been given: (1) that the lesser included offenses were not supported by the evidence; (2) that the lesser included offenses were both inconsistent with and prejudicial to the defendant\u2019s theory of defense; (3) that a defendant has a right to prevent instruction regarding lesser included offenses; and (4) that assault with a deadly weapon is a lesser related offense, not a lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-7\">2. <em>The Duty to Instruct Regarding Lesser Included Offenses</em></p>\n<p id=\"b262-8\">Preliminarily, we review the general rules regarding the trial court\u2019s sua sponte duty to instruct the jury regarding lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-9\">\u201cThe trial court functions ... as the jury\u2019s guide to the law. This role requires that the court fully instruct the jury on the law applicable to each particular case.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 323 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311].) \u201cIt is settled that in criminal cases, even in the absence of a request, the trial court must instruct on the general principles of law relevant to the issues raised by the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 524, 531 [83 Cal.Rptr. 166, 463 P.2d 390].)</p>\n<p id=\"b262-10\">\u201cThat obligation has been held to include giving instructions on lesser included offenses . . . .\u2019\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sedeno </em>(1974) 10 Cal.3d 703,715 [112 Cal.Rptr. 1, 518 P.2d 913], overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].) \u201c[T]he trial court has a sua sponte obligation to give instructions on necessarily included offenses when the evidence raises a question as to whether all of the elements of the charged offense were present and there is evidence that would justify a conviction of such a lesser offense . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bunyard </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1189, 1232 [249 Cal.Rptr. 71, 756 P.2d 795].) As long as such evidence is present, \u201c[t]he obligation to instruct on lesser included offenses exists even when as a matter of trial tactics a defendant not only fails to request the instruction but expressly objects to its being given.\u201d <em>(Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 716.) \u201cThe fulfillment of this obligation ensures that the jury will consider the full range of possible verdicts\u2014not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>limited by the strategy, ignorance, or mistakes of the parties.\u201d <em>(Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">3. <em>There Is Substantial Evidence to Support the Lessers</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">In arguing that the evidence did not justify the instructions regarding any lesser included offenses, such as assault, the defendant apparently reasons as follows: (1) the theme of the defendant\u2019s defense was that the knife wounds were inflicted on the victim in self-defense; (2) by acquitting the defendant of the charge of attempted murder, the jury must have accepted that explanation; (3) the jury could not have accepted that defense as to the attempted murder charge without also accepting it as to all lesser included offenses; therefore, (4) there was no factual basis for a guilty verdict as to any lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">We cannot accept this logic. First of all, the fact that the jury failed to convict the defendant of the attempted murder charge does not necessarily mean that they believed that the defendant had acted in self-defense. The acquittal could have been based on a reasonable doubt concerning the existence of one of the elements of the crime unrelated to self-defense, such as an intent to kill Mr. Waiter.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-8\">Second, the standard governing the court\u2019s obligation to instruct regarding a particular lesser included offense is whether there is some substantial evidence to indicate that the defendant may be not guilty of the greater offense but guilty of the lesser offense. <em>(Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 323-325.) The failure of the jury to convict on the greater offense does not perforce render that evidence insubstantial as to the defendant\u2019s guilt of the lesser included offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-9\">Finally, the defendant confuses the time at which the evaluation of the existence of \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d is to be made: i.e., at the end of the trial when the jury is ready to be instructed. In deciding whether to instruct regarding a lesser included offense, a trial court cannot wait to see whether the jury convicts the defendant on the greater offense. Nor can an appellate court, reviewing the trial court\u2019s decision, consider events which occurred after the decision was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-10\">4. <em>The Lesser Included Offenses Are Not Inconsistent With the Defense</em></p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The defendant next argues that the instructions on the lesser included offenses should not have been given because they were inconsistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>defense\u2019s theory of the case. In doing so, he contends that a trial court may not, over a defendant\u2019s objection, give an instruction on a lesser included offense which is supported by the evidence but which is inconsistent with the theory of the defense, citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Sede\u00f1o, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-4\">This argument fails because the defendant improperly equates the duty to instruct regarding <em>defenses </em>(which was the subject of the passage in <em>Sede\u00f1o </em>upon which he relies) with the duty to instruct regarding lesser included <em>offenses </em>(which the same passage expressly distinguishes): \u201cUnlike the rule obliging the court to instruct on lesser included offenses . . . whenever there is \u2018any evidence deserving of any consideration whatsoever\u2019 [citation], the duty to give instructions, <em>sua sponte, </em>on particular defenses and their relevance to the charged offense arises only if it appears that the defendant is relying on such a defense, or if there is substantial evidence supportive of such a defense and the defense is not inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s theory of the case.\u201d <em>(Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 716.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">Thus, a defendant may exercise some control over the trial court\u2019s instructions regarding inconsistent defenses,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> but has no similar control over supposedly inconsistent lesser included offenses. \u201cWhen the charged offense . . . encompasses lesser offenses, and there is evidence from which the jury could conclude that the lesser offense had been committed, the court must instruct on the alternate theory even if it is inconsistent with the defense elected by the defendant under the rule obliging the court to instruct on lesser included offenses . . . .\u201d <em>(Sedeno, supra, </em>10 Cal.3d at p. 717, fn. 7.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Here, the instructions at issue concerned lesser included offenses, not alternative defenses. Thus, the trial court properly gave those instructions despite their alleged inconsistency with the defendant\u2019s chosen theory of defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">5. A <em>Trial Court Must Instruct Regarding Lesser Included Offenses Despite a Defendant\u2019s Objection</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">The defendant argues that a trial court need not, and indeed may not, instruct regarding lesser included offenses if the defendant objects. He attempts to support this contention with three different arguments, none of which we find persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">First, he cites to the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that under the doctrine of \u201cinvited error,\u201d a trial court\u2019s sua sponte obligation to instruct on the applicable law \u201ccould be negated only in that special situation in which the defense counsel deliberately and expressly, as a matter of trial tactics, objected to the rendition of an instruction.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 303, 318 [78 Cal.Rptr. 217, 455 P.2d 153], explaining its holding in <em>People </em>v. <em>Phillips </em>(1966) 64 Cal.2d 574, 580-581, fn. 4 [51 Cal.Rptr. 225, 414 P.2d 353].) Relying on this indication that the trial court\u2019s duty to give an instruction may be \u201cnegated\u201d by defense counsel\u2019s objection, he argues that upon his counsel\u2019s objection, the trial court\u2019s \u201csua sponte obligation to instruct [on lesser included offenses] was nullified.\u201d He concludes that the trial court\u2019s insistence on giving those instructions despite the lack of a duty to do so constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-9\">We cannot agree. The defendant\u2019s interpretation of <em>Graham </em>is literally accurate but substantively incorrect. Contrary to the implication given by its imprecise reference to the trial court\u2019s duty being \u201cnegated\u201d by the defendant\u2019s objection, the <em>Graham </em>court was not holding that the duty to instruct was contingent upon the defendant\u2019s acquiescence in those instructions. Rather, <em>Graham </em>was defining those situations in which the errors by the trial court could not be relied upon by the defendant to justify a reversal because the commission of those errors had been \u201cinvited\u201d by the defendant himself.  Despite an objection, the sua sponte duty to instruct is still in force,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and the failure to instruct is still error. The only effect of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>defendant\u2019s objection is to render that error \u201cinvited\u201d and therefore nonreversible. Thus, <em>Graham </em>does not support the defendant\u2019s contention that he had a right to prevent the trial court from instructing on lesser included offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Second, he contends that, on a general policy basis, a defendant should have the right to prevent the trial court from instructing on lesSer included offenses. He notes that instructions as to lesser <em>related </em>offenses may only be given with the defendant\u2019s consent. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 526.) He argues that the \u201csame due process and fundamental fairness concerns which give appellant the right to permit or preclude jury consideration of lesser related offenses should give appellant the right to permit or preclude jury consideration of lesser included offenses.\u201d However, this contention fails to take into account the reason for the distinction drawn between included offenses and related offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Trial courts have a sua sponte duty to instruct regarding lesser included offenses because neither the defendant nor the People have a right to incomplete instructions. \u201cThe requirement of instructions on lesser included offenses is based on the elementary principle that the court should instruct the jury on every material question. [Citation.] The state has no interest in a defendant obtaining an acquittal where he is innocent of the primary offense charged but guilty of a necessarily included offense. \u00d1or has the state any legitimate interest in obtaining a conviction of the offense charged where the jury entertains a reasonable doubt of guilt of the charged offense but returns a verdict of guilty of that offense solely because the jury is unwilling to acquit where it is satisfied that the defendant has been guilty of wrongful conduct constituting a necessarily included offense. Likewise, a defendant has no legitimate interest in compelling the jury to adopt an all or nothing approach to the issue of guilt. Our courts are not gambling halls but forums for the discovery of truth.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>St. Martin, supra, </em>1 Cal.3d at p. 533; <em>People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at pp. 519-520.)</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">This rationale applies equally to all lesser offenses, and thus suggests that trial courts should have a comparable duty to instruct regarding lesser <em>related </em>offenses as well. However, conflicting due process considerations require that instructions on related offenses be given only with the defendant\u2019s consent. \u201c ' \u201cDue process of law requires that an accused be advised of the charges against him in order that he may have a reasonable opportunity to prepare and present his defense and not be taken by surprise by evidence offered at his trial. [Citations.]\u201d \u2019 HQ Where, however, the defendant himself requests the instruction on a related offense there is no constitutional bar. Obviously, such a defendant cannot claim lack of notice.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Geiger, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d at p. 526.)</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>Thus, while there are substantial constitutional impediments to allowing instructions regarding lesser related offenses to be given over the defendant\u2019s objections, those impediments do not extend to lesser included offenses. To the contrary, there are strong policy reasons why a defendant should not be able to exclude instructions regarding lesser included offenses. Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s contention that both should be governed by the same rule is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">6. <em>The Assault With a Deadly Weapon Instruction Was Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">As an alternative to his contention that the instructions regarding lesser included offenses should not have been given, the defendant argues that assault with a deadly weapon is only a lesser related (as opposed to included) offense, and thus an instruction on that offense should not have been given over his objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">This alternative fails as well. As the People point out, the defendant cannot complain about the prejudicial effect of an instruction which the defendant himself requested. In reply, the defendant contends that the doctrine of invited error, upon which tire People rely, does not apply to \u201cdefensive acts,\u201d i.e., when the \u201cinvitation\u201d is extended by the defendant only as a result of, and in an attempt to mitigate the harm from, some erroneous ruling by the trial court. That exception applies here, he argues, because the request that the jury be instructed on assault with a deadly weapon was made in response to the trial court\u2019s decision to instruct regarding the lesser included defenses of manslaughter and assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">The rationale behind the defensive acts doctrine is that a defendant should not lose his right to contest an erroneous ruling by the trial court merely because the defendant thereafter acts prudently to mitigate the adverse effects of that ruling. Here, the doctrine does not apply, because the decision by the trial court to instruct as to the lesser included offenses was not erroneous. Since there was no error to \u201cdefend\u201d against, the defendant cannot avoid the consequences of his request that the jury be instructed regarding assault with a deadly weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">B.
