The petitioners argue that if permitted to once again amend their complaint, they\n   would assert facts sufficient to establish their standing to pursue a derivative shareholder action on behalf of Massey against former corporate directors and officers, even though the petitioners are no longer Massey shareholders. With their proposed Second Amended Complaint, the petitioners also seek to add new claims on behalf of themselves and a putative class alleging that the respondents breached fiduciary duties owed directly to Massey shareholders when negotiating and agreeing to a corporate merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The circuit court concluded that under controlling Delaware law, the petitioners lack standing to pursue a derivative shareholder suit. Furthermore, the circuit court found that it would be futile to allow the petitioners to file their proposed Second Amended Complaint. For the reasons set forth below, we find no error in the circuit court's rulings and, accordingly, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On April 5, 2010, a devastating explosion occurred at Performance Coal's Upper Big Branch (\"UBB\") underground coal mine in Montcoal, West Virginia. Tragically, twenty-nine men working at UBB were killed. Performance Coal was a subsidiary of Massey, a Delaware corporation headquartered in Virginia. In the wake of the explosion, allegations arose of systemic mine safety compliance failures.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manville Pers. Injury Settlement Tr. v. Blankenship\n   </em>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   \"),\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    231 W.Va. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 640,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 332 (2013). Several investigations\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and lawsuits ensued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The instant litigation began as a derivative shareholder lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County on April 15, 2010, by Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust, a Massey shareholder. Subsequently, the lawsuit was consolidated with derivative actions instituted by other Massey shareholders, including California State Teachers' Retirement System and Amalgamated Bank as Trustee for the Longview Collection Investment Funds, and an Amended Complaint was filed on June 7, 2010.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (All of the shareholder plaintiffs are collectively referred to herein as \"the petitioners\"). In their derivative shareholder claims, the petitioners seek to hold individual members of Massey's then-Board of Directors, as well as certain Massey corporate officers, personally liable to the company based upon the alleged breach of fiduciary duties. At its core, the Amended Complaint asserts that the directors and officers knowingly allowed Massey's employees to disregard worker safety laws, regulations, and procedures, which resulted in the UBB explosion. The individual defendants named in the Amended Complaint are Donald L. Blankenship, Baxter F. Phillips, Jr., Dan R. Moore, E. Gordon Gee, Richard M. Gabrys, James B. Crawford, Bobby R. Inman, Robert H. Foglesong, Stanley C. Suboleski, J. Christopher Adkins, Jeffrey M. Jarosinski, M. Shane Harvey, and Mark A. Clemens (hereinafter collectively \"the respondents\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition, other Massey shareholders filed similar derivative lawsuits against Massey directors and officers in the Delaware Court of Chancery.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Massey Energy Co. Derivative and Class Action Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322837\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/484/\">\n    160 A.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Del.

(\"Alpha\"), initiated discussions with Massey about a possible corporate merger.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Initially, Massey's Board of Directors (\"Massey Board\") dismissed the idea. However, Alpha approached Massey again in August 2010 with a non-binding proposal offering twenty percent over Massey's then-current stock price of $30.99 per share. The Massey Board rejected this offer as insufficient, but determined that exploration of a merger was warranted. In September 2010, Alpha increased its offer to $41.07 for each share of Massey stock. After an October 2010 article in the Wall Street Journal reported that Massey was reviewing alternatives, Massey received proposals from two additional companies, Arcelor Mittal S.A. and Arch Coal, Inc.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Massey's discussions with Alpha were ongoing during this time. In early January 2011, Arch Coal submitted a non-binding offer of $70 per share; the following day, Alpha submitted an offer of $60.51 per share. Later in January, Alpha raised its bid to $65 per share, while Arch Coal\n   <em>\n    lowered\n   </em>\n   its bid to $55 per share. Following further negotiations, Alpha and the Massey Board reached a Merger Agreement on January 28, 2011, whereby Alpha would pay $69.33 per share of Massey stock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Merger Agreement between Massey and Alpha was announced on January 29, 2011. The Agreement provided that if Massey's stockholders approved, then on June 1, 2011, Massey would merge with and into a company named Mountain Merger Sub, Inc. that was formed by Alpha solely to effectuate this merger. The surviving corporation would be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alpha named Alpha Appalachia Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation. As part of the Merger Agreement, each outstanding share of Massey common stock would be converted into the right to receive 1.025 shares of Alpha common stock plus $10 in cash (which calculates to $69.33 per share). As proposed, total consideration for the merger would be in excess of $7 billion dollars.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Faced with the potential merger, on May 2, 2011, the petitioners filed a motion with the Circuit Court of Kanawha County for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint that, in addition to re-asserting derivative claims on behalf of the company, sought to add individual and class action claims on behalf of the shareholders themselves.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioners' individual and class action claims assert that the respondents violated fiduciary duties owed to the shareholders when negotiating and approving the Merger Agreement at an inadequate price. In their brief, the petitioners report that the parties conducted discovery pertaining to both the safety and the merger issues, but the petitioners desire additional discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On May 16, 2011, the petitioners filed a motion in the circuit court to preliminarily enjoin Massey's merger with Alpha. Unable to obtain a circuit court hearing in the time frame they requested, the petitioners filed an emergency petition with this Court on May 25, 2011, also seeking a preliminary injunction to halt the merger. After recognizing that the motion had not yet been acted upon by the circuit court, that Alpha would be impacted by an injunction but was not named as a party, and that a motion to enjoin the merger was already pending in the Delaware litigation, this Court denied the emergency petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California State Teachers' Ret. Sys. v. Blankenship\n   </em>\n   , No. 11-0839,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202119761\">\n    2011 WL 2119761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (W.Va. May 31, 2011) (memorandum order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In a lengthy order entered on May 31, 2011, the Delaware Court of Chancery refused to enjoin the merger and refused to create a \"litigation trust\" in which to maintain the Delaware plaintiffs' derivative claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Massey Energy Co. Derivative and Class Action Litig.\n   </em>\n   , C.A.

May 31, 2011) (unpublished opinion) (\"\n   <em>\n    Massey Energy I\n   </em>\n   \"). In short, the Court of Chancery concluded that the proposed merger would be beneficial to Massey's shareholders. The court explained, inter alia, that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [o]n the day the Massey Board unanimously approved the Merger, January 27, 2011, the Merger consideration amounted to a 25% premium over Massey's stock price based on the previous day's closing price of Massey and Alpha stock, a 95% premium over the closing price of Massey stock on October 18, 2010 before it was publicly reported that Massey was engaged in a strategic alternatives review, and even a 27% premium over Massey's stock price the day of the explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at * 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is undisputed that the merger proposal was thereafter submitted to a stockholder vote, where ninety-nine percent of the Massey shares that were voted were cast in favor of the transaction. Accordingly, the merger became effective June 1, 2011. The company formerly known as Massey became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alpha and, as the sole shareholder, Alpha replaced Massey's entire Board of Directors with a single director of its choosing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Importantly, upon the merger, the petitioners ceased being Massey stockholders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In addition to the case sub judice, on May 31, 2011, the petitioners brought a separate legal proceeding in the Circuit Court of Kanawha County seeking to hold Massey corporate directors and officers in contempt for failing to comply with an order entered by the circuit court in 2008 in a\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   shareholder derivative lawsuit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    231 W.Va. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 639-40,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 331-32. The circuit court's 2008 order had required Massey to adopt and follow certain mine safety standards and procedures, but the petitioners asserted that the directors and officers failed to comply, resulting in the UBB explosion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The contempt proceeding was dismissed in September 2011 upon the circuit court's conclusion that after the merger, the petitioners were no longer Massey shareholders and, therefore, lacked derivative standing under the applicable Delaware law to pursue relief on behalf of the company.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d at 335\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Subsequently, this Court affirmed the circuit court's dismissal of the\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   contempt action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    at 648\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d at 340\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Meanwhile, on June 24, 2011, the respondents filed a motion in the case at bar asking the circuit court to dismiss the petitioner's Amended Complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Rules of Civil Procedure. They also opposed the petitioners' motion for leave to file the proposed Second Amended Complaint. The respondents argued that after the merger, the petitioners were no longer Massey shareholders and lacked standing to assert derivative claims, and that amending their complaint a second time would be futile. After briefing and a hearing, the circuit court entered an order on November 14, 2013,\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that both dismissed the Amended Complaint and denied the motion for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint. The circuit court's only explanation was that the rulings were \"[b]ased upon, and for the reasons set forth in,\" this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Manville,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    231 W.Va. 637\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioners appealed and, on August 26, 2014, we entered an order remanding the case back to the circuit court for entry of an order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Following remand, the petitioners sought a scheduling order for additional briefing and a hearing, but the circuit court concluded that further proceedings would be beyond the scope of the remand. The circuit court did grant the parties the opportunity to submit\n   proposed orders that included findings of fact and conclusions of law. On November 20, 2014, the circuit court entered an Amended Final Order explaining its reasons for dismissing the Amended Complaint and for denying the motion for leave to file the Second Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the Amended Final Order, the circuit court explained that upon the consummation of the merger with Alpha, the petitioners were no longer shareholders of Massey and, therefore, had lost standing under the applicable Delaware law to pursue a shareholder derivative suit. The circuit court rejected the petitioners' argument that they retained standing under a fraud exception in Delaware law, concluding that the petitioners could not prove that the merger had been effectuated \"solely\" to deprive them of derivative standing. Moreover, the circuit court found it would be futile to allow the petitioners to file their Second Amended Complaint. To the extent that the Second Amended Complaint reasserted the derivative claims, the circuit court reiterated that the petitioners had lost shareholder standing and could not prove the fraud exception. With regard to the direct claims that the petitioners sought to add, the circuit court ruled that to be entitled to money damages under Delaware law, the petitioners would need to prove that the officers and directors acted in bad faith to approve a sale of Massey at a materially inadequate and unfair price. The circuit court found that the proposed Second Amended Complaint did not allege facts to establish that the merger was \"materially inadequate\" or that any inadequacy was the result of \"bad faith\" conduct by the respondents. Furthermore, the circuit court recited with approval the findings of the Delaware Chancery Court about the respondents' \"reasonable efforts to get the highest price it could from Alpha\" and the substantial premium received by shareholders as a result of this merger.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massey Energy I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%202176479\">\n    2011 WL 2176479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4. Finally, the circuit court concluded that it would be prejudicial to the respondents to allow the petitioners to pursue futile claims in another amended complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The petitioners once again appeal to this Court. While this appeal was pending,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Delaware Court of Chancery entered its final order on May 4, 2017, dismissing all of the Delaware plaintiffs' claims-both derivative and direct-in that Massey litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Massey Energy II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322837\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/484/\">\n    160 A.3d 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, we allowed the parties to file supplemental briefs addressing the Delaware court's final ruling.

Standards of Review and Choice of Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   There are two parts to the circuit court's Amended Final Order: the denial of the motion for leave to file a Second Amended Complaint and the dismissal of the pending Amended Complaint. With respect to the denial of leave to amend, we examine the circuit court's ruling for an abuse of discretion:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   \"A trial court is vested with a sound discretion in granting or refusing leave to amend pleadings in civil actions. Leave to amend should be freely given when justice so requires, but the action of a trial court in refusing to grant leave to amend a pleading will not be regarded as reversible error in the absence of a showing of an abuse of the trial court's discretion in ruling upon a motion for leave to amend.\" Syllabus point 6,\n   <em>\n    Perdue v.

Although the UBB mine was located in West Virginia, the Massey company was incorporated in the State of Delaware pursuant to Delaware law.

The petitioners theorize that by installing these four officers into the newly-formed company, the officers could direct the internal investigations into the UBB explosion and could prevent Alpha from pursuing the derivative claims after the merger. Moreover, the petitioners contend that the reason the respondent directors agreed to the merger with Alpha, at that particular time and that particular price, was to obtain a buyer who would not pursue the derivative shareholder claims. The petitioners suggest that another buyer, such as Arch Coal, or even Alpha if Alpha had engaged in a hostile takeover instead of a negotiated merger, would have pursued the derivative claims and sought to hold the respondents personally liable. The petitioners also argue that information obtained during Don Blankenship's federal criminal prosecution could provide more evidence of the fraudulent nature of the merger.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   In its rejection of the applicability of the Delaware fraud exception, the circuit court's Amended Final Order referenced, inter alia, the discussion in\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   about the financial benefits of the merger to Massey shareholders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Manville,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    231 W.Va. at 646\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    749 S.E.2d at 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, the petitioners argue that the reason they lost in\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   was that the\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   pleadings did not allege the merger was pretextual. By contrast, the petitioners' proposed Second Amended Complaint, if allowed, would allege that the merger was effectuated to deprive them of derivative standing. The petitioners argue that they are now doing what this Court concluded they had failed to do in\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The respondents argue that it is impossible for the petitioners to prove there was no valid business purpose for the merger, thus it would be an exercise in futility for this Court to allow the filing of the Second Amended Complaint. According to the respondents, there were unquestionably valid business reasons underlying Massey's merger with Alpha. Most importantly, they contend that the merger resulted in substantial value to Massey shareholders. Alpha paid more than seven billion dollars in merger consideration, representing a twenty-seven percent premium above Massey's stock price immediately before the UBB explosion. The respondents contend that the substantial premium paid in cash and stock is why more than ninety-nine percent of Massey shares that were voted, were cast in favor of the merger. Furthermore, the petitioners concede in their proposed Second Amended Complaint that the Massey Board was instructed by its legal counsel to \"assume the derivative claims would survive\" the merger, and not to take the derivative claims into account when considering the merger. The respondents argue that the petitioners' concession of this point is completely inconsistent with their claim that the merger was merely to preempt the derivative claims. Finally, the respondents argue that the petitioners' fraud claims are nothing but conclusory statements that do not state facts to support fraud with the requisite degree of particularity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   W.Va. R. Civ. P. 9(b) (\"[C]ircumstances constituting\n   fraud ... shall be stated with particularity.\");\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ward,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9237066\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/852/896/#p901\">\n    852 A.2d at 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"the particularized pleading requirement ... must be satisfied by a derivative complaint that seeks to invoke the fraud exception\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   After carefully considering the petitioners' proposed Second Amended Complaint and the parties' arguments on appeal, it is clear to this Court that the petitioners lost derivative standing and cannot prove the fraud exception. Even if one of the respondents' reasons for pursuing the merger was to protect themselves from liability in the derivative shareholder suits, it would be impossible for the petitioners to prove that this was the\n   <em>\n    sole\n   </em>\n   reason for the merger. Even from a reading of the petitioners' proposed Second Amended Complaint, it is obvious that there were legitimate business benefits arising from the merger-most importantly, the shareholders received substantial compensation for their stock. Alpha was the highest bidder in a multi-bidder process, and an overwhelming majority of stockholder votes were in favor of this transaction. The facts as asserted by the petitioners simply do not support the notion that the merger was \"merely\" a pretext to deprive them of standing in this lawsuit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Therefore, even accepting the petitioners' allegations as true, and assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the respondents committed the wrongful acts asserted in both the Amended Complaint and the proposed Second Amended Complaint, Delaware law dictates that the petitioners have lost standing to pursue the derivative shareholder claims.

On behalf of themselves and a putative class of other former Massey shareholders, the petitioners contend that when negotiating and approving Massey's merger with Alpha, the respondents' bad faith and breach of fiduciary duty caused them to \"fail[ ] to obtain the highest price reasonably available for the Company[.]\" The petitioners also assert that the respondents failed to disclose material information to Massey's shareholders about the terms of the merger, including a valuation of the derivative claims and information about the respondents' alleged malfeasance. According to the petitioners, it would not be a futile endeavor for the circuit court to permit them to amend their complaint to add these direct claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Arguing in support of the circuit court's futility ruling, the respondents contend that the merger was a public, multi-bidder process that lasted for nine months and resulted in a price that was $14.33 per share higher than Arch's final bid and twenty-seven percent higher than the value of Massey's stock just before the UBB explosion. The respondents argue that the petitioners' claims about the merger consideration being too low are merely conclusory and speculative. In addition, the respondents explain that the existence of the derivative claims\n   <em>\n    was\n   </em>\n   included in the merger proxy statement and, even if they had committed wrongdoing, there is no law requiring them to admit it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Under Delaware law, \"to state a bad-faith claim, a plaintiff must show either [1] an extreme set of facts to establish that disinterested directors were intentionally disregarding their duties or [2] that the decision under attack is so far beyond the bounds of reasonable judgment that it seems essentially inexplicable on any ground other than bad faith.

The majority's rejection of petitioners' entirely reasonable attempt to amend their complaint to comport with newly-discovered facts which were previously well beyond their reach smacks of blatant result-orientation. As is evident from even a casual read of the opinion, the majority-rather than confining itself to the allegations viewed in the light most favorable to petitioners-indulges itself in the entire universe of facts adduced to date in limited discovery and in other litigation, draws inferences and makes conclusions thereon, and summarily declares respondents to be the victors. Because the Rule 12(b)(6) stage is indisputably not the appropriate setting for such factual assessments, nor is it this Court's role to sit as a trier of fact, I dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   After the tragically well-known explosion at the Upper Big Branch mine owned and operated by Massey Energy Company (\"Massey\") which killed twenty-nine miners, petitioners filed a derivative shareholder action against Massey directors and officers alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties by failing to comply with worker safety laws. Contemporaneous with this action, other shareholders filed derivative actions in Delaware. Those Delaware derivative actions have continued along a track parallel to the instant action; however, the instant action was stayed for a long period of time pending the federal prosecution of Don Blankenship and the bankruptcy of Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (\"Alpha,\" Massey's successor).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Subsequent to the explosion and petitioners' original complaint in this action, Massey undertook a merger with Alpha. Subsequent to that merger, additional discovery was obtained, along with newly-available evidence from the federal prosecution, allegedly revealing that certain Massey directors and/or officers orchestrated the merger to ensure their most culpable employees (certain mine superintendents) and officers had continued employment and could therefore protect themselves by controlling the investigation into the explosion. Petitioners allege that a higher bidder was discouraged because Alpha had agreed to a \"social contract\" which involved retention of these culpable employees. Petitioners allege this was all done to limit the personal liability of these individuals with respect to the explosion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Petitioners now seek to amend their long-ago-filed complaint to assert facts in support of causes of action previously unavailable to them before receipt of this new discovery and information. In particular, petitioners seek to advance a derivative shareholder claim which may survive the merger for damages to the company and a \"direct\" claim for damages to the shareholders individually. For reasons that the majority attempts to obfuscate, it has determined-\n   <em>\n    as a matter of fact and law at the 12(b)(6) stage\n   </em>\n   -that petitioners have neither a viable cause of action nor the right to amend their complaint to even\n   <em>\n    allege\n   </em>\n   such a cause of action. In short, the majority has reviewed the cobbled-together evidence from various proceedings and determined, before even being permitted to amend their complaint, that petitioners cannot win under any circumstance. Making this bold proclamation before full discovery is even conducted seems less like legal analysis and more like reverse-engineering the outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   As this Court has made clear:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Rule 15(a) of the Rules of Civil Procedure provides that leave to amend a pleading \"shall be freely given when justice so requires.\" We recognize that the provision quoted should be liberally construed in order to promote substantial justice and, in accordance with the requirement of R.C.P. 1, in such a manner as \"to secure the just,\n   speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action.\"\n   <em>\n    Cotton States Mutual Insurance Co. v.

However, neither is remotely informative, much less dispositive. In both cases, the plaintiffs wholly failed to make the specific claims and allegations petitioners herein seek to assert.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   First, as to the derivative claim, the majority robotically details at length the black-letter law reiterated in\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   which holds that a derivative claim is extinguished by merger, given the requirement of continuity of ownership throughout derivative litigation. Barely acknowledging the fraud exception at issue here, the majority touts the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   's court agreement with this general principle and its conclusion that a derivative claim would not lie in that action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   While it is true that merger ordinarily defeats a shareholder derivative claim, there are two well-established exceptions, the pertinent one being when \"\n   <em>\n    the merger itself is the subject of a claim of fraud\n   </em>\n   being perpetrated merely to deprive shareholders of the standing to bring a derivative action.\"\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

As previously noted, the plaintiffs in the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   action\n   <em>\n    did not plead or argue this exception and expressly waived it\n   </em>\n   , as recognized by the Delaware Chancery Court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   [T]he Complaint does not plead acts from which it would be reasonable to infer that either of the exceptions to the continuous ownership rule applies.

Therefore, it is clear that the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   court did not actually pass on the question of whether the allegations were sufficient to invoke this exception to survive a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, this Court in\n   <em>\n    Manville\n   </em>\n   found that the complaint \"failed to sufficiently allege that the merger was fraudulent or inequitable.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12130842\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/231/637/#p640\">\n    231 W.

Petitioners have alleged a scenario wherein the directors and/or officers orchestrated a merger which not only had the effect of defeating the shareholders' standing for the derivative suit (a\n   benefit which the majority ironically confers as a matter of law), but also allowed the officers to maintain control over the investigation, shielding themselves from personal criminal and civil liability. Nonetheless, in the lone scrap of analysis dedicated to the issue, the majority doggedly focuses on the fact that the merger yielded a profit to the shareholders, concluding that this fact alone makes petitioners' claim futile. In so doing, the majority makes the\n   <em>\n    plainly factual\n   </em>\n   determination that because the shareholders realized a profit the merger could not have been entered into for the sole purpose of protecting the officers and/or directors. While certainly evidence that respondents could argue to defeat the intent requirement of the fraud exception, the profit margin yielded by the merger is by no means dispositive of the issue of the officers' and/or directors' intentions. That determination is a quintessential issue for the finder of fact. It is exceptionally well-understood that dispositive rulings \"should not be utilized in complex cases, particularly where issues involving motive and intent are present.\"\n   <em>\n    Karnell v. Nutting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8580036\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/w-va/166/269/#p273\">\n    166 W.

If further bootstraps the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   court's conclusion that the \"direct\" action likewise cannot be maintained because the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   court found that the facts alleged by those particular shareholders and their counsel in that particular action did not give rise to such a claim. However, it fails to note the language in\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   which clearly identifies the deficiencies in pleading such a cause of action by the plaintiffs in that case. Critically, petitioners' newly adduced evidence is\n   <em>\n    precisely\n   </em>\n   the type of evidence the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   court found lacking. For example, the\n   <em>\n    Massey II\n   </em>\n   court noted that plaintiffs in that case failed to present evidence of \" 'fraudulent conduct that necessitated the merger.' \"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322837\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/160/484/\">\n    160 A.3d at 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court noted the plaintiff's complaint was \"devoid of any allegations that any of the defendants ... engaged in misconduct to secure personal benefits for themselves to the detriment of any Massey stockholder separately or individually.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 504. Again, this is the exact evidence petitioners wish to amend their complaint to include.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The majority, in fact, makes much use of this newly-discovered evidence, utilizing it to summarily try the case at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage. Again, the majority focuses not on the allegations as construed in the light most favorable to the petitioners, but the respondent-friendly inferences it chooses to indulge based on the information attained to date. Referencing yet again the profit yielded from the merger and the approval of the shareholders of the merger, the majority concludes as a factual matter\n   <em>\n    before full discovery has even been permitted\n   </em>\n   that petitioners have produced nothing but \"theories\" and endorses respondents' \"conclusory\" and \"speculative\" characterizations of the allegations. The mere use of these terms makes clear that the majority, in its Herculean effort to parse the considerable, yet still underdeveloped evidence adduced to date, has entirely lost sight of the meaning of the term \"allegation\" and our pleading standards, even as to fraud claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   More importantly, however, these terms are clearly demonstrative of the majority's refusal to construe the allegations in the light most favorable to petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Furthermore, based upon the cases cited by the majority, it is likewise clear that it wholly misunderstands or deliberately chooses to mischaracterize petitioners' claims. The majority tersely cites from\n   <em>\n    In re MeadWestvaco Stockholders Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328339\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/675/#p684\">\n    168 A.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Del. Ch. 2017) in support of its conclusion that petitioners' \"direct\" claims are futile. However, in\n   <em>\n    MeadWestvaco\n   </em>\n   , the shareholders asserted merely that the directors \" 'flew blind' [into a merger] and left behind $3 billion of value[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328339\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/675/#p684\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12328339\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/675/#p684\">\n    at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Clearly, under such a circumstance, the profit yielded in the merger is entirely pertinent. Here, however, petitioners are not complaining merely that the merger undervalued the company; rather, they are alleging that the entire scheme was an attempt to mitigate civil and criminal liabilities of certain officers and management-level personnel. In such a case, \"profit\" would seem to have only limited relevance, particularly where petitioners allege the other party to the merger was in some measure complicit in the scheme. Further, the majority's reliance on\n   <em>\n    In re Crimson Exploration Inc. Stockholder Litigation\n   </em>\n   is a similar effort in \"cherry-picking\" legal support. No. 8541-VCP,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%205449419\">\n    2014 WL 5449419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Del. Ch. Oct. 24, 2014). Like\n   <em>\n    MeadWestvaco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Crimson Exploration\n   </em>\n   made allegations that the merger consideration was \" 'extraordinarily low.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *23. However, the Delaware Chancery Court dismissed the claim in part because it found fatal the shareholders' \"fail[ure] to allege that a higher price reasonably was available or that there was another bidder ready and willing to buy Crimson for a higher price.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at *24. Petitioners, on the other hand, make exactly this allegation in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   To suggest that petitioners' proposed amended complaint-on its face-is starkly lacking in sufficient allegations of actionable malfeasance on the part of Massey's officers, given all that is publicly known (and has been federally adjudicated) about this tragic incident is flabbergasting to say the least. If petitioners cannot satisfy the high bar set by the causes of action they seek to plead, that legal issue may be presented and determined at the summary judgment stage or resolved by the jury, as appropriate. To refuse petitioners the opportunity to even conduct discovery on their allegations now that the restraints of the federal prosecution and bankruptcy proceedings have been removed casts a pall over the majority's analysis and potential motivations. \"[T]he grant or denial of an opportunity to amend is within the discretion of the [court], but outright refusal to grant the leave without any justifying reason appearing for the denial is not an exercise of discretion; it is merely abuse of that discretion and inconsistent with the spirit of the [ ] Rules.\"\n   <em>\n    Foman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    371 U.S. at 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n    83 S.Ct. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   As the United States Supreme Court noted regarding abusive refusals of motions to amend, \"[i]t is too late in the day and entirely contrary to the spirit of the [ ] Rules of Civil Procedure for decisions on the merits to be avoided on the basis of [ ] mere technicalities.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"450547\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/371/178/#p182\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   For the petitioners herein who have endured eight years of litigation, a litany of investigations, prosecutions, and procedural roadblocks, it is indeed far \"too late in the day\" to reject their attempts to test the merits of their complaint just as they obtain the necessary evidence to present their claims.

However, to the extent that the petitioners might be arguing that the safety violations at Massey's mines could support their direct claims, Delaware law would not support them.

First, they argue that the court considered matters outside of the four corners of the Amended Complaint. As discussed above, we reject that argument. Second, they assert that the court dismissed their case without affording them notice and the opportunity to be heard. We can easily dispose of this claim. The appendix record reflects that all parties extensively briefed the issues to the circuit court. Furthermore, although the circuit court declined the petitioners' request to enter a new scheduling order after this Court's remand on August 26, 2014, that decision was in keeping with the scope of our limited remand. Our remand order instructed the circuit court to enter a new order containing findings of fact and conclusions of law to explain its prior ruling; we did not set aside the circuit court's prior ruling nor did we require the circuit court to hold further hearings or proceedings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Syl.

In\n    <em>\n     Manville,\n    </em>\n    plaintiffs brought a contempt petition against Massey alleging that it had breached a prior settlement agreement requiring it to enact safety protocols; it also went a step beyond and attempted to ask for damages on the basis that the merger was fraudulent, essentially arguing the continuous ownership fraud exception discussed above, but in the context of a contempt proceeding. This Court found that there was no continuity of ownership due to the merger, therefore the contempt proceeding would not lie. As discussed above, the contempt petition did not sufficiently assert the fraud exception to continuous ownership.
