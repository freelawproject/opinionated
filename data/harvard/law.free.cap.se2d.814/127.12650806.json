Inaction by the State Bar or the courts during\n    the course of the litigation, as the concurrence points out, cannot bar or moot subsequent discipline for professional misconduct. A lawyer's duty to the truth and his duty to advocate based upon the truth is central to our system of dispute resolution. N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 3.3. While any client, regardless of his or her status, is entitled to procedural defenses and due process in litigating a claim, no client is entitled to have his attorney present a claim or defense which is untruthful. N.C. R. Prof. Conduct 8.2. Both the public and our profession expect truthful claims and defenses to be presented in court, so that resolution of disputes can be meritoriously and promptly settled.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=254%20S.E.2d%20182\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-61\">\n    With regard to the Plaintiff's second and third requests for declaratory relief, we agree with the trial court Plaintiff lacks\n    standing to bring these claims.

Under our State Bar's disciplinary procedures, the complainant has no control over when, how, or whether the State Bar pursues his grievance. After reporting the alleged attorney misconduct to the Bar, the complainant's interest in the case going forward is the same as all other members of the public-to see a state agency protect the public from attorney misconduct by pursuing discipline for unethical behavior. 27 N.C.

In this declaratory judgment action, Boyce seeks an answer to a simple question: when the lawyers at the State Bar have a conflict of interest, who watches them?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    One answer, Boyce contends, lies in the concurrent jurisdiction of the court system to regulate lawyers. He argues that the statutes creating the State Bar reserved the inherent power of the courts to discipline lawyers. Thus, the courts retain the power to hear claims of attorney misconduct when the claimants have shown that the Bar has a potential conflict of interest. I agree with the majority that this particular declaratory judgment claim (but not the other claims asserted by Boyce) involves a justiciable legal controversy between these parties that the courts may answer through the Declaratory Judgment Act.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    It is worth emphasizing that Boyce has alleged a credible conflict of interest in this case. At the time Boyce submitted his grievance\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    and was awaiting an investigation by the State Bar, Cooper, then serving as our State's Attorney General, was representing the Bar in perhaps the highest profile legal issue in State Bar history-a lawsuit by LegalZoom\n    that threatened to upend the Bar's core mission of licensing and regulating the practice of law in our State.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     LegalZoom.com, Inc. v.

Super. Ct. 2015).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    Cooper appeared in that case as recently as October 2015, a time period that, according to Boyce, overlapped with the submission of his grievance. Moreover, during that same time period, Cooper and his staff routinely represented the State Bar or the Bar's Disciplinary Hearing Commission.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g., Peggs v. North Carolina State Bar\n    </em>\n    , TA-25890 (N.C. Indus. Comm'n 2017);\n    <em>\n     Harper v. North Carolina State Bar\n    </em>\n    , TA-25285 (N.C. Indus.

When the General Assembly created the State Bar, it emphasized in the enabling\n    statutes that the Bar disciplinary process shall not be \"construed as disabling or abridging the inherent powers of the court to deal with its attorneys.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.C.%20Gen.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2084-36\">\n     N.C.

Several years ago, the Bar received a disciplinary complaint against one of Cooper's employees at the Attorney General's office.\n    <em>\n     In re Hicks\n    </em>\n    , 14 M 4670 (N.C. Super.

Boyce has standing to seek declaratory relief on this issue from the trial court. I therefore concur in the decision to reverse the trial court's dismissal of this claim for lack of standing and to remand for further proceedings.\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"10\">\n    <p id=\"p-93\">\n     At oral argument, the State Bar refused to disclose precisely when it opened a grievance investigation or what steps it took with respect to Boyce's grievance.
