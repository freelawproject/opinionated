Appellant Latisha Shana McCoy was charged with driving under the influence of marijuana to the extent it was less safe to drive after she was stopped at a roadblock in Henry County. She moved to suppress all evidence obtained from the stop and arrest on the ground that the roadblock violated the Fourth Amendment. The trial court denied McCoy's motion, and following a bench trial, found her guilty. She appealed to the Court of Appeals, which affirmed the trial court's denial of her motion to suppress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   <em>\n    McCoy v.

The screening officer did not testify at the hearing on the motion to suppress. Rather, the only individual to testify was the police sergeant who made the decision to implement the roadblock pursuant to the police department's written policy.

Specifically, she contends the State presented no evidence that the screening officer's training and experience was sufficient to qualify him to make an initial determination as to which motorists should be given field tests for intoxication.

For this reason, she asserts that the roadblock violated the Fourth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    LaFontaine\n   </em>\n   factors to determine whether a roadblock is satisfactory were adopted by this Court based on the Court of Appeals opinion in\n   <em>\n    State v.

It is clear that the delay experienced by passing motorists was minimal, lasting only a minute or two unless a violation was noted, and that the operation was well identified as a police checkpoint. Taking all of these factors into consideration, we hold that the\n   <em>\n    initial detention\n   </em>\n   of the defendant at the roadblock was reasonable and resulted in no violation of his Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Footnote omitted; emphasis supplied.)

Indeed, it is the rule in Georgia that any person may testify, on the basis of personal observation, as to whether another person did or did not appear to be intoxicated on a given occasion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Citations omitted; emphasis supplied.)

Indeed, a roadblock stop can become a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop-when an officer has reasonable suspicion that a motorist may have committed a crime such as driving under the influence-which must also comply with the Fourth Amendment.

In\n    <em>\n     State v. Jackson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638392\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/646/\">\n     287 Ga. 646\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638392\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/646/\">\n     697 S.E.2d 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010), we explained that in determining whether to disapprove precedent, we consider \" 'factors such as the age of the precedent, the reliance interests at stake, the workability of the decision, and, most importantly, the soundness of its reasoning.' \" (Citation omitted.)\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638392\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/646/\">\n     Id. at 658\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (5),\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3638392\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/287/646/\">\n     697 S.E.2d 757\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Taking these points in reverse order, the reasoning in\n    <em>\n     LaFontaine\n    </em>\n    as to the fifth factor, as we explained above, misconstrued the Court of Appeals' holding in\n    <em>\n     Golden\n    </em>\n    , and other courts do not appear to use the factor as part of the constitutional analysis of roadblocks; a four-factor analysis is more workable, especially when the fifth factor has never seemed to be dispositive, and thus the fifth factor serves only to unusefully expand or unhelpfully confuse the roadblock analysis; the factor established no property or contract interest or substantive right and thus generated no meaningful reliance interests; and while it is 20 years old,\n    <em>\n     LaFontaine\n    </em>\n    is not an ancient ruling deeply embedded in the law, and indeed there are only a few appellate decisions applying the fifth factor. Stare decisis therefore does not preclude disapproving the continued consideration of\n    <em>\n     LaFontaine\n    </em>\n    's fifth factor.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-36\">\n    At the hearing on the motion to suppress, counsel asserted that \"the only issue, ... is whether the roadblock was constitutional.\" And the trial court ruled only on that issue. During oral argument in this Court, however, counsel asserted that no one testified as to McCoy's condition, how she appeared, etc., and that there was no evidence as to whether it was reasonable to move McCoy for further testing. This Court will not consider arguments asserted for the first time on appeal that were neither raised nor ruled upon by the trial court. See\n    <em>\n     Johnson v.
