J.:\n </judges>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   This is an appeal from the November 30, 2016, order of the Circuit Court of Wood County sentencing petitioner Cortez Barefield (hereinafter \"petitioner\") to one to fifteen years in the penitentiary on his conviction of possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, with intent to deliver. Petitioner asserts that the circuit court erred by admitting evidence seized from petitioner in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article III, section 6 of the West Virginia Constitution. Specifically, petitioner claims that evidence seized from his person was obtained without a search warrant and that none of the exceptions to the warrant requirement are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Upon careful review of the briefs, the appendix record, the arguments of the parties, and the applicable legal authority, we find that the circuit court erroneously admitted evidence seized as the result of an unlawful, warrantless search, which fails to satisfy any of the exceptions to the warrant requirement. We therefore reverse petitioner's conviction and remand for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 21, 2015, Officer Michael Pifer (\"Officer Pifer\") of the Vienna Police Department and member of the Parkersburg Violent Crime and Narcotics Task Force unit obtained a search warrant for 925 Lynn Street, Parkersburg, West Virginia, which home was owned by Eric Salyers. Officer Pifer provided an affidavit in support of probable cause that stated that a confidential informant advised him that Mr. Salyers and his wife Keisha were selling heroin from their residence. The confidential informant then engaged in two controlled purchases of heroin at the residence from Mr. Salyers. Based upon this information, Officer Pifer's affidavit requested a search warrant for the residence at 925 Lynn Street and that the warrant \"cover all structures on this property,\" and \"\n   <em>\n    shall also cover search of any\n   </em>\n   vehicles and\n   <em>\n    persons located on this property\n   </em>\n   .\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Magistrate Brenda K. Marshall issued a form search warrant referencing a list of items to be seized from 925 Lynn Street including controlled substances, records, currency, photographs, paraphernalia, firearms, and other evidence of possession with intent to distribute controlled substances. In the section provided for \"grounds for probable cause,\" the warrant states \"See Affidavit.\" The warrant then states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-13\">\n   You are therefore, commanded in the name of the State of West Virginia\n   <em>\n    to search forthwith the premises above described and all appurtenances thereto\n   </em>\n   for the property above specified, to seize such property and bring the same before me to be dealt with according to law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A SWAT team then executed the search warrant at 925 Lynn Street, removing petitioner and three other people from a bedroom in the home to search it. Arrest warrants were served on Mr. Salyers, his wife, and Kalem Casto, an acquaintance of the Salyers who was living in their guest room. Petitioner was handcuffed and removed to the front yard where he was subjected to a second pat-down and search by Officer Pifer. Officer Pifer seized approximately $865 in cash, a pay stub, an Ohio ID card belonging to petitioner, a social security card, and a VISA debit card in someone else's name from petitioner's person. During the search of the home, the police found three separate controlled substances in the bedroom where petitioner was found and therefore arrested petitioner and the three other individuals who were in the bedroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Petitioner was indicted on three counts of possession with intent to deliver, second offense; the three controlled substances were cocaine, methamphetamine, and oxycodone. At trial, Kalem Casto testified that he was at the residence at the time of the raid and had sold heroin to two individuals there; those same individuals also wanted to buy crack cocaine, but Mr. Casto had none. He contacted petitioner to bring crack cocaine to sell to the individuals. Petitioner came to the residence and waited in the bedroom for the individuals to return with more money to buy the cocaine. It was at this time that the raid occurred. Mr. Casto denied that any of the drugs found in the bedroom belonged to him or any other individuals in the room.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Salyers also testified that he was present at the home and saw petitioner arrive with several baggies containing crack cocaine and methamphetamine; he testified that petitioner discussed having oxycodone as well. Both Mr. Casto and Mr. Salyers agreed to give testimony against petitioner as part of their plea agreements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to trial, petitioner filed three motions to exclude all or part of the evidence seized from his person during the raid. During the evidentiary hearings on the motions, Officer Pifer testified that the individuals in the bedroom were brought outside of the home to process both the people and property and ensure no one tampered with evidence. Officer Pifer confirmed that petitioner was patted down and handcuffed by the SWAT team before he searched him outside. Importantly, Officer Pifer testified that he believed that he was acting pursuant to the search warrant when he searched petitioner's person. He stated he was searching for both weapons and contraband. He further testified that while on the scene, due to the discovery of drugs in the bedroom where petitioner was located, he developed probable cause to arrest petitioner and typically, incident to arrest, he performs an inventory search on items on an individual. He stated that he knew the home to be one used for drug transactions and that petitioner specifically was known to him as being someone involved in a prior controlled buy at the Red Roof Inn. Officer Pifer conceded that although his search occurred before the drugs were found, he would have kept petitioner in custody until that search was completed and therefore the items seized would have been discovered on his person incident to arrest.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    Also in the room were Isaiah Ocee, Michaela Butcher, and Nathan Casto (Kalem's brother who is now deceased). Mr. Casto testified that all three purchased drugs from him and were drug abusers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <p type=\"majority\">\n   <p id=\"p-18\">\n    The circuit court denied petitioner's motions to suppress, finding that the search of petitioner was not unreasonable because of petitioner's presence at the home, where the police had \"reliable information that the residence was being used at the time as a place from which controlled substances were being bought and sold.\" The circuit court further referenced Officer Pifer's familiarity with petitioner's involvement in drug trafficking and the need to ensure he and others were neither a safety risk nor destroyed contraband. The circuit court seemingly also referenced the inevitable discovery rule by stating that Officer Pifer could have \"replace[d]\" the evidence on petitioner's person and then \"seize[d] it again after unlawful drugs were found in the home.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    Petitioner was found guilty of only one count: possession of a controlled substance, cocaine, with intent to deliver. He was found not guilty of possession of methamphetamine and oxycodone. The circuit court sentenced him to one to fifteen years and this appeal followed.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    <strong>\n     II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    It is well-established that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n    the ultimate determination as to whether a search or seizure was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Section 6 of Article III of the West Virginia Constitution is a question of law that is reviewed\n    <em>\n     de novo\n    </em>\n    .... Thus, a circuit court's denial of a motion to suppress evidence will be affirmed unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence, based on an erroneous interpretation of the law, or, based on the entire record, it is clear that a mistake has been made.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-23\">\n    Syl.

With these principles in mind, we proceed to petitioner's assignment of error.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    <strong>\n     III. DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    Petitioner raises only one assignment of error: that the seizure of the items\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    from his person during the execution of the search warrant were the result of an illegal warrantless search and that no recognized legal exceptions to the warrant requirement apply. The State maintains that the warrant permitted the search of all persons on the premises, including petitioner, and that in any event, the evidence is admissible pursuant to the inevitable discovery doctrine since it would have been discovered during a search incident to arrest of petitioner.\n    <footnotemark>\n     3\n    </footnotemark>\n    Petitioner counters that no probable cause to arrest him existed and therefore, there was no lawful arrest to which a search would have been incident. While we ultimately conclude that the warrant at issue, neither on its face nor as an \"all persons\" warrant, lawfully permitted the search of petitioner, we take this opportunity to address the potential validity of such a warrant as well as the requirements for its proper procurement and issuance.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    <em>\n     A. Validity of the Search Warrant\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-27\">\n    This Court long-ago held that\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n    [a] search warrant ... cannot be extended to authorize the arrest or search of a person not in any way connected with the place directed to be searched, who merely happens to be upon the premises, and who is not mentioned or described in the warrant or affidavit of probable cause upon which the warrant was issued.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-29\">\n    Syl.

The State maintains that the warrant permitted law enforcement to validly search all persons present on the premises pursuant to a so-called \"all persons\" warrant, which purports to grant authority to search all persons found at a particular location. While West Virginia has not yet addressed the validity of such a warrant, we note that a majority of states, as well as the Fourth Circuit, have determined that such a warrant \"is not unconstitutional\n    <em>\n     per se\n    </em>\n    \" but may be found to be valid as long as there is sufficient probable cause to justify the search of all persons located on the premises.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     ex rel.

D. Wis. 2001) (analyzing cases and tallying jurisdictions permitting \"all persons\" warrants). Of the approximate\n    eight jurisdictions that have rejected the warrants as facially unconstitutional, most have done so on the basis that they are \"uncomfortabl[y] similar[ ]\" to general warrants, which the Fourth Amendment was designed to address.\n    <em>\n     Id\n    </em>\n    . at 1207.

Ct. App. 1990). In one of the first cases to recognize such a warrant, the New Jersey Supreme Court attempted to debunk the ostensible fear that \"all persons\" warrants were tantamount to general warrants by reasoning that \"there is none of the vice of a general warrant if the individual is [ ] identified by physical nexus to the ongoing criminal event itself,\" particularly where \"the place is so limited and the illegal operation so overt that it is likely that everyone present is party to the offense.\"\n    <em>\n     State v.

For instance, the Fourth Circuit has held that the nexus among criminal activity, the premises, and its occupants is insufficient if there is not \"probable cause to believe that\n    <em>\n     everyone\n    </em>\n    found on the premises being searched is involved in the illegal activity and that evidence of the crime would be found on their person.\"\n    <em>\n     Owens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9231380\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/372/267/#p275\">\n     372 F.3d at 275\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis in original).

In addition to a factual nexus, the supporting affidavit must more specifically demonstrate 1) that the area to be searched is small, confined, and private; 2) the nature of the suspected criminal activity is such that participants constantly shift and/or change, making it difficult to predict who may be present on the premises at any given time; and 3) that the items which are the subject of the search are of a size or kind which renders them easily concealed and/or destroyed.

Significantly, however, there were three other people in the bedroom with petitioner where the drugs were found and two to three other adults\n    elsewhere in the small house-any of whom could have been the owner and/or possessor of the drugs.

Therefore, that drugs were found is hardly surprising and in fact what police believed they would find as evidence of Mr. and Mrs. Salyers' and Mr. Casto's drug activities. Attributing those drugs to petitioner then, as opposed to any other individual in the house and/or specifically the bedroom where they were found-particularly those who were the target of the investigation-is devoid of logic.

This is the position taken by the State in this matter and represents precisely the majority approach which the Court rejected in\n    <em>\n     Flippo\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Accordingly, even if one accepts the State's argument that it had probable cause to arrest petitioner, necessitating a search incident to arrest and that there was therefore a \"reasonable probability\" that the evidence would have been discovered, the State must still prove the two remaining elements of\n    <em>\n     Flippo\n    </em>\n    : that the leads making the discovery inevitable were possessed by the police at the time of the misconduct; and that the police were actively pursuing a lawful alternative line of investigation to seize the evidence prior to the time of the illegal search. The State contends the \"lead\" making the discovery inevitable was the search warrant; however, a reasonable argument could be made that the \"lead\" was actually the discovery of the drugs in the bedroom where petitioner was located, which discovery occurred\n    <em>\n     subsequent\n    </em>\n    to Officer Pifer's illegal search.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    However, we need not engage in a theoretical debate about which of these positions is more compelling inasmuch as the final requirement of\n    <em>\n     Flippo\n    </em>\n    is demonstrably lacking. Clearly, the police were not \"actively pursuing a lawful alternative line of investigation to seize\" the items from petitioner because they believed their existing warrant permitted them to search petitioner. Police were not pursuing, nor did they at any time, pursue a warrant to search or arrest petitioner. It is this final requirement of\n    <em>\n     Flippo\n    </em>\n    which most markedly separates West Virginia's more restrictive view of the inevitable discovery doctrine from the more lax, majority view permitting mere \"routine procedure\" to pave a pathway toward discovery, and therefore admissibility, of the evidence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    Therefore, we conclude that the evidence seized from petitioner and admitted as evidence at trial was obtained pursuant to an unlawful warrantless search and should have been suppressed.

Mr. Salyers' testimony was the only evidence as to petitioner's possession of those two illegal substances. Therefore, when the remaining witness' testimony about summoning petitioner to the house to sell crack cocaine is coupled with the seizure of a large sum of cash from petitioner's person-evidence which is consistent with and supportive of the prosecution's theory of the case and the testimony of the primary witness-we cannot conclude that the admission of the unlawfully seized evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-70\">\n    <strong>\n     IV.

Mr. Salyers testified that the petitioner was in possession of methamphetamine and oxycodone; as the majority notes, the jury clearly found him not credible, based on their acquittal of those charges. There is no evidence, however, that the jury's verdict hinged on or was even affected by the unlawfully seized evidence, given Mr. Casto's compelling testimony. Mr. Casto testified that he summoned the petitioner to the house to sell crack cocaine to two individuals to whom Mr. Casto had just sold heroin. Mr. Casto candidly discussed his own drug addiction and trafficking activities and admitted to his own individual culpability as to the events occurring prior to the raid. Clearly, the jury found him credible as his was the\n    <em>\n     only\n    </em>\n    testimony linking the petitioner to the cocaine found on the premises.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    Moreover, a closer examination of the significance of the unlawfully-seized evidence demonstrates how inconsequential it was. Unlike most instances, the petitioner in this case was not found with drugs on his person. Rather, the unlawfully seized evidence consisted only of $800, an identification card, a social security card, a paystub, and a VISA debit card. Obviously, the only remotely inculpatory evidence among these items, relative to the charge of possession with intent to deliver, is the $800 in cash. To suggest that the jury's verdict was influenced by his possession of $800 in cash wholly disregards Mr. Casto's testimony. No one testified that the two individuals had already paid the petitioner for the cocaine, in which case the cash would serve as corroborative evidence. Nor was there any testimony demonstrating that the only logical conclusion is that the cash was from the sale of the cocaine, as opposed to some innocent source. As such, the mere possession of cash by the petitioner is of little to no moment in light of the testimony of Mr. Casto, who squarely implicated the petitioner relative to the charge of possession with intent to deliver. The scant mention of the cash by the prosecution is further demonstrative of how insignificant it was to the case as a whole.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    This is not a case where scores of witnesses and evidence were introduced, which would make the significance of the unlawfully-seized evidence to the jury somewhat unclear. Instead, this was a simple, straightforward case and the conviction rendered by the jury was supported fully by the testimony of a single witness. The evidence erroneously admitted is simply not the type that added weight to the scales in favor of conviction. Accordingly, I dissent.\n   </p>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
