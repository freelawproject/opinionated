City &amp; </em>County, 63 Haw. 668, 634 P.2d 595 (1981), and abused its discretion in granting an interlocutory appeal after denying Appellant MTL, Inc.\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment. We therefore reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">L</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Appellee Barbara Stafford, an employee of the State of Hawaii, was injured while boarding an MTL bus and subsequently filed a complaint against MTL for negligence. Because MTL\u2019s insurer was thereafter declared insolvent, Hawaii Insurance Guaranty Association (HIGA) assumed the responsibility of providing MTL with liability coverage according to Chapter 431-16 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The State then intervened to establish a lien against any recovery made by Stafford for the workers\u2019 compensation benefits the State had already paid for treatment of Stafford\u2019s injuries. The trial court denied MTL\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment which contended that the State did not fall within the definition of a \u201ccovered claim\u201d under HRS \u00a7 431:16-105(5). However, the trial court allowed MTL to seek this interlocutory appellate review of its denied motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-10\">Section 641-1 (b) of the Hawaii Revised Statutes allows a court to exercise its discretion to grant an appeal from an interlocutory judgment whenever the court may think the appeal is advisable for \u201cspeedy termination of litigation.\u201d In <em>Liu </em>we held that if the appeal puts an end to the action, the requirement of speedy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>termination is met. If, on the other hand, the appeal is merely a request for this court to intervene and decide an issue in an unfinished and incomplete case, the requirement is not met. 63 Haw. at 672,634 P.2d at 598. In this case, the resolution of whether HIGA may have to pay the State\u2019s lien is speculative at this point and is of no assistance towards a \u201cspeedy termination of litigation.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A4j\"><em>Kevin P. H. Sumida (Clyde Wm. Matsui, Randall Y. S. Chung, Gary W. B. Chang, Michael N. Tanoue </em>and <em>Cary T. Tanaka </em>with him on the briefs) for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AtvP\"><em>George Horn, </em>Deputy Attorney General, for Intervenor-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AFO\"><em>Pamela J. Berman </em>for Plaintiff-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">The burdensome expense in pursuing premature appeals as well as the inherent waste of both attorney and judicial time is a serious problem and is clearly contrary to the purpose and statutory requirements of interlocutory appeals. If MTL is held not liable, the issue of whether the State\u2019s lien is a covered claim need not be determined. Address of this issue on interlocutory appeal is unnecessary at this point and is of no assistance towards a speedy termination of litigation as the <em>Liu </em>court required in interpreting HRS \u00a7 641 \u2014 1(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">We hold that the trial court improvidently granted the interlocutory appeal. On the authority of <em>Liu, </em>we reverse and remand for trial on the merits.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
