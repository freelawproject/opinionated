The court also ordered him summarily discharged from his job pursuant to HRS \u00a7 286-138(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">On appeal, Defendant contends that (A) the prosecution of Defendant was in violation of the doctrine of separation of powers; (B) there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction; (C) Defendant\u2019s conduct constituted a de minimis infraction of the offenses charged; (D) the trial court erred in allowing evidence of prior bad acts under the rubric of habit and custom; (E) in the absence of supporting evidence, the trial court erred in giving the jury instruction on accomplice liability; and (F) the trial court erred in discharging Defendant from his job as Deputy Administrative Director of the Courts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">We hold that there was insufficient evidence to support the convictions of one count of Tampering with a Public Record and six counts of Unsworn Falsification to Authorities. Accordingly, we reverse those convictions. However, we affirm the convictions of six counts of Fixing Tickets and the sentences therefor, including the summary discharge of Defendant from his government job.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">The State of Hawaii (State) cross-appeals, claiming that the trial court (A) abused its discretion in excluding the State\u2019s evidence of uncharged misconduct; (B) erred in merging the Tampering with a Public Record charges with the Unsworn Falsification to Authorities charges; and (C) erroneously concluded that HRS \u00a7 804-4 (Supp. 1989) mandated a stay of Defendant\u2019s sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>pending appeal,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We hold that the issues raised by the State are. moot and dismiss the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">I. FACTS A.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">In 1961, the Traffic Violations Bureau (TVB) was transferred from the Honolulu Police Department (HPD)to the Honolulu District Court. District Court Administrative Magistrate Millard White<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> appointed Defendant as the director of the TVB. Magistrate White established a system for the pre-arraignment disposition of traffic tickets when the recipient of the citation complained in person at the TVB. Under the system, Defendant would listen to the complaint and make a recommendation whether to cancel or modify the traffic citation, or to reduce the amount of the fine. Defendant would rubber-stamp the citation \u201cAction by Court\u201d and forward it to Magistrate White with a brief note about the circumstances of the citation and his recommended disposition. If approved, Magistrate White would sign and date the citation. The citation was then filed at the TVB.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">Another system was developed for the disposition of citations where a citing police officer wished to withdraw the citation. The police officer would meet with Defendant and state his reasons for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>the withdrawal. Defendant would fill out an affidavit with the officer\u2019s reasons and have the officer swear to and sign the affidavit. Both the citation and affidavit were then sent to Magistrate White for review and approval.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">District Court Administrative Judge Frank Takao issued two directives addressing these procedures in 1976 and 1977. The directives provided that all citations voided or modified by an issuing officer must be accompanied by that officer\u2019s affidavit slating the reason for the adjustment. Judge Takao testified at trial that the circumstances he had in mind for recommendation of adjustment of bail amounts or cancellation of tickets were cases where a tree branch blocked a traffic sign or light, and not because the motorist was on welfare. Judge Takao stated that when Defendant received a complaint, he was supposed to check with the police officer who issued the ticket to determine whether the complaint was legitimate. If it was, that reason was to be put in the officer\u2019s affidavit. Under the established procedures, Defendant had a duty to inform the district judge of the reason for his recommendation for the adjustment or cancellation of a traffic ticket.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Successor Administrative Judge Russell Kono continued the procedures established by his predecessor. He testified that the 1976 and 1977 directives were meant to prevent the cancellation of traffic tickets without justification rather than to facilitate the cancellation of tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The evidence at trial disclosed the following TVB procedure. A traffic citation consists of five copies: one copy for the cited motorist, one copy for the issuing police officer, and three copies for processing by the TVB. The citation is logged into the court\u2019s computers at the TVB Data Processing Division (DP). One copy is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>placed in a master file. The remaining two copies arc sent to the cashier\u2019s section.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Two procedures were available to an issuing police -officer who wanted to cancel a traffic citation. By general order, the officer was supposed to fill out HPD Form 168 setting forth the reason for the cancellation. Upon review and approval of the form by the officer\u2019s superior, it would be sent to theTVB. The TVB would fill out an affidavit indicating the reason for the cancellation taken from the Form 168, then call in the officer to sign tire affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The other procedure, available to both police officers and civilians, entailed requesting cancellation at the TVB. All eight of the citations at issue in this case involved this method of cancellation. An officer or civilian would go to the TVB with a request or complaint regarding a citation. That person would either meet with Defendant or one of his clerks. Defendant generally met with the police officers. Most of the police officers testified that although they did not address the validity of the citation, Defendant placed a shorthand symbol for \u201caffidavit\u201d on the citation. The TVB clerks understood the symbol to mean that the citation was to be cancelled and that they were to prepare an affidavit for the issuing officer\u2019s signature. When the officer went to sign the affidavit, it would usually be blank. Sometimes the officer gave a reason for cancellation or often gave no reason, or would slate \u201cpul the usual.\u201d Usually, the clerk would type in a false, concocted reason for the cancellation and the officer was not placed under oath to swear that the contents of the affidavit were true. Defendant\u2019s understanding was that his indication of \u201caffidavit\u201d on the citation was an instruction to his staff to prepare an affidavit with the officer\u2019s given reason for cancellation and that the affidavit would then be executed by the officer after he swore to the truth of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">Explanations given for the cancellated of a citation were always accepted and there was no attempt to independently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>determine the validity of the reasons given. Defendant never instructed the clerks regarding the reasons they were to insert in the affidavit. After the issuing officer signed the affidavit, TVB managing clerks Hanae Yasuda, Harriet Schimmelfenning, or Viola Kasparovitch would sign it for Defendant without reviewing the reasons for cancellation. Defendant did not review the contents of the affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">The affidavit and citation were then sent to the DP division where the information was logged into the computer and a printout made. Defendant testified that the computer printout and bundled tickets first came to his office before being sent to the administrative district judge, but that he did not have time to look at \u201ceach and everyone.\u201d 5/30/89 Transcript at 101-102. A district judge would review the printout and sign it. Generally, a judge would routinely approve the cancellation of a citation that was supported by an affidavit of the issuing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The eight traffic tickets or citations involved in this case were issued to Nelson Higa (Higa), Shirley Hayashi (Hayashi), Ronald Medeiros (Medeiros), Roxanne Sprowl Scott (Scott), Judith Utter-back Wasson (Wasson), John Roth (Roth), Lois Sprowl (Sprowl), and Michael Machado (Machado). All eight tickets were cancelled through the affidavit procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">Higa personally saw Defendant and complained that the citation he received was unjustified because the left turn sign was obscured by a traffic control signal. Concerning Machado\u2019s ticket, his friend who knew Defendant complained to Defendant that there was a problem with the speeding ticket issued to Machado. In each of the other six citations, a police officer who did not issue the ticket saw Defendant about cancelling the ticket. With respect to the tickets issued to Scott, Wasson, Roth, and Sprowl, Officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Veal, a fellow church member, told Defendant that those cited were experiencing financial hardship. Each of the motorists\u2019 copies of the tickets (except that for Machado which was not introduced into evidence) bore Defendant\u2019s shorthand symbol for affidavit.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Each issuing officer testified he believed the ticket he issued was valid. Each was called in to sign an affidavit for the ticket he had issued. Most of the seven issuing officers (Officer Richardson had issued two of the tickets) could not remember if the affidavit was blank when they signed it. Officer Richardson, who cited Higa and Roth, did however testify that usually he would sign the affidavit without any discussion about the reason for the cancellation. Officer Medeiros signed an affidavit that was never filled in and testified that he was not asked about a reason for the cancellation.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Officer Eggersgluss, who cited Sprawl, could not recall signing the affidavit but recognized his signature and testified that it was standard procedure to be given a blank affidavit to sign. Officer Veal, who cited Machado, testified that he signed a blank affidavit. He also testified that he believes TVB clerk Amy Donlin told him that the cancellation was requested by Defendant and he thought he saw Defendant\u2019s symbol approving the cancellation of the ticket. Most of the officers testified that it was common practice to agree to cancel perfectly valid citations at the request of another officer unless there was a strong reason not to. Most also testified that they would not sign an affidavit unless the cancellation was approved by Defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">The jury returned guilty verdicts as to six counts of Fixing Tickets, seven counts of Tampering with a Public Record, and six counts of Unsworn Falsification to Authorities. The jury was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>unable to reach a verdict as to two counts of Fixing Tickets (tickets issued to Higa and Machado) and one count of Unsworn Falsification to Authorities (ticket issued to Higa). The trial court declared a mistrial as to these counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">On Defendant\u2019s motion regarding the merger of the offenses, the court held that Tampering with a Public Record was an offense included within the offense of Unsworn Falsification to Authorities. Therefore, on six of the traffic tickets where Defendant had been convicted of both offenses, the court dismissed the six counts of Tampering with a Public Record. Since the jury did not reach a verdict on the Unsworn Falsification to Authorities charge on the Higa ticket, the conviction on the Tampering with a Public Record charge for that ticket was allowed to stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">After the entry of the judgment of conviction, Defendant timely appealed and the State cross-appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">II. DEFENDANT\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"AnXh\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Before, during, and after trial, Defendant sought the dismissal of all charges on the ground that the prosecution impermissibly interfered with the judiciary\u2019s decision-making function in violation of the separation of powers doctrine. Defendant\u2019s basic premise was that, with respect to the pre-arraignment disposition of traffic citations from which the charges arose, he was acting as a member of the judiciary branch and, as such, his conduct was not subject to control by the executive branch.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">In ruling on Defendant\u2019s pretrial motion to dismiss, the trial court held that \u201c[ijmplicit in the charges is the assumption that the powers of the judiciary has [sic] been clearly exceeded.\u201d Record, Vol. 5 at 114. We agree with the court\u2019s analysis and its denial of Defendant\u2019s motions to dismiss on the separation of powers ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>HRS \u00a7 286 \u2014 138(b) (1985), enacted in 1961, provides that no traffic violation charge \u201cshall be stricken, amended, or reduced except by consent of the court upon written motion of the prosecuting attorney stating the reasons therefor.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In 1961, at a meeting of all state magistrates with Chief Justice Wilfred Tsukiyama, it was determined that, since a traffic ticket is not a charge, no nolle prosequi is necessary. Therefore, Chief Justice Tsukiyama stated that a magistrate may approve the modification or voidance of a \u201ctag\u201d if he knows the reason therefor. Accordingly, a procedure was established by the Honolulu District Court for the prearraignment disposition of traffic tickets as indicated above.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The Fixing Tickets charges, in essence, implied that Defendant acted outside the scope of his authority as a judiciary employee in the disposition of the eight traffic tickets by not adhering to the procedures established by the district judges. At trial, the central issue was not \u201cthe manner in which the Judiciary had decided on the disposition of eight traffic citationsl,]\u201d as Defendant claims. Rather, it was the manner in which Defendant failed to comply with the established procedures for the pre-arraignment cancellation of the traffic tickets. Based on the evidence, Defendant\u2019s breach of separation of powers claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">Moreover, in an abundance of caution to maintain fairness, the trial court instructed the jury that Defendant could not be convicted of Fixing Tickets if his \u201cactions constituted the use of the powers of the Judge or Judges, in the exercise of their judicial functions!.]\u201d 6/2/89 Transcript at 69-70. The court also instructed the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>that the defense of \u201cexecution of public duty\u201d applied if Defendant reasonably believed that \u201chis conduct [was] required or authorized to assist a public officer in the performance of his dutiesf]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 75-76. Despite these instructions, the jury found Defendant guilty of six of the eight Fixing Tickets charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">We hold that the prosecution of Defendant did not constitute a violation of the separation of powers principle.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">Defendant contends that there was insufficient evidence that Defendant knew of the falsification of the police officers\u2019 affidavits which resulted in the cancellation of the traffic tickets involved in this case. We agree with respect to the Tampering with a Public Record and Unsworn Falsification to Authorities convictions. We disagree, however, regarding the Fixing Tickets convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">The State is required to prove each element of an offense beyond a reasonable doubt. HRS \u00a7701-114(a) (1985). Regarding both the Tampering with a Public Record (HRS \u00a7 710 \u2014 1017(l)(b)) and Unsworn Falsification to Authorities (HRS \u00a7 710-1063(l)(b)) charges, an essential element of those offenses is that Defendant <em>knew </em>that the written instrument (the issuing officer\u2019s affidavit) <em>was falsely made or completed. </em>In our view, the State failed to prove this essential element beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">It is clear from the evidence that, with respect to the eight affidavits at issue, (1) Defendant did not tell the clerks, directly or indirectly, what reasons to put in the affidavits; (2) he did not tell the persons seeking cancellation of the tickets to tell the clerks anything; (3) the police officers who issued the tickets did not discuss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>the reasons for cancellation with Defendant; (4) Defendant did not review or personally approve or sign the affidavits; and (5) Defendant testified that it was his belief that the clerks would insert in the affidavits the true reasons given by the officers issuing the tickets. Thus, there was no direct evidence that Defendant knew that the affidavits were falsely made or completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Nonetheless, the State asserts that \u201cthere was substantial evidence from which the jury could reasonably infer that, although the Defendant did not know the specific reasons the clerks put in the affidavits, those reasons were false.\u201d \u201c[Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the [S]tate,\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Tamura, </em>63 Haw. 636, 637, 633 P.2d 1115, 1117 (1981), we do not believe there is substantial evidence that Defendant knew that the affidavits were falsely made or completed. From the evidence of general practice and procedure in the TVB, we cannot by a quantum leap arrive at a reasonable inference of Defendant\u2019s knowledge of falsity as to the eight affidavits involved in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">Accordingly, we conclude that the evidence was insufficient to support convictions for the Tampering with a Public Record and Unsworn Falsification to Authorities offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">On the other hand, to support a conviction of Fixing Tickets, proof of Defendant\u2019s knowledge that the affidavits were falsely made and completed is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">As the trial court instructed the jury, the essential elements of the Fixing Tickets offenses are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">First, defendant is a person, including a governmental official or employee of the State or County.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">And, second, defendant fixed, voided, tampered with or otherwise disposed of;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Third, any of the eight traffic citations which are the subject of this case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">And fourth, he did so intentionally, knowingly or recklessly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">6/2/89 Transcript at 69. The court also gave the following instruction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">[A] person acts recklessly with respect to a result of his conduct when he consciously disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that his conduct will cause such a result.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-9\">A risk is substantial and unjustifiable if, considering the nature and the purpose of the person\u2019s conduct, and the circumstances known to him, the disregard of the risk involves a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law abiding person would observe in the same situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">Upon a careful review of the record, we conclude that there is substantial evidence that Defendant was under a court directive to make recommendations as to the disposition of traffic citations, and was directed to submit such recommendations, with the citing officers\u2019 affidavits, in accordance therewith. There further is evidence that Defendant failed to ascertain the validity of the affidavits before inviting reliance thereupon by the district judges. A jury, on the record, could find that Defendant acted recklessly in this regard and, accordingly, could convict Defendant on the six counts of Fixing Tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-12\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-13\">Defendant next contends that his conduct constituted a de minimis infraction of the Fixing Tickets offenses. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>HRS \u00a7 702-236(1) (1985)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> permits a court to dismiss de minimis infractions of the law. Appellate review of the court\u2019s determination under this statute is based on the abuse of discretion standard. <em>State </em>v. <em>Park, </em>55 Haw. 610, 617, 525 P.2d 586, 591-92 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Defendant asserts that he acted in good faith without evil intent and his conduct fell \u201cwithin a customary license or tolerance\u201d as set forth in HRS \u00a7 702-236(l)(a). He argues that the procedure of pre-arraignment cancellation of traffic tickets \u201cwas granted a customary license in order that the District Court could continue to operate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The evidence, however, is contrary to Defendant\u2019s assertion. The district judges who approved the cancellations of the eight traffic tickets in question believed that the reasons set forth for the recommended cancellations were legitimate. There was no \u201ccustomary license or tolerance\u201d to justify the cancellation of the traffic tickets by falsifying the affidavits of officers who had issued those tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">Moreover, Defendant\u2019s conduct constituting the basis of the charges was not consistent with the purpose of the law defining the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>offense, a requirement under HRS \u00a7 702-236(l)(a). When the legislature established the traffic point system (HRS \u00a7 286-128), it also made \u201cfixing tickets\u201d an offense under HRS \u00a7 286-138. Act 113,1961 Haw. Sess. Laws 99. The purpose of the \u201cfixing tickets\u201d statute was \u201cthe administration and enforcement of the proposed point system <em>in a strict uniform manner without </em>qualification.\u201d Sen. Stand. Comm. Rep. No. 904, in 1961 Senate Journal, at 981 (emphasis added). Thus, Defendant\u2019s conduct resulting in the tickets being cancelled was not consistent with the purpose of the \u201cfixing tickets\u201d statute. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Vance, </em>61 Haw. 291, 307, 602 P.2d 933, 944 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">We therefore conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the dismissal of the Fixing Tickets charges on de minimis grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">Because of the volume of traffic tickets they handled and due to the passage of time, the TVB clerks, managing clerks, and police officers who testified generally were unable to recall the specifics of the eight tickets pertinent to this case. The trial court, however, permitted them to testify about the handling of other tickets in general as evidence of habit and routine practice under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) Rule 406.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">Defendant claims error-because (1) the Stale failed to lay an adequate foundation to establish that the witnesses\u2019 testimony constituted evidence of habit, and (2) the evidence admitted under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>guise of habit was really evidence of prior bad acts \u201cto prove the character of [Defendant] to show that he acted in conformity therewith.\u201d HRE Rule 404(b).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">While the use of character evidence under HRE Rule 404 is stringently limited, \u201crelevancy, in general, is the only limitation upon proof of habit or routine practice.\u201d 10 J. Moore &amp; H. Bendix, <em>Moore's Federal Practice </em>\u00b6 406.02, at IV-139 (2d ed. 1988). Also,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">[h]abit or routine practice may be proved by testimony in the form of an opinion or by specific instances of conduct sufficient in number to warrant a finding that the habit existed or that the practice was routine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>Id. </em>The question whether repeated instances rise to the level of habit is \u201csubject to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at IV-140.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">Applying the foregoing precepts, we hold that the trial court did not err in admitting the questioned evidence pursuant to HRE Rule 406. In our view, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the foundation was adequate in allowing testimony of habit, custom, and routine procedure. Moreover, the admitted evidence was relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">Defendant\u2019s claim that the testimony dealt with evidence of prior bad acts precluded by HRE Rule 404(b) is without merit. The trial court excluded most of the testimony concerning the acts of Defendant and other testimony deemed questionable on the basis of whether it actually dealt with habit, custom, or routine procedure. The admitted testimony generally concerned the habit or custom of the testifying police officers regarding the issuance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>traffic tickets and the signing of affidavits, and the routine procedures of TVB clerks in the processing of tickets.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">We find no error in the trial court\u2019s admission of the questioned testimony under HRE Rule 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">Over Defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court instructed the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-9\">A person may be guilty of an offense if it is committed by his own conduct or by the conduct of another person for which he is legally accountable or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-10\">A person is legally accountable for the conduct of another person, when acting with the stale of mind that is sufficient for the commission of the offense, he causes an innocent person to engage in conduct which violates the law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">6/2/89 Transcript at 72. The instruction generally tracks HRS \u00a7\u00a7 702-221(1) and -221(2)(a) (1985).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> During deliberation, the jury inquired whether the instruction applied to all the offenses or only to the Tampering with a Public Record offenses. The court responded that the instruction applied to all counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">Defendant contends that the court erred in giving the instruction since \u201cthere was no evidence that [he] manipulated an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>unwitting accomplice to commit any of the charged offenses[.]\u201d He claims that \u201cnot a single police officer orTVB clerk who actually participated in cancelling the eight traffic citations by means of theTVB affidavit system was \u2018innocent.\u2019\u201d He therefore asserts that the giving of the accomplice liability instruction was \u201centirely unjustified by the evidence.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">In our analysis of the issue, we start with the principle that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AuB\">[i]n determining whether there is evidence that will warrant an instruction, the court does not pass on the weight and sufficiency of the evidence. It is not error to submit an instruction covering a theory advanced by a party if there is any evidence on which to base it, although it might be slight and inconclusive, or opposed to the preponderance of the evidence.:</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">75 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Trial </em>\u00a7 652, at 610;(1974) (footnotes omitted). The question is whether there was any evidence indicating that Defendant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly, caused any innocent person to engage in conduct which resulted in the violation of Fixing Tickets. The record indicates that there was.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">This case is unlike a simple accomplice liability case of A causing a crime by an innocent B. Defendant concedes that, based on the evidence in this case, no ticket was \u201cfixed\u201d until its cancellation was approved by a district judge. After Defendant affixed his shorthand symbol for \u201caffidavit\u201d on the eight traffic tickets, the TVB clerks obtained false affidavits from the police officers who issued the tickets, the DP clerks then logged the information from the citation and affidavit into the computers, and finally, relying on the computer printouts, the district judges approved the cancellation of the eight tickets. Thus, there were intermediate actors between Defendant and the district judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">In our view, if the evidence supported the fact that any one of the TVB clerks, the police officers who signed the affidavits, the DP clerks, and the district judges was \u201cinnocent,\u201d the giving of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>\u201cinnocent\u201d accomplice liability instruction was not error. The evidence indicated, as Defendant claims, that the TVB clerks and police officers were not \u201c\u2018innocent\u2019 to the improprieties of the system.\u201d However, the evidence indicated that the DP clerks and the district judges were \u201cinnocent\u201d persons within the meaning of the accomplice liability instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">At oral argument, Defendant\u2019s counsel argued that the district judge\u2019s conduct could not serve as a basis for. the giving of the instruction because the judge did not engage in any \u201cconduct which violates the law.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">HRS \u00a7 702-221 (2)(a) deals, in part, with the problem of an innocent agent where a crime is committed. The statute \u201ccouples the state of mind of the defendant with the conduct he has caused another to perform and determines the defendant\u2019s liability accordingly.\u201d Commentary to HRS \u00a7702-221. Under the statute, \u201c[t]he defendant need not satisfy the objective elements of the substantive offenses; the point of the provision is to hold him legally accountable when he engages in conduct that causes an innocent ... person to satisfy the objective requirements.\u201d Robinson &amp; Grail, <em>Element Analysis in Defining Criminal Liability: The Model Penal Code and Beyond, </em>35 Stan. L. Rev. 681,733 (1983). Thus, under HRS \u00a7 702-22l(2)(a), the innocent person merely engages in an overt behavior constituting an element of the offense and does not legally commit the offense itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">The instruction given did not exactly follow the language of HRS \u00a7 702-221 (2)(a). Instead of stating \u201che causes an innocent person to engage in such conduct,\u201d the instruction stated \u201che causes an innocent person to engage in conduct which violates the law.\u201d However, we do not deem the deviation in language to be fatal. Since a person cannot be innocent and be engaging in criminal conduct at the same time, the instruction logically meant \u201che causes an innocent person to engage in conduct which resulted in a violation of the law.\u201d The jurors were not misled by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>instruction. The jury could have found that Defendant caused the \u201cinnocent\u201d district judges to approve the cancellation of the traffic tickets which resulted in violations of the Fixing Tickets law.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Accordingly, we conclude that Defendant was not prejudiced by the jury instruction in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">F.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">Finally, Defendant contends that the trial court erred in imposing a sentence of dismissing him from his job as Deputy Administrator of the courts. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">With respect to penalties, HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-10\">Any person who violates this subsection shall be fined not more than $1,000, or imprisoned for not more than one year, or both. Any governmental official or employee of this State or any county who violates any of the provisions hereof shall be summarily discharged from the official\u2019s or employee\u2019s office or employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">Defendant claims that HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) does not specifically authorize a sentencing court to discharge a government employee from his job. He therefore argues that, as a civil service employee, Defendant may be discharged only pursuant to the civil service laws or, alternatively, that under the principle of separation of powers, he may be summarily discharged by the Chief Justice pursuant to his \u201cexecutive\u201d powers. Our short answer is that summary discharge from employment is a penally mandated by HRS \u00a7 286-138(a), and the circuit courts are empowered to impose any penalty mandated by statute. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 603-21.5(2) (1985).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Also, with respect to a conflict between the Hawaii civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>service laws and HRS \u00a7 286-138(a), this court has stated that \u201c[w]here a plainly irreconcilable conflict exists between a law of general application and law of specific application concerning the same subject matter, the specific authority will be favored.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Greyson, </em>70 Haw. 227, 235, 768 P.2d 759, 763-64 (1989). <em>Accord State v. Spencer, </em>68 Haw. 622, 624, 725 P.2d 799, 800 (1986). Here, HRS \u00a7 286-138(a), the law of specific application, is the favored authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">Defendant also challenges the penalty in question on the ground that HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) is void for vagueness or over-breadth in violation of the due process clause. We find no constitutional infirmity.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">This court has stated that a penal statute should define the offense created with sufficient certainty to convey to a person of ordinary intelligence an adequate description of the evil intended to be prohibited.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Albano, </em>67 Haw. 398, 402, 688 P.2d 1152, 1155-56 (1984) (quoting <em>Territory </em>v. <em>Tam, </em>36 Haw. 32, 37 (1942)). HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) clearly states that the \u201cfixing,\u201d \u201cvoiding,\u201d changing, modifying, adjusting, tampering with, or disposing of in some other way, any traffic citation, notice, or summons by any person, other than by a judge in the exercise of his judicial function, will constitute an offense. In our view, the statute conveys \u201cto a person of ordinary intelligence an adequate description of the evil intended to be prohibited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Defendant also argues that HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) is facially \u201cbroad enough to encompass the \u2018disposal\u2019 of a traffic citation by a custodian or janitor without any criminal intent,\u201d thereby resulting in his being summarily discharged from his job. Defendant\u2019s fear is unwarranted. HRS \u00a7 286-138(a) must be read together with HRS \u00a7 702-204 (1985) which requires the State to prove that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>custodian or janitor acted \u201cintentionally, knowingly, or recklessly\u201d with respect to each element of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">Accordingly, the trial court did not err in summarily dismissing Defendant from his government job as a part of the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">III. THE STATE\u2019S CROSS-APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">At oral argument, the State\u2019s counsel made the following statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-9\">The State\u2019s purpose of the cross-appeal is just to preserve the issues in the event of a reversal and a remand, and that\u2019s the purpose of this. The matters of course would be moot if the convictions were: affirmed, and the State has already told the trial court it has no interest in retrying the mistrial counts which now are stayed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">In the disposition of Defendant\u2019s appeal, we are affirming the convictions of the Fixing Tickets counts and reversing the Tampering with a Public Record and Unsworn Falsification to Authorities counts. Nothing is being remanded for iretrial. Consequently, based on the State\u2019s representation, the issues raised in its cross-appeal are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b480-12\">The convictions of one count of Tampering with a Public Record and six counts of Unsworn Falsification to Authorities are reversed. The convictions of six counts of Fixing Tickets are affirmed. The State\u2019s cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AVa\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Michael A. Weight </em>and <em>Rodney M.
