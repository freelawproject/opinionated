Lincoln appeals from his new conviction of murder in violation of Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7\u00a7 707-701, 702-221, and 702-222.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Lincoln alleges numerous points of error in his appeal. We need to address only one, which is whether the trial court committed reversible error when it admitted into evidence the former testimony given in Lincoln\u2019s first trial by the trigger man in the shooting, Anthony Kekona, Jr., after the trial court found that Kekona was unavailable as a witness under Hawaii Rules of Evidence (HRE) 804 when Kekona refused to testify. Because we find that Kekona\u2019s former testimony lacked the necessary indicia of reliability and because Lincoln\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Hawaii Constitution have been violated, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">On May 4,1978, Anthony Kekona, Jr. and Patrick Hawkins went to the Kaleialoha Condominium in Honokowai, Maui, where Kekona shot and killed Paul Warford and David Blue and shot Harriet Savage in the head wounding her severely. Hawkins, who had provided the gun Kekona used, was arrested almost immediately. Kekona was arrested several days later on Oahu.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">Kekona pled guilty on two counts of murder and one count of attempted murder for which he was sentenced, respectively, to life imprisonment with possibility of parole and 20 years in prison. Hawkins pled guilty to three counts of attempted robbery for which he received five years probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">The day after his sentencing in July 1979, Kekona told Ms uncle, Robert Cordero, a Maui police detective, that he had been hired by John Kalani Lincoln to kill Warford, Blue and Savage.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Thereafter Lincoln was indicted by the Grand Jury on two counts of \u201cmurder for hire\u201d and one count of attempted murder. Both Hawkins and Kekona testified on behalf of the State against Lincoln. These testimonies were read to the jury in Lincoln\u2019s retrial and are the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">On April 12,1980, a jury found Lincoln guilty of the two murders and attempted murder. The jury did not find Lincoln guilty of \u201cmurder for hire.\u201d He was sentenced to life with parole and twenty years in prison respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">In late 1982, Anthony Kekona, in a sworn affidavit which stated that Lincoln had no connection with the shootings and that Kekona\u2019s only connection with Lincoln involved marijuana transactions, recanted his testimony given at Lincoln\u2019s trial. When a hearing was held on this recantation, Kekona recanted his recantation and claimed he only wanted a free trip back to Hawaii from prison on the mainland to see his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">After the 1987 reversal of Lincoln\u2019s conviction by the Federal District Court, the State decided to retry Lincoln.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Eventually, a new jury trial was held commencing January 17, 1989. Kekona refused to testify for the State. Kekona demanded new concessions from the State for further testimony and also claimed his privilege against self-incrimination after not being offered immunity. Hawkins was unavailable to testify for the State since his probation had expired and he had moved to the mainland. The State did try to produce Hawkins through the Uniform Act to Secure Attendance of Witness from Without the State in Criminal Proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>The former testimony of Kekona was read to the jury. The jury was advised of his retraction and his retraction of his retraction. The court allowed the former testimony under HRE 804(a)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Likewise, the court allowed the former testimony of Hawkins under HRE 804(a)(5) but in this appeal we need not address that aspect of the court\u2019s ruling. Lincoln objected very strenuously to the admission of the former testimony of Kekona, citing the fact that Kekona\u2019s behavior in the intervening years had been such as to cast serious doubts on the reliability of his former testimony. Lincoln argues that Kekona\u2019s action subsequent to his prior testimony rendered the prior cross-examination of him inadequate to support the admission of the prior testimony, and Lincoln was deprived of his right of confrontation. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">We have previously held that the erroneous admission of evidence may constitute plain error if a fair trial was thereby impaired or if that evidence resulted in substantial prejudice to the Defendant. <em>State </em>v. Cummings, 49 Haw. 522, 528, 423 P.2d 438, 442 (1967). We must also determine whether the admission of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>evidence was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in order to decide the question of whether or not the admission of former testimony under a hearsay exception to the Hawaii Rules of Evidence violated Lincoln\u2019s constitutional right to confront his accuser. <em>State </em>v. <em>Pookini, </em>57 Haw. 26, 548 P.2d 1402 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">In the present case, the trial court found that both Kekona and Hawkins were unavailable and admitted their former testimony from the first trial which was read to the jury even though the State was not able to assure the trial court that Kekona\u2019s testimony at the second trial would have been substantially similar to that in the first if he did choose to testify a second time. Kekona\u2019s recantation and recantation of the recantation were also made known to the jury but, of course, Lincoln\u2019s counsel was unable to cross-examine him on these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">Generally, former testimony is admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule. Since it was adduced under oath and the opposing party had the opportunity for lull cross-examination, former testimony is thought to be reliable and acceptable when the declarant is unavailable. <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 100 S. Ct. 2531, 65 L. Ed. 2d 597 (1980) (reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception); <em>State v. White, </em>65 Haw. 286, 651 P.2d 470 (1982). Criminal defendants have a basic constitutional right to confront their accusers under both the Hawaii and- United States Constitutions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under HRE 804(b)(1), the proponent of former testimony must establish that the witness is unavailable and that his unavailability has not been procured by the party seeking to use his former testimony <em>and </em>that the opposing party had a sufficient reason, motive, and opportunity to cross-examine the witness at the former hearing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Former testimony is thus admissible and does not violate the Confrontation Clause if this test is met. <em>Roberts, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">Hawaii case law also allows the admission of former testimony, if the witness is unavailable. Generally, the introduction of prior testimony does not violate the Confrontation Clause if there is sufficient proof of the unavailability of the witness. <em>State v. Kim, </em>55 Haw. 346, 519 P.2d 1241 (1974). Such testimony is admissible if the witness was under oath, the defendant and his attorney were present and had an opportunity to cross-examine the witness, the proceedings were before a judicial tribunal which recorded them properly, and the State was unable to procure the attendance of the witness after diligent efforts. <em>State v. Faafiti, </em>54 Haw. 637, 513 P.2d 697 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">We find that here Kekona\u2019s former testimony lacks reliability. Kekona retracted his testimony under oath, retracted his retraction, and finally refused to testify at trial. His motives are unclear but may have included, among other things, a desire to receive a free trip back to Hawaii from his mainland prison as well as an attempt to strike a better deal with the State. We also find that the prior cross-examination of Kekona was rendered inadequate by subsequent events.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">There is a federal case which is analogous. In <em>United States v. Barlow, </em>693 F.2d 954 (6th Cir. 1982), the court set out a test for determining the reliability of former testimony given before a grand jury which was sought to be admitted under Federal Rules of Evidence 804(b)(5) (same as HRE 804(b)(6)).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Although there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>was no cross-examination before the grand jury, the testimony was given under oath.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b304-6\">[9] Second the trial court must determine whether the substance of the grand jury testimony possesses \u201ccircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d equivalent to the other exceptions included in Rule 804. In making this determination the trial court should consider the <em>declarant\u2019s relationship with both the defendant and the government, the declarant\u2019s motivation to testify </em>before the grand jury, the extent to which the testimony reflects the declarant\u2019s personal knowledge, <em>whether the declarant has ever recanted the testimony, and the existence of corroborating evidence available for cross-examination. </em>(Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b304-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">We hold that the mechanistic application of the hearsay exceptions is inappropriate. <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 93 S. Ct. 1038, 35 L. Ed. 2d 297 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">The evidence against Lincoln is flimsy without the critical testimony of Kekona. Kekona\u2019s testimony was critical to the extent that we feel that, upon review of the record, its admission was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. To allow the former testimony which lacks the indicia of reliability usually associated with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>sworn testimony to be admitted in lieu of Kekona\u2019s live appearance violates Lincoln\u2019s constitutional right to confront his accuser as to subsequent events which have rendered Kekona\u2019s testimony unreliable.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"APk\"><em>Eric A.
