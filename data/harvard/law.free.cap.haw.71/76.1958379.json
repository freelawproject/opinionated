A dispute arose between the parties regarding the construction of the wall and driveway. Pursuant to the construction contract, the dispute was submitted to arbitration. While the arbitration process was proceeding, the parties nevertheless were attempting to settle the dispute. Because the parties believed that a settlement agreement was imminent, they agreed that no arbitration award would be rendered until after 3:00 p.m. on October 21, 1988. The arbitrator\u2019s decision was released on November 1, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Clawson filed a motion in the circuit court to vacate the arbitrator\u2019s award. According to Clawson, the panics had reached a binding settlement agreement prior to the release of the arbitrator\u2019s award. Habilitat, Inc. responded by filing a motion to confirm the arbitration award.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-7\">The circuit court confirmed the arbitration award. Clawson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">We vacate the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">\u201c[J]udicial review of an arbitration award is confined to the \u2018strictest possible limits\u2019 and an arbitration award cannot be vacated unless it falls within the scope of [Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 658-9 (1985)].\u201d <em>Gadd v. Kelley, </em>66 Haw. 431, 441, 667 P.2d 251, 258 (1983).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>Clawson contends that the arbitrator exceeded his powers in this case, therefore, the award must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">The scope of an arbitrator\u2019s authority is determined by agreement of the parties. An arbitrator must act within the scope of the authority conferred upon him by the parties and cannot exceed his power by deciding matters not submitted. <em>Brennan </em>v. <em>Stewarts\u2019 Pharmacies, Ltd., </em>59 Haw. 207, 579 P.2d 673 (1978); <em>Totem Marine Tug &amp; Barge, Inc. v.

App. 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">As with other contractual agreements, the parties may modify the agreement defining the scope of the arbitrator's powers and authority. <em>Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse, Inc. </em>v. <em>Piggly Wiggly Operators\u2019 Warehouse Indep. Truck Drivers Union, Local No. 1, </em>611 F.2d 580, 584 (5th Cir. 1980); <em>Schlaifer v. Sedlow, </em>51 N.Y.2d 181, 185, 433 N.Y.S.2d 67, 69-70, 412 N.E.2d 1294, 1296 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>In this case the parties originally agreed to submit Clawson\u2019s claims and Habililat\u2019s counterclaims to arbitration. However, the agreement was later modified in that the arbitration of their respective claims would be retracted if the parties reached a settlement agreement by 3:00 p.m. on October 21, 1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">The question is whether a settlement agreement, in fact, had been reached by the parties prior to 3:00 p.m. of October 21,1988.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">The circuit court has the duty to initially determine whether an arbitration award should be vacated on any of the grounds set forth in HRS \u00a7 658-9. Although Rule 52 of the Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure (HRCP) intimates that findings of fact and conclusions of law are not necessary on a motion to vacate an arbitration award,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> findings of fact and conclusions of law on motions to vacate arbitration awards should be entered by circuit courts when appropriate. See <em>Gadd </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>66 Haw. 431, 667 P.2d 251 (1983), and <em>Brennan v. Stewarts\u2019 Pharmacies, Ltd., </em>59 Haw. 207, 579 P.2d 673 (1978), where findings of fact and conclusions oflaw were entered by the circuit courts on motions to vacate arbitration awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Here, without proper findings of fact and conclusions of law, we are unable to determine whether the circuit court erred in denying appellant\u2019s motion to vacate the arbitration award. Wc hold that whenever material facts arc in dispute in determining whether an arbitration award should be vacated, the circuit court should conduct an evidentiary hearing and render findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>conclusions of law in support of granting or denying the motion to vacate the arbitration award.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ap0\"><em>Andrew Scott Winer </em>(Carlsmilh, Wichman, Case, Mukai and Ichiki) on the brief for Petitioner-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A2M\"><em>Thomas Grande (Stanley E. Levin </em>with him on the brief of Davis &amp; Levin) for Respondent-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">This case is remanded to the circuit court for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law to determine whether the parties had reached a settlement agreement prior to 3:00 p.m. on October 21, 1988, thereby divesting the arbitrator of power and authority to render an award.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">The order confirming the arbitration award is vacated and this case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-11\">HRS \u00a7 658-9 (1985) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">Vacating award.
