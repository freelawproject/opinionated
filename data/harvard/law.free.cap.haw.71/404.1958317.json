Sharpies claims in her suit that psychiatrist Dr. William F. McCook, a State employee, had sex with her while she was McCook\u2019s patient, and that the State is liable under a theory of respondeat superior for injuries caused to her by reason of the sex. We agree with the court below that summary judgment is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-11\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the standard to be applied by the appellate court is identical to that employed by the trial court; the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts alleged in the materials (such as depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions and affidavits) considered by the court in making its determination must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>First Hawaiian Bank, </em>61 Haw. 346, 349, 604 P.2d 39, 41 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The facts as presented by Appellant Sharpies, the party opposing the motion, are as follows. Sharpies sought psychiatric care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>with the State\u2019s Maui Psychiatric Clinic in the summer of 1983. At that time, McCook was an employee of the State, and had been since 1982. A psychiatrist-patient relationship was established between McCook and Sharpies. During the parties\u2019 professional relationship, at McCook\u2019s residence, Sharpies was induced by McCook to engage in sexual relations with him. McCook thought that sexual relations with Sharpies was in furtherance of therapy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Immediately after this sexual encounter, McCook severed all relationships with Sharpies. Sharpies was caused additional psychiatric harm by McCook\u2019s swift entry in an affair and abrupt termination of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Sharpies argues that material factual disputes include: (1) whether the conduct of McCook was foreseeable by the State or necessarily in the furtherance of the State\u2019s business or interest; (2) whether the tortious conduct of McCook, was part of his professional care [therapy] for Sharpies; and (3) whether the conduct of McCook was ratified by the State by not recording McCook\u2019s conduct in Sharpies\u2019 medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">We reject Sharpies\u2019 argument that factual issues preclude summary judgment. The State is not vicariously liable for the harm caused by Dr. McCook. For the State to be liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior, McCook\u2019s acts must have been within the scope of his employment. We hold McCook\u2019s behavior, was as a matter of law, not within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">The most closely analogous case brought to the attention of this court, <em>Cosgrove </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>215 N.J. Super. 561, 522 A.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>483 (App. Div. 1987), held that summary judgment was appropriate. In <em>Cosgrove </em>a social worker therapist employed by the County of Somerset and the Richard Hall Community Mental Health Center, both public entities, engaged in sexual relations with a patient. As is reported in the lower court\u2019s opinion, the therapist characterized his actions as being in pursuit of his employer\u2019s ends. <em>See Cosgrove </em>v. <em>Lawrence, </em>214 N.J. Super. 670, 674, 520 A.2d 844, 846 (Law Div. 1986). The appellate court agreed with the lower court that, as a matter of law, such conduct is not within the scope of employment so as to subject the employer to respondeat superior liability. We adopt the rule of law put forth by the New Jersey Superior Court in <em>Cosgrove.</em></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApHf\"><em>Peter Cahill (James Krueger </em>and <em>Timothy P. McNulty </em>on the briefs) for Appellant Sharpies.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AV9\"><em>Gale L. F. Ching (Laurence K. Lau </em>with him on the brief), Deputy Attorneys General, for Appellee State of Hawaii.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">We also reject Sharpies\u2019 argument that she can recover under a ratification theory. The employer\u2019s liability under a ratification theory requires that the act complained of be done on behalf of or under the authority of the employer, and there must be clear evidence of the employer\u2019s approval of the wrongful conduct. <em>Costa </em>v. <em>Able Distribs., Inc., </em>3 Haw. App. 486, 490, 653 P.2d 101, 105 (1982). Nothing in the record tends to show employer ratification of McCook\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-8\">Thus, the summary judgment was correctly granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-9\">This inference is supported by the fact that in his deposition, Dr. Licht, a colleague of McCook at the Maui clinic, reported that McCook had \u201crationalized that it [having had sexual intercourse with Sharpies] was therapeutic, that it was part of his therapy with her[.]\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
