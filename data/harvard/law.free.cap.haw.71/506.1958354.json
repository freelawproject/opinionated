Myers </em>[published as <em>SGM Partners v. The Profit Co.], </em>8 Haw. App. 86,_P.2d_(1990). Based on the reasons set forth below, we reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">The pertinent facts for purposes of this opinion arc as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">In May 1983, SGM Partners (SGM), the original owner and lessor of the subject property, entered into a lease with The Profit Co., Ltd. (Profit) for certain commercial space located at 1680 Kapiolani Boulevard, with the lease guaranteeing the use of a certain number of parking stalls. Michael Myers (Myers), one of the SGM partners, had negotiated the lease' on behalf of SGM.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">A month later, in June 1983, Ben Gromet\u2019s (Gromct) and Myers\u2019 respective partnership interests in SGM were purchased by two other SGM partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-16\">Meanwhile, from the opening of Profit\u2019s business in December 1983, SGM failed to provide Profit with the number of parking stalls as agreed upon in the lease. Consequently, Profit began to withhold rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>By letter dated June 3, 1985, a settlement agreement was memorialized between SGM and Profit over the number of parking stalls and withheld rent issues. Soon thereafter, however, SGM failed to furnish Profit with the newly agreed upon number of parking stalls, and Profit refused to comply with the terms of the settlement agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">In May 1985, SGM and Maher Azer (Azer), who eventually succeeded SGM as the owner-lessor, filed suit against several defendants, including: 1) Gromet; and 2) the brokers SGM utilized in this leasehold transaction (Brokers). Later, in April 1986, Azer, as successor in interest to SGM, filed an amended complaint alleging, <em>inter </em>alia: 1) negligence and offset claims against Gromet; and 2) breach of fiduciary duty and negligence claims against Brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">The case proceeded to a consolidated trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">During the trial, Gromet moved for directed verdicts on all of Azer\u2019s claims against him. The trial court subsequently granted Gromet\u2019s motion, including Gromet\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on Azer\u2019s negligence and offset claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">After the jury returned its special verdict, judgment was entered accordingly. Included in the judgment was the entry of judgment in Azer\u2019s favor and against Brokers, based on the jury\u2019s findings of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty on Brokers\u2019 part.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The trial court subsequently denied Azer\u2019s motion to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs from Brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">On appeal, the ICA vacated: 1) the entry of directed verdict in Gromet\u2019s favor on Azer\u2019s negligence and offset claims; and 2) the denial of Azer\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees and costs from Brokers. The ICA then remanded for, <em>inter </em>alia: 1) a retrial of Azer\u2019s negligence and offset claims against Gromet; and 2) a determination of attorney\u2019s fees and costs recoverable from Brokers by Azer. In all other respects, the ICA affirmed the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>Upon applications to this court, we granted certiorari to two of the parties in order to address two issues we believe are worthy of discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">We now proceed to examine these two respective issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">DIRECTED VERDICT</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Gromet, a former partner, contends the ICA erred in vacating the directed verdict in his favor on Azer\u2019s negligence and offset claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">On a motion for a directed verdict, the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Shannon </em>v. <em>Waterhouse, </em>58 Haw. 4, 563 P.2d 391 (1977) (per curiam), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 911, <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>441 U.S. 917 (1979). And where a jury could reasonably infer that the plaintiff\u2019s claim is sustainable, the motion should be denied. <em>Id. </em>Conversely, where the evidence is insufficient to submit the case to the jury, the trial court should grant the motion for a directed verdict. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">We begin by addressing the negligence claim, followed by the offset claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-13\">Negligence Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b534-14\">In his amended complaint, Azer alleged that Gromet acted negligently in misallocating the available number of parking stalls. At trial, the trial court subsequently granted a directed verdict in Gromet\u2019s favor on the negligence claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-15\">On appeal, the ICA vacated the trial court\u2019s order on this issue. In its ruling, the ICA essentially relied on Myers\u2019 testimony to the effect that \u201cGromet had a small part in negotiating the Profit [l]ease.\u201d <em>Azer </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>8 Haw. App. at 117,_P.2d at_. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Given this evidence, the ICA reasoned that a jury could reasonably find that Gromet was negligent in negotiating a lease which contained parking provisions that were in conflict with the parking provisions of an existing lease with a neighboring tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">We disagree. The inference drawn from Myers\u2019 pertinent testimony by the ICA, we believe, is not a reasonable one. The lease, as originally executed in May 1983, is a lengthy and detailed document which contains many provisions in addition to the one page parking provisions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In our view, just because Gromet had played a small part in negotiating the lease does not therefore lead to the reasonable inference that Gromet was negligent in misallocating the available number of parking stalls. No evidence was presented as to the subject-matter of Gromet\u2019s participation in the lease negotiations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Contrary to the ICA, we hold that the evidence adduced was insufficient to withstand a motion for directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Offset Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">As for Azer\u2019s offset claim against Gromet, the ICA opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMp\">In view of the possibility that Azer might recover some damages on his negligence claim, it was error to grant a directed verdict on his offset claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>Azer </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>8 Haw. App. at 117,_P.2d at_.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">In view of our ruling upholding the dismissal of Azer\u2019s negligence claim against Gromet, we hold that the trial court\u2019s dismissal of Azer\u2019s offset claim against Gromet was likewise proper. The ICA\u2019s contrary ruling on the offset claim issue was thus in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES AND COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">The trial court denied Azer\u2019s motion to recover attorney\u2019s fees and costs from Brokers.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">On appeal, the ICA vacated the trial court\u2019s order denying attorney\u2019s fees and costs to Azer. The ICA ruled that Azer\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty claim against Brokers constituted an action on the listing agreement between SGM and Brokers, and thus, Azer was entitled to attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 607-17.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">Brokers contend that HRS \u00a7 607-17 does not apply because: 1) the listing agreement obligates Brokers to diligently pursue the procurement of a tenant; 2) the listing agreement authorizes reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party where the lessor or broker commences litigation to enforce the tends of the listing agreement; and 3) Azer\u2019s claims against Brokers did not concern the enforcement of the terms of the listing agreement, i.e., that Brokers had failed to diligently pursue the procurement of a tenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-12\">We agree with Brokers\u2019 position.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-13\">HRS \u00a7 607-17 authorizes the awarding of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees when provided for in a written contract. The listing agreement, in turn, authorizes the awarding of reasonable attorney\u2019s fees to the prevailing party where the lessor or broker commences litigation to enforce the terms of the listing agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-14\">The enforcement of the listing agreement was not at issue in this case. In his amended complaint against Brokers, Azer did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>seek to enforce the terms of the listing agreement. Hence, the jury\u2019s breach of fiduciary duty finding on Brokers\u2019 part was independent of any non-existent claim to enforce the listing agreement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-M\"><em>James J. Bickerton </em>(Bickerton, Ramos-Saunders &amp; Dang, of counsel), on the writ and brief, for Petitioners/Respondents Ben Gromet, et al.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AZBu\"><em>William Meheula, </em>and <em>Nadine Y. Ando </em>(McCorriston, Miho &amp; Miller, of counsel), on the writ and brief, for Petitioners-Respondents Michael S. Myers, et al.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ABN\"><em>Jeffrey S. Portnoy, Stephen B. MacDonald, </em>and <em>Susan Oki Mollway </em>(Cades, Schutte, Fleming &amp; Wright, of counsel), on the briefs, for Respondents SGM Partners, et al.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Accordingly, we hold that the ICA\u2019s ruling vacating the trial court\u2019s denial of attorney\u2019s fees to Azer by Brokers was in error. We view the costs issue as a separate matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Azer, as the prevailing party against Brokers, was entitled to reimbursement for costs. <em>See </em>HRS \u00a7 607-9; Hawaii Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule 54(d). Hence, we affirm the ICA\u2019s ruling; 1) vacating the trial court\u2019s denial of costs to Azer by Brokers; and 2) remanding for the awarding of reasonable costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b537-11\">Based on the foregoing reasons, we reverse the ICA\u2019s vacation of the trial court\u2019s order; 1) granting directed verdict in Gromet\u2019s favor on Azer\u2019s negligence and offset claims; and 2) denying Azer\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees from Brokers. In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">Reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b535-10\"> Although Myers and Gromet both signed the lease on behalf of SGM, the ICA noted that: 1) none of the parties could execute any lease without the written consent of the other partners; 2) Gromet did not sign the lease as a managing partner; 3) Gromet signed the lease at the requestofanotherparlner; and 4)at the time Gromet signed the lease, two other partners had orally agreed to purchase Gromet\u2019s partnership interest in SGM. <em>See Azer </em>v. <em>Myers, </em>8 Haw. App. at 117-18 &amp; n.27,_P.2d at_&amp; n.27.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b535-12\">We note that Gromet testified that he played no part in negotiating the lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION OF</p>\n<author id=\"Am7\">LEVINSON, CIRCUIT JUDGE</author>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">I agree, for the reasons staled by the majority, that the evidence adduced by Azer on his negligence and offset claims against Gromet was insufficient to withstand a motion for a directed verdict; I therefore join in the reversal of the ICA\u2019s vacation of the trial court\u2019s order granting the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">I believe, however, that the majority\u2019s focus on the \u201cniceties of pleading\u201d with respect to the listing agreement between Brokers and the \u201cOwner\u201d (i.e., Azer, for purposes of this appeal) ignores \u201cthe underlying realities\u201d of that contract. <em>See Higa </em>v. <em>Mirikitani, </em>55 Haw. 167, 171-72, 517 P.2d 1, 4 (1973). I would affirm the ICA\u2019s reversal of the trial court\u2019s denial of Azer\u2019s request for attorney\u2019s fees from Brokers and would remand for a determination, not only of costs, but also of attorney\u2019s fees recoverable from Brokers by Azer. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from that part of the opinion of the court reversing the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">I. GIVEN THEIR CONTRACTUAL DUTY OF DILIGENCE, BROKERS, THROUGH MYERS, BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTY TO AZER IN MISALLOCATING AVAILABLE PARKING SPACE AS A PART OF THEIR NEGOTIATION OF THE PROFIT LEASE, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO AZER.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">By virtue of the judgment entered in Azer\u2019s favor and against Brokers based on the jury\u2019s findings of the latters\u2019 breach of fiduci- . ary duty, Azer proved, <em>inter </em>alia, the following facts at trial:</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>(1) SGM Partners (which, for present purposes, will be referred to as Azer) and Brokers executed an Exclusive Authorization of Lease (listing agreement), pursuant to which Azer granted to Brokers the exclusive right to negotiate a lease or leases for space in the property not already listed;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">(2) The listing agreement, by its express terms, obligated Brokers <em>\u201cdiligently </em>to pursue the procurement of a tenant\u201d in consideration for a commission. (Emphasis added). The listing agreement also provided that \u201cif either [Azer] or Broker[s] commences any litigation to enforce the terms of this [agreement], the prevailing party shall be entitled to receive a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the other party[;]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">(3). Myers was a real estate agent employed by Brokers;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">(4) Myers, as an agent of Brokers, was bound by the terms of the listing agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">(5) Myers, as an agent of Brokers and on behalf of Azer, negotiated a lease of space (Profit lease) in the property with Profit;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">(6) The terms of the Profit lease were prepared by Myers, who had substantial control over the lease transaction;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">(7) The Profit lease guaranteed to Profit a specified minimum amount of parking space incident to Profit\u2019s authorized use of the property;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">(8) Azer paid Brokers a substantial commission for procuring the Profit lease pursuant to the listing agreement;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">(9) Brokers, through Myers, owed Azer a fiduciary duty in obtaining a lessee and negotiating the Profit lease;</p>\n<p id=\"b539-13\">(10) Brokers, through Myers, breached their fiduciary duty to Azer, in the course of negotiating the Profit lease, by misallocating the property\u2019s available parking space; and</p>\n<p id=\"b539-14\">(11) As a result of Brokers\u2019 breach of fiduciary duly, Azer sustained damage, for which he was entitled to, and the jury awarded, compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>II. AZER IS ENTITLED TO AN AWARD OF A REASONABLE ATTORNEY\u2019S FEE FROM BROKERS PURSUANT TO HRS \u00a7 607-17, INASMUCH AS BROKERS\u2019 BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY DERIVED FROM A BREACH OF THEIR CONTRACTUAL DUTY OF DILIGENCE IMPOSED IN THE LISTING AGREEMENT.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">When they entered into the listing agreement, Brokers agreed that if either party to the contract commenced \u201cany litigation to enforce the terms\u201d of the agreement, \u201cthe prevailing party shall be entitled to receive a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from the other party ....\u201d As the majority recognizes, HRS \u00a7 607-17 authorizes the awarding of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee when provided for in a written contract. Moreover, this court has recognized for almost seventeen years that \u201cin reality, a claim of injury resulting from ... professional incompetence ... is actionable under theories which are an amalgam of both tort and contract.\u201d <em>Higa </em>v. <em>Mirikitani, </em>55 Haw. at 172, 517 P.2d at 5. Accordingly, the answer to the question whether the damage award to Azer, based on his breach of fiduciary duty claim against Brokers,:arises out of \u201cany litigation to enforce the terms\u201d of the listing agreement determines whether Azeris entitled to recover a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from Brokers in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-5\">In my view, the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201c[t]he enforcement of the listing agreement was not at issue in this case,\u201d <em>SGM Partners v. The Profit Co., </em>71 Haw. 506, 512, _P.2d_,_ (1990), is unduly facile. Specifically, it ignores the inescapable fact that, in finding in favor of Azer on his breach of fiduciary duty claim against Brokers, the jury must <em>of necessity </em>have found as a fact that Brokers breached their express, written, contractual duty \u201cdiligently to pursue the procurement of a tenant\u201d by misrepresenting, in their negotiations with Profit, the amount of allocable parking space available on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>None of the parties to this case disputes that the listing agreement created a fiduciary relationship between Brokers and Azer. Transcript of 7/13/87, at 38-39. It should therefore go without saying that actions for breach of fiduciary duty sound in contract. <em>Bibo v. Jeffrey\u2019s Restaurant, </em>770 P.2d 290, 296 (Alaska 1989); Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 400, and 401 comment a, introductory note to ch. 13; <em>see also Higa v. Mirikitani, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Moreover, the parties do not dispute that, as a fiduciary, Brokers owed Azer an \u201cobligation of the <em>utmost </em>faith, integrity honesty, and loyalty in connection with\u201d Brokers\u2019 performance of their duties pursuant to the listing agreement. (Emphasis added). Transcript of 7/13/87, at 34. Indeed, the duty of diligence that Brokers\u2019 voluntarily undertook is the quintessential expression of that obligation. Such \u201cutmost\u201d or \u201cextraordinary\u201d diligence has been defined as \u201c[t]hat extreme measure of care and caution which persons of unusual prudence and circumspection use for securing and preserving their own property or rights.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>411 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">It therefore ineluctably follows that when a duty, fiduciary or otherwise, arises out of a contract, a breach of that duty is a breach of the contract. <em>See generally Schulz </em>v. <em>Honsador, Inc., </em>67 Haw. 433, 437, 690 P.2d 279, 282 (1984); <em>Au v. Au, </em>63 Haw. 210, 219, 626 P.2d 173, 180 (1981); <em>Higa </em>v. <em>Mirikitani, supra; see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 400 and 401 comment a, introductory note to ch. 13, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Brokers\u2019 suggestion that although \u201cAzer\u2019s breach of fiduciary claim may be based on the listing agreement,... he [is nevertheless] not seeking] enforcement of the agreement,\u201d Brokers\u2019 Supplemental Brief of 5/10/90 at 3, is nothing short of disingenuous. In effect, Brokers are arguing that as long as they <em>in fact </em>produced a tenant for Azer pursuant to the listing agreement, they <em>could not possibly </em>have breached their fiduciary obligation of diligent pursuit. It is inconceivable to me that if, in the manner of Don Vito <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>Corleone, Brokers had procured Profit as a tenant by assuring its representatives that Brokers would have their brains or their signatures on the Profit lease, or if Brokers had <em>intentionally </em>misrepresented the true amount of allocable parking space available, anyone would deny that Brokers had breached their fiduciary duty of diligent pursuit. Brokers\u2019 breach under the circumstances of this case compels no different conclusion. By agreeing diligently to pursue a tenant for Azer, Brokers contractually bound themselves to a standard of care. Brokers\u2019 failure to perform according to that standard caused Azer\u2019s damages. If that is not a breach of contract, then nothing is.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Azer is entitled by HRS \u00a7 607-17 to an award of a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee from Brokers.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
