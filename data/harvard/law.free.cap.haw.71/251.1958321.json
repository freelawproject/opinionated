Appellant was on a prison furlough and did not return at the expiration thereof. She was caught four days later. She was indicted under HRS \u00a7 710-1021. The indictment reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>On or about the 22d day of August, 1987, in the City and County of Honolulu, State of Hawaii, LYNETTE LEHUA KEALOHA did intentionally escape from a correctional or detention facility, to wit, Women\u2019s Community Correctional Center, thereby committing the offense of Escape in the Second Degree in violation of Section 710-1021 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">Appellant argues that while she may not have returned to the facility, she did not escape therefrom, and that her failure to return, while it may have been an escape from custody, is not what is alleged in the indictment. In addition, she attacks three jury instructions but, in essence, they raise the same point. She contends that there was insufficient evidence to convict her. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">A similar contention was made in <em>Provisional Government </em>v. <em>Stone, 9 </em>Haw. 363 (1894). This court there said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">He contends that there was no evidence to show that he escaped \u201cagainst the will of the officer having him in custody,\u201d as provided in this section of the statute. We think that there was such evidence. The officer, a prison luna, who had charge of the defendant, a prisoner at work on the road, testified that he allowed the prisoner to go into the bush for a particular purpose, and that he did not return, but escaped. The permission to go for that particular purpose implied an intention on the part of the officer that the prisoner should return. Further, the word \u201cescape\u201d was evidently used by the officer in its usual popular sense, which implies not merely that the prisoner recovered his freedom, but that he did so against the will of the officer in charge.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 363-64. In <em>State v. Okamura, 59 </em>Haw. 549, 584 P.2d 117 (1978), this court stated, albeit by way of dictum:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-8\">We hold that the use of the word \u201cescape\u201d was proper. \u201cEscape\u201d is a word of common currency\u2014 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>common definition of \u201cescape\u201d, according to Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary (unabridged, 1967), is as follows:</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AMu\"><em>Susan Lynn Arnett, </em>Deputy Public Defender, on the opening brief, and <em>Richard W. Pollack, </em>Public Defender, on the reply brief, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJH\"><em>James H.S. Choi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, on the brief for appellee.</attorneys>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\u201cto get away (as by flight or conscious effort), break away, get free, or get clear.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 550, 584 P.2d at 119 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">Obviously appellant was granted a furlough on condition that she return when that furlough expired. When she failed to do so without a legitimate excuse, she was guilty of escape, as that term is used in the statute. Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
