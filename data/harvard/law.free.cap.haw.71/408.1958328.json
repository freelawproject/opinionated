HRS \u00a7 286 \u2014 155(b). If the judge finds the statements to be true, the judge revokes the arrested person\u2019s driver\u2019s license. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Prior to her respective hearing date, defendant Busby filed and served a Request for Admissions on the State pursuant to Rule 36 of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure (DCRCP). The State never responded to the request. The district court denied Busby\u2019s motion to dismiss the case for the Stale\u2019s failure to respond. The court ruled that Rule 36 of the District Court Rules of Civil Procedure was inapplicable and that Rule 33(a) of the Rules of the District Courts of the State of Hawaii (RDC) controlled in cases of refusal to submit to a breath or blood test. Under RDC 33(a), a defendant has no right to request admissions from the Slate. The district court found the statements in the affidavit lo be true and revoked defendant\u2019s license.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-12\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">RDC 1 states that all proceedings shall be divided into four classes: civil, small claims, criminal, and traffic. Here, the case is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>clearly not a small claims case, nor a criminal case, and thus it is either a civil or a traffic case. RDC 33 explicitly applies to <em>traffic </em>cases, whereas DCRCP 36 applies in \u201csuits of a civil nature.\" Sec DCRCP 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In cases of refusal to submit to a breath or blood test, the drivers who are stopped and arrested for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor on a public highway obviously affect traffic safety, and the penalty imposed under HRS \u00a7 286-155, revocation of the driver\u2019s license, is directly related to traffic safety. Furthermore, HRS \u00a7 286-155 is intended to facilitate enforcement of the DUI statute, <em>see State </em>v. <em>Uehara, </em>68 Haw. 512, 721 P.2d 705 (1986), and it is clear that DUI is a traffic offense. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Leatiota, </em>69 Haw. 253, 739 P.2d 930 (1987). The committee report in support of the refusal to submit statute declares that, \u201c[t]he purpose of this bill is to establish a sound and practicable <em>traffic safety </em>program for the State of Hawaii.\u201d Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 23, in 1967 Senate Journal, at 824 (emphasis added). In addition, <em>prosecutors </em>are empowered to try cases of refusal to submit to a breath or blood test, <em>see State v. Winchester, </em>69 Haw. 600, 752 P.2d 105 (1988), a characteristic common to traffic rather than civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">Although we have staled on several occasions that refusal to submit cases are \u201ccivil in nature,\u201d <em>see, e.g., State v. </em>Severino, 56 Haw. 378, 537 P.2d 1187 (1975); <em>State v. Uehara, </em>68 Haw. 512, 721 P.2d 705 (1986); <em>cf. State v. Winchester, </em>69 Haw. 600, 752 P.2d 105 (1988), the \u201ccivil\u201d description was used only to distinguish refusal to submit cases from <em>criminal </em>cases. In the above cases, whether a refusal to submit case was a <em>traffic </em>case as opposed to a civil case was not at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">We hold, therefore, that cases of refusal to submit to a breath or blood test under HRS \u00a7 286-155 arc traffic and not civil cases, and that RDC 33(a) is applicable. Consequently, Busby was not entitled to request admissions from the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ay6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>Arthur Ross (Paul J.
