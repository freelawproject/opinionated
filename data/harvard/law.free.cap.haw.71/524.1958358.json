Daniel consumed quantities of alcohol and subsequently while driving lost control of his motor vehicle and died. We note that the decedent in purchasing liquor from Appellee violated HRS \u00a7 281-101.5(b) (1985)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and could have been subject to criminal penalty pursuant to HRS \u00a7 281-101.5(d) (Supp. 1989).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Appellant Mary Winters, mother of the deceased, filed a claim for wrongful death in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii against Appellee based upon diversity of citizenship alleging dram shop liability. Appellee moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">Traditionally, at common law, a cause of action did not exist against dram shops<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> when they sold or served liquor to patrons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>who injured themselves due to intoxication nor when innocent third parties suffered injuries due to the tavern patron\u2019s inebriation. The rationale in support of the rule precluding dram shop liability was that the proximate cause of injuries due to the person\u2019s intoxication was the consumption of the liquor, not its sale or service. <em>Ono v. Applegate, 62 </em>Haw. 131, 134, 612 P.2d 533, 537 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">In <em>Ono </em>v. <em>Applegate </em>this court recognized a common law dram shop action allowing a person injured in an automobile collision with an inebriated tavern customer to recover damages from the tavern that sold liquor to the customer. Persuaded by public policy reflecting a clear judicial trend across the nation to allow such a cause of action, we held that the liquor control statute, HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) (1976),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> created a duty upon commercial liquor suppliers not to serve a person under the influence of alcohol and that such sale or service of alcohol may be a proximate cause of injuries inflicted upon those within the protected class, i.e. innocent third persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">However, we have refused to further modify the common law dram shop action to permit recovery against commercial suppliers of liquor by inebriated liquor consumers who sustain injuries because of their voluntary intoxication. In <em>Bertelmann </em>v. <em>TAAS Associates, 69 </em>Haw. 95, 735 P.2d 930 (1987), this court in holding that a decedent\u2019s estate and his survivors failed to state a claim against a commercial supplier of alcoholic beverages stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b551-8\">We agree with the majority of jurisdictions that have passed on this issue and emphatically reject the contention that intoxicated liquor consumers can seek.rccovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>from the bar or tavern which sold them alcohol. Drunken persons who harm themselves are solely responsible for their voluntary intoxication and cannot prevail under a common law or statutory basis.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 100, 735 P.2d at 933 (citing <em>Wright v. Moffit, </em>437 A.2d 554 (Del. 1981\u00bb.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">We reasoned that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-8\">HRS \u00a7\u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B) and 281-78(b)(l) were created to protect the general public from drunk driving accidents, not to reward intoxicated liquor consumers for the consequences of their voluntary inebriation. <em>See Wright, </em>437 A.2d at 557.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 101, 735 P.2d at 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-11\">Appellant contends that minors were intended to be included in the protected class and <em>that Bertelmann </em>is not applicable to the instant case as <em>Bertelmann </em>involved an adult consumer of alcohol. This court in <em>Bertelmann </em>specifically left open the question which is now presented to us in the form of the aforestated certified question. We noted that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-12\">At least one jurisdiction has ruled that public policy, to prevent alcohol abuse by immature and inexperienced minors, requires those who' illegally furnish liquor to minors be held legally accountable. <em>See Trujillo v. Trujillo, </em>104 N.M. 379, 721 P.2d 1310 (N.M. Ct. App.), <em>cert. denied, </em>104 N.M. 289, 720 P.2d 708 (N.M. 1986).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, the majority of cases, like <em>Miller </em>[v. <em>City of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number><em>Portland, </em>288 Or. 271, 604 P.2d 1261 (1980)], makes no distinction between minors and adults and rules that, under common law and/or statute, neither minors nor adults who hurt themselves after becoming intoxicated possess a cause of action against whoever provided them with liquor. <em>See Sutter </em>v. <em>Hutchings, </em>254 Ga. 194, 327 S.E.2d 716, <em>on remand, Sutter v. Turner, </em>174 Ga. App. 743, 332 S.E.2d 175 (1985); <em>Ruth v. Benvenutti, </em>114 Ill. App. 3d 404, 449 N.E.2d 209 (1983).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 101 n.3, 735 P.2d at 934 n.3. <em>See also </em>Annotation, <em>Liability of Persons Furnishing Intoxicating Liquor For Injury To Or Death Of Consumer, Outside Coverage Of Civil Damage Acts, </em>98 A.L.R.3d 1230, 1260-63 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">The rationale of the majority view is that absent legislative intent or public policy to change the common law and allow a tort right of action utilizing regulatory and criminal statutes to establish duty and conduct of care, the courts refuse to judicially legislate. In <em>Miller, </em>the Oregon court noted it had previously modified the common law to allow an action against a commercial seller of liquor for the death of a third party killed by a minor who received liquor in violation of its liquor control statute prohibiting the sale of liquor to a minor. However, the court held that the inebriated minor was not within the protected class of the statute and refused to allow a cause of action against the tavern where the injured minor himself violated a statute prohibiting minors from purchasing liquor. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-10\">[W]e believe it is inappropriate to use ORS 471.130(1) [Oregon state statute prohibiting the sale of liquor to persons under the age of twenty-one] as a basis for civil liability by licensees to the underage minor. ORS 471.430 prohibits minors ... from purchasing or acquiring alcoholic liquor and provides a penalty for the violation (a fine). It would be inconsistent with apparent legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>lative policy to reward the violator with a cause of action based upon the conduct which the legislature has chosen to prohibit and penalize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">288 Or. at 279, 604 P.2d at 1265 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">Similarly, in this jurisdiction there is absent any legislative intent or public policy to extend the protected class to minors and the same inconsistency as pointed out in <em>Miller </em>would exist if this court were to allow the cause of action sought by Appellant insofar as decedent\u2019s own conduct of purchasing liquor was an activity which our legislature expressly intended to prohibit and penalize.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\"><em>Feliciano v. Waikiki Deep Water, Inc., </em>69 Haw. 605, 752 P.2d 1076 (1988), provides further confirmation of this court\u2019s refusal to judicially enlarge the protected class to include any persons who sustain injuries due to their own voluntary intoxication in the absence of any legislative expression, intent or public policy to do so regardless of their level of maturity, sophistication or state of intoxication at the time they are served alcoholic beverages by a commercial liquor supplier. Feliciano, an \u201cunsophisticated nineteen year old,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> grew up in Waianae in a sheltered environment due to injuries he received years previous preventing him from attending school for a considerable time. Prior to the accident, he had never driven to Honolulu nor had he been to Waikiki. He was not accustomed to drinking although he had tasted beer on prior occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">On the date of accident, Feliciano and some friends went to a Waikiki hostess bar. He alleged that while at the bar he was apprehensive and felt intimidated by the bar\u2019s hostesses who continually encouraged and coerced him to consume at least four (4) alcoholic beverages over a two and a half hour period causing him to spend approximately $175.00. Feliciano argued that the service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>of alcohol to him while intoxicated was in violation of the liquor control statute, HRS \u00a7 281-78(a)(2)(B), and that because he was unsophisticated the aggressive conduct of selling drinks by the bar\u2019s employees constituted a breach of duty on the part of the bar to avoid affirmative acts that increased the peril to an intoxicated consumer, a cause of action referred to in <em>Bertelmann.</em><footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>69 Haw. at 608, 752 P.2d at 1078.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In affirming the lower court\u2019s granting of summary judgment against Feliciano we concluded, \u201cthat without more, aggressive sales of drinks at a bar do not constitute affirmative acts that would create liability to the consumer on the part of the bar or tavern. In the instant case, Feliciano apparently paid for the drinks and voluntarily drank them.\u201d 69 Haw. at 608-09, 752 P.2d at 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">As a nineteen year old adult, Feliciano\u2019s inexperience, immaturity and unsophistication regarding the consumption and effects of alcohol which parallels the experience level of many of today\u2019s \u201cminors\u201d (below twenty-one years of age) was insufficient to either place him in the protected class or support the basis for a cause of action premised on the tavern\u2019s employees\u2019 affirmative acts which arguably increased his peril after he became intoxicated. It is difficult to comprehend that had Feliciano\u2019s accident occurred after the raising of the drinking age to twenty-one years that this court\u2019s decision would have differed. Generally, the classification of \u201cminor\u201d connotes one who lacks maturity and requires supervision and protection for his/her well-being and safety. However, for this court to allow \u201cminors\u201d (below twenty-one years of age) to categorically be placed within the protected class would be inconsistent with the expression of legislative intent to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>treat those within the age bracket of eighteen to twenty years as responsible adults in all other respects.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">Appellant argues that the legislative history of the 1986 amendment raising the legal drinking age from eighteen years to twenty-one years \u201cindicates that it was the intent of the legislature to protect minors from the evils of alcohol\u201d and include them in the protected class. Opening Brief of Plaintiff-Appellant at 20. On the contrary, close scrutiny of the legislative history fails to support Appellant\u2019s position. It is evident that the primary and overriding motivation for the legislature to raise the legal drinking age to twenty-one years was to comply with the Federal mandate requiring all states to make unlawful the \u201cpurchase or public possession ... of any alcoholic beverage by a person who is less than twenty-one years of age\u201d or suffer the consequences of federal highway funds being withheld. 23 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (Supp. 1990). Legislators were fully aware and apprehensive that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A4y\">[U]nder Public Law 98-363 [23 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1) (Supp. 1990)], the State of Hawaii will lose five per cent or $6,285,000 of its federal highway funds for fiscal year 1987 if Hawaii does not have a drinking age requirement of twenty-one by October 1,1986, and will lose ten per cent or $12,570,000 of these funds for fiscal year 1988 if it does not have this requirement by October 1, 1987.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>Session Laws of Hawaii (S.L.H.) 1986, c. 342, \u00a7 1, at 804-05.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The 1986 legislature\u2019s reluctance in passing the amendment raising the legal drinking age to twenty-one years is manifest by concerns expressed regarding infringement upon state\u2019s rights and constitutionality of the federal mandate:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">The legislature is aware that the State of Hawaii is challenging the constitutionality and rationale of Public Law 98-363 through an amicus brief filed on September 17, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>1985. While the legislature supports and will continue to support this effort, the legislature further finds that the State\u2019s federal highway funding will be jeopardized if no legislation is enacted in the 1986 legislative session to raise the drinking age to twenty-one.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">S.L.H. 1986, c. 342, \u00a7 1, at 805.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Moreover, we note that the 1986 Regular and Special Session of the legislature focused its efforts on tort refonn due to the then purported liability insurance crisis and sought to reduce and stabilize automobile<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and commercial liability insurance rates.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Therefore, it would be totally inconsistent with the legislative policy of 1986 to conclude that it intended to expand the liability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>commercial liquor suppliers which in turn would undoubtedly increase their liability insurance premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">In recent years, drunken driving accidents have raised the level of public concern for the need to reduce if not eliminate the devastating cause of loss of human life and limb on our highways. Our lawmakers have reacted to public sentiment by enacting more stringent laws and heavier penalties seeking solutions to the problem. However, whether some remedial measure can be found in further modifying the common law by shifting the burden and responsibility of injuries to minors resulting from their voluntary consumption of alcohol to the commercial seller of liquor is best left to the wisdom of the Legislature and its process.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">It is within the legislature\u2019s province to weigh and balance the far reaching social, economic and legal consequences of modifying the common law as Appellant urges. At least two major concerns in contemplating such modification of the common law arise: (1) where existing law distinguishes between two groups of minors, i.e. those below eighteen years and those between eighteen to twenty years, should the latter group be included in the protected class when under the law, they are treated as adults in every other IS respect;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> and (2) whether the legislature\u2019s expressed policy of reducing and stabilizing commercial insurance liability costs should be altered by expanding the liability of commercial liquor suppliers.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">We turn now to that portion of the certified question of whether survivors of a deceased minor are precluded from suing the commercial liquor supplier under HRS \u00a7 663-3 (1985). In <em>Bertelmann, </em>we stated:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AR5h\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number><em>Ned Rowan </em>and <em>Paul Cunney </em>for Plaintiff-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARn\"><em>Ronald G.
