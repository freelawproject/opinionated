Coyle each appeals from his conviction of the crime of Abuse of Family and Household Members, Hawaii Revised Statutes (HRS) \u00a7 709-906 (1985). Each had a non-jury trial, was charged and convicted only under HRS \u00a7 709-906. On appeal each contends that the judge\u2019s finding that a mutual affray occurred is a defense to the crime. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-8\">Although HRS \u00a7 707-712(2) (1985) on Third Degree Assault does provide a defense which mitigates that crime from a misdemeanor to a petty misdemeanor when the assault is committed during a fight or scuffle entered into by mutual consent,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> no similar provision is made in HRS \u00a7 709-906, Abuse of Family and Household Members. Mutual affray, therefore, is not a defense to the crime of which Appellants were convicted, Abuse of Family and Household Members, HRS \u00a7 709-906.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">We do not decide the contested issue of whether Third Degree Assault committed in a mutual affray, HRS \u00a7 707-712(2), is a lesser included offense of the charged Abuse of Family and Household Members, HRS \u00a7 709-906, because a decision on that issue is not relevant to a determination of the present cases. Being guilty of a lesser included offense is not a defense to a conviction of the greater offense. <em>State v.
