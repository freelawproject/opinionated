Wilder\u2019s complaint for damages premised on an alleged violation of his First Amendment rights. Finding \u201cthere [were] genuine issues of material fact regarding Wilder's \u00a7 1983 claim[,]\u2019\u2019 the Intermediate Court of Appeals (the ICA) vacated the judgment. Reviewing the record on appeal, we conclude the ICA erred and reinstate the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-15\">John P. Wilder was an inmate of the Oahu Community Correctional Center (OCCC) in 1984. He was transferred out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>general prison population on February 7, 1984 for broaching prison discipline. Four months later his request for reconsideration of the transfer was granted, and he was trans\u00ed erred from the OCCC holding unit to Module 3 where Hairy Tanouyc was the supervisor on August 9,1984. Wilder's return to the prison's general population, however, was on a three-month probationary basis; it was conditioned, among other things, upon his \u201ccooperation with staff \u2014 especially in remedying complaints informally by open communication with staff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Wilder wrote Congressman Cecil Hcftel on October 9, .1984, complaining about conditions at the prison. Several weeks later. Tanouyc told Wilder this \u201cappeared to be a breach\" of one of the conditions of the latter's transfer to Module 3. Wilder then filed a grievance against Tanouyc, claiming his constitutional right to write a congressman had been violated. Tanouyc issued Wilder a written memorandum on the same day, advising him that w riling the letter \u201cwithout first attempting to resolve [the] complaint informally with staff\u2019 violated a condition of the probationary transfer and warning him that \u201cfurther disciplinary action which may include an increase in custody and/or a change in housingl would follow if the violations continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Wilder filed his pro se complaint against Tanouyc in (lie circuit court on November 7, 1984, alleging Tanouyc, while acting \u201cunder color of Hawaii law,\" violated his \"First and Fourteenth Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution,\u201d as well as the State Constitution. The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages. Tanou\\c's responsive pleading raised as defenses the qualified immunit\\ described in <em>Harlow v. </em>Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800 (1982), and the State\u2019s sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Shortly after the complaint was filed, however, Tanouyc rescinded the written wanting issued earlier. The memorandum to Wilder stated: \u201cThis is to inform you that the written wanting to you dated November 1,1984, is rescinded. Copies of the warning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>will be rcm.ovcd from the facitily and module files.\" Wilder was transferred a few days later to a module supervised by someone else.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Tanouye moved for summary judgment on November 26, 1986, and the circuit court granted the motion on April 7, 1987. Wilder appealed, and the appeal was assigned to the ICA.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">The ICA noted \u201cWilder\u2019s complaint [did] not mention 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\" but nevertheless \u201callegc[d] that Tanouye, acting under the \u2018color of Hawaii law,\u2019 deprived him of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights under the United States Constitution. Consequently, [it treated] Wilder\u2019s claim as a \u00a7 1983 claim.\" \u201cViewing the evidence in the record and inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to Wilder,\u201d the ICA found \u201cthere (were] genuine issues of material fact\" and ruled \u201cthe granting of summary judgment was improper.\u201d We granted Tanouye\u2019s application for a writ of certiorari in order t\u00f3 review the ICA's ruling in the light of the pronouncements of the Supreme Court regarding the viability of claims brought under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">H;</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Title 42 United States Code (U.S.C.) section 1983, which is \u201cderived from \u00a7 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">\u2018Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any Stale or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any cili/.cn of the United Stales or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u2019\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-11\"><em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 253 (1978). Its legislative history \u201cdemonstrates that it was intended to \u2018[create] a species of tort <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>liability\u2019 in favor of persons who are deprived of \u2018rights, privileges, or immunities secured\u2019 to them by the Constitution. <em>Imbler </em>v. <em>Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 417 (1976).\u201d <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. at 253. Congress, in the Supreme Court\u2019s view, \u201cadopted [the] common law system of recovery when it established liability for \u2018constitutional torts.\u2019\u201d <em>Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura, 477 </em>U.S. 299, 307 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">\u201c[T]hc basic puipose of a \u00a7 1983 damages award [is] to compensate persons for injuries caused by the deprivation of constitutional rights].]\u201d <em>Carey v.

But \u201c[r]ights, constitutional or otherwise, do not exist in a vacuum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>They \u201cprotect persons from injuries to particular interests, and their contours are shaped by the interests they protect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The concept of damages in Anglo-American law \u201creflects this view of legal rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the Court on several occasions has said \u201cdamages are available under fsection 1983] for actions \u2018found ... to have been violative of . . . constitutional rights <em>and to have caused compensable injury </em>....\u2019 <em>Wood v. Strickland, </em>420 U.S. (308,] 319 [(1975)] (emphasis supplied)!.]\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 255 (other citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\"><em>\u201cCarey </em>v. <em>Piphus </em>represented ] a straightforward application of these principles.\u201d <em>Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 </em>U.S. at 307. A section 1983 plaintiff, the Court ruled in reversing the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, \u201ccould recover . . . only if he proved actual injury caused by the denial of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere no injury was present, no \u2018compensatory\u2019 damages could be awarded.\" <em>Id. </em>at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The instructions given the trial jury were at issue in <em>Memphis Community School District v. Stachura. </em>The jurors were instructed that in deciding what was required to compensate the plaintiff for the denial of his constitutional rights, \u201cthey should place a money value on the \u2018rights\u2019 themselves by considering such factors as the particular right's \u2018importance ... in our system of government,\u2019 its role in American history, and its significance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>... in the context of the activities in which [he] was engaged.\u201d <em>Id. Carey v. Piphus, </em>the Court said, \u201cestablishes that such an approach is impermissible.\u201d <em>Id. </em>For \u201c[tlhcse factors focus, not on compensation for provable injury, but on the jury\u2019s subjective perception of the importance of constitutional rights as an abstract matter.\" <em>Id. </em>The conclusion reached in <em>Carey </em>that a section 1983 plaintiff could recover only if he proved actual injury, the Court emphasized, \u201csimply leaves no room for noncompensatory damages measured by the jury\u2019s perception of the abstract \u2018importance\u2019 of a constitutional right.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 309-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Wilder, as we noted, alleged that Tanouyc deprived him of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.and sought declaratory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>and injunctive relief and compensatory and punitive damages. When Tanouye\u2019s motion for summary judgment was heard, Wilder\u2019s plea for declaratory and injunctive relief was not a viable request \u2014 the written warning had been rescinded and removed from the files, he was not subject to disciplinary action, and he had been transferred from the module supervised by Tanouye.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">The ICA nonetheless concluded \u201cWilder's claim for money damages remains viable and is not moot]. ]\u201d It concluded Tanouyc was not entitled to summary judgment because (1) Wilder's complaint \u201casscrtlcd) a substantive claim pursuant to the First Amendment as made applicable to the stales by the Fourteenth Amendment!,]\u2019' (2) \u201cTanouye's contention that Wilder\u2019s transfer occurred after the filing of the complaint and was not an issue below is not entirely correct!, 1\u201d and (3) the \u201crescission of the \u2018warning\u2019 letter and removal of the copies of the letter from Wilder's institutional files \u2014 all of which occurred subsequently to the filing of Wilder\u2019s complaint \u2014 do not by themselves signify that there was no retaliation.\u201d Applying, the principles reiterated by the Supreme Court in <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus </em>and <em>Memphis Community School District </em>v. <em>Stachura </em>and other principles of the common law system of recovery relevant here, we conclude the ICA erred in vacating the award of summary judgment to Tanouye.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">To begin, the assertion of \u201ca substantive claim pursuant to the First Amendment\u201d is not controlling for purposes of anal) zing section 1983 claims. The respondent in <em>Memphis </em>argued the principles enunciated in <em>Carey </em>did not control his claim for damages because \u201ca <em>substantive </em>constitutional right \u2014 respondent's First Amendment right to academic freedom- \u2014 was infringed.\u201d <em>Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura, 477 </em>U.S. at 309 (emphasis in original). The Court summarily dismissed the argument, stating <em>Carey </em>did \u201cnot establish a two-tiered system of constitutional rights, with substantive rights afforded greater protection than \u2018mere\u2019 procedural safeguards.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And it \u201cemphasized that, whatever the constitutional basis for \u00a7 1983 liability, such dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>ages must always be designed \u2018to <em>compensate injuries </em>caused by the [constitutional] deprivation.' [435 U.S.] at 265 (emphasis added).\u201d <em>Id. </em>(footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Thus, the viability of Wilder\u2019s claim for compensatory damages turns on whether his First Amendment rights were violated and whether the violation resulted in compensable injury. Wilder was not prevented from writing Congressman Hcftcl; if a violation occurred, it was when Tanouyc advised Wilder that the communication of complaints breached an agreed condition of his return to the prison\u2019s general population and warned him about further disciplinary action if this happened again. But \"damages based on the \u2018value\u2019 or \u2018importance\u2019 of constitutional rights arc not authorized by \u00a7 1983,\u201d 477 U.S. at 309 n.13, and Wilder's claim for compensatory damages was viable only if he could show he suffered actual injury. Viewing the evidence in the record and the inferences to be drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to him, we conclude the claim was not one that could be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The rescission of the written warning and its expungement from the records of the OCCC removed even the threat of retaliation the ICA spoke of in setting aside the summary judgment. Moreover, the transfer to a module supervised by someone other than Tanouyc could hardly be deemed injurious to the prisoner's interests. Since damages based on the abstract importance of First Amendment rights arc not awardablc in a section 1983 suit, the defendant was entitled to summary judgment on the claim for compensator}' damages.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"ASn\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number><em>John Campbell, Jr., Glenn S.

Wilder, </em>respondent-appellant, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The decision of the ICA is set aside, and the summary judgment in favor of the defendant is reinstated.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b59-8\"> The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">Nor do we find such damages necessary to vindicate the constitutional rights that \u00a7 1983 protects. See n. 11, <em>Supra. </em>Section 1983 presupposes that damages that compensate for actual harm ordinarily suffice to deter constitutional violations. Carey, [435 U.S.] at 256-257 (\u201cTo theextenl thatCongress intended that awards under \u00a7 1983 should deter the deprivation of constitutional rights, there is no evidence that it meant to establish a deterrent more formidable than that inherent in the award of compensatory damages\"). Moreover, damages based on the \u201cvalue\u201d of constitutional rights are an unwieldy tool for ensuring compliance with the Constitution. History and tradition do not afford any sound guidance concerning the precise value that juries should place on constitutional protections. Accordingly, were such damages available, juries would be free to award arbitrary amounts without any evidentiary basis, or to use their unbounded discretion to punish unpopular defendants. Cf. <em>Gertz[ </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc.,] </em>418 U.S.[323.) 350. Such damages would be too uncertain to be of any great value to plaintiffs, anti would inject caprice into determinations of damages in \u00a7 1983 cases. We therefore hold that damages based on the abstract \u201cvalue\" or \u201cimportance\" of constitutional rights are not a permissible element of compensatory damages in such cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">477 U.S. at 310.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The evidence in the record viewed in a light most favorable to the plaintiff also does not show the acts complained of were \u201cmaliciously, or wantonly, or oppressively done.\u201d <em>Memphis Community School Dist., </em>477 U.S. at 306 n.9; <em>see also Kang v. </em>Harrington, 59 Haw. 652, 660-61, 587 P.2d 285, 291 (1978).
