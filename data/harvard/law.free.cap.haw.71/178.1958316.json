Palpallatoc (Defendant) appeals from his conviction for driving without no-fault insurance (HRS \u00a7 431:10C-104). After a bench trial, the court found Defendant guilty, suspended his driver\u2019s license for a period of six months and fined him four hundred dollars. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">This case proceeded to trial on February 8,1989, based on the following stipulated Tacts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-16\">L Defendant was operating a motor vehicle bearing license number BEJ 481, which was owned by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>brother, Scot[t] Palpall[a}toc. It was involved in an automobile accident on October 21,1988.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\">2. Scott Palpallatoc\u2019s vehicle was not insured by no-fault insurance on the date of said accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">3. Defendant has permission from Scot[t] Palpallatoc to operate said motor vehicle on the date in question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-8\">4. Defendant had no knowledge that said vehicle was not covered by no-fault insurance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-9\">5. Defendant was cited for not having no-fault insurance on October 21, 1988 and there was probable cause to stop the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-10\">Transcript of April 26,1989 at 2-3. The issue before the court was whether a person who borrows another person\u2019s vehicle without knowing that the vehicle is uninsured establishes the good-faith defense of lack of knowledge under the no-fault statute, HRS \u00a7 431:100-117. At trial on February 8, 1989, the lower court asked the parties to submit memoranda in support of their respective positions and continued trial until April 26, 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-11\">Defense counsel submitted a Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on April 5, 1989, and an identical Supplemental Motion for Judgment of Acquittal on April 12,1989. The State failed to submit a memorandum.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">At trial on April 26, 1989, the lower court ruled that \u201cthe word[s] \u2018good-faith defense\u2019 at its minimum requirement, means an inquiry as to whether or not the registered owner has no-fault insurance or not. Absent that inquiry, good-faith has not been shown.\u201d Transcript of April 26,1989 at 8. The lower court, however, rejected the requirement of an affirmative act after the inquiry, such as looking in the glove compartment. The lower court found from the stipulated facts that no inquiry was made by the Defendant, and therefore found that the good-faith defense had not been established as required by statute. Accordingly, the court denied Defendant\u2019s Motion for Judgment of Acquittal and found Defendant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>This timely appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">Defendant contends that a plain reading of HRS \u00a7431:10C-117 clearly provides a good faith defense in a situation where a party lacks knowledge that a vehicle is uninsured. Defendant asserts that this interpretation of the statute is consistent with the legislative history of the statute and the fact that the legislature amended the statute to specifically provide for such a defense. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">In <em>State v. Lesher, </em>66 Haw. 534, 669 P.2d 146 (1983),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we held that although it did not appear that the legislature intended to impose absolute liability for operating an uninsured vehicle, the statutory scheme and the requisite state of mind (at a minimum recklessness) make it \u201cincumbent upon the borrower of a vehicle to ascertain whether or not there is a current no-fault insurance card in the vehicle.\u201d 66 Haw. at 537, 669 P.2d at 148.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">In 1988, the legislature amended HRS \u00a7 294-39, renumbered HRS \u00a7 431:10C-117, to allow for a good faith defense.. That statute reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\">[Provided further that any person cited underthis section shall have an opportunity to present a good faith defense, including but not limited to lack of knowledge or proof of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-9\">HRS \u00a7 431:100-117(a)(2) (Supp. 1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b204-10\">Where no.ambiguity exists in the language of the statute, the statute must be given effect according to its plain and obvious meaning. <em>State v. Palama, </em>62 Haw. 159, 612 P.2d 1168 (1980). \u201cWhere statutory language is ambiguous, yet capable of being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>fairly and reasonably construed, the purpose and objective which moved the legislature to enact it may be determinative of its interpretation.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Ogata, </em>58 Haw. 514, 518, 572 P.2d 1222, 1225 (1977) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">In amending the statute to provide for an assertion of a good faith defense, the legislature clearly expressed its intent that absolute liability will not be imposed for operating an uninsured vehicle, and that owners and drivers may avail themselves of certain good faith defenses. <em>Cf. State </em>v. <em>Lesher, </em>66 Haw. 534, 669 P.2d 146 (1983). The plain language of the statute, however, does not make clear what constitutes the good faith defense of lack of knowledge. Given this ambiguity we must interpret the language of the statute consistent with the purpose and objective of the entire statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The statute\u2019s legislative history provides no guidance.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The purpose of the entire act, however, is clear. That purpose is to have all vehicles on the road (excluding federally-owned vehicles) insured by no-fault insurance. HRS \u00a7431:10C-102 reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-8\">Purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-9\">(b) To effectuate this system of motor vehicle insurance and to encourage participation by all drivers in the motor vehicle insurance system[.j</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASq\">In justifying the imposition of harsher penalties for driving without insurance, the legislature stated that \u201cdriving without insurance is a serious offense and that the prospect of automatic license suspen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>sion, in addition to a stiff fine, should deter this behavior... [and] that this punishment is needed to protect Hawaii\u2019s citizens and should convince many drivers that it is better to be insured than to risk the consequences of driving illegally.\u201d Sen. Conf. Comm. Rep. No. 188, in 1988 Senate Journal, at 658-59.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AvJ\"><em>Richard W. Pollack, </em>Public Defender <em>(Travis J. L:Stephens, Jr., </em>Deputy Public Defender, with him on the opening, brief) for Defendant-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJo\"><em>James H. S. Choi, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for PlaintiffAppellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As we stated in <em>Lesher, </em>allowing drivers to escape penal responsibility for operating uninsured motor vehicles by failing to inquire as to whether or not that vehicle is insured would frustrate the purpose of the statute, since the objective of the no-fault system is to have all vehicles being operated on the highways insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">To give effect to the overall statutory scheme, therefore, we hold that in order to satisfy the good faith defense of lack of knowledge, die borrower of a vehicle must at least inquire of the owner whether or not the vehicle is insured.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Here, Defendant by merely stating he had no knowledge that the vehicle was not covered by no-fault insurance, we feel was not sufficient to satisfy the requirement necessary to assert the good faith defense of lack of knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b204-11\">This case interpreted HRS \u00a7 294-8 and \u00a7 294-8.5(a) which were subsequently amended and renumbered $ 431:100-104 and \u00a7 431:IOC-107, respectively, die same statutes involved in' the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b205-10\">The legislative history reads in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-11\">The purpose of this bill was to provide that in addition to a fine, the owner and the driver of an illegally operated uninsured motor vehicle shall have their driver\u2019s licenses suspended for one year. However, lack of knowledge or proof of insurance would be considered good faith defenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-12\">Sen. Conf, Comm. Rep. No. 188, in 1988 Senate Journal, at 658.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b206-10\"> Under <em>Lesher, </em>the borrower may stillnegate the State's showing of recklessness by ascertaining that there is _a current-no-fault insurance card in the vehicle.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
