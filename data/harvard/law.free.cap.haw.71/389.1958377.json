The trial court further found that prior to deliberations the same juror stated to another juror \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t take the stand.\u201d During a smoke break the same day, the same juror said to the same other juror \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he didn\u2019t go on the stand if he were innocent.\u201d During deliberations in the juryroom, the juror stated \u201cIf I were innocent, I would lake the stand to defend myself.\u201d Then during a smoke break during deliberations, he said to one of the jurors \u201cIf I were innocent, I would take the stand to defend myself.\u201d Again, during deliberations, he stated: \u201cIf I were innocent, I would lake the stand to defend myself.\u201d Despite these findings, the court below refused to grant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">In our view, the denial of the motion for a new trial was an abuse of discretion and must be reversed. It is settled that a defendant has a constitutional right <em>not </em>to take the stand, and a constitutional right to have the jury instructed that <em>no </em>adverse inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>arc to be drawn from the fact that the defendant does not take the stand. The court below correctly so instructed the jury.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5z1\"><em>Theodore Y.H. Chinn, </em>Deputy Public Defender, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Am_\"><em>Charlotte J. Duarte, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney, for appcl-</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">It is clear that had the juror responded \u201cyes\u201d to the voir dire question \u201c[wjill you hold it against the defendant if he doesn't testify,\u201d he could and would have been excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">In <em>State </em>v. Larue, 68 Haw. 575, 722 P.2d 1039 (1986), we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-8\">Had foreperson Chung revealed the experience, and her recollection thereof, during the voir dire, there can be no question that she would have been subject to a challenge for cause, because it is clear that, given the central issue of reliability of the children\u2019s statements in this case, a person with such an experience and recollection thereof cannot, no matter how hard he or she tries, really be an impartial juror.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 578, 722 P.2d at 1042.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">By the same token, in this case had the juror in question responded truthfully to the voir dire inquiry he would have been excused for cause because he could not be an impartial juror. A criminal defendant is entitled to twelve impartial jurors. Appellant in this ease, because of the false answer, did not have a trial before twelve impartial jurors. The trial court abused its discretion in refusing to grant a new trial. Reversed and remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
