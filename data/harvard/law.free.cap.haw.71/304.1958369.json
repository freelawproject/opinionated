Mafi, </em>wherein Defendant Mafi is charged, <em>inter alia, </em>with Driving Under the Influence of Intoxicating Liquor (DUI), pursuant to Hawaii Revised Statutes \u00a7 291-4. The government alleges \u201cJudge Ames clearly abused his judicial discretion and exceeded his authority\u201d under Rule 16(d) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the Hawaii Rules of Penal Procedure by permitting Mafi to discover 41 of 45 items he sought by means of a Written Request for Disclosure served on the State and a subsequent motion for discovery filed in district court. We agree that Judge Ames has acted beyond the scope of his jurisdiction pursuant to HRPP Rule 16 in this case and thus invoke our supervisory power over the district court to direct by mandamus that the two discovery orders entered by Judge Ames on September 1, 1988 be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The extraordinary writ of mandamus is appropriate \u201cto confine an inferior tribunal to the lawful exercise of its proper jurisdiction[.]\u201d <em>State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. 307, 312, 640 P.2d 289, 293 (1982). <em>See also In re Doe, </em>67 Haw. 466, 469, 691 P.2d 1163, 1165 (1984). But \u201cmandamus may not be used to perform the office of an appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 310, 640 P.2d at 292 (citing <em>Chambers </em>v. <em>Leavey, </em>60 Haw. 52, 57, 587 P.2d 807, 810 (1978)). Thus, we must at the outset determine whether the State may have a remedy by way of an appeal or any other means of relief from the disputed discovery orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">\u201c[T]he right of appeal in a criminal case is purely statutory and exists only when given by some constitutional or statutory provision.\u201d <em>State v. Oshiro, </em>69 Haw. 438, 441, 746 P.2d 568, 570 (1987). <em>See also State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 310, 640 P.2d at 292; <em>State v. Johnson, </em>50 Haw. 525, 526, 445 P.2d 36, 37 (1968). HRS \u00a7 641-13 confers this right on the State in nine instances, which do not, however, include pretrial discovery orders.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the State is without a remedy from the September 1,1988 discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>ery orders issued by Judge Ames, unless this court grants its petition for extraordinary relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">But \u201c[t]he mere fact that other remedies are not available has never in itself been sufficient justification for mandamus.\u201d <em>State v. Shintaku, </em>64 Haw. at 311, 640 P.2d at 293 (citing <em>In re Application of Liverpool, </em>14 Haw. 481, 488 (1902)). And \u201c[w]here the trial judge has discretion to act,... mandamus clearly will not lie to interfere with or control the exercise of that discretion, even where the judge has acted erroneously,... unless ... the judge has exceeded his jurisdiction, has committed a flagrant and manifest abuse of discretion,... or has refused to act on a subject properly before the court where it was under a legal duty to act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 312-13, 640 P.2d at 293-94. <em>See, e.g., In re Doe, </em>67 Haw. 466, 691 P.2d 1163 (1984); <em>State ex </em>rel. <em>Marsland </em>v. <em>Town, </em>66 Haw. 516, 668 P.2d 25 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Upon review of the instant petition, we are persuaded that Judge Ames \u201chas exceeded his jurisdiction\u201d by issuing the dual discovery orders in this case and that our intervention is necessary to correct persistent misapplication of HRPP Rule 16(d) in DUI cases heard in our district courts and to establish parameters of permissible discovery in misdemeanor DUI cases. We therefore invoke our supervisory jurisdiction over the district court by authority of HRS \u00a7 602-4<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and exercise our discretionary power to issue a writ of mandamus pursuant to HRS \u00a7 602-5(4) and (7).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Disclosure in criminal cases is governed by HRPP Rule 16, which limits discovery \u201cto cases in which the defendant is charged with a felony,\u201d HRPP Rule 16(a), except as provided in HRPP Rule 16(d). HRPP Rule 16(d) reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Upon a showing of materiality and if the request is reasonable, the court in its discretion may require disclosure as provided for in this Rule 16 in cases other than those in which the defendant is charged with a felony, but not in cases involving violations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Thus, discovery in a misdemeanor DUI case may be permitted by the trial judge \u201c[u]pon a showing of materiality and if the request is reasonable,\u201d but only to the extent authorized by HRPP Rule 16 for felony cases. HRPP Rule 16(b) enumerates the items the State must disclose upon request of a defendant who is charged with a felony. It provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">(1) Disclosure Upon Written Request of Matters Within Prosecutor\u2019s Possession. Upon written request of defense counsel, the prosecutor shall disclose to him the following material and information within the prosecutor\u2019s possession or control:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">(i) the names and last known addresses of persons whom the prosecutor intends to call as witnesses, in the presentation of the evidence in chief, together with their relevant written or recorded statements, provided that statements recorded by the prosecutor shall not be subject to disclosure;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">(ii) any written or-recorded statements and the substance of any oral statements made by the defendant, or made by a co-defendant if intended to be used in a joint trial, together with the names and last known addresses of persons who witnessed the making of such statements;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">(iii) any reports or statements of experts, which were made in connection with the particular case or which the prosecutor intends to introduce, or which are material to the preparation of the defense and are specifically designated in writing by defense counsel, including results of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>(iv) any books, papers, documents, photographs, or tangible objects which the prosecutor intends to introduce, or which were obtained from or which belong to the defendant, or which are material to the preparation of the defense and are specially designated in writing by defense counsel;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-5\">(v) any prior criminal record of the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">(3) Disclosure of Matters Not Within Prosecution \u2019s Possession. Upon written request of defense counsel and specific designation by him of material or information which would be discoverable if in the possession or control of the prosecutor and which is in the possession or control of other governmental personnel, the prosecutor shall use diligent good faith efforts to cause such material or information to be made available to defense counsel; and if the prosecutor\u2019s efforts are unsuccessful the court shall issue suitable subpoenas or orders to cause such material or information to be made available to defense counsel.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Mail\u2019s Written Request for Disclosure, which was initially served on the State and subsequently considered by Judge Ames pursuant to a motion to compel discovery, sought 45 items from the prosecution. Judges Ames granted 41, denied three, and took no action with respect to one of the items requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-8\">We begin our review of Judge Ames\u2019 orders of discovery by examining seven items that appear to fall within the ambit of HRPP Rule 16. Item 1 is a list of State\u2019s witnesses, \u201ctogether with their relevant written or recorded statements... [or] a written summary of the testimony each witness is expected to give at trial.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Item 2 consists of any \u201cstatements made by the Defendant together with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>the names and last known addresses of persons who witnessed the making of such statements.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Item 3 deals with \u201creports or statements of experts... including results of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests, experiments, or comparisons.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Item 5 covers material \u201cwhich the prosecution intends to present to the Court, or which were obtained from or which belong to the Defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Item 6 is a request for \u201c[a]ny prior criminal record of the Defendant or any State witness.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Item 30 concerns the results of the Intoxilyzer 401 IAS test taken by the defendant.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Item 42 consists of information obtained by means of a horizontal gaze <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>nystagmus test, if any, administered to the defendant.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We believe these seven items would be discoverable in misdemeanor DUI cases, in whole or in part, within the limits prescribed by HRPP Rule 16(b), provided the defendant meets the threshold requisites of HRPP Rule 16(d). Thus, Judge Ames could have compelled the State to disclose the following material upon written request from Mal\u00ed: Item 1, except for \u201ca written summary of the testimony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>each witness is expected to give at trial,\u201d which is not authorized by HRPP Rule 16(b)(l)(i); Items 2, 3, and 5 in their entirety, <em>see </em>HRPP Rule 16(b)(1)(h), (iii), and (iv), respectively; Items 30 and 42, limited to the results of the Intoxilyzer 401 IAS test and the horizontal gaze nystagmus test, if any, taken by defendant, <em>see </em>HRPP Rule 16(b)(l)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">The government avers that it \u201croutinely and freely supplie[s]\u201d a defendant in a DUI case \u201cthe relevant waiver forms, Intoxilyzer and/or blood test results, operational checklists, witness statements, and maintenance logs.\u201d Thus, we assume this material was disclosed to Mafi. If it was not, we believe Mafi is entitled to receive these items, even without submitting a Written Request for Disclosure or a motion to compel discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">But Mafi was neither entitled to nor was Judge Ames authorized to order disclosure of the additional 34 items on the list of requested materials. For not only is disclosure of these items not \u201cprovided for in .. . [HRPP] Rule 16,\u201d which is a requirement of HRPP Rule 16(d), but too discovery in a misdemeanor case that exceeds the limits of discovery established by HRPP Rule 16 for felony cases cannot be justified under the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Thus, we determine that Judge Ames acted beyond the scope of his authority under HRPP Rule 16(d) when he granted Mafi\u2019s motion to compel discovery with respect to the following items:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A0q\">4. Identification by title, journal, volume, page number, date and author of all documents (reports, forms, articles, journals, books, etc.) relied upon by the prosecution\u2019s expert regarding his opinion of the reliability of the instrument used to determine Defendant\u2019s blood-alcohol content.
