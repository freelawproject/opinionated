DefendantAppellee Lynn Aguinaldo was driving a vehicle which was routinely stopped for a check. When the police officer had an opportunity to observe Aguinaldo, it was apparent that she was not intoxicated. The police officer, as a matter of routine, liten asked Aguinaldo to produce her driver\u2019s license and no-fault insurance card. When Aguinaldo was unable to do so, the police officer cited her for failure to produce a current driver\u2019s license and proof of car insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-11\">Aguinaldo moved to suppress all evidence obtained pursuant to her detention at the roadblock. She contcnds.that the demand to produce her driver\u2019s license and no-fault insurance card constituted a warrantless search in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, \u00a7 7 of the Hawaii Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-12\">The trial court granted Aguinaldo\u2019s motion to suppress on the grounds that (1) the highway safety statutes relating to intoxication control roadblock programs do not authorize police officers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>to enforce any other laws than those relating to driving under the influence of intoxicating substances (DUI) at an intoxication roadblock, and (2) the police had no probable cause to detain and question Aguinaldo once it was determined that she was not violating any DUI laws. The State appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">The trial court stated in its conclusion of law (COL) #1 that HRS \u00a7 286-162.5 and \u00a7 286-162.6,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which authorize the police to establish intoxication roadblocks, do \u201cnot expressly authorize police officers to enforce other traffic laws at the time of the DUI <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>roadblock stop.\u201d The statement is factually correct, but we disagree with the conclusion drawn therefrom by the trial court. While the roadblock statutes do not expressly authorize police to enforce other traffic laws at DUI roadblock stops, neither do they prohibit it.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">A separate section of the highway safety law &gt;, HRS \u00a7 286-116 (1985),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> authorizes \u201c[ejvcry police officer or law enforcement officer when stopping a vehicle or inspecting a vehicl <em>z for any reason </em>[to] demand that the driver or owner display the driver\u2019s or owner\u2019s driver\u2019s license and insurance identification card.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u201cLaws in pari materia, or upon the same subject matter, shall be construed with reference to each other. What is clear in one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>statute may be called in aid to explain what is doubtful in another.\u201d HRS \u00a7 1-16 (1985); <em>see also Zator </em>v. <em>State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., </em>69 Haw. 594, 597, 752 P.2d 1073, 1075 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Both the roadblock statutes and HRS \u00a7 286-116 pertain to police powers in ensuring highway safety. HRS \u00a7 286-116 authorizes the police to demand the production of a driver's lio nsc and no-fault insurance card whenever the police slop a vehicle for any reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">We interpret \u201cfor any reason\u201d to mean stopping vehicles for any <em>valid </em>reason. <em>See State </em>v. <em>Powell, </em>61 Haw. 316, 320, 603 P.2d 143, 147 (1979). (\u201cThe propriety of the search of appellee\u2019s automobile, and the subsequent seizures . . . hinges in part upon the validity of the initial stop____If it is ultimately detennined that the stop was constitutionally objectionable, the items seized from the vehicle \u2014 as fruits of an unlawful \u2018seizure\u2019 \u2014 would be the proper subjects of a suppression order.'')</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">When the roadblock statutes arc read in conjunction with \u00a7 286-116, it is clear that the police arc statutorily authorized to enforce the laws requiring drivers to have with them a valid driver\u2019s license and a no-fault insurance card by demanding that the same be produced when a slop is validly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">Aguinaldo argues that if \u00a7 286-116 is applied to intoxication roadblock situations, the police could use these roadblocks as pretexts for finding other violations. She also contends that \u00a7 286-116 is overbroad, and therefore, constitutionally infirm because it would sanction police demands for production of a driver\u2019s license and a no-fault insurance card even when the stop itself is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">Except where First Amendment rights are involved, a statute may not be challenged on the ground that it may be unconstitutionally applied in circumstances other than those before the court. <em>State v. Manzo, </em>58 Haw. 440, 445, 573 P.2d 945, 949 (1977). \u201cA person to whom a statute may be constitutionally applied cannot challenge the statute on the ground that it may conceivably be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>applied unconstitutionally to others.\u201d <em>State v. Kaneakua, </em>61 Haw. 136, 144, 597 P.2d 590, 594 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Here, Aguinaldo stipulated, for purposes of this appeal, that the stop of her vehicle pursuant to the intoxication roadblock was constitutionally valid. Consequently, she has no standing to claim that \u00a7 286-116 may conceivably be unconstitutional if apj lied in a situation where the stop is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">The trial court stated in its COL #2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-8\">The roadblock statutes provide the police with probable cause to conduct only a DUI investigation and docs not provide them with the necessary probable cause to investigate any other offenses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">It went on to conclude that without probable cause to investigate other offenses, the continued detention of Aguinaldo and the demand for a driver\u2019s license and no-fault card were impermissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-10\">The statement that the roadblock statutes provide the police with probable cause to conduct a DUI investigation is erroneous. \u201cProbable cause\u201d is often used as a shorthand term to signify the constitutional validity of certain government actions based upon facts and circumstances existing at the time.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-11\">\u201cProbable cause .. . cxistfsj when the facts and circumstances within one\u2019s knowledge and of which one has reasonably trustworthy information arc sufficient in themselves to warrant a man of reasonable caution in the belief that a crime [has been or is] being committed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-12\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>67 Haw. 535, 539, 696 P.2d 346, 350 (1985) (quoting <em>State v. Haili, </em>63 Haw. 553, 555-56, 632 P.2d 1064, 1065 (1981)). \u201c[PJrobable cause ... in a search situation presupposes a belief resting on reasonably trustworthy information thal . . . evidence of that crime is concealed in the places to be searched.\" <em>Id. </em>at 540-41, 696 P.2d at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>A statute written in the abstract cannot provide the necessary facts and circumstances to create probable cause, whether for the roadblock stop or any search or seizure thereafter. The absence of probable cause, however, does not render all searches and seizures constitutionally infirm. Our constitutions protect against <em>unreasonable </em>searches and seizures. Not every warrantless and nonconsensual search is proscribed. <em>Nakamoto </em>v. <em>Fasi, </em>64 Haw. 17, 24, 635 P.2d 946, 952 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">In <em>State v. Powell, </em>61 Haw. 316, 603 P.2d 143 (1979), this court held that when a driver is validly stopped, it is reasonable for the police officer to request production of the driver\u2019s license. <em>Id. </em>at 323, 603 P.2d at 148^19.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\"><em>InPowell, </em>this court held that the stop of the defendant\u2019s vehicle was valid because the police reasonably believed that the driver may have been violating a traffic law. Here, the police lacked any reasonable belief that Aguinaldo violated any highway safely law. In this case, however, the stop was made pursuant to a valid roadblock stop.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">In <em>State v. Tourtillott, </em>289 Or. 845, 618 P.2d 423 (1980), a roadblock was established in which every vehicle was stopped for the purpose of enforcing state game laws. When the defendant was stopped, there was no indication that any game law was being violated. The officer nevertheless requested to sec the defendant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. When the defendant responded that her license had been suspended, she was issued a citation. After determining that the initial stop of the defendant's vehicle was permissible, the Oregon Supreme Court went on to hold that the request to see the defendant\u2019s license was also permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">The defendant in <em>Tourtillott </em>argued, as Aguinaldo does here, that even if the initial stop was valid, any inquiry must relate to the purpose for which the stop was made. In response, the Oregon Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-10\">Although the officer\u2019s request for identification or a driver\u2019s license did not directly relate to the purpose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>roadblock, it certainly related to the defendant\u2019s status as the driver of the car. We hold that if an automobile is validly stopped by a law enforcement officer, the officer may request the operator\u2019s driver\u2019s license.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"Aeu\"><em>James B. Takayesu, </em>Deputy Prosecuting Attorney <em>(Benjamin M. Acob </em>with him on the briefs) for Plaintiff-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ADq\"><em>Theodore Chinn, </em>Deputy Public Defender, <em>(James Tagupa </em>and <em>Richard W. Pollack </em>on the bricl) for Defendant-Appel lee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b88-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 867, 618 P.2d at 435.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We concur with the statement and holding of the Oregon Supreme Court. <em>See also State v.Coccomo, </em>177 N.J. Super. 575, 427 A.2d 131 (1980). Hawaii law requires possession of no-fault insurance identification card in addition to a driver\u2019s license for (he operation of a motor vehicle.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We, therefore, hold that the police has the power and authority to demand from the driver of a vehicle the production of both whenever the vehicle is validly stopped. In this case, Aguinaldo stipulated that the roadblock stop was constitutionally valid, therefore, the demand for production of her driver\u2019s license and proof of no-faull insurance was also constitutionally permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">The order granting Aguinaldo\u2019s motion to suppress is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-9\"> \u00a7 286-162.5 Authorization to establish intoxication control roadblock programs.
