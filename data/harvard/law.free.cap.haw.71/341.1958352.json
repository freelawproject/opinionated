At issue is the proper intetpretation and application of former HRS \u00a7 431-448.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-12\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">The relevant facts are not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">On May 16, 1986, Defendant-Appellee Dorothea Ferreira (Ferreira) was a passenger in her insured motor vehicle when it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>was rear-ended by an uninsured motorist. Ferreira sustained whiplash-type injuries as a result of this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">Plaintiff-Appellant National Union Fire Insurance Company (National Union) had issued an automobile insurance policy to Ferreira which was in effect on the accident date. The policy includes: 1) no-fault coverage with a policy limit of $15,000; 2) uninsured motorist coverage with a policy limit of $35,000; and 3) underinsured motorist coverage with a policy limit of $35,000. The policy does not define underinsured motorist benefits nor does it state when such benefits are either applicable or excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">National Union paid Ferreira $15,000 in no-fault benefits and $35,000 in uninsured motorist benefits. National Union, however, denied Ferreira any underinsured motorist benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-8\">National Union subsequently filed an action for declaratory judgment in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, seeking a declaration that National Union was not required to pay underinsured motorist benefits to Ferreira. Motions for summary judgment were then filed by the respective parties on the issue of whether National Union was obligated to pay underinsured motorist benefits to Ferreira.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-9\">This certified question from the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-11\">QUESTION PRESENTED</p>\n<p id=\"b367-12\">The certified question we now address is one of first impression in this jurisdiction. It states (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-13\">May an injured insured person, receive both uninsured motorist coverage benefits and <em>underinsured motorist coverage benefits </em>under the terms of the insureds\u2019 policy if the insured paid a premium for both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>types of coverage and the insured was injured as a result of the sole negligence of an <em>uninsured </em>motorist?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">UNDERINSURED MOTORIST BENEFITS</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u201cInsurance policies are governed by statutory requirements in force and effect at the time such policies are written.\u201d 13 J. Appleman, <em>Insurance Law &amp; Practice </em>\u00a7 7382, at 23 (1976) (footnote omitted). \u201cSuch provisions are read into each policy issued thereunder, and become a part of the contract with full binding effect upon each party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23-24 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Former HRS \u00a7 431-448 (1985),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which was in effect at the date of the accident, provided in respective part (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATL8\">Automobile liability; coverage for damage by uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-10\">(b) Each insurer shall offer to each policyholder or applicant for a motor vehicle liability policy <em>optional additional insurance coverage </em>for loss resulting from bodily injury or death suffered by any person legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of <em>underinsured motor vehicles.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b368-11\">(c) The term <em>\u201cunderinsured motor vehicle,\u201d </em>as used in this section, means a motor vehicle with respect to the ownership, maintenance, or use of which <em>the sum of the limits of liability of all bodily injury liability insurance coverage applicable at the time of loss to which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>coverage afforded by such policy or policies applies is less than the liability for damages imposed by law. </em>A motor vehicle shall also be deemed uninsured within the meaning of this section if, after the occurrence of a loss described in this section, the owner or operator thereof is unknown.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">National Union contends that Ferreira is not entitled to receive underinsured motorist benefits, while Ferreira counters otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">The underlying issue, in essence, is whether Ferreira is entitled to receive underinsured motorist benefits pursuant to HRS \u00a7 431-448, where the tortfeasor was an uninsured motorist.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">This court\u2019s primary duty in interpreting.and applying statutes is to ascertain and give effect to the legislature\u2019s intention to the fullest degree. <em>Kaiser Hawaii Kai Dev. Co. v. City &amp; County, </em>70 Haw. 480, 777 P.2d 244 (1989); <em>Reefshare, Ltd. v. Nagata, </em>70 Haw. 93, 762 P.2d 169 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The fundamental starting point for statutory interpretation is the language of the statute itself. <em>Kaiser Found. Health Plan, Inc. v. Department of Labor and Indus. Relations, </em>70 Haw. 72, 762 P.2d 796 (1988). And where the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, our sole duty is to give effect to its plain and obvious meaning. <em>Id:, see also Sandy Beach Defense Fund v. City Council, </em>70 Haw. 361, 773 P.2d 250 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">A prerequisite to the term \u201cunderinsured motor vehicle,\u201d under the plain and obvious meaning of HRS \u00a7 431-448(c), is the existence of \u201cbodily injury liability insurance coverage[,]\u201d which is \u201cless than the liability for damages imposed by law.\u201d Where a tortfeasor has no bodily injury liability insurance coverage, therefore, he is not underinsured under the provisions of HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) and (c). Rather, he is uninsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">We believe that in enacting HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) and (c), the legislature intended to create separate and distinct types of insurance coverages \u2014 underinsured and uninsured. In other words, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>terms underinsured and uninsured, in our view, are mutually exclusive as applied to the same motor vehicle. The combination of these two coverages by the insured, as Ferreira urges before this court, was not the legislature\u2019s intent in its enactment of HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) and (c). In the context of HRS \u00a7 431-448(b) and (c), underinsured motorist coverage applies when there is insufficient bodily injury liability insurance coverage. Conversely, it does not apply when there is a complete absence of such coverage.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A5p\"><em>Carleton B. Reid </em>(/. <em>Thomas Weber </em>with him on the briefs; Davis, Reid &amp; Richards, of counsel), for Plaintiff-Appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Axo\"><em>Benjamin L. Carroll, III (Magali V. Richter </em>and <em>Tharrington T. Trusdell </em>with him on the brief; McKenzie, Trecker &amp; Fritz, of counsel), for Defendant-Appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We reject Ferreira\u2019s contention that the phrase \u201csum of the limits of liability of all bodily injury liability insurance coverage applicable at the time of loss[,]\u201d as codified in HRS \u00a7 43 1-448(c), includes the insureds\u2019 uninsured motorist coverage under the insureds\u2019 automobile insurance policy. Bodily injury liability insurance coverage and uninsured motorist coverage constitute separate and distinct types of insurance coverages under Hawaii law. <em>Compare </em>HRS \u00a7 294-10(a) <em>with </em>HRS \u00a7 431-448(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Based on the foregoing reasons, we answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-12\">The material provisions at issue, subsections (b) and (c) of HRS \u00a7 431-448, took effect on January 1,1986. See Act 181, \u00a7\u00a74,8,1985 Haw. Sess. Laws 311, 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">Effective July 1,1988, former HRS \u00a7 431-448 was repealed and reenacted in its newly amended form as part of the Insurance Code. See Act 347, \u00a7\u00a7 1,2,4, 1987 Haw. Sess. Laws 1,113,342. Former HRS \u00a7 431 \u2014 148 is now codified as HRS \u00a7 431:10-213.
