The prayer of the bill is that the bank be enjoined from alleging in its action at law against Simpson any waiver by Simpson of the statute of limitations concerning said notes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-5\">\u201cThe notes sued on contain an agreement on Simpson\u2019s part that in default of payment of the notes the bank may sell the collateral and that Simpson will remain 'responsible, however, for any and all deficiency in payment of principal or interest, and hereby waiving any and every benefit, exemption and privilege under any law now or hereafter to be in force,\u2019 and the quoted clause appears to be what the bill of complaint describes as a waiver of the statute of limitations. If it is so to be construed, the only ground stated in the bill for a restraint against the bank taking advantage of it in its suit at law is the refusal of the bank to sell Simpson\u2019s collateral on his demand and the resultant loss to Simpson. The allegation in the bill of an assignment of claim made by Simpson to the bank two years after that demand and refusal appears to have no relation to the contention that the bank should be enjoined from pleading such waiver.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u201cWhen Simpson deposited his stock with the bank as collateral for payment of his notes, no trust or other fiduciary relationship arose between the parties; the relationship between them was that of pledgor and pledgee <em>(Kurth </em>v. <em>Maier, 133 N. J. Eq. </em>388) and it does not appear that by the conditions under which the bank was to hold the stock the bank obligated itself to make sale thereof, although it had the power to do so. In the absence of such obligation the bank\u2019s duty was merely to exercise ordinary care and it would be liable only for neglect of such care <em>(Franklin Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Goerke, 116 N. J. Law 529). </em>If, on the allegations contained in the bill, failure or refusal by the bank to sell the stock at Simpson\u2019s request or demand constituted negligence or violation of a duty owed by the bank to Simpson, such allegations if proved in the law suit would present a valid defense to that suit <em>(Franklin Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Goerke, 117 N. J. Law 518) </em>and therefore no ground is presented by the bill for equitable intervention on that score. But it would seem that the allegations do not show a valid defense <em>(Franklin Trust Co. </em>v. Goerke, <em>116 N. J. Law 529).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-4\">\u201cThe real question presented by the bill is whether the bank is estopped front setting up in the suit at law, in answer to Simpson\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations, an alleged agreement by Simpson to waive the benefit of the statute. The bill contains no allegation that Simpson was induced by fraud or other unconscionable act on the part of the bank to enter into the waiver provision contained in his notes, but if it were so alleged it would show a defense available to him in the law action <em>(Savage </em>v. <em>Edgar, 86 N. J. Eq. 205; Victor Talking Machine Co. </em>v. Caubre, <em>116 N. J. Eq. 592). </em>Whether by the conditions contained in the notes as quoted above, Simpson agreed not to claim the benefit of the statute is a question which can be determined in the law court. So far as it appears by the bill, Simpson voluntarily made the alleged waiver agreement whereby he is alleged to have agreed, in effect, that in case of his failure to pay his notes he would not require the bank to bring suit against him by reason of his default within six years thereafter. That agreement and the bank\u2019s failure to sell his stock oar his request are separate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>and distinct incidents in tlie transaction between them. It does not seem to me that the bank\u2019s refusal (even if wrongful) to recognize his request to sell his stock, made nearly three years after he had entered into the alleged waiver agreement, works an estoppel against the bank pleading the waiver in the action at law. The statute of limitations is for the benefit of individuals and not to secure general objects of policy; it may be waived by express agreement <em>(Howard </em>v. <em>West Jersey, &amp;c., Railroad </em>Co., <em>102 N. J. Eq. 517; </em>affirmed, <em>104 N. J. Eq. 201).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-4\"><em>\u201cI </em>do not find an equitable cause of action stated in the bill and the motion to strike the bill will be granted.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-5\"><em>Mr. Alex </em>Simpson, <em>pro </em>se, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b397-6\"><em>Mr. Abner </em>W. <em>Feinberg, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b397-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The decree appealed from is affirmed, for the reasons stated in the opinion filed in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-9\"><em>For affirmance </em>\u2014 The Chief-Justice, Bodife, Dofges, Heher, Colie, Waohenfeld, Eastwood, Burling, Wells, Dill, Feeufd, McLean, Schettifo, JJ. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-10\"><em>For reversal </em>\u2014 None.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
