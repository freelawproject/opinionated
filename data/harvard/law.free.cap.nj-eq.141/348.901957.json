The affiants who supply this proof are Charles S. Bush, an engineer of 40 years\u2019 standing; Kenneth C. Eitchie, an engineer of <em>2o </em>years\u2019 standing, and Leslie D. Long, chief engineer of the Newark Testing Laboratories, and the defendant, Abraham J. Neiss, the contractor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b388-12\">\u201cI do not find from the proof before me that the contractor was required to use a binder of stone screenings or gravel. The city reserved the right to order omission of any portion of the work or materials and to make alterations, provided such alterations, in the opinion of the engineer, are consistent with, the general nature of the work. It appears that the city engineer has permitted bank sand\u2019 to be used on a portion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>of the roadway as a binder in the base course of the pavement in place of the trap rock stone dust specified. This, according to the specifications, the engineer could do.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"b389-4\">\u201cInjunction denied.\u201d</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b389-5\"><em>Messrs.
