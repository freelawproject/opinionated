The charge arose from a fight in a crowded barroom. During the fight, complainant, Emmett Williams, was allegedly shot by defendant. The trial court, sitting without a jury, convicted defendant of assault with intent to do great bodily harm less than murder.  The defendant was sentenced to 9-1/2 to 10 years in prison. Defendant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied, and the Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction. (23 Mich App 16.) We granted leave to appeal. (384 Mich 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">During the trial, the following brief colloquy toot place between the assistant prosecutor and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Tatken: </em>May I have the transcript of the examination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Yes, as soon as I finish it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">We have held in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ramsey </em>(1971), 385 Mich 221, that it is reversible error for the trial court, without regard to the statutory provisions of MCLA \u00a7 768.26 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1049), to examine the contents of the transcript of the preliminary examination. Therefore, for the reasons given in the <em>Ramsey </em>case we reverse the conviction of defendant in the instant case and remand for new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b393-9\">T. M. Kavanagh, C.
