Two days after tbe robbery, the victim picked defendant out of a police lineup and later identified him in court. At the conclusion of a nonjury trial, held in the Recorder\u2019s Court of the City of Detroit, defendant was found guilty of armed robbery and subsequently sentenced to five to ten years in prison. The Court of Appeals affirmed. (25 Mich App 576.) We granted leave to appeal. (384 Mich 759.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">Defendant has raised four issues on appeal. However, in view of our disposition of the case, we deem it necessary only to discuss the first issue. After the defendant waived his right to trial by jury, the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-5\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Is the transcript of the preliminary examination available?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage [assistant prosecuting </em>attorney]: Yes, I have it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Do you need it now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage: </em>No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t really need it. I would be very glad to turn it back to the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>I will have a glance at it then if you don\u2019t mind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\"><em>\u201cMr. Sage: </em>All right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-11\">Defendant contends that the trial court committed reversible error in looking at the preliminary examination transcript while sitting as the finder of facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-12\">The relevant statute is MCLA 768.26 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.1049), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">\u201cTestimony taken at an examination, preliminary hearing, or at a former trial of the case, or taken by deposition at the instance of the defendant, may be used by the prosecution whenever the witness giving such testimony can not, for any reason, be produced at the trial, or whenever the witness has, since giv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>ing such testimony become insane or otherwise mentally incapacitated to testify.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">In addition, Recorder\u2019s Court Rule No 8<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b342-5\">\u201cWhenever any Judge shall have acted as Examining Magistrate in any case he shall not be assigned to the trial of that case, except with the expressed consent of counsel for all parties entered upon the record in open Court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The purpose of both the statute and the court rule is to preserve the rights of confrontation and cross-examination and to prevent prejudice by the use of evidence which is not in the record of the trial. <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968), 390 US 719 (88 S Ct 1318, 20 L Ed 2d 255); <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1968), 380 Mich 74. The only exception which is recognized is when it is not possible to produce a witness at the trial after a diligent effort has been made to secure the attendance of such witnesses. <em>People </em>v. <em>Hunley </em>(1946), 313 Mich 688; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne </em>(1940), 293 Mich 15. The present case does not fall within the statutory exception because the complainant, who was the sole witness to the alleged armed robbery, was available and did testify at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The people contend there is no case directly on point that supports defendant\u2019s theory of error. Moreover, the people contend if any error occurred, it was harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">It is true that there is no case precisely on point. However, the policy behind this statute as expressed in both the United States and Michigan Constitutions is clear.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> It is to assure that an accused has a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>right to confront all of the witnesses against him in open court, and to have all of the evidence against him placed in the record at the trial. The revised Recorder\u2019s Court rules reinforce this policy. We, therefore, hold that the trial court committed reversible error when he viewed the transcript of the testimony taken at the preliminary examination while sitting without a jury as the trier of the facts in the case, the transcript not being placed in evidence as provided by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">This case demonstrates the need for an absolute rule in this situation. There is no way to determine whether or not the trial court was prejudiced by \u201cglancing\u201d at the transcript. In fact, it is difficult to determine precisely how much, if any, of the transcript was read by the court, or for what purpose. Therefore, in order to avoid problems of proof on this issue, we hold that as an absolute rule it is reversible error for the trial court sitting without a jury to refer to the transcript of testimony taken at the preliminary examination except under the exceptions provided by statute. A jury, if impanelled, would not be aware of the testimony taken at a preliminary examination except under the provisions of the statute. A trial judge, sitting as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>the trier of the facts, can assume no greater prerogatives than a jury if a jury were impanelled to determine the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">The trial court and the Court of Appeals are reversed and the case is remanded for new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b344-6\">T.
