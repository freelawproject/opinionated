There is a special relationship between the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>community policed and a policeman. A policeman\u2019s very presence, whether actually performing a specified duty during assigned hours, or engaged in any other activity during off-duty hours, provides a trained person immediately available for enforcement purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Policemen are required by department order to be armed at all times, and why is this ? Simply because by such requirement they are, no matter where they are or what they are doing, immediately prepared to perform their duties. They are charged with law enforcement in the City of Detroit, and obviously must be physically present to perform their duties. The police force is a semi-military organization subject at all times to immediate mobilization, which distinguishes this type of employment from every other in the classified service.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">I would reverse the decision of the trial court and hold that Ordinance 327-Gr is valid in its totality.</p>\n<judges id=\"b641-6\">T.

I cannot agree with the conclusion of my Brother Williams.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-8\">He would hold that the residency ordinance invidiously discriminates against police' officers, because no waiver is permitted for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-9\">By striking the words \u201cpolice officers\u201d from the first sentence of the ordinance, my Brother would simply amend the ordinance to eliminate all residence requirements for police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-10\">What remains is a requirement that firemen and all other classified employees must reside in the city unless they obtain waivers, but <em>policemen are free to live elsewhere without waivers.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b642-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>Having concluded that policemen have been discriminated against, he would correct the situation by discrimination in their favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\">Personally, I disagree with the major premise. I find nothing invidious about the classification which requires police officers to be residents of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">That classification amounts to nothing more than a legislative determination that the nature of a police officer\u2019s work is such that he ought to be a resident of the city.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">One of the most sensitive problems in law enforcement today is the relationship between the police and the black community. Over 40% of the people of Detroit are black. Less than 10% of the population of suburban Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties is black.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">The Common Council of the City of Detroit has made a difficult legislative judgment, weighing the desirability of having a resident police force on the streets against the detriment of losing many experienced, dedicated and courageous officers who choose to live in the suburbs.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">The common council has chosen a course which will make it more difficult to recruit policemen and keep them. But it has also chosen a course which will make recruitment of black officers more imperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The residency requirement is not designed solely to assure that the officer has a greater stake in the city. It is also intended to bring about a more cooperative attitude among the citizenry with whom the police are in daily contact.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-10\">The common council wants \u2014 desperately needs\u2014 to promote a feeling of trust, confidence and fraternity between the people of Detroit and their police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"525\">*525</page-number>In that respect and in this time, the constabulary is unique among the municipal departments.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">Special treatment of police residency puts them in the category of the judges and other elected officials of the city.

The first is whether the Detroit Common Council can legislate a residency requirement for city employees that includes city police \u2014 or whether any residency requirement for policemen is the exclusive authority of the Detroit Police Commissioner. The second is whether the common council has legal authority to legislate a residency requirement for city employees. The third is the validity of Detroit Ordinance 327-G (\u00a7\u00a7 2-1-1.1-2-1-1.3 of the Municipal Code of the City of Detroit) which unqualifiedly required its police officers to reside in the city while permitting the residence requirement to be waived under certain conditions for most other city employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b643-10\">Ordinance 327-G was unanimously adopted by the Common Council of the City of Detroit on May 17, 1968, after a public hearing, and became effective on J une 8,1968. It reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-11\">\u201cSec. 2-1-1.2. Residence construed to be actual domicile. Residence shall be construed to be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"526\">*526</page-number>actual domicile of the individual where he normally eats and sleeps and maintains his normal personal and household effects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-6\">\u201cSec. 2-\u00cd-1.3.

All police officers, appointees in the unclassified service, except the director of the zoo and superintendent of the House of Corrections, and all persons working in any branch of the classified service of the city shall reside in the city. The civil service commission may waive the residency requirement for employment in the classified service upon a finding that such waiver would serve the best interest of the city. When waiving the residency requirement, the civil service commission shall base their determination upon: (1) The nature of the work. (2) The location of the work, and (3) All other pertinent facts concerning employment. The Commission shall promptly report any waiver of residency requirement to the mayor and the common council.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">Plaintiff, Detroit Police Officers Association, hereinafter called D.P.O.A., is the recognized and exclusive collective bargaining representative of the approximately 3,200 patrolmen and policewomen who are employed by the Police Department of the City of Detroit, most of whom are members of plaintiff D.P.O.A. Of the individual plaintiffs, plaintiff Whall is a resident of the City of Detroit and desires to move his residence outside of the city. Plaintiff Mierzejewski is a resident of the City of Lincoln Park, Michigan. Plaintiff O\u2019Reilly is a resident of Redford Township, Michigan. All of the individual plaintiffs are patrolmen employed by the Police Department of the City of Detroit and are members of plaintiff D.P.O.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">Plaintiffs contend that the ordinance in question is an infringement of the powers delegated to the police commissioner by the Charter of the City of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>Detroit, that it is beyond the scope of the powers granted to the common council by the charter to enact an ordinance requiring all police officers to reside in the city and that the instant ordinance is a violation of the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">The trial court held that the residency requirement of Ordinance 327-G attempts to regulate the internal rules and regulations of the police department and contravenes the city charter which places the power to make these rules in the police commissioner. The trial court also held that the ordinance discriminates arbitrarily against police officer's as contrasted with all other city employees by denying them the same conditional waiver of residency and in so doing denies them the full protection of the laws. From the decision of the trial court, leave to appeal directly was granted by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">With respect to plaintiff\u2019s claim that Detroit Ordinance, 327-G is an infringement of the powers of the Detroit Police Commissioner, the powers and duties of both the common council and the police commissioner are defined in the Charter of the City of Detroit. It is to that document that we must look in determining the relationship between the common council and the Commissioner of Police.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">The common council is vested by the charter with the legislative power of the city.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Its legislative powers and duties include the following among others :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b645-8\">1. \u201cTo enact ordinances to carry into effect the powers conferred and the duties imposed upon the city by the constitution and the laws of the state, to make operative the provisions of this charter and to promote the general peace, health, safety, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"528\">*528</page-number>welfare and good government of the city * . * * \u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-6\">2. \u201cTo execute all legislative powers of the city including the power to adopt, continue, amend and repeal city ordinances * * * \u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-7\">3. to \u201cenact such ordinances as may he necessary to carry out the provisions\u201d of specified chapters dealing with the powers and duties of various executive officers and departments,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> one of which is the chapter dealing with the office of Commissioner of Police.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-8\">The Commissioner of Police, on the other hand, is an officer of the executive branch, \u201cwho shall he appointed by the mayor and who shall have charge of the police department.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The charter provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-9\">\u201cThe powers and duties of the commissioner which shall be exercised and performed as herein provided and in accordance with the laws of the state and the ordinances of the city, shall he as follows :</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-10\">\u201c(a) He shall assume and exercise supervision over the police department and make all proper rules for the government and discipline thereof;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABq\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-11\">\u201c(d) May change the titles of police officers and employees under him, except deputies, designating such titles as he may see fit, creating whatever offices and positions he may deem necessary for the proper organization and conduct of the department.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-12\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-14\">\u201c(m) Shall have such other powers as are herein prescribed or may he necessary hereunder for the proper discharge of his duties.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b647-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number>In addition, the police commissioner has whatever additional duties, liabilities, rights and powers not inconsistent with the charter as the common council may prescribe by ordinance.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">The above cited section of the charter specifically makes the powers and duties of the police commissioner subject to the ordinances of the city. This language is not dissimilar to language governing the duties and powers of other officers of the executive branch, whose duties and powers must be exercised \u201cin accordance with the general ordinances of the city.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These officers include the Commissioner of Public Works,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Parks and Recreation Commissioner,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the City Planning Commissioner,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Public Lighting Commission,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> the Board of Water Commissioners,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> the Board of Health,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> the Board of Fire Commissioners,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> the Commissioner of Buildings and Safety Engineering,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Arts Commission,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the Commissioner of Purchases and Supplies,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the Board of Commissioners of the House of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Correction,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> the Corporation Counsel,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> the Zoological Park Commission,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the Civic Center Commission,<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> the Detroit Historical Commission,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the Streets and Traffic Commission.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The language above is identical to that governing the exercise of powers and duties of the Public Welfare Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">No intent to except the police commissioner from the operation of validly enacted city ordinances can be gleaned from the language of the charter. Consequently, if a residency requirement for most city employees is within the legislative powers of the common council granted by the charter, police officers as well as other city employees are subject to the requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-7\">III</p>\n<p id=\"b648-8\">As to the second issue, the common council authority to enact Ordinance 327-G, the pertinent legislative powers granted by the charter to the common council are listed above. Included among them is the power \u201cto enact ordinances * * * to promote the general * * * health, safety, welfare and good government of the city\u201d and \u201cto exercise all legislative powers of the city.\u201d A determination that to require most of the employees of the city to reside in the city would promote the \u201cgeneral health, safety, welfare and good government of the city\u201d is the kind of policy determination that a legislative body is empowered to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">This Court in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Civil Service Commission of the City of Detroit </em>(1970), 383 Mich 507, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>upheld a similar residency requirement. Rule VII of the Civil Service Commission of the City of Detroit imposed a residence requirement upon all persons in the city civil service. It was subject to waiver, if the interest of the city would he best served and justice to the employee so required for upholding the requirement, this Court said (pp 517, 518):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b649-4\">\u201cTherefore, the question of whether or not to make residence within a city a condition of public employment is one which must he largely addressed to the legislative branch of government. This is not to say that under all circumstances such a requirement would he reasonable and valid.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The legislative power of the city is vested exclusively in the common council. Accordingly, under the charter and subject to the equal protection limitations discussed later, the council\u2019s policy decision was within the bounds of legislative discretion. The requirement of residence within the city for most city employees thus became one of those \u201cordinances of the city\u201d in accordance with which the powers of the police commissioner must be exercised and his duties must be performed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">We turn now to the third question of whether Ordinance 327-0 violates the equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article 1 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963. The ordinance makes residence within the city a mandatory condition of employment for all police officers of the City of Detroit. For police officers, there are no exceptions to this requirement. The residence requirement may he waived, however, for persons in any branch of the classified service. Such a waiver is conditioned upon a finding that, in an individual case, a waiver would serve the best interest of the city, considering the nature of the employee\u2019s work, the location of his work and all other pertinent facts concerning employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Under the classification established by the ordinance, a waiver is allowed to persons in any branch of the classified service when it \u201cwould serve the best interest of the city,\u201d but is denied categorically to police officers. To uphold the classification, it must be based upon a real and substantial difference having reasonable relation to the object of the legislation. As stated in <em>Rinaldi </em>v. <em>Yeager </em>(1966), 384 US 305, 308, 309:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>\u201cThe Equal Protection Clause requires more of a state law than nondiscriminatory application within the class it establishes. <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Florida </em>[1964], 379 US 184, 189, 190 [85 S Ct 283, 13 L Ed 2d 222]. It also imposes a requirement of some rationality in the nature of the class singled out. To be sure, the constitutional demand is not a demand that a statute necessarily apply equally to all persons. \u2018The Constitution does not require things which are different in fact . . . to be treated in law as though they were the same.\u2019 <em>Tigner </em>v. <em>Texas </em>[1940], 310 US 141, 147 [60 S Ct 879, 84 L Ed 1124]. Hence, legislation may impose special burdens upon defined classes in order to achieve permissible ends. But the Equal Protection Clause does require that, in defining a class subject to legislation, the distinctions that are drawn have \u2018some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made.\u2019 <em>Baxstrom </em>v. <em>Herold </em>[1966], 383 US 107, 111 [86 S Ct 760, 15 L Ed 2d 620]; <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Rash </em>[1965], 380 US 89, 93 [85 S Ct 775, 13 L Ed 2d 675]; <em>Louisville Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>[1928], 277 US 32, 37 [48 S Ct 423, 72 L Ed 770]; <em>Royster Guano Co. </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>[1920], 253 US 412, 415 [40 S Ct 560, 64 L Ed 989].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">This constitutional test has been reiterated by this Court in <em>Tracer </em>v. <em>Bushre </em>(1968), 381 Mich 282, 286, 287:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b651-7\">\u201c \u2018These constitutional provisions [the Federal and state equal protection clauses] do not mean that there can be no classification in the application of statutes and ordinances, but only that the classification must be based on natural distinguishing characteristics and must bear a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation.\u2019 <em>Cook Coffee Co. </em>v. <em>Village of Flushing </em>(1934), 267 Mich 131, p. 134.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">The enactment of the residence requirement represents a decision by common council that certain benefits are acquired for the city by requiring most <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>city employees to reside within the municipality.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> It then, hy allowing a waiver of the residence requirement when waiver is in the best interest of the city, implicitly states that, in an individual case, the benefits attained for the city by allowing a waiver outweigh the assumed detriment of an employee\u2019s outside residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">By asserting that even when a waiver is in the best interest of the city and that even when it is allowed to an employee in the classified service under the same circumstances, a waiver will be denied to a police officer solely because he is a police officer, the ordinance is self-defeating. Such a classification is devoid of rationality. Any legitimate governmental purpose must be in the best interest of the city. By denying that which is in the best interest of the city to police officers the classification foregoes any claim it might have to a reasonable relation to a legitimate governmental purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">The city argues that the ordinance does nothing more than recognize the facts of a policeman\u2019s employment which in its normal course, is never outside the boundaries of the city. Hence, says the city, since waivers are only allowed for work-related exceptions there is no reason to permit a waiver for police officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">Policemen in their relation to the location of their work are substantially similar to firemen, who are in the classified service and have an opportunity for waiver of residence. Both work substantially within the city and both may be called out of the city <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>in the performance of their duties as a result of the mutual aid pact between Detroit and several nearby municipalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">However, even if the city\u2019s view of the peculiar locational requirements of a policeman\u2019s work is accepted, the ordinance cannot be read so narrowly as the city suggests. Location of employment is only one of the factors to be considered in determining whether a waiver will be granted to classified service employees. The civil service commission in considering a waiver can also consider the nature of the employee\u2019s work and \u201call other pertinent facts considering employment.\u201d This language on its face gives broad discretion to the civil service commission to inquire into the circumstances of each individual case, location of work being only one of these circumstances, and arrive at a solution that will genuinely \u201cserve the best interest of the city.\u201d Such an inquiry can, for example, balance the benefits obtained to the city by the retention of a competent, industrious employee who, due to some family hardship, is forced to live across the municipal line, against the assumed detriment of his outside residence if a waiver would serve the best interest of the city, it is granted to an employee of the classified service. A competent, industrious policeman under the same circumstances when faced with the same situation is now denied the benefit of this kind of determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">As well as being definitionally detrimental to the city the classification\u2019s denial of a waiver to police officers which is in the best interest of the city while at the same time granting such a waiver to employees of classified service denies to police officers the equal protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">We are thus faced with a situation in which that portion of Ordinance 327-0 which applies to police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>officers is unconstitutional. Sec. 1-1-6 of the Municipal Code of the City of Detroit provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-4\">\u201cShould any section, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or word of this Code be declared invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity or unconstitutionality shall not affect any of the remaining words, phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs or sections of this Code, since the same would have been enacted by the common council without the incorporation in this code of such invalid or unconstitutional word, phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph or section.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">The spirit of the above cited provision is that when a portion of an ordinance is declared unconstitutional, those portions of the ordinance not declared unconstitutional are to be saved if at all possible in light of the ordinance\u2019s purpose. By excepting police officers from the application of the ordinance, we can fulfill the common council\u2019s desire to leave that portion of the ordinance not declared unconstitutional unaffected. Therefore, we hold that the words \u201cpolice officers\u201d in the first sentence of \u00a7 2-1-1.3 of the Municipal Code of the City of Detroit are unconstitutional, void and of no effect and leave the rest of the ordinance intact.
