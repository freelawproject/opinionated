Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aya\">The opinion of Judge Holbrook for the Court of Appeals succinctly postures this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">\u201cDefendants Johnnie Sylvester Gardner and Wavie R. Williams, Jr., were tried in a joint trial and convicted by a jury in the recorder\u2019s court for the city of Detroit, on June 16, 1967, of the crime of assault with intent to rob and steal being armed (CL 1948, \u00a7 750.89 [Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 28.284]) and the crime of assault with intent to commit murder (CL 1948, \u00a7 750.83 [Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7 28-.278]). Both defendants were represented at the trial by the same retained counsel. Neither defendant took the witness stand. Defendant Gardner was sentenced to prison for a term of 11 to 20 years and defendant Williams for a term of 17 to 35 years. Evidence was presented by the prosecution showing that on the evening of November 11, 1966, three men entered the Y and B Market, armed with pistols, and proceeded to demand money from owner Albert Yezbick and his son, Victor Yezbick. They departed after one of the men shot and wounded Albert Yezbick. Victor Yezbick, using a gun which was kept in the store, fired three shots at the men as they fled onto Milwaukee street from John R. street. A passerby, Thomas Phelan, armed under a concealed weapon permit, testified to having chased the three men on foot after they fled from the store brandishing weapons, with Phelan firing shots at them and at the get-away car located on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>Milwaukee, around the corner from the Y and B Market. Both described the get-away car as a blue Oldsmobile convertible with white top.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-4\">\u201cWitness Phelan testified on direct examination in part as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">\u201c <em>\u2018Q. </em>Do you know if there was anyone in the car, in the Oldsmobile, when they ran to it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\"><em>\u201c \u2018A. </em>Yes, there was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">\u201c <em>\u2018Q. </em>When they got in there would be four persons altogether?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\"><em>\u2018\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-9\"><em>\u201c \u2018Q. </em>Could you identify the person that was in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-10\"><em>\u201c\u2018A. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-11\"><em>\u201c \u2018Q. </em>What did you do then when they got in the car?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-12\"><em>\u201c\u2018A. </em>I opened fire on the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-13\"><em>\u201c \u2018Q. </em>How many shots in all did you fire?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-14\"><em>\u201c \u2018A. </em>Six; one in the tire, one in the bumper, three into the trunk and one in the back window.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-15\">\u201cA 1960 Oldsmobile meeting this description was examined by a patrolman at a Detroit motel on December 3, 1966. He testified that the car contained numerous holes in the body, appearing to be bullet holes, and in the convertible top, side and rear view mirror. Defendant Gardner, taken into custody at that time, stated to the patrolman that the car in question was his. The car was subsequently determined to have been registered to a John S. Gardner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-16\">\u201cWiley Richardson, Jr., owner of a service station a block from the scene of the crime testified that he had identified defendant Gardner in a lineup sometime after November 11, 1966, \u2018maybe about a week later, two weeks later, * * * I couldn\u2019t recall.\u2019 The witness identified Gardner again, at the trial, as having entered his station on foot at approximately 6 o\u2019clock on the night in question accompanied by two companions. Gardner asked to use the rest room, got the key and went to the outside rest room. The witness testified that after Gardner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>brought the key back the witness looked out the window and saw three men going toward the Y and B Market. He did not know whether Gardner was one of the three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">\u201cDefendant Gardner was not identified as having been in the Y and B Market at the time of the offense. Defendant Williams was identified by Victor Yezbick in a lineup and again at trial. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-6\">\u201c[A] customer who was in the store when the three armed men entered, identified Williams as having been one of the three men.\u201d (19 Mich App 291, 294-298 [1969].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">The testimony of the police officer who questioned Gardner at the time he was taken into custody was in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He told me that he was driving \u2014 that, We were driving down John R.\u2019 and they pulled over at Milwaukee and John R, I believe it was, so that he could go to the bathroom. He told me that he went into the bathroom, came back to the car, and when he came back to the car Wavie Williams, Herbert Farmer and John Anthony said they were going to the store to get some beer to check it out. He told me that he was scared and that he said he asked them what they were going to do, and they walked on to the store. He stated that he remained in his car. He walked back to the corner, got out of the car once and walked back to the corner and looked around the corner and he saw guns coming out and heard all of this shooting. He stated at this time that he got scared and ran and got into his car and started it up and attempted to pull away from the curb. I believe he stated that he had a little trouble getting out. I don\u2019t know if because of the parked cars or what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">\u201cBut by this time he heard all the shooting and Wavie Williams came and got in the car and he asked him, \u2018Man, what have you done <em>V </em>and he stated, \u2018Get out of here quick.\u2019 And Wavie Williams was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>followed in the car hy John Anthony, and at this time he almost pulled away hut Herbert Farmer jumped in and at the last minute, and he stated that bullets were flying everywhere and one flew by his head and one went by the right window and either bullets or glass nicked Herbert Farmer on the head and he stated that he drove home at this time and told his wife that he was in serious trouble or that the car was in serious trouble. I don\u2019t remember which. And he asked her to report it stolen, which she did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">The Court of Appeals affirmed defendant Gardner\u2019s conviction and although four errors were asserted on appeal, we find three to he without merit: 1) defendant\u2019s \u201cexculpatory statement\u201d was improperly admitted, 2) there is no evidence of common enterprise, 3) the evidence, being entirely circumstantial does not negative every theory of innocence consistent with the facts proven.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The trial court\u2019s instruction accurately and adequately covered the elements of intent and common enterprise and if the jury believed the witnesses produced, there is ample evidence from which to infer defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">Regarding the \u201cexculpatory statement\u201d of the defendant Gardner which was recounted by the police officer, there appears no evidence of physiological or psychological coercion in obtaining it, and the testimony that defendant\u2019s rights were fully explained to him before he told his story was unrebutted. We conclude that no error was committed in receiving the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">The one asserted error which requires our reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction, however, is complex and convoluted.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">The defendant\u2019s appellate counsel states it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-10\">\u201c(a) Joint representation by single retained counsel of Defendant Gardner and his co-defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>ant was reversible error where the defenses of the two parties charged were inconsistent and conflicting and where Gardner\u2019s representations was undoubtedly not as effective as it might have been if single counsel with undivided loyalties had represented him, and where there was no intelligent and knowing waiver of Gardner\u2019s right to effective assistance of counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-4\">(1) If counsel\u2019s joint representation of co-defendants with conflicting interest is not deemed reversible error, then Defendant Gardner for this and other reasons was denied his constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">This very statement of the claimed error underscores the unacceptability of the course of conduct pursued here.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">\n<em>No inconsistent defenses were offered by defense counsel, and the trial court\u2019s instructions to the jury that they were offered is the error we find requiring reversal.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">The formal defenses offered on behalf of both defendants were simply their pleas of not guilty. Such plea puts in issue every element of the crime, and by itself advances no explanation or exculpatory theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">When the trial court charged the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">\u201cOn the other hand, it is the defendant\u2019s position that he indeed drove the automobile away but he did so after he heard the shots and he was getting away from the danger; that he did not know that the defendants, the other individuals rather, were going into the store to plan this robbery and he did not wait there and he did not flee as a result of waiting for them and all jointly agree [sic] to flee; he was leaving on his own and he had difficulty getting away from the curb and the time it took for him to get away from the curb, in this time, the other persons involved in the robbery jumped in the automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>bile without his planning it or without any preconceived knowledge that that was going to occur this way,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">he misstated defendant Gardner\u2019s position. This was error. See <em>People </em>v. <em>King </em>(1970), 384 Mich 310.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">If this error was not induced it was at least occasioned by the circumstances of joint representation of two defendants with <em>potentially </em>conflicting defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">This potentiality of conflicting defenses is the root of the problem here and it raises such fundamental questions that we deem it necessary to address ourselves to it, for it is apparent that the jury received this case as though conflicting defenses had been pleaded. Even though the courts\u2019 posturing of it so was error, we are convinced that no other reasonable inference could be drawn from the unrebutted testimony of the people\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">As the record stands in this case, even without the erroneous instruction, defendant Gardner did not have the effective assistance of counsel contemplated by the Michigan and United States Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">He could have waived it and perhaps he did, but the record before us will not support a conclusion of waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">The ease of <em>People </em>v. <em>Degraffenreid </em>(1969), 19 Mich App 702 contains an exhaustive and illuminating discussion of the difference between the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of due process and the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel <em>vis-a-vis </em>trial errors and incompetence of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">In light of the statements of defense counsel in his colloquies with the court about the court\u2019s jury instructions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>\u201cHere is the position that I am in. I am representing two defendants. If I am taking this position with one defendant [Gardner] I am more or less sabotaging the other by admitting he was there,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201cI have one [objection]. That is the Court\u2019s charge that it is the defendant\u2019s position that Mr. Gardner was in the car and driving away and he did not have knowledge of the events that transpired before he drove away. That would prejudice my other client. In other words, for Mr. Gardner to be in the car and not know the events that took place and considering his position, it would be inconsistent representing both defendants to assume that Mr. Gardner didn\u2019t know what was happening but yet Mr. Williams was there and was in the store. It is Mr. Williams\u2019 position he was not there,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">as well as his observation in closing argument attempting to minimize the effect of Gardner\u2019s statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-8\">\u201cNow, we can all remember experiences when we were children perhaps, when we got cornered for something we weren\u2019t responsible for and sometimes some of us may have made alibis, perfectly innocent of what we were accused of. We made alibis and then got tripped up on the alibis. But that does not mean that you are responsible for the basic premise, for the charge in question.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-9\">We are led inexorably to the conclusion that defense counsel recognized the inconsistencies of the defenses <em>as they must appear to the jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-10\">This fact alone effectively deprived the defendant of the benefit of the undivided loyalty of his counsel that the Constitutions assure him is his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-11\">For the error in instruction above described the conviction of defendant Gardner is set aside and the matter remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>T.

I agree with our standard majority when its members say that three of the four errors assigned by defendant Gardner are without merit. As for that defendant\u2019s fourth assignment, I agree again with the Brethren four when they say that it is \u201ccomplex and convoluted\u201d (What magnificent understatement! See it quoted, <em>ante </em>at p 397). There our agreement ends.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">The fourth assignment, upon which the majority relies for disposition of this latest appeal from an affirmed conviction for serious felony, is that defendant Gardner was denied the effective assistance of counsel, citing <em>Glasser </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1942), 315 US 60 (62 S Ct 457, 86 L Ed 680).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">For my part, I am satisfied that Division 1 considered, reasoned and decided the fourth assignment properly, and that it is equally without merit.
