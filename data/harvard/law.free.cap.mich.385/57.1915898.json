Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3u\">This appeal presents a very-simple question but it is fraught with great danger to the public weal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The question is: Was the trial court in error in refusing to grant defendant\u2019s motion for a Judgment notwithstanding the jury\u2019s verdict for the plaintiffs ?</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">The defendants are skilled surgeons who performed a relatively complicated operation on plaintiff Richard Guilmet, and after such operation the plaintiffs suffered very great damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The danger attendant upon decision here is that on one hand if we sanction the award of damages to the plaintiffs we may foster suits which threaten the freedom physicians and surgeons must have in the practice of their vital profession, and on the other hand if we deprive these plaintiffs of their award, we not only may do them an injustice but impair the very process by which we seek to administer justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">The facts and circumstances giving rise to the suit are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">In the fall of 1963 the plaintiff had suffered near fatal bleeding through a peptic ulcer. At that time he was being treated by Dr. Klewicki and it was Dr. Klewicki who recommended the defendant surgeons. In January of 1964 the plaintiff went to see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>the surgeon \u201c * <em>* * </em>curious about an operation, if I should have one or if I shouldn\u2019t have one * * * It was never indicated to the plaintiff that he <em>must </em>have the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Defendant Dr. Campbell testified that prior to the operation the plaintiff was in excellent physical condition and the operation was <em>not </em>an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">At the first consultation with the defendant, Dr. Campbell, the following conversation took place according to the plaintiff\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now what was the nature of the conversation? Did you state your purpose in being there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I asked Dr. Campbell \u2014 I was curious about an operation, if I should have one or if I shouldn\u2019t have one, I told him. He knew of my records. I started to tell him about my records. He said, \u2018I know all about your records.\u2019 I said, \u2018Fine.\u2019 He told me, he said, <em>\u2018Once you have an operation, it takes care of all of your </em>troubles/ and he said, <em>\u2018You can eat as you want to, you can drink as you want to, you can go as you please.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>This type of operation we are talking about then is a stomach or an ulcer operation, is that right ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you talk with him at all about his familiarity with this type of operation or the extent of the operation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was the conversation as you recall it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, he explained to me how they do this operation, and at that time he told me that him and his associate, Dr. Arena, were specialists, <em>and there was nothing to it at all. It was a very simple operation according to them.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did he talk at all about whether he had performed these before?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>And what was the conversation along those lines ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I asked him how often. He said, <em>\u2018Very often.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Any discussion as to complications or problems that may arise, that may result?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I asked him about it, how long I\u2019d be out of work. He said, \u2018Approximately <em>three to four weeks at the most,\u2019 </em>and I asked him about any complications, anything dangerous. He said, <em>\u2018No, there is no danger at all in this operation.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was there any discussion as to where it would take place, how long you\u2019d be convalescing in the hospital?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>He said \u2018Beaumont Hospital.\u2019 I\u2019d probably be in four to five days and <em>then I\u2019d be off work maybe another two to three weeks.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You say he was familiar with your background. Was he aware that you were taking various medications, Maalox and things of this nature ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, he was.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You had been taking these pills for a number of months, had you not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was the discussion about the future use of medication f</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-14\">\u201cA. Well, he said, \u2018after <em>this operation, you can throw your pillbox away, your Maalox you can throw away,\u2019 </em>and then he come up with an example.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Give the example.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The example was that <em>\u2018In twenty years if you could figure out what you spent for Maalox pills and doctors calls, you could buy an awful lot. Weigh it against an operation.\u2019</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Was there any conversation with him as to operations he had performed on other individuals who had treated for a while?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. He told me, he never mentioned no names. He just told me of a gentleman that he knows treated for an ulcer thirty years and he went <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>in, had this operation, <em>and he is altogether a different man at this time.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now at the time of the conversation were you back to work?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, I was.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Following this conversation the plaintiff Richard Guilmet underwent the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">The record contains a stark description of the troubles that thereafter befell him.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">The record description of the vagotomy reveals activity around and on the esophagus. On March 4, 1964 the day following the operation Dr. Wood\u2014 a specialist in thoracic surgery on the staff of Beaumont Hospital examined plaintiff and diagnosed : \u201cRuptured esophagus due to surgical trauma in doing the vagotomy with bilateral effusion and mediastinal emphysema and mediastinitis.\u201d Dr. Wood testified that the symptoms displayed by the patient would cause him concern, that the mortality rate from a ruptured esophagus is 50% to 75%.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">After the original operation plaintiff went through three subsequent operations for the insertion of tubes to drain excess fluid from his body; he suffered hepatitis which the defendant Dr. Campbell thought was probably caused by one of the many pints of blood he had been given; due to plaintiff\u2019s constant coughing and vomiting when eating, his weight fell from 170 pounds to 88 pounds and he was unrecognizable; he was unable to sleep due to coughing and only a return to the hospital and insertion of a drainage tube enabled him to sleep; and finally, he is scarred badly from the operations; he is unable to hold down two jobs as he once could; he is physically weak and unable to be athletically or socially active, and Dr. Wood <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>testified that it is not unusual for recurrences of one of his infections as long as 20 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">The plaintiffs brought suit for their damages in a two count complaint. One count asserted negligence on the part of the defendants in performing the operation, and the other count charged a breach of contract saying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201c4. That in January of 1964, Plaintiff, Richard A. Guilmet, for good and valuable consideration, entered into an agreement with Defendants to perform an operation known as a gastric resection upon Plaintiff and to administer subsequent post-operative care; that thereupon Defendants in furtherance of their contract jointly undertook to examine, diagnose, treat and operate upon and care for Plaintiff so as to cure him of the stomach disorder from which he was then suffering.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">At the conclusion of proofs, overruling a defense motion for a directed verdict, the trial court sent the case to the jury and stated in his ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cTurning to the matter of contract, it is true that Plaintiff Richard Guilmet, in his testimony, direct testimony, said that he talked with Dr. Campbell and Dr. Campbell said the operation would take care of all his troubles, and he could do as he pleased afterwards; that it was a simple operation, said that he performed it very often and he would be out of work four weeks and there was no danger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">\u201cNow again, this Court would doubt whether those statements were all made, particularly after having listened to the Doctor, and while it is true that the Doctor is not required to guarantee his work, I suppose there is no reason why a medical doctor can\u2019t do that if he wishes, as well as any other person, so there is testimony here from which the Jury might reasonably infer that a contract was made to do these things as Mr. Guilmet testified, and I guess Dr. Campbell would be the first to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>admit that it was far more than four weeks before this man did go back and there must be a great danger involved as a matter of practical fact, and that apparently the Plaintiff, Mr. Guilmet, has not been able to throw away his pill box since he recovered.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-5\">\u201cWell, the record indicates, according to my notes that Plaintiff Richard Guilmet had a conversation with Dr. Campbell prior to the operation, and that Dr. Campbell said that the operation would take care of all troubles and that he could go as he pleased afterwards, and it would be a simple operation ; that he had performed many before and that the Plaintiff would not be out of work more than four weeks, there was no danger, and he\u2019d be in the hospital four to five days, and he could throw the pill box away after the operation, and told of other successful operations. <em>* * * if tfoig conversation and if the Jury accepts it, they would be in position to conclude that this Defendant Doctor had assured the plaintiff of the success of his operation, and having failed in that respect, they would be liable for </em>damages(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The jury returned a verdict of \u201cno negligence\u201d on the tort count but awarded the plaintiffs $50,000 on the breach of contract count.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Following this verdict the defendants moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, and the trial court denied it.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">This decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeals and we granted leave in light of our conviction that it raised questions of the indicated significance to the jurisprudence of this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The defendants argue on appeal that \u201cto establish a <em>special </em>contract to effect a cure plaintiff must prove a clear and enforceable promise, within the contemplation of the parties, supported by a <em>special </em>consideration, followed by reliance.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b185-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>The distracting aspect of casting the question thus is that the plaintiffs never asserted a \u201cspecial contract\u201d.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> They claim, on the contrary, that the observations and descriptions of the result which the defendant made were promises to achieve that specific end, and were inducements upon which plantiff, Richard Gruilmet, relied in proceeding with the operation. They characterize it as an undertaking to \u201ccure\u201d him of the stomach disorder from which he was then suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">This appellation of \u201ccure\u201d may be unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">The parties when contracting never used the word \u201ccure\u201d and the mere elimination of a troublesome condition may not always be properly so designated. For example, a headache may be eliminated by decapitation but no one seriously suggests that it is a \u201ccure.\u201d Similarity the substitution of a different stomach disorder for a specific one is not property called a \u201ccure\u201d of the original ailment.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">The gravamen of the plaintiffs\u2019 breach of contract complaint is that: 1) The following is the gist of what the defendants told him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>\u201cOnce you have an operation it takes care of all your troubles. You can eat as you want to, you can drink as you want to, you can go as you please. Dr. Arena and I are specialists, there is nothing to it at all \u2014 it\u2019s a very simple operation. You\u2019ll be out of work three to four weeks at the most. There is no danger at all in this operation. After the operation you can throw away your pill box. In twenty years if you figure out what you spent for Maalox pills and doctor calls, you could buy an awful lot. Weigh it against an operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">2) That this amounted to an offer of a contract to achieve by the operation the condition described.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">3) That in reliance on the description, the plaintiff accepted the offer, and in breach of the contract the condition described did not result.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">In effect by their motion for judgment N.O.V., the defendants ask the court to rule as a matter of law that such statements by defendant <em>before the parties had contracted for the operation </em>as to the danger, convalescence, and result can <em>not </em>be regarded as a term of a contract between a physician and his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">This we will not do for we agree with Mr. Justice Cooley when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-9\">\u201c <em>* </em>* * where the terms of a negotiation are left to oral proofs, the question what the parties said and did, and what they intended should be understood thereby, is single and cannot be separated so as to refer one part to the jury and another part to the judge; but in its entirety the question is one of fact. <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Saunders </em>[1867], 15 Mich 339; <em>Maas </em>v. <em>White </em>[1877], 37 Mich 126; <em>Estate of Young </em>[1878], 39 Mich 429; <em>Engle </em>v. <em>Campbell </em>[1880], 42 Mich 565.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-10\"><em>McKenzie </em>v. <em>Sykes </em>(1882), 47 Mich 294, 295, 296.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>We hold that the terms of a contract, when contested, are for the jury\u2019s determination. This is true even when the evidence of the terms is uncontradicted. See <em>Boyer </em>v. <em>Joyal </em>(1911), 164 Mich 662.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">We recognize that what we hold is sometimes made clearer by stating what we do not hold. Here we do not say that everytime a doctor says to his patient prior to the formation of their contract for example, \u201cI recommend an immediate appendectomy. It will fix you up fine. You will be back at work in no time. Do not worry about it \u2014 I have done hundreds of these operations. It is really a very simple thing.\u201d It may be said that he contracted to \u201ccure\u201d his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">What we are saying is that under some circumstances the trier of fact might conclude that a doctor so speaking did contract to \u201ccure\u201d his patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">What was said, and the circumstances under which it was said always determines whether there was a contract at all and if so what it was. These matters are always for the determination of the fact finder. <em>(Strong </em>v. <em>Saunders, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">Justice Talbot Smith in <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Rudner </em>(1957), 349 Mich 459, 467, 468 articulated our concern for the sensitivity of this area of engagement, when he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">\u201cA doctor and his patient, of course, have the same general liberty to contract with respect to their relationship as other parties entering into consensual relationship with one another, and a breach thereof will give rise to a cause of action. It is proper to note, with respect to the contracts of physicians, that certain qualitative differences should be observed, since the doctor\u2019s therapeutic reassurance that his patient will be all right, not to worry, must not be converted into a binding promise by the disappointed or quarrelsome.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>This sound counsel, however, should not he read to import a different standard to this relationship than to any other. It merely stresses the importance of circumstances in determining the effect of words in establishing a contract. The qualitative difference between the relationship of a physician and his patient and the relationship between a shopkeeper and his customer is a significant circumstance the fact finder must remember in assaying their respective words of undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In this case the trial judge instructed the jury in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">\u201cNow, on the other hand, the two doctors take the position first of all, that they did not enter into a contract to effect a cure or a result, but that they only agreed to perform with such degree of care and knowledge and attention as is ordinarily possessed by practitioners of their profession under like circumstances. In other words, <em>they say that they did not assure to the plaintiffs any cure or specific result, * * * </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">As in all contract cases for personal services, in order to find for the plaintiffs here the jury must have found from the evidence that the doctors made a specific, clear and express promise to cure or effect a specific result which was in the reasonable contemplation of both themselves and the plaintiff which was relied upon by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">The plaintiffs say they did, the defendants say they did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">We conclude that under the circumstances disclosed by this record the trial court was correct in sending this case to the jury to determine the offer, acceptance, breach and damages, and refusing to grant judgment notwithstanding their verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-11\">As did the Court of Appeals, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">Plaintiffs may tax costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. G. Kavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b185-7\"> In this state, a doctor is free to contract as he sees fit. He may or may not warrant the results of his treatment. He may do so as a term of the contract or as a separate contract subsequent to the original contract. <em>(Stewart </em>v. <em>Rudner </em>[1957], 349 Mich 459.) But in this case the warranties were prior in time to the acceptance and thus did not, as there, present a question of \u201cpast\u201d consideration. Inapposite is <em>Gault </em>v. <em>Sideman </em>(1963), 42 Ill App 2d 96 (191 NE2d 436) wherein the Illinois court held the complaint did not sound in contract and observed \u201cAttention has been called by (sic) courts to the fact that a promise to cure is not made by a competent and honorable physician and that such a physician knows that he cannot warrant a cure.\u201d In addition to the obvious distinction between the cases, the quoted observation (whatever its validity) sheds little light on the question here involved as to whether or not such a promise was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">It is well settled that a physician or surgeon may bind himself by express contract to perform a cure or obtain specific results by treatment or an operation. 41 Am Jur, Physicians and Surgeons, \u00a7 105, p 220.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b186-11\"> See also <em>Beebe </em>v. <em>Koshnic </em>(1885), 55 Mich 604, 606, wherein Mr. Justice Cooley stated: \u201cThe question what oral contract parties have made is not for the court, but for a jury * * * .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b189-4\">T.

That Defendants in further breach of their contract, failed to timely diagnose and ascertain the aforementioned damage and to promptly and properly remedy their unskilled performance by proper operative and post-operative examination and treatment; that Defendants\u2019 post-operative procedures, particularly the oral administration of food and liquid which passed through the perforation in Plaintiff\u2019s esophagus into his chest cavity thereby causing aggravation and infection, was contrary to Defendants\u2019 agreement to exercise care and skid in administering to Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-8\">\u201c9.

In all other cases a jury verdict is a general verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">The jury verdict here was a general verdict upon the breach of contract count, and did not, as my Brothers suppose, negate the existence of those acts of negligence which were charged as breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">The trial court\u2019s oral question from the bench,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-7\">\u201cThe finding of the jury is no negligence?\u201d did not constitute a special verdict under GCR 1963, 514. It did not control or limit the general verdict on the contract count.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The trial judge, throughout his instructions, referred to the assumpsit and trespass counts as \u201ccontract\u201d and \u201cnegligence\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">He was attempting to clarify the foreman\u2019s report that the verdict was \u201cnot guilty\u201d as to malpractice and \u201cguilty\u201d as to breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">The only proper question the court could have been asking, and, in my opinion, the real purpose of his inquiry was\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">\u201cDo you find no cause for action as to the count of negligence?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Properly considered, the verdict of the jury merely constituted a finding of no cause for action on Count II of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint (the trespass or negligence count) and a verdict for the plaintiff upon Count I of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint (the assumpsit or contract count).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-13\">This result is the more understandable when we consider that the trial judge severely limited the jury\u2019s consideration of Count II.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>\u201cNow although the plaintiffs in this cause have also claimed that the defendants failed to make timely diagnosis and failed to promptly and properly remedy plaintiff\u2019s post-operative complications by proper operative and post-operative examination and treatment, and also claim that the post-operative procedures, particularly the oral administration of food and liquid were careless and negligent and that the defendants carelessly and negligently deposited and left a clamp within the plaintiff\u2019s abdomen, and the defendants failed to advise the plaintiffs of the risks involved, and that the defendants failed to use the proper technique in the performance of the operation so as to not injure plaintiff\u2019s esophagus, and that the defendants failed to promptly call in consultants, let me say to you that the evidence does not disclose that their performance in these regards was not proper and in accordance with the medical standards of the community. Accordingly I direct that you disregard these claims and that they play no part in your deliberations as to whether or not the defendants were in fact negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">The trial judge did not similarly limit its consideration of the jury with respect to the allegations of Count I, and there is no reason here to assume that the jury did not find that the conduct of the defendants was \u201ccontrary to Defendants\u2019 agreement to exercise care and skill in administering to Plaintiff\u201d as alleged in Count I.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">In my view, the law should indulge every presumption that a physician\u2019s medical assurances do not constitute a contract to cure. The verdict here should be sustained, and can be sustained without encouraging such allegations in the future.</p>\n<judges id=\"b193-6\">Adams and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. E.

In these early weeks of 1971 an exuberant new majority of a once great appellate court prepares to launch an unwarned, unprecedented, wholly gratuitous and destructively witless war of \u201ccontract liability\u201d upon a brother profession which, by the multifold harassment of malpractice actions, has been forced already to undertake what is professionally known as \u201cdefensive medicine.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> What the statewide impact will be, when today\u2019s majority opinion is released, is not difficult to foresee. The five Justices composing this new majority should be forgiven, for demonstrably they know not what they do to an old and indispensable relationship of reciprocal trust which the legal profession and the followers of Hippocrates have always identified as that of physician and patient.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">When this case was submitted May 5 last year, the writer as then assignee under our system wrote for a majority. His opinion for reversal was submitted to the other Justices on May 21, 1970. It appears verbatim at the end of this 1971 dissent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> I stand by it today, just as last May. One endorse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>ment committed last year was eliminated by the progressive and then terminal illness of the late Justice Harry F. Kelly. The other was eliminated by political action November 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Determination of the appeal was held in abeyance by Justice T. ,G. Kavanagh, for preparation of an announced minority opinion. July 8 the Justice delivered to us an opinion proposing affirmance which, for reasons I think may be developed circumstantially, will <em>not </em>appear in our reports. Thereafter, with each of the two conflicting opinions bearing three signatures and awaiting Justice Kelly\u2019s hoped for recovery, we were compelled finally to enter our November 30 order for rehearing of a then deadlocked appeal. That order eliminated the votes of two Justices who, but for events starting June 1, would have participated in a reasonably prompt decision, last year. Thus does the precedential law of Michigan swing back and forth like a two year timed metronome.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">When one writes for a majority be is inhibited. As Justice Cardozo wrote (Selected Writings of Benjamin Nathan Cardozo, Fallon Publications 1947, p 353), \u201cComparatively speaking at least, the dissenter is irresponsible. The spokesman of the court is cautious, timid, fearful of the vivid word, the heightened phrase.\u201d Then the Justice proceeded (same page): \u201cNot so, however, the dissenter. He has laid aside the role of the hierophant, which be will be only too glad to resume when the chances of war make him the spokesman of the majority. For the moment, he is the gladiator making a last stand among the lions.\u201d (To which the writer must add that the gladiator, wielding bis grimly boned claymore, usually begat a pretty fair lunch while the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>wounded lions that managed to survive were getting almost as costly a meal.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">Much more than this has been written about the chores of a dissenter. I prefer to say in present context that his duty is to warn a great unrepresented throng of directly concerned citizens, doctors and patients alike, that the hitherto dependable nature of a wholesome relationship is bound by this upcoming judicial decision to lose much if not all of its value, and that the bedside assuager may no longer lay that alleviating foundation for ordeal, as before. The patient and his consulted surgeon must each proceed hereafter at wary and worried arm\u2019s length, with words and writings chosen with care and recorded as a basis for the surgeon\u2019s advisory judgment, that is, whether to operate or not operate. I can think of no greater blow a Court may strike at what is needed most, confidence and mutual trust that is, when the sick must consult an operating specialist with view toward that kind of major surgery which no man may deny is fraught with peril, no matter how skilled the surgeon and no matter the perfection of his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\n<em>First: What is the Specific Nature of Our Divisive Issued</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">Plaintiffs, husband and wife, sued the defendant surgeons in separate counts for alleged breach of contract and malpractice, both charged as having arisen out of the same transaction and the same facts. The first count avers that the defendant surgeons for good and valuable consideration contracted with plaintiff Richard A. Guilmet to remove a portion of his stomach by \u201can operation known as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>a gastric resection,\u201d that defendants performed the agreed operation \u201cin an unworkmanlike, unprofessional and unskilled manner,\u201d thereby injuring \u201cplaintiff\u2019s esophagus, a heretofore healthy part of his body which required no treatment,\u201d and that they were injured thereby to the tune of $365,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">The second count, for malpractice, charged the defendants similarly excepting only that the breach of contract theory was omitted from that count. Thus the first count was pleaded <em>ex contractu </em>upon negligence and the second was pleaded <em>ex delicto </em>upon negligence. See full quotation, ante at pp 71, 72, of the \u201cbreach\u201d paragraphs of count one of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">The pleaded issues were tried to a jury. The verdict of the jury specifically acquitted the defendants of negligence and found for the plaintiffs under the count <em>ex contractu, </em>in the amount of $50,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The <em>verdict </em>of the jury, and the <em>verdict </em>of today\u2019s majority with respect to the jury\u2019s verdict, expose with precise clarity that which on rehearing has become a simple and quite decisive issue. Here is the jury\u2019s verdict:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\"><em>\u201cForeman: </em>The verdict of the jury is that on the count of malpractice, not guilty. On breach of contract, guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-8\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>The word \u2018guilty\u2019 is not used except in criminal matters. Is it your finding that you found no negligence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-9\"><em>\u201cForeman: </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-10\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>The finding of the jury is no negligence ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-11\"><em>\u201cForeman: </em>That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-12\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>You find breach of contract?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-13\"><em>\u201cForeman: </em>That\u2019s right. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-14\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>What did you assess by way of damages ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>\u201cForeman: </em>Fifty thousand.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">(Jury sworn as to verdict [also polled]) * * *</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-6\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Ladies and Gentlemen, that concludes the trial of this cause.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Here is today\u2019s majority verdict, repeated for accentuation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-8\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict of \u2018no negligence\u2019 does not resolve the contract question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\">\u201cIF THERE WAS A CONTRACT TO EFFECT A CERTAIN RESULT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER THE TREATMENT WAS DONE NEGLIGENTLY OR WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL. IF THE CURE WAS NOT EFFECTED THE CONTRACT WAS BREACHED.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">(I have put this last paragraph in full caps, that it may stand forth shamelessly naked before the courts of other states when they, predictably, are called upon to follow suit.)</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">As was noted last year, the \u201cunworkmanlike, unprofessional and unskilled\u201d language of count one manifestly was taken from, and plaintiffs\u2019 contract theory of recovery was planted upon, the most prominent authority cited by them. That authority is <em>Robins </em>v. <em>Finestone </em>(1955), 308 NY 543 (127 NE2d 330), a decision which came to review, not as here after trial and verdict but upon the defendant surgeon\u2019s motion to dismiss. His motion assigned New York State\u2019s two-year statute of limitations, applicable to non-contract actions, <em>as the sole basis of dismissal. </em>The New York Court of Appeals held only that the complaint stated a cause <em>ex contractu </em>against the defendant surgeon, thus bringing into play the state\u2019s much longer limitational statute. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number><em>There was no holding at all that the pleaded came would hold up without proof and finding of the negligence charged in Mr. Robins\u2019 complaint.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">Hence, unlike last year, we are now definitely squared off for and against proposition that the jury\u2019s verdict, having absolved the defendants from negligence, wiped out plaintiffs\u2019 pleaded and tried theory that the alleged breach was committed by the specific acts of <em>negligence </em>that are charged as <em>breach </em>in plaintiffs\u2019 first count.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\n<em>Second: May These Plaintiffs Have Judgment Under the First Count, the Defendants Having Been Exonerated of Negligent Conduct as Alleged in that Count?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">My then as now negative answer, with reasons based particularly on the reasoning of cases decided in California, Illinois and Montana,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> appears in the opinion submitted last May. As against this there is no pretense of proffered authority or precedent. My Brothers five just say \u201cThis is the law.\u201d That they do with an arrantly dixitized vengeance, for all of the skilled research clerks of Lansing, working with no surcease and without food or drink, never could come up with any kind of respectable or even plausible authority holding that a surgeon, said as having contracted to accomplish what none but the Great Maker could perform, may be held to respond in damages for having failed to provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">The affirming Brethren attest on their own that no matter the skill with which these unusually competent and experienced specialist surgeons went about a perilously developing and finally successful <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>task; that no matter they managed to save Mr. Guilmet\u2019s life by their efforts; that no matter the jury did find them not guilty of negligence, that these same specialists nonetheless \u201ccontracted\u201d to provide \u2014 yes in \u201capproximately three or four weeks at the most\u201d \u2014 a \u201ccure\u201d for Mr. Guilmet\u2019s badly diseased and twice dangerously bleeding stomach and, having failed to have him \u201chack at work\u201d at end of that four week period, that they are due for mulct aggregating today more than $63,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Such is the announced rule of this case, no more and no less. Let it stand in our books for all to read, wonder and prepare either for more amercement of doctors or more \u201cdefensive medicine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">The policy and reasoning declared in the cited California, Illinois and Montana cases is not opposed by <em>Beebe </em>v. <em>Koshnic </em>(1885), 55 Mich 604, which last the Brethren standing for affirmance cite as authority for the proposition that today\u2019s issue of contract and breach became one of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">Let us examine the <em>Beebe </em>case. There the doctor was the <em>plaintiff. </em>His pleaded cause was one of <em>special </em>contract, supported by a <em>special </em>consideration, to effect a cure on the same basis as in <em>Hollywood </em>v. <em>Reed </em>(1884), 55 Mich 308, that is, \u201cno cure, no pay.\u201d In view of our irreconcilably variant views of <em>Beebe, </em>hear Chief Justice Cooley tell us in steady \u2014 not conveniently expurgated \u2014 context what the nature of Dr. Beebe\u2019s cause was, and how the issue there came to this Court (pp 604, 605):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-9\">\u201cCooley, C. J. The plaintiff is a physician, and brings suit to recover compensation for services in curing the defendant of a disease of one of the defendant\u2019s legs. <em>It was a part of the plaintiff\u2019s case that he performed the services under a special agreement that he was only to be paid in the event of a cure. </em>He therefore took the burden of showing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>that a cure had been effected.\u201d (Emphasis hy present writer.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">I have read through, again this year, the 778 pages of this trial transcript. It discloses that the plaintiffs made out no submissible case of negligent malpractice under rules often laid down, strikingly applicable here, as in <em>Lince </em>v. <em>Monson </em>(1961), 363 Mich 135 and <em>Skeffington </em>v. <em>Bradley </em>(1962), 366 Mich 552. It discloses further that the testimony of Mr. Guilmet, taken at its best, failed to make out a submissible case under count one (the \u201ccontract\u201d count) of his pleading. The reason is that his testimony did not support any \u201ccontract\u201d theory of recovery, <em>that theory being breach occasioned exclusively by negligence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Read now all of the \u201cbreach\u201d paragraphs of Mr. Gruilmet\u2019s complaint:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-6\">\u201c5. That Defendants agreed as part of their employment to perform said operation in a good and workman-like manner; that as specialists in surgery they would cure Plaintiff hy said operation and that Plaintiff would he able to leave the hospital in a short time and resume his occupation and normal family life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">W \u201c W</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">\u201c7. That Defendants in the course of said operation and in breach of their contract, in an unworkman-like, unprofessional and unskilled manner, injured and perforated Plaintiff\u2019s esophagus, a heretofore healthy part of his body which required no treatment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-9\">\u201c8. That Defendants in further breach of their contract, failed to timely diagnose and ascertain the aforementioned damage and to promptly and properly remedy their unskilled performance hy proper operative and post-operative examination and treatment; that Defendants\u2019 post-operative procedures, particularly the oral administration of food and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>liquid which passed through the perforation in Plaintiff\u2019s esophagus into his chest cavity thereby causing aggravation and infection, was contrary to Defendants\u2019 agreement to exercise care and skill in administering to Plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">\u201c9. That Defendants in further breach of their contract carelessly deposited and left a clamp within Plaintiff\u2019s abdomen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">\u201c10. That Defendants in further breach of their contract failed to advise Plaintiffs of the risks involved and serious consequences attendant to said -operation and failed to achieve satisfactory results.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">\u201c11. That Defendants wrongfully misrepresented to Plaintiffs and concealed from them the injury to Plaintiff\u2019s esophagus and their careless and negligent acts in said operation as well as the extent of the surgery performed and the permanent and serious nature of the injury resulting from their treatment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-8\">Consider the pleaded factual specifics distinguished from the legal conclusions that are set forth in the quoted paragraphs. One is declared by paragraph 7, the other by paragraph 9. Paragraph 7 declares that the defendants \u201cperforated\u201d Mr. Guilmet\u2019s healthy esophagus. Paragraph 9 declares that they left a \u201cclamp\u201d in his abdomen.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-9\">Take \u201c7\u201d first. Did the defendants \u201cinjure and perforate\u201d Mr. Guilmet\u2019s esophagus? The claim was based in particular upon an entry in the hospital record made by Dr. Wood, a specialist in thoracic surgery, not abdominal surgery, some five days after the gastric resection was performed. Dr. Wood had been called into consultation by the defendants in view of Mr. Guilmet\u2019s then precarious condition. His entry reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">\u201cHistory and progress noted. X-ray today shows perforation of the lower esophagus \u2014 correction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>lower esophageal segment with large pneumothorax on the right and pleural effusion on the left.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">Dr. Wood was sworn by plaintiffs as their witness. Unless our standing rules of evidence have changed, plaintiffs vouched for his credibility, which is not to suggest that there was anything incredible or doubtful about his testimony. It developed without shred of dispute, both by Dr. Wood\u2019s testimony and that of defendant Arena, that the noun \u201cperforation\u201d was used by customary medical parlance in its broad sense and that the hole in the lower esophagus, discovered some days after the operation as above, is known technically as a \u201cspontaneous fistula.\u201d Hear Dr. Wood on this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You have indicated a spontaneous fistula. Would you explain to the jury what the mechanics of such a thing might be?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It usually occurs in a patient who has some vomiting for any particular reason. Vomiting with a large amount of gas in the stomach can suddenly balloon the esophagus beyond its stretching point and it splits. The esophagus is actually a rather weak structure. It has an inner lining called the mucosa and then a muscular coat but it doesn\u2019t have any covering on the outside as the rest of the intestinal tract has, and so it\u2019s a structure which does not have a great deal of strength and so it is possible for it to become perforated without a great deal of injury. I mean, a great deal of force let me say. So a patient that suddenly evacuates the contents of the stomach, if it be dilated with gas and fluid, can so perforate the esophagus. This would be called a spontaneous perforation of the esophagus and it is reported and has a syndrome attached to it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Later, when the trial judge intervened by saying he did not hear a presented question, Dr. Wood responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>Actually in reviewing the chart here, my question was going to be is it your opinion that this hole in the esophagus was created during this operation of the gastric resection?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I didn\u2019t anticipate that question, your Honor. I would be of the opinion that the perforation in the esophagus occurred at some time subsequent to the actual operation. I stated before that if it occurred at the time of operation, the surgeon should see it. It is possible I think that either Levine tube or a situation at the time of surgery precipitated a subsequent perforation, several hours after. I don\u2019t know whether the patient vomited after or not, but vomiting or retching could well have produced a perforation some time after surgery, perhaps during the immediate post-operative period, awakening from an anesthesia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>At any rate, it is your opinion that it did not occur during the operation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think that is what I said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Is that your opinion?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I think that it occurred subsequent to the operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">It is enough to say that there simply was no proof, or scintilla out of which any permissible inference of actionable practice could be drawn, that the defendants were negligent as charged by quoted paragraph 7, or that they were guilty of \u201cbreach\u201d as duplicitously charged in that paragraph. I suggest the Brothers five concede this when they say that the jury\u2019s verdict of \u201cno negligence\u201d did not absolve the defendant surgeons of and from the alleged contractual liability. Do they not say that the defendants must respond no matter the \u201cconsummate skill\u201d of their surgical doings?</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">Now for quoted \u201c9\u201d. This allegation was actually interred at the trial, when the trial judge considered the requests to charge with counsel. When chai<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>lenged for proof plaintiffs\u2019 counsel admitted that \u201cclip\u201d should have been employed in the place of \u201cclamp.\u201d Then this took place, with no objection on the part of plaintiffs\u2019 counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-4\"><em>\u201cMr. Condit [attorney for </em>plaintiffs]: I would move to amend the complaint to substitute the word \u2018clip\u2019 for the word \u2018clamp.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\"><em>\u201cMr. Whitfield [attorney for </em>defendants] : I again suggest there is no evidence in the record that this is not within the standard of care. In fact it was testified to do this. It is intended with clips that they be left in and there is no evidence to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-7\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>I will have to agree with you on that.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">A \u201cclip\u201d such as was applied to Mr. Guilmet\u2019s vagus nerve, after the latter had been snipped off as a necessary part of the main operation, is of minute size and made of silver. Its <em>permanent purpose </em>is to adjust and control \u2014 to the radically reduced size and gastric functioning of the remaining part of the stomach \u2014 the'discharge of gastric juices into that part. There was no showing whatever that this was done other than in accord with regularly accepted medical practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\n<em>Third: A Looh at the Consequences of Today\u2019s Misfortunate Decision.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">From here on the surgeon contemplating a serious operation will undertake knowingly a third and even more menacing risk should he advise affirmatively. The first of course is the ever sobering possibility of sad or untoward results no matter his \u201cconsummate skill\u201d and the careful employment thereof. The second is that crescently more perilous exposure to a suit for negligent malpractice should the result turn out funereal or misfortunate. And now comes the third. It is this Court\u2019s newly invented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>and retroactively granted right of suit against a surgeon upon simple allegation that the surgeon contracted to do that which none but the Deity could possibly agree to perform, that is, effect a \u201ccure\u201d or defined result when the scheduled treatment is surgical removal of a substantial part of an anatomical organ; an organ which, to sustain life beyond extremis, must continue to perform a daily function.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">Does not the complaint before us allege that the defendants entered into an agreement \u201cto perform an operation known as a gastric resection\u201d ? Do the Brethren not realize that the recommended operation necessitated the excision of approximately 80% of Mr. Guilmet\u2019s stomach, and that the vagotomy of which so much has been made was hut a vitally necessary preliminary to the plaintiff-pleaded gastric resection?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">One wonders why the minority affirmers of 1970, and now the majority affirmers of 1971, cannot see that their current opinion will not only create an easy new \u201cbreach of contract\u201d way to sue physicians and surgeons for untoward or unforeseen results; that it will in addition open the doors of our courts to actions old and new so long as they pass six-year rather than two-year muster under MCLA \u00a7 600. 5807 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a727A.5807). Do the Brethren not perceive that the medics will go even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>more \u201cdefensive\u201d when this latest of our \u201cforward-looking\u201d decisions hits the precedential fan, and that many an operation that might have saved life will not he performed either of professional wariness or, more importantly, inability of the surgeon under new law to prepare his apprehensive patient mentally for the making of an affirmative decision?</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">It is natural for the sick, and the near kin of the sick, to seek anxiously for more and more medical assurance when the hour for surgical decision arrives. And when that decision is affirmative and the result turns out fatal, disabling or otherwise dismal, it is human to recall the doctor or doctors\u2019 preparational encouragement as misrepresentative or even promissory; certainly when money is brought into legal focus. There is the rub as one gazes at testimony that Dr. Campbell, the circumstances being what they were when Mr. Guilmet was suffering the second time from serious internal bleeding,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cpromised to have the latter back at work in \u2018approximately three to four weeks at the most\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">Another curiosity: What will be contrived out of this case of <em>Guilmet </em>when, the presented case being exactly as at bar except only that the patient has died after administration of last rites, the patient\u2019s promise-oriented widow sues or attempts to sue as fiduciary under our distinctive wrongful death statute? Is not the tortious linchpin of that statute the exact same as was originally written by Lord Campbell, that is, death \u201ccaused by wrongful act, neglect or default\u201d? Has not our unique since-1939 statute provided that \u201cAll actions for such death, or injuries resulting in death, shall be brought only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>under this section.\u201d (MCLA \u00a7 600.2922 [Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 27A.2922]) ?<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> What will we pronounce to be the measure of damages in such a case of <em>contracted cure, </em>when death results?</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Still another for meditation is what our presently heady majority will do when an indignant client, having lost his case, insists in court on strength of <em>Guilmet </em>that his lawyer <em>promised </em>for consideration a damage verdict and judgment for no less than a given amount, or <em>promised </em>a decree saving the client\u2019s home from an allegedly unjust foreclosure or title-trap, or <em>promised </em>a successful action against that life insurer refusing to pay on allegation of medical fraud, or <em>promised </em>a successful contest of Grandpa\u2019s will, but did not come through. That will be a first class vexer for this Court to grant or deny when the contractual theory of <em>Guilmet </em>is advanced, yes against a lawyer; most certainly when the alleged promisor is a prominent member of the so-called plaintiffs\u2019 bar and <em>he </em>is nominated for condemnation in damages.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">Thus far there appears to the writer still another like bushment the Court should see but does not see, or perhaps is too absorbed to see, dead ahead. But what avails further attempt at persuasion when all caution has been cast aside for the big rush toward more punitive damage awards? In our present exuberance this <em>Guilmet </em>case has become a blind stampede toward another jurisprudential precipice. Hence anyone in the way had best head for the hills <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>of reasoned safety. Even a duty-bound dissenter cannot exhort too long, before stepping aside, lest he be run down or carried over the cliff with the rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\n<em>To Conclude:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Is the above too gloomy? Not at all. Today in America there is a great and critically developing shortage of medical men. They already have too much to do, are stretching their hours the more, and are hardly interested in the assumption of more legal risks than they bear now. You see, Brothers all, no Court may or can force a surgeon to perform an operation he deems risky <em>both </em>ways, that is, risky for the patient personally and risky for himself legally. <em>Guilmet </em>will simply make him guardedly overcautious in the making of his most serious judgments, and that is not good for the public weal.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The doctor who cannot prepare and condition his patient, both mentally and physically for a <em>serious </em>operation, is crippled beforehand. So is the patient, only more so. What is recommended surgically becomes progressive Gethsemane for the patient unless the doctor can provide, as before, that \u201ctherapeutic reassurance\u201d which Justice Talbot Smith so wisely preserved inviolate when he wrote our carefully narrowed opinion of <em>Stewart </em>v. <em>Rudner </em>(1957), 349 Mich 459, 468. But now with the threatening thrust of <em>Guilmet </em>the doctor must so hedge and guard his words (probably from now on with a tape recorder running) as to create more doubt and fear than ever in the patient\u2019s mind and, here and there, impel a desperate negative decision by the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">All else aside, the stark tragedy of this <em>Guilmet </em>precedent is that we Justices will never see or know anything about the hundreds and hundreds of negative decisions today\u2019s determination of \u201ccontract\u201d liability will force upon the physician-patient rela<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>tionship, both in the offices of medical consultation and in the hospitals of Michigan. Nor will we ever know about those predictably fewer cases where, more than true to their Hippocratic oath, the specialist in internal medicine and the specialist surgeon will risk despite <em>Guilmet </em>their reputations, their property, literally their all upon the sheer need for hopeful assuagement of the patient\u2019s misgivings and fears; only to see things go wrong at the hospital through no fault of theirs.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Those cases will be settled, ere they reach us. Not many will defend in court as Dr. Campbell and Dr. Arena have done, only to find themselves at the mercy of a \u201ccontract to cure\u201d when they have undertaken to resect in serious part one of the patient\u2019s vital organs. I have no doubt, having read the details of Dr. Campbell\u2019s enviably proud record in abdominal surgery and of the assiduous skill employed by him and Dr. Arena in bringing Mr. Guilmet finally to that state of health which is reasonably ex-pectable after such an operation, that the ordeal of this trial and of its ensuing appellate history had much to do with his untimely death last year. He and his partner saved Mr. Guilmet\u2019s life. He has lost his, after having been acquitted of negligence and yet held in damages for breach of an unbelievable contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">All of the defensive measures this <em>Guilmet </em>case will breed are not of course foreseeable by one of our profession. Some are, though. \"Will not the Port Huron or Detroit medic, knowing as he does that equally skilled fellows in medicine are available within 15 minutes across the river, more likely refer that uncertain patient over the international boundary for treatment and surgery; over there where the \u201claw\u201d is a little different? What about Niles to South Bend, or Monroe to Toledo? Withal, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>words fit for a judicial report are not available with which to characterize properly the reprehensible nature of this war without warning upon a status of mutual trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">Such is the ominous and wholly uncalled for stuff of which <em>Guilmet </em>is made. I consider myself privileged to be here at this time for rude exposure \u2014 in our books \u2014 of what before both the legal and medical professions will stand forth as incredible judicial folly; folly because we are <em>not </em>forced to make such an unreal decision, as occasionally is due when we interpret and apply a statutory or constitutional provision. Here we deal with the common law. Here wisdom is due <em>from us; </em>not legislators or electors. That Lady must have departed our midst January 7 last when five gentlemen of the Court announced that they would endorse what by these presents I oppose.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">A final word: Have not all thus far directly concerned with this case, counsel, trial judge, three Judges of the Court of Appeals, and now five Justices of this Court and their clerks, given no thought to where lies the really damning error of judgment for these plaintiffs? Is it not likely, had Mr. Guilmet decided against the recommended operation after having been physically and mentally readied for it by the defendants in February of 1964, that he would <em>not </em>be alive today? I apprehend, that there is some little life-or-death difference between having a major operation when prepared for it with medical care, and undergoing it in desperate emergency after having been brought in by a speeding ambulance with a third attack of internal bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">My vote is cast as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>ADDENDA </em>(June 21, 1971) :</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">The foregoing dissent was delivered to the Brethren March 24, 1971. May 3 our majority withdrew the opinion criticized by that dissent and substituted in its place another which, as I understand, the regular plurality stands ready to endorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">This latest opinion begs literally if unintentionally for more denunciation of its ominous threat, and for further alert to the retroactive extension it is due to make of limitational time within which the disgruntled may think up suits, for <em>breach of con</em>tract, against members of the medical profession. It should and will be dissected by means of successively contextual quotations, each followed by timid comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">1. For the first time since this case came to original submission May 5, 1970, the Brethren standing for affirmance have deigned recognition of the fact that their endorsements lockstep over perilously untested legal ground. Let their opinion speak here, for firm inclusion in our annals, lest the following also disappear by amendment or substitution. By the fourth paragraph of this latest opinion five Justices say (ante at p 61):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-9\">\u201cThe danger attendant upon decision here is that on one hand if we sanction the award of damages to the plaintiffs we may foster suits which threaten the freedom physicians and surgeons must have in the practice of their vital profession, and on the other hand if we deprive these plaintiffs of their award, we not only may do them an injustice hut impair the very process by which we seek to administer justice.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-10\"><em>Comment: </em>They go on, nonetheless, to court if not invite the conceded danger by upholding, as due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number><em>contractually, </em>this \u201caward\u201d against two blameless surgeons in the sum of $50,000. Thus the statewide impact of the Court\u2019s decision, upon unknown numbers of present and prospective patients and their necessary relationship with the medical profession (saying nothing of the medics themselves), is weighed with, but found wanting against, the claimed right of these plaintiffs whose good fortune it was that the defendant surgeons by their skill succeeded in saving Mr. Guilmet\u2019s life. All this, however, is but nothing compared with the Court\u2019s sweeping assignment to fact finders of <em>all </em>cases that are pleaded and allegedly supported as at bar. See division \u201c4,\u201d <em>post.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>2. </em>On the same page the Court advises, in a one-sentence paragraph:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">\u201cDefendant Dr. Campbell testified that prior to the operation the plaintiff was in excellent physical condition and the operation was <em>not </em>an emergency.\u201d (Italics by my Brothers.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-6\"><em>Comment: </em>This is the occasionally deceptive half of the truth. The rest is that, when Dr. Campbell was sent for in December of 1963, Mr. Guilmet was in or near <em>extremis, </em>suffering from ulcerous internal bleeding which had sent him unconscious to the hospital. There and then at home he had to be nursed slowly to that state of health which would permit the operation recommended by Dr. Campbell. This was done under Dr. Campbell\u2019s direction, but not until the doctor was satisfied with Mr. Guilmet\u2019s condition vis-a-vis the recommended operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">It is hardly fair, then, for one to aver upon this record that \u201cthe operation was <em>not </em>an emergency.\u201d To the contrary it turned out to be just that, when the defendant surgeons opened Mr. Guilmet\u2019s abdomen and found as they did a stomach so diseased that 80% thereof had to be removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>True, the operation was not deemed an emergency when it was planned by the patient and his major surgeons. Yet I doubt that anyone here is willing to state from the trial court record \u2014 upon <em>our </em>record \u2014 that it was <em>not </em>a critical job, a true emergency that is, when as only may be done with utmost precision the extent of internal disease is brought to surgical vision and palpation. Who indeed is willing to suggest, the two-times critical background of Mr. Guilmet\u2019s stomach trouble considered, that he in all probability would be just as alive today had the operation <em>not </em>been readied and done when it was?</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">3. Next comes new reasoning by the Court for sustenance of the award of damages now in scrutiny. Having stated plaintiffs\u2019 claim</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">(a) That the observations and descriptions of the result which the defendants made were promises to achieve a specific end, and</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">(b) That they were inducements upon which the plaintiff Richard Guilmet relied in proceeding with the operation, and</p>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">(c) That plaintiffs have characterized all this as an undertaking to \u201ccure\u201d Mr. Guilmet of the stomach disorder from which he was then suffering;</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">our majority proceeds to \u201ccure\u201d this erroneous theory of recovery by <em>sua sponte </em>amendment thereof (an amendment not made, pretentiously or otherwise, upon authority of GCR 1963, 118.3). Read this (quoted from the majority opinion, <em>ante </em>at p 67):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-11\">\u201cThis appellation of \u2018cure\u2019 may be unfortunate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-12\">\u201cThe parties when contracting never use the word \u2018cure\u2019 and the mere elimination of a troublesome condition may not always be properly so designated. For example, a headache may be eliminated by decapitation but no one seriously suggests that it is a \u2018cure\u2019. Similarly the substitution of a different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>stomach disorder for a specific one is not properly-called a \u2018cure\u2019 of the original ailment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-4\">Then comes what I would suggest is a \u201cgisted\u201d review by the Court, rather than a testimonially quoted presentation, of the facts upon which the Court comes to its judgment and the precedential effect thereof <em>{ante </em>at pp 67, 68):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-5\">\u201cThe following is the gist of what the defendants told him:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201c \u2018Once you have an operation it takes care of all your troubles. You can eat as you want to, you can drink as you want to, you can go as you please. Dr. Arena and I are specialists, there is nothing to it at all \u2014 it\u2019s a very simple operation. You\u2019ll be out of work three to four weeks at the most. There is no danger at all in this operation. After the operation you can throw away your pill box. In twenty years if you figure out what you spent for Maalox pills and doctor calls, you could buy an awful lot. Weigh it against an operation.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\"><em>Comment: </em>Compare this \u201cgist\u201d and its preceding quoted counterpart with that which has been deleted from the Court\u2019s opinion submitted May 3 last:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">\u201cThe jury\u2019s verdict of \u2018no negligence\u2019 does not resolve the contract question.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-9\">\u201cIF THERE WAS A CONTRACT TO EFFECT A CERTAIN RESULT IT DOES NOT MATTER WHETHER THE TREATMENT WAS DONE NEGLIGENTLY OR WITH CONSUMMATE SKILL. IF THE CURE WAS NOT EFFECTED THE CONTRACT WAS BREACHED.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">The comparison made, can there be any doubt that a wary Court has decided recently to avoid any precise definition of what it has in mind, as and for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>some new theory of recovery by plaintiffs? All the profession gets now is \u201cThis appellation of \u2018cure\u2019 may be unfortunate.\u201d; plus an intimation that defendants may have breached the alleged contract by substituting \u201ca different stomach disorder for a specific one.\u201d As against that plaintiffs\u2019 pleaded and tried, and briefed and supported on appeal, theory of count one recovery is that defendants contracted \u201cto cure him [plaintiff Eichard Gruilmet] of the stomach disorder from which he was then suffering.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Come now Brothers, isn\u2019t a planned major operation consisting of a \u201csub-total gastric resection\u201d of one\u2019s stomach, 80% in this instance, reasonably expected to result in a somewhat different stomach disorder than the infinitely more dangerous \u201cspecific\u201d these medics diagnosed, as a basis for their recommendation? What then is the \u201cspecific\u201d nature of the contract, and of its breach, upon which the Brethren in majority presently rely? Can we have no answer except that \u2014 possibly\u2014the plaintiffs did not intend to plead, or try, an issue of contract of \u201ccure\u201d and breach thereof?</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">4. Next comes that which, presumably, is designed to soothe a profession already beset by steadily mounting malpractice claims. Plainly it will have an opposite effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>Consider Judge Van Valkenburg\u2019s recent article, \u201cCan Our Courts Be Saved?\u201d (February 1971 issue of MSBJ, 75-77, referring to that part headed \u201cMalpractice Cases.\u201d) He tells us that which is probably better known to trial lawyers and trial judges throughout Michigan than to appellate Judges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\">\u201cMalpractice suits have increased by leaps and bounds in recent years, by about eight to ten percent per year. As every judge knows, they are difficult to try and have a sweeping effect on the medical profession and the public. Doctors become extremely cautious, hospitalize patients for minor matters, order unnecessary tests and X-rays and refuse to handle some cases at all. Further, insurance rates have increased \u2014 in one state to $5,000 per year \u2014 and inexperienced doctors cannot obtain coverage at all unless connected with a firm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The Court starts out with observation that \u201cWe recognize that what we hold is sometimes made clearer by stating what we do not hold.\u201d <em>(Ante </em>at p 69.) Then, pursuing such an apparently negative vein, my Brothers proceed to peal out a real alarm rather than an intended \u201call quiet\u201d; one that is bound to send medics and surgeons posthaste to their lawyers for defensive preparations. To make it doubly clear that this is no overstatement, I repeat from the majority opinion the real \u201cgist\u201d of that which the medical profession is due to face; <em>nunc pro tunc </em>six years backward at that <em>(ante </em>at P 69).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cWhat we are saying is that under some circumstances the trier of fact might conclude that a doctor so speaking did contract to \u2018cure\u2019 his patient.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cWhat was said, and the circumstances under which it was said <em>always </em>determines whether there was a contract at all and if so what it was. These <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>matters are <em>always </em>for the determination of the fact finder.\u201d (Italics hy present writer.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-4\">Cited in support of this last is <em>Strong </em>v. <em>Saunders (1867), 15 </em>Mich 339. That case is all that is proffered to sustain the quoted and rather remarkable conclusion of law. Now <em>Strong </em>was a suit in assumpsit to recover compensation for the use of certain range lights and stakes provided by the plaintiff for the guidance of the defendant\u2019s steam tug through the St. Clair Flats, during the navigational season of 1864. The defendant tugboat owner denied obligation to pay on ground that no obligation accrued unless and until the captain of the tug had fixed and certified the amount to be paid, which last had not been done. The Court disposed of the defendant\u2019s requests for separate and alternative jury instructions by saying that \u201cThere was evidence strongly tending to show an express promise to pay such sum as the defendant\u2019s captain should certify to be fair and reasonable; and there also was evidence tending to show an implied promise, or, in other words, a clear duty on the part of the defendant to pay a reasonable compensation; * * * .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">I have read the <em>Strong </em>case from one end to the other and am unable to find that the Court employed the inclusive word \u201calways,\u201d or that it made any commitment such as I oppose, or any commitment remotely like it. Moreover, the case presented no question whatever of right to an instructed verdict of nonliability. It actually went back for retrial on account of an error of jury instruction not pertinent here.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-6\">We have a seven-tined forkful of uncommon law here. The point made now, for cases pleaded and tried as at bar, is that the issue of contractual liability or nonliability of the defendant doctor or surgeon is <em>always </em>to be one for determination of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>jury or, if the issue is tried to the court, <em>always </em>for the fact finding determination of the judge. The message will get across. The medical profession and its legal advisers will simply have to ask pardon for taking more defensive measures, as all listen respectfully to the word of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">Now for a few concluding observations:</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">Throughout a year (plus) of disagreement experienced since this case was initially submitted, one continually nagging question persists. It arises out of the jury\u2019s reported and accepted verdict of \u201cno negligence,\u201d and of \u201cnot guilty\u201d (of malpractice). Now most practitioners of law know no way whereby a man may breach a contract another avers he has made excepting (a) by neglect of performance, or (b) by omission or refusal of performance. The latter is not of course charged by these plaintiffs. They do however count upon the former, that is, negligent performance. If any doubt remains on that score, read again the total charging part of count one of plaintiffs\u2019 complaint <em>{ante </em>at p 71).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">Plaintiffs\u2019 charge of negligent (\u201cunworkman-like, unprofessional and unskilled\u201d) performance was tried as their count-one issue of contractual liability, along with their count two liability issue of negligent malpractice. The jury found no malpractice and \u201cno negligence.\u201d How then, all dixitism aside, can the trial court\u2019s judgment stand?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">If the doctor cannot win even when the jury says \u201cno negligence,\u201d how can he win at all without planning and erecting beforehand his own bar of exposure to what this day is made a newly conceived method of penalizing doctors of medicine and major surgeons for untoward results of the best of treatment, the best of surgery?</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">The patient who, with fear of his contemplated major operation left not too well assuaged by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>consulted but legally forewarned surgeon, cannot be tbe heartened and trusting patient he should be. The surgeon who must be on legal guard against his patient and the relatives of that patient, simply cannot perform as otherwise he might. Too often he is likely to leave to the patient, by mechanical record, that critical decision of operation or no operation. And when the doctor of medicine or the specialist in surgery learns that he must by law protect himself against suits upon alleged <em>contracts of cure or </em>result, suits that are due now to be made expansible timewise from two years to six years, our majority can hardly blame that doctor or surgeon for taking the precautionary advice of his lawyer, rather than what may be intended to be the mollifying word of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It appears now that the die is cast. We are about to provide for grim ingest by our two most eminent professions the very essence of Michigan\u2019s new order of legalistic ultraism. This State, once proud of a national reputation for dependable as well as masterfully written precedents, deserves better than this from a Court which, in the venerable Capitol from which we departed last year, was graced by judges like Cooley in his time and Fellows in the present century.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">As before my vote is cast to reverse and remand for entry of judgment in favor of the defendants.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b194-7\"> Read \u201cSuing the Doctor: A Rising Problem,\u201d US News &amp; World Report, March 8, 1971 issue, pp 70-72:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-8\">\u201c \u2018Defensive medicine.\u2019 Doctors\u2019 fears of malpractice suits are adding heavily to medical bills across the nation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-9\">\u201cAs doctors become more aware of the legal dangers they are running, they become increasingly cautious.
