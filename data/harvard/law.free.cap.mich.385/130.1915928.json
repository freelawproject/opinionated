E. Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ASL\">The case before us is indistinguishable upon its facts from the case of <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Troy </em>(1968), 380 Mich 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The complaint here alleges that plaintiff\u2019s decedent, Baby Boy Pinet, was an eight-month-old viable infant <em>en ventre sa mere </em>at the time of the injury which caused his death.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Action was brought under Michigan\u2019s wrongful death statute. MCLA \u00a7 600.2922 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a727A.2922). By motion for summary judgment, defendants raised the issue of whether the plaintiff\u2019s decedent was a person within the meaning of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-10\">Plaintiff answered the motion, contending that his decedent was a person within the meaning of the wrongful death statute, and further arguing that his decedent was a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution ; that his right of action may not be denied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>without depriving him of a vested property right without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">We lay the constitutional question aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">Intervening since our decision in <em>Powers </em>is the case of <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Buchhorn </em>(1971), 384 Mich 718, decided at this term.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">In Womack, we overruled <em>Newman </em>v. <em>Detroit </em>(1937), 281 Mich 60, and held that a common-law action does lie in this state for prenatal injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-7\"><em>Womack </em>being the applicable rule of common-law tort liability, we have only to apply the wrongful death statute to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">The first section of that statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">\u201cSec. 2922.(1) Whenever the death of a person or injuries resulting in death shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, in respect thereof, then and in every such case, the person who, or the corporation which would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony. All actions for such death, or injuries resulting in death, shall be brought only under this section.\u201d' MCLA \u00a7 600.2922 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 27A.2922).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">The obvious purpose of the statute, originally enacted as PA 1848, No 38, is to provide an action for wrongful death whenever, <em>if death had not ensued, </em>there would have been an action for damages. <em>Womack </em>settled the question of whether, if death had not ensued, Baby Boy Pinet would have had an action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The statutory wrongful death action is co-extensive with the common-law right of action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">We have never supposed that the 1848 legislature intended only to provide an action for wrongful death under those circumstances in which there was precedent for recovery of damages in cases reported before 1848. It would be anomalous indeed if we were to have two co-existing bodies of common-law tort liability in Michigan \u2014 one static and frozen as of 1848 for wrongful death and one living and growing to apply in other cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Justices who felt no action should lie for the wrongful death of an unborn person subscribed to the following statements in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Troy, </em>supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-8\">\u201cAppellee, <em>per contra, </em>premises his argument on the traditional view that to hold a fetal child under our death act to be a \u2018person\u2019 we, in legal effect, judicially amend a statute which has been construed since its enactment over a hundred years ago to exclude the cause of action contended for by appellant. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-9\">\u201cRather we rest our decision squarely upon the fact that at the time our wrongful death act was passed the legislature used the term \u2018person\u2019 in its ordinary, generally accepted meaning at that time. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-10\">\u201cWe are not convinced that \u2018person\u2019 in its ordinary signification in 1848 when our death act was passed included the concept of a fetal child. It should be noted and emphasized that we deal here, not with a cause of action which existed at common law. We do not face here the question of broadening the base of recovery in an action already recognized at common law. We deal with a statute in derogation of the common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANO\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201cConsidering the plain import of the word \u2018person\u2019 at the time of enactment of our statute and its uniform interpretation through the years, we feel obligated to accord to the term its \u2018ordinary signification\u2019 when legislatively employed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">No citation of authority was provided in <em>Powers </em>to establish the historical accuracy of those conclusions. It is not accurate to assume that our recent explosion of medical knowledge on the subject of prenatal life constituted a complete reversal of previous thinking on the subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">The instructive dissent of <em>Mr. Justice Boggs, </em>in <em>Allaire </em>v. <em>St. Lukes Hospital, </em>184 Ill 359 (56 NE 638), at 368, was written in 1900. His view has been largely adopted in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The majority in that case held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-7\">\u201cThat a child before birth is, in fact, a part of the mother and is only severed from her at birth, cannot, we think, be successfully disputed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">Justice Boggs wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-9\">\u201cMedical science and skill and experience have demonstrated that at a period of gestation in advance of the period of parturition the foetus is capable of independent and separate life, and that though within the body of the mother it is not merely a part of her body, for her body may die in all of its parts and the child remain alive and capable of maintaining life when separated from the dead body of the mother.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-10\">If the mother can die and the fetus live, or the fetus die and the mother live, how can it be said that there is only one life?</p>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">If tortious conduct can injure one and not the other, how can it be said that there is not a duty owing to each?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>The phenomenon of birth is not the beginning of life; it is merely a change in the form of life. The principal feature of that change is the fact of respiration. But the law does not regard the incidence of respiration as the sole determinative of life. Respiration can be artificially induced or mechanically supplied. Life remains.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">That the fetus cannot be seen is hardly the measure of life. That it cannot cry or see or remember \u2014 can these things control its right to live?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">What of the capacity for \u201cindependent\u201d life?</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">A baby fully born and conceded by all to be \u201calive\u201d is no more able to survive unaided than the infant <em>en ventre sa mere. </em>In fact, the babe in arms is less self-sufficient \u2014 more dependent \u2014 than his unborn counterpart.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">Does he want to eat? He cannot take himself to his mother\u2019s breast, or even discover the use of it without her help. He cannot keep himself warm or dry or ward off danger. He lives by the sufferance of others, demanding the means of sustaining his life by the noisy, endearing, obvious fact of his presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">The demands of the unborn child are no less total, but they are enforced by physical rather than emotional attachments. Ensconced and protected, he takes what he needs without asking. Only the conscious or negligent acts of others can deprive him of sustenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">The phenomenon of birth is an arbitrary point from which to measure life. True, we reckon age by counting birthdays. The Chinese count from New Years. The choice is arbitrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-10\">Birth may be natural, where the fetus has commenced the process by chemical changes within himself, and the mother has cooperated; it may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>intentional, as in the case of Cesarean section or induced labor; or it may be accidental, as where the child is separated from the mother by trauma.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">One need not be alive in order to be born; as the delivery of stillborn babies demonstrates. Neither is it possible for one to be born alive unless he be living prior to the birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">A fetus having died within its mother\u2019s womb is dead; it will not come alive when separated from her. A fetus living within the mother\u2019s womb is a living creature; it will not die when separated from her unless the manner, the time or the circumstances of separation constitute a fatal trauma.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">The fact of life is not denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Neither is the wisdom of the public policy which regards unborn persons as being entitled to the protection of the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-8\">PA 1968, No 292, constitutes a legislative recognition of the <em>personhood </em>of the unborn:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-9\">\u201c600.2045 Guardian ad litem for <em>unborn persons. </em>[M.S.A. 27A.2045].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-10\">\u201cSec. 2045. (1) If in an action or proceeding, other than in probate court, it appears that a person not in being may become entitled to a property interest, real or personal, legal or equitable, involved in or affected by the action or proceeding, and the interest of the unborn person is not or cannot otherwise properly be represented and protected, the court, upon its own motion, or upon the motion of any party, may appoint a suitable person to appear and act as guardian ad litem of the unborn person. The guardian ad litem is authorized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>to engage counsel and do whatever is necessary to defend and protect the interest of the unborn person. A judgment or order made after the appointment shall be conclusive upon the unborn person for whom a guardian was appointed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-6\">\u201c(2) The guardian ad litem may be removed by the court which appointed him, without notice, when it appears to the court to be for the best interests of the ward. The guardian ad litem may be allowed reasonable compensation by the court appointing him, to be paid and taxed as a cost of the proceeding's as directed by the court.\u201d MCLA \u00a7 600.2045 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 27A.2045). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">If property interests of unborn persons are protected by the law, how much more solicitous should the law be of the first unalienable right of man \u2014 the right to life itself?</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">There remains the question of whether the statutory action for wrongful death contemplates an action for the wrongful death of an unborn child, in the light of the unitary and interdependent provisions of PA 1939, No 297, and sections 114 and 115 of the probate code of the same year, 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">These statutes were interpreted in <em>Breckon </em>v. <em>Franklin Fuel Company </em>(1970), 383 Mich 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">We there held that damages recoverable in wrongful death actions were limited to pecuniary injury, reasonable medical, hospital, funeral and burial expenses, and conscious pain and suffering, and that the concept of \u201cpecuniary injury\u201d was further delineated by the probate code provision requiring distribution of such pecuniary loss among \u201cdependents of the decedent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b256-11\">We have never held, however, that \u201cdependents of the decedent\u201d were limited to those persons who received actual support and maintenance from the decedent during his lifetime.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>In <em>In re Olney\u2019s Estate </em>(1944), 309 Mich 65, we held that a husband was entitled to the value of his wife\u2019s services, less the reasonable cost of her maintenance, and that such loss of services constituted a \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d recoverable by him as administrator of her estate, and distributable to him as a \u201cdependent\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-6\">So, too, in the case of minor children, parents are entitled to the net value of their children\u2019s services; these are pecuniary injuries with respect to which the parents stand in the capacity of dependents for the purpose of distribution under the probate code.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">Admittedly in the case of very young or stillborn children, the value of prospective filial service is not easy to prove.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-8\">But pecuniary injuries are alleged in this cause, and no issue has been made of it in this appeal based upon the motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-9\">Reversed and remanded.

This case, dealing as in <em>Breckon </em>v. <em>Franklin Fuel Company </em>(1970), 383 Mich 251 with the same unitary statutes as are cited at the margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> is fairly entitled to the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>textual beginning as the Court employed for <em>Breckon. </em>To quote <em>Breckon </em>at 264, 265:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-4\">\u201cAll of which brings to the fore that judicial obligation which arises when one party to litigation demands that the Court apply a controlling statute one way and his adversary insists that it should be applied precisely the other way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-5\">\u201c50 Am Jur, Statutes, \u00a7 223, pp 200-203, speaks tersely the duty called into play here:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b258-6\">\u201c \u2018\u00a7 223. <em>Legislative Intent as Controlling Factor. </em>\u2014 In the interpretation of statutes, the legislative will is the all important or controlling factor. Indeed, it is frequently stated in effect that the intention of the legislature constitutes the law. <em>The legislative intent has been designated the vital part, heart, soul, and essence of the law, and the guiding star in the interpretation thereof. </em>Accordingly, the primary rule of construction of statutes is to ascertain and declare the intention of the legislature, and carry such intention into effect to the fullest degree. A construction adopted should not be such as to nullify, destroy, or defeat the intention of the legislature.\u2019 (Emphasis by present writer.)\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">For some reason no thoughtful trial lawyer or trial judge is able to rationalize on legal ground, these statutes of 1939 have \u2014 since handing down of <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Van Laan </em>(1962), 367 Mich 485 \u2014 been treated by some here as exempt from <em>all </em>rules of statutory construction. Why the provisions thereof, plucked out and set apart from all other statutes, should be regarded as open to judicial amendment <em>without word or thought for legislative intent, </em>is pure mystery; no reason being deigned in or upon any page of our books even after repeated challenge. <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Fiting, supra, </em>is a prime example of this state of affairs, the issue in that case having been right of suit for alleged pecuniary injury and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>eligibility of survivors to distributive proceeds \u2014 under the mentioned acts of 1939.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">This writer, slated now to contribute an offering prior to scriven by or on behalf of a majority of the Justices, proposes to lance our feverish disagreement with aim toward ascertainment as now due of the specific issue of legislative intent and purpose. As before in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Troy </em>(1968), 380 Mich 160, 182-185, I do not care to join others for today\u2019s forthcoming new tour through philosophy, theology, science and legal writings dehors Michigan <em>where statutes corresponding with or even akin to those now before us have never come to enactment.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">I begin by reference to two mature and obviously necessary rules of statutory construction. The first and <em>basic </em>one is that <em>all </em>portions of statutory provisions brought under scrutiny should be read together and considered for accurate identification of the will of the legislature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-6\">\u201cThe basic rule governing the matter is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent. <em>City of Grand Rapids </em>v. <em>Crocker, </em>219 Mich 178; <em>Boyer-Campbell Co. </em>v. <em>Fry, </em>271 Mich 282 (98 ALR 827); <em>Gardner-White Co. </em>v. <em>State Board of Tax Administration, </em>296 Mich 225. This requires that the clause in question shall be read in connection with other pertinent provisions of the act and that a meaning shall be given thereto consistent with the general purpose sought to be accomplished.\u201d <em>(Roberts Tobacco Company </em>v. <em>Department of Revenue </em>[1948], 322 Mich 519, 530).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">The other is that which most recently was reiterated unanimously in <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Tygard </em>(1968), 381 Mich 271, 275:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-8\">\u201cPerforce we say as we have said uniformly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>before in determining legislative intent we accord words their ordinary meaning:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b260-4\">\u201c \u2018The words of a statute are to be taken in their ordinary signification and import.\u2019 <em>Green </em>v. <em>Graves </em>(1844), 1 Doug (Mich) 351, 354.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Now for <em>our </em>unitary acts of 1939, as amended, and their relation to <em>our </em>original statute of 1848, paying no attention to foreign statutes and interpretations which no reasonable mind or man could seriously fit to <em>our </em>said statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">In <em>Currie, supra </em>at 465, the writer called upon the Brethren for response to pointed questions purposed toward ascertainment of the then called up intent of the legislature as regards the aforesaid acts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> There was no answer or hint of answer then, anywhere in the 49 pages of <em>Currie. </em>Now I try again, hoping that the Brethren this time will join in framing issue <em>whether, </em>by the acts of 1939 as amended, <em>the legislature intended to provide that </em>\u201c \u2018new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principle, in every way new,\u2019 \u201d and wholly <em>\u201cindependent cause of action for the purpose of compensating certain dependent members of the family </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>for the deprivation, <em>pecuniarily, </em>resulting to them from his [\u2018the injured person\u2019] wrongful death\u201d, <em>in favor of anyone assigning the wrongful taking of a fetus. </em>(The quotations are taken from <em>Michigan Central R. Co. </em>v. <em>Vreeland </em>[1913], 227 US 59, 69 (33 S Ct 192, 195, 57 L Ed 417, 421), adopted by our Court in <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Detroit &amp; Mackinac R. Co. </em>[1914], 179 Mich 189, 204).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">In <em>Currie, supra </em>at 466, the entire wrongful death act of 1848 was reproduced; my then purpose being that of identifying the legislative intent by utilizing a former regular practice of the legislature (discontinued with the compilation of 1929). That practice was the citation by marginal appendages, in the respective compilations, of extant court decisions construing and applying the theretofore employed statutory language. On the occasion of <em>Currie </em>the reproduction was taken from the compiled laws of 1871.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Now and below I have had reproduced the act of 1848 from the \u201cLaws of Michigan\u201d as then published.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Next and below I have inserted today\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>outstanding counterpart of the act of 1848, portrayed by section 2 of aforesaid act 297 of 1939, as amended without change by PA 1961, No 236, and as amended without relevant change by PA 1965, No 146.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> My purpose here is to portray demonstra<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tively the way in which the legislature has told all willing to read that \u201cperson\u201d and \u201csuch deceased person,\u201d as employed in 1848, again in 1939, and then again in 1965, contemplated \u2014 naturally, precisely and sensibly \u2014 a living human being whose wrongful death could and did cause that requisite \u201cpecuniary injury\u201d to, or \u201cpecuniary loss\u201d suffered by, a surviving \u201cwidow\u201d, \u201cwife\u201d, \u201cspouse\u201d, and \u201cnext of kin\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\"><em>Just what legislative assembly of Michigan intended, </em>by contextual employment of such commonly understood words and phrases as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u201cperson\u201d,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-6\">\u201cwidow and next of kin of such, deceased person\u201d, \u201cwife and next of kin of such deceased person\u201d, \u201cdecedent\u201d,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">\u201cdependents of the decedent\u201d,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-8\">\u201ceach of such dependents\u201d,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-9\">\u201creasonable compensation for the pain and suffering, while conscious, undergone by such deceased person during the period intervening between the time of inflicting of such injuries and his death\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-10\">and particularly by repeated limitation of \u201cpecuniary\u201d benefits to the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-11\">\u201csurviving spouse and next of kin who suffered such pecuniary injury\u201d,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-12\">\n<em>to create a statutory cause for wrongful death of an unborn or stillborn fetus?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b264-13\">This gentle comment is submitted: An unborn or stillborn fetus simply could not and cannot succeed in leaving a \u201cwidow\u201d, a \u201cwife\u201d, a \u201cspouse\u201d, or \u201cnext of kin who suffered such pecuniary injury\u201d. Nor could any legislator of 1848, or of 1939, or of 1965, reasonably have conceived otherwise. If the Brethren purpose to write \u201cnay\u201d to this, I shall read their reasons with controlled and utmost deference.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-14\">For further enlightenment with respect to the legislative intent of 1848 (indeed for the overall intentional purpose of our 1939-strengthened version of Lord Campbell\u2019s Act), see this Court\u2019s quotation of the original British Act itself <em>(Hyatt </em>v. <em>Adams </em>[1867], 16 Mich 180, 194), noting particularly that the action must then have been brought \u201cby and in the name of the executor or administrator of the person deceased, and to be for the benefit of the <em>wife, husband, parent </em>or <em>child </em>of the person whose death shall have been so caused\u201d. Would the wrongful prevention of birth into life have qual<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>ified then, any more than now, for action under such a statute? I think it proper to reply that, both in <em>Powers </em>and now in <em>O\u2019Neill, </em>plaintiff\u2019s counsel and others have concentrated too much on that one word \u201cperson\u201d, and too little on the purposeful rest of these unitary statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Refer <em>(ante </em>at p 141) to quotation of <em>Detroit </em>v. <em>Tygard. </em>Employment by our legislature of the noun \u201cperson\u201d in 1848, and again in 1939 and 1965, permits no more today than a century ago any tensional stretch of that noun\u2019s common or ordinary understanding. Looking back at its original use both in England and here, it has occurred to the writer that legislators of the past century<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> may have been just as familiar with English communicative usages as we are supposed to be, and that the common grasp of ordinary words employed then might be obtained by consulting what reputedly remains the most thorough and authoritative dictionary and encyclopedia that was published during the 19th century. Turning upon that thought to the 10-volume, 50 to 55 pound Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia (copyrighted 1889-1902 and published by the Century Company of New York), we find in Volume V the noun \u201cperson\u201d defined and discussed in all of its aspects (pp 4414, 4415). Nowhere on any of these pages is there any suggestion that\" individual \u201cperson\u201d meant anything except a living and breathing human. Arriving at Division \u201c9\u201d of the definitions, we find this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">\u201c9. In <em>law: </em>(a) A living human being, (b) A human being having rights and duties before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>law; one not a slave. In old Roman law slaves were not considered to be persons, (c) A being, whether natural or artificial, whether an individual or a body corporate other than the state, having rights and duties before the law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">I find nothing detracting from this in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2d ed 1956), p 1828. See on that page \u201c8. <em>Law\u201d.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">It is true that more can be said, of simple reasoning brewed of common understanding of prevalently familiar words and phrases, for holding that it was the wrongful taking of a breadwinning or otherwise pecuniarily supportive person which the legislature had in mind, all the way through, when that body dealt successively with the wrongful death of a \u201cperson\u201d and the wrongful death of \u201csuch deceased person.\u201d The above however should be enough for initial writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>To conclude:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">1. I cannot accept for determination plaintiff\u2019s constitutional attack upon the mentioned statutes,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> for even if we should decide that issue in his favor the result would have to be destruction of the very cause he has pleaded, along with all other pending and future actions of its statutory kind. <em>Neither ,the Fourteenth Amendment nor our own Constitution may, </em>without saying so, <em>amend </em>any Michigan statute. They may destroy such a statute, depend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>ing upon our interpretation and application of it, but it is for us to say what the legislature meant by employed language when conflicting constructions of such a statute are pressed upon us.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">I <em>do </em>accept plaintiff\u2019s appeal as a renewed motion (as in <em>Powers </em>v. <em>City of Troy </em>[1968], 380 Mich 160) for judicial revision of all sections of the unitary acts of 1939 as amended; a revision which if ordered will render eligible thereunder suits by appointed fiduciaries of the unborn or stillborn to recover damages for \u201cpecuniary injury\u201d on behalf of what necessarily must be newly designated beneficiaries. On that issue, that alone, an already divided Court has squared off.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">2. <em>Womack </em>v. <em>Buchhorn </em>1971, 384 Mich 718 has been decided since submission of the case at bar. Now it is urged that our determination of that <em>common-law </em>action, brought as it was (not by a fiduciary of a statutory \u201cdecedent\u201d but <em>by an eight year old </em>child) for injuries caused by negligence \u201cduring the fourth month of pregnancy,\u201d authorizes for the first time a statutory action for wrongful death on behalf of the \u201csurviving spouse and next of kin\u201d of an unborn or stillborn fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">It is a sufficient answer to point out that this Court expressly confined its <em>Womack </em>decision to a holding that an action will lie <em>at common law, </em>by a person prenatally injured and hence born injured, for causal negligence. Such common-law action has to be brought, of course, by or on behalf of a living human being. The measure of damages must be such as have been suffered personally since birth, and as will be suffered personally in the future. No cause for \u201cpecuniary injury\u201d or \u201cpecuniary loss,\u201d on behalf of others whether \u201cspouse\u201d or \u201ckin,\u201d was authorized by <em>Womack.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>All <em>Womack </em>did was that which this Court may ever do as maker and molder of the common law of Michigan. Was it not suggested in <em>Currie, supra </em>at 486, 487, that it would be a bit more lawful and upright should the Court fashion \u2014 as now in <em>Womack </em>\u2014a common-law action whenever as in <em>Currie </em>we perceive a definite wrong; a wrong knowing no remedy? Was not another like suggestion made (by separate opinion of <em>Abendschein </em>v. <em>Farrell </em>[1969], 382 Mich 510, 524-527, supported then by Justice T. G. Kavanagh), that our Court may at will create a remedy for any disclosed wrong when, presently, there is no known remedy therefor?</p>\n<p id=\"b268-6\">It may be well to repeat here this Court\u2019s employment of the principle to which allusion has just been made <em>(Creek </em>v. <em>Laski </em>[1929], 248 Mich 425, 65 ALR 1113; employed later in <em>B. F. Farnell Company </em>v. <em>Monahan </em>[1966], 377 Mich 552, 556):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-7\">\u201c \u2018Action on the case \u2014 \u201cis an outgrowth of the principle that, whenever the law gives a right or prohibits an injury, it will also afford a remedy. Hence, where there has been an injury for which none of the established forms of action will lie, an action on the case may be maintained, it being no objection that there is no precedent for the particular action, since the action is suited to every wrong and grievance that a person may suffer, and varies according to the circumstances of the case.\u201d 11 C J p 4.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">I vote to affirm the judgment entered below (20 Mich App 679).</p>\n<judges id=\"b268-9\">Adams, J., concurred in the result.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b257-12\"> PA 1939, No 297; CLS 1961, \u00a7 600.2922; MCLA \u00a7 600.2922 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 27A.2922) as amended by PA 1965, No 146.
