With respect to that system, it has been my regular practice since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>1959 to submit to the Brethren old-fashioned hacklesmoothers headed \u201cPer Curiam\u201d, each struck off with steady employment of the plural pronoun \u201cwe\u201d. Usually, but far from always, this soothing procedure has worked out with majority satisfaction. <em>Carman </em>v. <em>Secretary of State </em>(1971), 384 Mich 443, 447 is the most recent prominent example. This case of <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Walch </em>now becomes one of the exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">The ensuing opinion \u2014 in form <em>per curiam </em>and presented in unitary grammatics \u2014 was submitted to the Justices May 14 last. With it went a somewhat lengthy memorandum explaining why I felt no need for reference to <em>Beacon Theatres </em>v. <em>Westover </em>(1959), 359 US 500 (79 S Ct 948, 3 L Ed 2d 988) and the progeny thereof. The memorandum advised:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">\u201cIn preparing the opinion I decided purposely to omit reference to these cases <em>[Beacon et al.], </em>figuring that the profession already comprehends fully the difference between the congressionally controlled jurisdiction of the lower courts of the Federal system (under art 3, US Const) and the jurisdiction which, by <em>our </em>Constitution, has from 1850 beginning been vested with what we know today as Michigan\u2019s \u2018one Court of Justice\u2019. All this last appears with clarity, both in the opinion of the <em>Brown Case </em>[75 Mich 274] and in the lengthy opinion on application for rehearing of the <em>Blodgett Case </em>[115 Mich 160, 169].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-7\">\u201cThe Supreme Court in the <em>Beacon Theatres Case </em>dealt with rights under the Federal declaratory judgment act and, most recently <em>(Ross </em>v. <em>Bernhard, </em>396 US 531, 24 L Ed 2d 729), with the right to a demanded jury trial of a stockholder\u2019s derivative action \u2014 both under the 7th Amendment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-8\">\u201cIf three or four members of the Court deem it needful that these fundamentals require expatiation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>I will be glad to add a pedantic paragraph, providing many interesting illustrations of professorial theory gone mad in the face of the people\u2019s grant of and duty to exercise the judicial power which, starting definitely with the <em>Brown Case, </em>has been known pretty well.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Sadly however, I find that the May 14 draft has stimulated no paeans or hosannahs. That being the present state of <em>Wolf's </em>affairs, I have amended the May 14 draft so as to switch pronouns and structure into the area of the first person singular, and to submit the new draft as a separate contribution to the collection plate. This should prod the writing of whatever opinion may be desired by our majority, thereupon bringing this May-submitted cause to due decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">My new and now individual opinion of <em>Wolf </em>v. <em>Walch </em>follows. It is submitted to the Brethren this 3rd day of July, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">Plaintiff instituted this action to foreclose a real estate mortgage and a chattel mortgage, both executed by defendants to secure payment of a running-account owing for merchandise sold and delivered to defendants\u2019 retail stores. The complaint alleged a balance owing of approximately $61,000. Defendants answered with allegation that the mortgages sought to be foreclosed had been paid in full and, by counterclaim alleging fraud, breach of contract and \u201cwillful and wrongful interference with defendants\u2019 just rights and business\u201d, sought damages against plaintiff in the sum of $200,000. With their answer and counterclaim defendants filed a general and all-inclusive demand for jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Plaintiff moved promptly to strike the demand. That motion was denied at pretrial; \u201cthere is a jury question in regard to the counterclaim at least.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Trial of all issues presented by the pleadings went ahead before the jury. The jury was told to bring in a general verdict only, for the plaintiff, or for the defendants, or that \u201cneither one of them is entitled to anything\u201d. Its verdict was \u201cno cause for action as to both the claim and counterclaim\u201d. Plaintiff thereupon moved to \u201cvacate the purported jury verdict of no cause for action as to the claim of the plaintiff against the defendant\u201d, and for entry of a decretal judgment of foreclosure against defendants with judicial finding of a secured balance owing it in the sum of $55,421.42. Its primary reason offered in support was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-5\">\u201cThe issues raised by the amended foreclosure complaint and the amended answer thereto are equitable in nature (MSA 27 A.3180) and are for non-jury determination by the court. The jury was permitted to hear evidence concerning the amended complaint for foreclosure along with defendants\u2019 evidence as to the amended counterclaim only as a matter of convenience, subject to objection of plaintiff and plaintiff\u2019s motion for separate non-jury trial thereof. Said verdict is not binding on the court or plaintiff under Rule 509.4 because plaintiff did not consent to jury trial as to the complaint for foreclosure.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">For further factual and procedural details see the opinion of Division 3, resulting in reversal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>remand for new trial (21 Mich App 483, 489). The Court granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal (383 Mich 798), partly to review the merits <em>de novo </em>and, more importantly, to consider the propriety of ordering and conducting a single trial before a jury, selected and instructed to bring in a general verdict only; the action in the first place heing purely equitable and there having been no determination or suggestion that the jury\u2019s function would, under GCR, 1963, 509.4, be that of an adviser only. For reference to the beginning basis of our concern, see chapter 31 of the Revised Judicature Act of 1961, particularly \u00a7\u00a7 3101 and 3180 MCLA \u00a7\u00a7 600.3101, 600.3180 (Stat Ann 1962 Rev \u00a7\u00a7 27A. 3101, 27 A.3180).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\"><em>First: </em>The original edition of Pomeroy\u2019s \u201cTreatise on Equity Jurisprudence\u201d was published in 1881. The author at that time warned the profession forcefully that what then was termed the \u201cReformed Procedure\u201d (recognized loosely today as the \u201cunion of law and equity\u201d, the \u201cblended procedure\u201d, or the \u201cprocedural merger\u201d) would unless controlled result inevitably in the gradual suppression and final disappearance of equitable principles and doctrines and the supplanting thereof \u201cby the more inflexible and arbitrary rules of the law; until in time equity would practically cease to be a distinctive part of the national jurisprudence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>It cannot be doubted that Pomeroy\u2019s then newly heralded alert came to the attention of this Court when, in 1889 <em>(Brown </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, </em>75 Mich 274), it was shown by petition for mandamus that one of the parties to an equitable action (brought to set aside a deed) had successfully demanded a jury trial of the framed issue <em>with result that the jury\u2019s verdict became the foundation for an entered decree in favor of the complainant. </em>Consider that part of the opinion of Justice Campbell, writing for a unanimous Court, where (p 284) it was observed trenchantly that, \u201cThe right to have equity controversies dealt with by equitable methods is as sacred as the right of trial by jury\u201d and then ruled (p 285):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-5\">\u201cJuries cannot devise specific remedies, or safely deal with complicated interests, or with relief given in successive stages, or adjusted to varying conditions. Theory amounts to nothing in the history of jurisprudence. The system of chancery jurisprudence has been developed as carefully and as judiciously as any part of the legal system, and the judicial power includes it, and always must include it. Any change which transfers the power that belongs to a judge to a jury, or to any other person or body, is as plain a violation of the Constitution as one which should give the courts executive or legislative power vested elsewhere. The cognizance of equitable questions belongs to the judiciary as a part of the judicial power, and under our Constitution must remain vested where it always has been vested heretofore.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-6\"><em>Leser </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1920), 212 Mich 558, procedurally is much like the case at bar. By his bill the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>sought to set aside an exchange of real estate for fraud. A jury was impaneled and the case was tried \u201cas ordinary actions at law are tried\u201d. The jury returned a general verdict for plaintiff. Justice Fellows, writing for the Court, opened review this way (pp 561, 562):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">\u201cThis court hears chancery cases <em>de novo, </em>aided but not controlled by the findings of fact of the trial judge, who may in turn be aided but not controlled by the findings of a jury on pure questions of fact. In the case of <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Circuit Judge </em>[1889], 75 Mich 274 (5 L.R.A. 226, 13 Am.St.Rep. 438), this court in holding an act invalid which provided for a trial by jury in chancery cases as matter of right, and making\u2019 the verdict a finality, pointed out quite fully the rights of party litigants in equity cases. It was there said:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">\u201c \u2018The right to have equity controversies dealt with by equitable methods is as sacred as the right of trial by jury. Whatever may be the machinery for gathering testimony or enforcing decrees, the facts and the law must be decided together; and when a chancellor desires to have the aid of a jury to find out how facts appear to such unprofessional men, it can only be done by submitting single issues of pure fact, and they cannot foreclose him in his conclusions unless they convince his judgment.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">\u201cAs has already been noted, single questions of pure fact were not submitted to the jury, nor has the chancellor expressed his personal views upon the facts aided or unaided by the verdict. The proceedings are irregular, but the testimony is all before us, and as the final triers of the facts in chancery cases we shall proceed to dispose of the case giving such weight to the verdict of the jury as under all the circumstances it is entitled to. By so doing we are not to be understood as approving the method of procedure in the instant case or making it a guide for future cases.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The writer, recalling personal participation in the early meetings and deliberations of the Joint Committee on Civil Procedure of 1958-1962, has yet in mind Pomeroy\u2019s warning. Honigman and Hawkins have recorded the fact and the point thereof in their Michigan Court Rules Annotated (vol 1, pp 9,11):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-5\">\u201cThese rules are written to abolish, as far as possible, the <em>procedural </em>distinctions between law and equity. No attempt has been made to alter the substantive differences between law and equity. However, Professor Pomeroy observed, in the preface to the first edition of Pomeroy\u2019s Equity Jurisprudence (1881), that under such unified procedure \u2018The tendency * * * has plainly and steadily been towards the giving an undue prominence and superiority to purely legal rules, and the ignoring, forgetting, or suppression of equitable notions.\u2019 The adoption of these rules is not to be construed as approving of this tendency. On the contrary, Professor Pomeroy\u2019s words are to be taken as a warning so that we may avoid the consequences he describes. Only procedural distinctions are abolished or minimized by this set of rules.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\"># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\u201c(1) Most important, the distinctions between law and equity must continue to be recognized for the purpose of preserving constitutional rights to trial by jury in legal matters and trial by court in equity matters. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, </em>(1889), 75 Mich 274, 42 NW 827.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">\u201c(2) The substantive elements of the cause of action \u2014 that is, the facts which must be proved to establish a claim or defense \u2014 and the kind of remedy the court can give must still be determined by reference to the substantive law of the actions in law and equity <em>as they previously </em>existed(Last emphasis supplied by present writer.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>As the deliberations of the Joint Committee progressed, the advisability of uniting law and equity <em>procedure </em>came to debate. Accessory thereto was the alleged and denied right to a jury trial of a specific issue or issues of fact where, in a typical chancery action, the court must retain the invoked jurisdiction for the purpose of performing equity\u2019s traditional aim, that of granting complete relief by adjudging in one action the rights and duties of all of the parties which <em>really groiv out of or are connected with the subject matter of that </em>action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">As the described debate proceeded the equity action of <em>Sokel </em>v. <em>Nickoli </em>came to second review (356 Mich 460, decided June 6, 1959). On that occasion the Court concluded unanimously (p 467):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">\u201cIn regard to appellants\u2019 complaint that the lower court denied them a jury trial, we call attention to the statute (CL 1948, \u00a7 618.21 [Stat Ann \u00a7 27.1001]) providing that the court shall decide whether a jury is necessary, and, we believe, the following, as stated in <em>Chamberlain </em>v. <em>Eddy </em>[1908], 154 Mich 593, 604, 605, applies:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">\u201c \u2018We are not impressed with the importance of a jury to decide any question in the case. A chancellor can do it as well. Where the jurisdiction of equity is clear, as in this case, there is no obligation to send questions of fact to the jury.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The significance of the stated distinction between the purposeful substance of law and equity cannot be overstressed, most certainly in the context of this business of verdicts advisory. As early as <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>Dunn </em>(1863), 11 Mich 285, an action for divorce wherein a jury was assembled \u201cto try and determine whether the acts of adultery set up in the answer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>had been committed\u201d, Justice Campbell wrote (p 286):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">\u201cThe reason for this difference is, that in an action at law the jury are the sole judges of questions of fact, while in a court of equity there is no process by which the Chancellor can substitute the conscience or belief of a jury for his own; and he must find the facts on his own responsibility. * * * And there is no authority which I have discovered which renders it incumbent on any court of Chancery, or even proper, to follow a verdict which is not calculated to aid the conscience of the court, in solving questions of fact otherwise doubtful.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-5\"><em>Second: </em>In <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Kalamazoo Circuit Judge, supra, </em>the Court acknowledged the dilemma of the chancellor; whether under the questioned statute of 1887 he should have entered his decree on strength of the special verdicts of the jury, or should \u201cexercise his own judgment in the case\u201d, (p 276.) There as here the presented question was whether a demand for jury trial, made timely in the course of an equitable action, must be honored <em>as of right. </em>Here as in <em>Brown </em>the \u201cquestion has been raised in several parts of the State, and needs to he settled in order to procure uniformity of practice\u201d. <em>(Brown </em>at 276.)</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">Judge Van Domelen, perceivably in doubt as the record shows with respect to the substance as well as the procedure which was or may have been effected in 1963, instructed the jury in detail with respect to what upon factual test became a complex accounting action; an action which, being essentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>equitable <em>(Second Michigan Cooperative Housing Association </em>v. <em>First Michigan Cooperative Housing Association </em>[1959], 358 Mich 252, 256), was bound to be determinative of tbe issue of payment of tbe mortgage or mortgages defendants say were merged and satisfied. I perceive no need for review of these instructions for error, the jury\u2019s verdict being advisory as the trial judge finally decided. Rather, it is suggested that our task is to determine whether, without remand, the circuit court\u2019s decretal judgment can be affirmed or reversed with traditional finality. My answer is \u201cNo\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">The proof for and against payment of the two mortgages, and of the claimed legal merger of one with the other, was sharply conflicting. Plaintiff claimed and defendants denied that the parties had arrived at an account stated, each arguing upon the facts the legal questions Division 3 considered (21 Mich App at 487, 488). As for the defendants\u2019 counterclaim, no proof worthy of note was offered in support thereof, either as to liability or damages as pleaded. They claim only on this appeal that \u201cThe evidence supports the finding of the jury and court that neither party was entitled to recover\u201d. In these circumstances, regrettably, their counterclaim and jury demand brought about an unnecessary and fruitless jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Today\u2019s difficulty is that we have before us no independent opinion of the trial judge upon the facts, and no finding or determination by him beyond this disposition of plaintiff\u2019s motion to vacate the jury\u2019s verdict and enter a judgment of foreclosure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">\u201cThis court adopts the verdict of the jury as advisory so as to erase any doubts as to its efficacy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">\u201cIf the accounts between plaintiff and defendants are evenly balanced, then it follows that there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>nothing due on the real estate mortgage. The court finds that the chattel mortgage was merged in the real estate mortgage and was extinguished so there would be nothing due under the chattel mortgage and that should be discharged. Both mortgages were based upon the sale of goods and merchandise to defendants by plaintiff, and if there is nothing owed to the plaintiff by defendant as determined By the verdict, the mortgages must be treated as paid in full.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><em>Third: </em>Refer to <em>Beacon Theatres </em>v. <em>Westover, supra, </em>at p 255 and <em>Dairy Queen </em>v. <em>Wood </em>(1962), 369 US 469 (82 S Ct 894, 8 L Ed 2d 44); also most recent <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Bernhard </em>(1970), 396 US 531 (90 S Ct 733, 24 L Ed 2d 729). The first two of these cases are cited by defendants\u2019 counsel as authority for the proposition that his clients were \u201centitled to a jury trial by reason of the trial court\u2019s proper determination of the sequence of trial\u201d. This means, as I gather, that defendants claim they were entitled <em>of right </em>to obligatory acceptance of the jury\u2019s general verdict, distinguished from its advisory nature (see GCR 1963, 509.4 and 517.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">I cannot agree with counsel in such regard. So long as the <em>Brown </em>case stands as it does \u2014 and should \u2014 on our books, the right and duty of the trial court to hear and determine this equity case to decretal judgment, with or without an advisory jury, is constitutionally sound law in our State. In Michigan, unlike the Federal practice with its involvement of specific acts of Congress and the Seventh Amendment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we determine properly under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>our Constitution the extent of equity\u2019s jurisdiction, duties and powers. Our practice is governed by the rule set forth in <em>Vaughan </em>v. <em>Wayne Circuit Judge </em>(1908), 153 Mich 478, 480, followed in <em>F. M. Sibley Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Wayne Circuit Judge </em>(1928), 243 Mich 483, 485. It calls up the application of sound judicial discretion with no constitutional right of sequence of trial or jury trial involved; whenever the jurisdiction of equity is unquestioned, as here in <em>Wolf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\n<em>To conclude:</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">I believe it unwise to undertake decisional review of this decretal judgment without an opinion of the chancellor wherein he has found the facts and dealt with such legal questions as are requisite to determination of the case. In this instance the chancellor has not \u201cexpressed his personal views of the facts either as aided by the finding of the jury or independent thereof\u201d. <em>(Leser, supra </em>at 561.) And the profession knows that, upon <em>de novo </em>review of an equitable action, this Court depends much upon the opinion of the chancellor. I think we need such help, for the judge was \u201cthere\u201d when the witnesses testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">The situation being what it is, and the trial judge having heard all of the testimony given before the jury, I would remand specially rather than order a new trial or determine the case now. That the Court did in <em>Leser </em>decide finally is not to be taken as precedent, as Justice Fellows advised pointedly in our quotation of <em>Leser, ante </em>at p 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">This plaintiff is entitled to that which, but for the defendants\u2019 demand for jury trial, it would have obtained as a matter of course, namely, an opportunity to argue the facts independently before Judge Van Domelen in effort to persuade him that \u2014 irrespective of the jury\u2019s general and advisory verdict\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the proof did not preponderate in favor of defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses. Therefore the Court of Appeals\u2019 order for reversal and remand for new trial should be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">The record should be remanded for reargument of the cause before the trial judge, for preparation by him of an independent opinion, and for entry of a new decretal judgment which, consistent with the foregoing procedural views, should decide the merits of plaintiff\u2019s claimed right of foreclosure and defendants\u2019 denial thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">I suggest further that, if either or both of the contenders be dissatisfied with such new result, they be accorded right to have the trial court\u2019s new opinion and judgment certified to this Court for further consideration, all in conjunction with the present testimonial record and the received exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The issue of costs should abide the final result.</p>\n<judges id=\"b385-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. E. Brennan, T. G.
