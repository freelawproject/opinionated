Brennan, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">The Case</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Plaintiff commenced this action on November 17, 1965, against General Motors Corporation and UAW-CIO, Local 1292. The complaint alleged four separate causes of action in four counts. Counts I and III were directed against General Motors and sought $20,000 in damages from defendant corporation on each count; Counts II and IY were directed against UAW-CIO, and sought $20,000 in damages from defendant labor union on each count. Counts II and IY were disposed of by the circuit court\u2019s order of December 21, 1967, dismissing plaintiff\u2019s suit as to defendant UAW-CIO, Local 1292, and the intervenor-defendant, International Union, UAW.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">In Count I of the complaint, plaintiff alleges that on or about May 27,1964, when he was employed as a crane operator at a General Motors plant, he accidentally dropped a die and thereafter General Motors \u201cunjustly and prejudicially suspended the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Plaintiff from his employment and demoted him to the lesser paying classification of crane hooker in which capacity he is currently employed.\u201d Count I further alleges that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-6\">\u201c6. The Plaintiff is a member of the Negro race.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-7\"><em>\u201c7. </em>That just prior to and shortly after the above described suspension and demotion, a number of employees of the Defendant corporation employed at the same plant and in the same capacity as crane operators were disciplined and suspended because of the severe infractions of company rules and unsafe work habits. Several had been charged with unsafe work habits before and at least one was charged with operating a crane while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. None of these individuals, all members of the Caucasian race, were demoted because of the infractions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-8\">\u201c8. The Plaintiff herein had received no previous reprimands or discipline while working as a crane operator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-9\"><em>\u201c9. </em>The Defendant herein, General Motors Corporation owed a duty to the Plaintiff to refrain from, because of race, discriminating against him with respect to tenure, terms, conditions or privileges of employment, pursuant to M.S.A. 17.458 (3)(a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-10\">\u201c10. That the Michigan Constitution Article I, Section 2, prohibits the denial to any person of the enjoyment of his civil rights because of race. The Defendant, General Motors Corporation, was under a duty to refrain from denying the civil rights of the plaintiff herein, which includes equal opportunity and treatment in the field of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b660-11\">\u201c11. But the Defendant, General Motors Corporation, did breach the duties owed the Plaintiff under Michigan Pair Employment Practices Act and the Michigan Constitution by discriminating against him in the exercise of his civil rights to equal employment and for discriminating ag\u2019ainst him because of his race, color, national origin or ancestry by failing to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>accord him the same rights and privileges as an employee of the Caucasian race.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">In Count III, plaintiff re-alleges the factual allegations set forth in Count I, and further asserts that his alleged demotion from the crane operator classification constituted a violation of \u201can employment contract [which] existed between Plaintiff and Defendant General Motors Corporation, which was negotiated on his behalf by his union, bearing the date of September 20, 1961, which provided it to he \u2018applied to all employees without regard to race, color, creed or national origin.\u2019 \u201d He also alleged violation of a letter dated September 18,1961, signed by a vice-president of General Motors which provides in pertinent part that General Motors extends equal employment opportunities to all employees on a nondiscriminatory basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">On December 8, 1965, General Motors filed a motion for accelerated judgment of dismissal in the circuit court pursuant to Rule 116 of the Michigan General Court Rules. The motion asserted that the court lacked jurisdiction over the subject matter of Counts I and III of the suit; that Count I was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in the Michigan State Fair Employment Practices Act, and was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Michigan Civil Rights Commission; that Count III was barred by reason of the disposition made by plaintiff\u2019s exclusive bargaining representative prior to commencement of the action in withdrawing plaintiff\u2019s grievance from the contractual grievance procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">Attached to the motion were two affidavits. One of them, by the plant director of industrial relations, Ray Finley, set forth that on May 27, 1964, plaintiff filed a grievance through his bargaining representative which stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>\u201c \u2018Protest management removing me from the crane operator group. Demand that I he returned to the crane operator group at once.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">The Finley affidavit further stated that the grievance which plaintiff did file was withdrawn from the grievance procedure by his collective bargaining representative on September 3, 1964. A second affidavit, by Eugene Hartwig, counsel for General Motors, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">\u201cOn January 15, 1965, plaintiff filed an application for the issuance of a complaint against defendant Corporation * * * with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission alleging in substance that his removal by defendant Corporation from the \u2018crane operator\u2019 classification * * * constituted discrimination against him because of his race in violation of the Constitution of the State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-9\">\u201cOn April 27, 1965, the Civil Rights Commission entered its order dismissing plaintiff\u2019s claim. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">\u201c * * * that plaintiff did not within fifteen (15) days from the date of mailing of said order on April 28, 1965, request in writing of the commission a reconsideration of its refusal to issue a complaint.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-12\">\u201c * * * that plaintiff has not brought any action or proceeding against the Commission in any circuit court in the State of Michigan wherein he claims to be aggrieved by the order of said Commission entered on April 27, 1965.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-14\">Plaintiff filed two affidavits in opposition to the defendant corporation\u2019s and defendant local union\u2019s simultaneously filed motions for accelerated judgment. The first affidavit stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-15\">\u201c7. On numerous occasions, I attempted to get UAW-CIO, Local No. 1292 to process my grievance against the corporation and exhaust all of the avenues open to have me return to the classification of crane operator. The union refused to do this, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>and on their own, dismissed my grievance for the reasons set out in my Complaint filed in this cause.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-5\">\u201c8. As soon as it became clear that my union was not going to back me up in this matter and that the General Motors Corporation would not reinstate me in my proper classification, I notified the Michigan Civil Rights Commission, but was informed that the jurisdictional period of 180 days from the date of the offense had elapsed and, therefore, the commission was without jurisdiction to proceed with the matter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-6\">\u201c9. My failure to timely file a claim with the Michigan Civil Rights Commission was due to the fact that the union representatives indicated that they would take care of this matter for me in a fair fashion. I was advised and had every reason to believe that my grievance would be processed and that I would be returned to my classification of crane operator, from which I was wrongfully demoted, without further affirmative action on my part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">\u201c10. That many white men and employees of the defendant corporation with much worse work records than mine are now employed by the Defendant corporation as crane operators. Many of these men have been suspended for [sic] times, but none have been demoted, and in every instance where the union has stepped in and filed a grievance, the man has been reinstated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-8\">The second affidavit filed by plaintiff, in response to the international union\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment, specially dealt with the steps plaintiff went through in an attempt to appeal the union\u2019s allegedly wrongful dismissal of his grievance and the reasons for not pursuing those steps expeditiously.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>On May 3, 1967, the court entered its order denying General Motors\u2019 motion, but at the same time \u201cFURTHER ORDERED that the questions raised and issues posed in said motion may again be raised at the conclusion of the Plaintiff\u2019s proofs upon trial\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">On December 10, 1968, the case came on for trial with General Motors as the sole defendant. The factual and legal issues had been limited to those set forth in Counts I and III of plaintiff\u2019s complaint as a result of the December 21, 1967, order dismissing Counts II and IV, and by the circuit court\u2019s final pre-trial conference order of April 1, 1968. At the conclusion of the plaintiff\u2019s case on December 12, 1968, General Motors renewed its motion for accelerated judgment of dismissal in accordance with the right reserved to it by the circuit court\u2019s order of May 3,1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">The trial judge based his ruling in part on \u00a7 13 of Article 32 of the International Union Constitution, which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-7\">\u201cIt shall be the duty of any member or subordinate body who feels aggrieved by any action, decision or penalty imposed upon him or it to exhaust his or its remedies and all appeals therefrom under the laws of this International Union prior to appealing to a civil court or governmental agency for redress,\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">and also on \u00a7 16 of Article 6, which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b665-9\">\u201cThe International Union and the local union to which the member belongs and each of them are by this irrevocably designated, authorized and em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>powered exclusively to appear and act for him and in his behalf before any board, court, committee or other tribunal in any matter affecting his status as an employee.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The trial judge reasoned that those provisions required exhaustion of the administrative remedies within the structure of the collective bargaining agreement before a civil action could be brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">He further reasoned that the complaint which plaintiff had in this action was embodied in \u00a7 6a of the International contract which provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b666-8\">\u201cIt is the policy of General Motors and the UAW-AFL-CIO that the provisions of this agreement be applied to all employees covered by this agreement without regard to race, color, creed or national origin. Any claims of violation of this policy may be taken up as a grievance, provided that any such claim must be supported by written evidence by the time it is presented by the Shop Committee at a meeting with Management.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">The trial court then concluded that the grievance filed by plaintiff on May 27, 1964, contained no allegations of a 6a violation,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and that even if there had been a reference to a 6a violation, plaintiff had failed to exhaust his intra-union remedies. Defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment of dismissal was then granted as to both counts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>The Court of Appeals affirmed, 24 Mich App 60, concluding that plaintiff had failed to exhaust his remedies under the collective bargaining agreement, and there was nothing in the record even to support an inference that the employer repudiated the contractual procedures or that the union refused, wrongfully or otherwise, to process plaintiff\u2019s grievance based on alleged discrimination, since no 6a violation had ever been charged.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The allegations in Count I of plaintiff\u2019s complaint,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> which we accept as true for purposes of this motion for accelerated judgment,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> constitute a <em>prima facie </em>violation of the Michigan State Fair Employment Practices<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Act. That act provides in \u00a7 7(b):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>\u201cAny individual claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful employment practice may, by himself or his agent, make, sign and file with the board, within 90 days, after the alleged act of discrimination, a verified complaint in writing * * * .\u201d MCLA \u00a7 423.307(b) (Stat Ann 1968 Rev \u00a717.458 [7][b]).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">From Exhibit 1 attached to the Finley affidavit,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> it is clear that the incident concerning which plaintiff complains in this case occurred on May 28, 1964, when he was transferred from the crane operator classification to the press operator classification. This suit was filed on November 17, 1965, some 17-1/2 months after his grievance was withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">Defendant contends that since Count I of plaintiff\u2019s complaint alleges that the action which the employer took on May 28, 1964, constitutes a violation of the Michigan State Fair Employment Practices Act, plaintiff is bound by the statute of limitations embodied in that act which expressly provides that complaints of violations of the act must be filed within 90 days after the alleged act of discrimination. In support of that contention, defendant notes the general rule of law that one who sues to enforce a statutory right is restricted by the statutory limitation of time within which suit must be brought.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We re-affirm our adherence to this rule and are therefore constrained to agree with defendant that plaintiff\u2019s <em>statutory </em>remedy is barred since the applicable limitational period has run.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>But it is transparently clear that plaintiff in Count I is asserting a cumulative judicial remedy for redress of his civil right to freedom from discrimination in private employment, rather than any <em>statutory </em>remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Whether a civil action lies to recover compensation for damages suffered by reason of discrimination in private employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Decision</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">For reasons presently given, we reject defendant\u2019s arguments that the Civil Rights Commission\u2019s jurisdiction in this area is exclusive, and conclude that plaintiff may avail himself of a cumulative judicial remedy in vindication of this specific civil right.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">Our reasons for so holding are immersed in the origins of plaintiff\u2019s asserted civil right. In 1955, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>the fair employment practices act created a civil right<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> in the opportunity to obtain employment without discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin or ancestry. Defendant contends, and we agree, that prior to the passing of this important legislation in 1955, there was in Michigan no recognized legal remedy for acts of discrimination based on race in private employment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While a right of action was recognized for racial discrimination in public accommodation <em>(Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gies </em>[1890], 82 Mich 358) and in the enjoyment of various other civil rights, the right to be free from discrimination on account of race in private employment was not regarded as a civil right entitled to protection of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">We recognize that the fact that there was no preexistent common-law remedy for racial discrimination in private employment is generally highly significant in determining the exclusiveness of the statutory remedy. The general rule, in which Michigan is aligned with a strong majority of jurisdictions, is that where a new right is created or a new duty is imposed by statute, the remedy provided for enforcement of that right by the statute for its violation and nonperformance is exclusive. <em>Thurston </em>v. <em>Prentiss </em>(1849), 1 Mich 193; <em>In re Quinney\u2019s Estate </em>(1939), 287 Mich 329; <em>Lafayette Transfer &amp; Storage Co. </em>v. <em>Michigan Public Utilities Commission </em>(1939), 287 Mich 488.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Correlatively, a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>remedy for enforcement of a common-law right is deemed only cumulative.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">But courts have forged exceptions to these general rules when the statutory rights infringed were civil rights. Although there is some authority to the contrary<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> most decisions have held that a person aggrieved by the violation of a civil rights statute is entitled to pursue a remedy which will effectively reimburse him for or relieve him from violation of the statute, notwithstanding the statute did not expressly give him such right or remedy. <em>McCabe </em>v. <em>Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. B. Co. </em>(1914), 235 US 151 (35 S Ct 69, 59 L Ed 169); <em>People ex rel. Bibb </em>v. <em>Alton </em>(1904), 209 Ill 461 (70 NE <em>640); Randall </em>v. <em>Cowlitz Amusements, Inc. </em>(1938), 194 Wash 82 (76 P2d 1017).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">We turn to a discussion of prior decisions in Michigan relating to the issue of whether a person has a private remedy for violation of a civil rights statute-in the absence of any pre-existent common-law remedy. <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Gies, supra, </em>involved an action under a civil rights statute<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> growing out of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>the refusal of a restaurant keeper to serve colored persons in a particular part of his restaurant although there were vacant tables at which he would have served white persons. The Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-6\">\u201cBut it is claimed by the defendant\u2019s counsel that this statute gives no right of action for civil damages; that it is a penal statute; and that the right of the plaintiff under it is confined to a criminal-prosecution. The general rule, however, is that where a statute imposes upon any person a specific duty for the protection or benefit of others, if he neglects or refuses to perform such duty, he is liable for any injury or detriment caused by such neglect or refusal, if such injury or hurt is of the kind which the statute was intended to prevent; nor is it necessary in such a case as this to declare upon or refer to the statute.\u201d P 365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-7\"><em>Ferguson </em>would undoubtedly have settled the question in Michigan in favor of the right to maintain such private action, hut the Court then added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">\u201cThe common law as it existed in this State before the passage of this statute, and before the colored man became a citizen under our Constitution and laws, gave to the white man a remedy against any unjust discrimination to the citizen in all public places. It must he considered that, when this suit was planted, the colored man, under the common law of this State, was entitled to the same rights and privileges in public places as the white man, and he must be treated the same there; and that his right of action for any injury arising from an unjust discrimination against him is just as perfect and sacred in the courts as that of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>other citizen. This statute is only declaratory of the common law, as I understand it now to exist in this State.\u201d P 365.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">It was upon this language that defendant in <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>Grand Rapids Operating Corporation </em>(1927), 239 Mich 318, based his contention that the civil rights statute was immaterial to the earlier decision, and hence that <em>Ferguson </em>was not authority for the right to maintain a private action for exclusion from a place as to which the common law did not forbid discrimination, but our Court refused to adopt such a position. <em>Bolden </em>dealt with a Negro who had been refused a ticket permitting him to occupy a seat in defendant\u2019s theatre on account of his color. This Court unanimously upheld plaintiff\u2019s right to maintain a civil action for damages, despite the fact that the statute was criminal in form and provided imprisonment or fine or both for its violation. The argument advanced there as to the exclusiveness of the statutory remedy follows closely the reasoning of defendants here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-6\">\u201c2. The claim of defendant\u2019s counsel in regard to the right of action is thus stated:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-7\">\u201c \u2018The civil rights act is a criminal statute only, and does not give rise to an action for damages for its violation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b673-8\">\u201cCounsel urge that \u2018a theater is a private enter-uprise that \u2018in the absence of statute the proprietor of a theater may exclude therefrom any persons whomsoever;\u2019 that plaintiff\u2019s right of action must be based solely on the violation of the statute; that no such right existed at common law; that the statute does not in terms confer the right, and therefore the only liability of defendant for its violation is by criminal prosecution.\u201d P 325.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-9\">Our Court unqualifiedly rejected such an argument when dealing with civil rights statutes, con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>eluding that the aggrieved person may maintain an action for damages for injuries suffered by the violation of the civil rights statute despite the fact that the statute made no express provision for such recovery. We cited as the controlling principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-5\">\u201c'In cases.where there has been illegal discrimination the person aggrieved has clearly a civil right of action for damages, and this is true although the provision for the enforcement of a civil rights statute under which the complainant claims redress provides for a criminal prosecution only. This right accrues by virtue of the general rule that where a statute imposes upon any person a specific duty for the protection or benefit of others, neglect or refusal to perform the duty creates a liability for any injury or detriment caused by such neglect or refusal, if the injury or hurt is of the kind which the statute was intended to prevent.\u2019 \u201d P 328.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">The fact that in <em>Ferguson </em>there was a common-law remedy was expressly rejected as a basis for positing the private remedy. Thus <em>Bolden </em>clearly affirms that, despite the absence of any pre-existent common-law remedy, the fact that a civil rights statute does not specifically give the person aggrieved a right to damages for the injury suffered does not preclude maintenance of the civil damage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">More recently, we reiterated this holding in <em>St. John </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1944), 308 Mich 333. There, a civil damage action was held maintainable for violation of a penal anti-discrimination statute.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Justice Wiest, writing for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>\u201cIf plaintiff has suffered financial damage by-reason of defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the mandatory provisions of the statute applicable to claimants\u2019 employment then civil action may be maintained. <em>Bolden </em>v. <em>Grand Rapids Operating Corp. </em>[1927], 239 Mich 318 (53 ALR 183). The statute establishes specified personal civil rights and if there has been discrimination between sexes in the instances at bar the remedy by action at law is available to claimants.\u201d P 336.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-5\"><em>Bolden </em>and <em>St. John </em>would seem wholly dispositive of the issue of maintenance of the Count I civil damage action, but defendant further contends that the action is not maintainable since the exclusive machinery for enforcement of the right is now vested in the Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">In 1964, with the promulgation of the new Michigan Constitution, the Fair Employment Practices Commission was abolished and was superseded by the constitutionally created Civil Eights Commission which, in Article 5, \u00a7 29, has the duty in a manner which may be prescribed by law to investigate alleged discrimination against any person because of religion, race, color or national origin in the enjoyment of the civil rights guaranteed by law and by this constitution, and to secure the equal protection of such civil rights without such discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Section 29 of Article 5 of the constitution goes on to provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-8\">\u201cThe commission shall have power, in accordance with the provisions of this constitution and of general laws governing administrative agencies, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>promulgate rules and regulations for its own procedures, to hold hearings, administer oaths, through court authorization to require the attendance of witnesses and the submission of records, to take testimony, and to issue appropriate orders.

PA 1963 (Ex Sess), No 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Based on this historical framework, defendant contends that the right to be free from acts of racial discrimination in private employment is a right created by legislative enactment for which a specific statutory remedy has been established with exclusive jurisdiction to grant that remedy vested in a constitutionally created administrative body whose final orders only are subject to judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-8\">The third sentence of the second paragraph of Article 5, \u00a7 29 (italicized above) answers that argument. That sentence of the 1963 Constitution is referred to as the \u201cjudicial remedies provision\u201d; the debate in the constitutional convention made its purport clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b677-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>\u201cThe convention did not intend to confer exclusive jurisdiction in the civil rights field on the Commission. <em>Remedies in the courts, including both those existing at the time and those subsequently created by legislative enactment or judicial decision, are not affected by the civil rights commission provision. </em>Thus, an individual who has been subjected to illegal discriminatory treatment in a place of public accommodation may bring a damage action in the circuit court against the business engaged in such discrimination; and the legislature may create new civil and criminal remedies for acts of private discrimination and may vest jurisdiction in the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Since <em>Bolden </em>and <em>St. John </em>clearly affirm the existence of a cause of action for damages under a civil rights statute, and since the judicial remedies provision in \u00a7 29 of Article 5 clearly intended no <em>displacement </em>of judicial remedies, defendant\u2019s argument as to the \u201cexclusive\u201d jurisdiction of the Civil Rights Commission is without merit.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>We hold that plaintiff can maintain a civil damage action for redress of his statutorily created right to be free from discrimination in private employment, and that this remedy may be pursued in addition to the remedial machinery provided by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The subject matter of Count III of plaintiff\u2019s complaint involves an employee\u2019s suit against his employer for breach of a collective bargaining agreement. Although state courts have jurisdiction over such suits,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> it is Federal law which must be applied.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is well settled, as a matter of Federal labor law, that an employee may not maintain an action against his employer for an alleged breach of a collective bargaining agreement where the employee has not first exhausted the grievance and arbitration procedures established under the collective bargaining agreement upon which he bases his suit. <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes </em>(1966), 386 US 171, 184 (87 S Ct 903, 17 L Ed 2d 842); <em>Republic Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Maddox </em>(1965), 379 US 650, 657, 658 (85 S Ct 614, 13 L Ed 2d 580). This rule has been uniformly followed by the Michigan courts. <em>Spencer </em>v. <em>Wall Wire Products Company </em>(1959), 357 Mich 296, 299; <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Company </em>(1957), 349 Mich 108, 126, 127; <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Levitt </em>(1968), 10 Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>399, 402, 403. But exceptions have been engrafted onto the rule, on the theory that since \u201cthese contractual remedies have been devised and are often controlled by the union and the employer, they may well prove unsatisfactory or unworkable to the individual grievant.\u201d <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, supra. </em>In the instant case, it is beyond dispute that resort to the higher stages of grievance procedure under the contract is exclusively vested in the union.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">The governing Federal standard here is clear. In <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, supra, </em>the United States Supreme Court dealt with the issue of exhaustion of contractual remedies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b679-6\">\u201cWe think that another situation when +he employee may seek judicial enforcement of his contractual rights arises if, as is true here, the union has sole power under the contract to invoke the higher stages of the grievance procedure, <em>and </em>if, as is alleged here, the employee-plaintiff has been prevented from exhausting his contractual remedies by the union\u2019s <em>wrongful </em>refusal to process the grievance. It is true that the employer in such a situation may have done nothing to prevent exhaustion of the exclusive contractual remedies to which he agreed in the collective bargaining agreement. But the employer has committed a wrongful discharge in breach of that agreement, a breach which could be remedied through the grievance process to the employee-plaintiff\u2019s benefit were it not for the union\u2019s breach of its statutory duty of fair representation to the employee. To leave the employee remediless in such circumstances would, in our opinion, be a great injustice.\u201d Pp 185, 186.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"562\">*562</page-number>Upon determination of a motion for accelerated judgment, well-pleaded facts are accepted as true. <em>Cortez </em>v. <em>Ford Motor Company, supra. </em>Contents of affidavits may also be considered. GCR 1963, 116.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">Contrary to the considered judgment of the trial court and reviewing\u2019 opinion of the Court of Appeals, we conclude, after a careful review of plaintiff\u2019s pleadings and affidavits, that plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that his union arbitrarily and with bad faith thwarted his efforts to redress his grievance. This is not a case where the employee attempts to completely by-pass union procedures and file an action in the court against either the employer or the union. The plaintiff\u2019s affidavit, if accepted, avers sincere attempts to remedy this grievance by prompt filing of the proper form, but alleges a lack of response and/or interest by the shop committeeman, the local president, the regional representative of the union, and the international union itself. An over-technical scrutinization of the employee grievance form should not substitute for well-pleaded allegations contained in the complaint and affidavit. Carried to its logical absurdity, the form filed by plaintiff on May 27, 1964, does not state any basis for a grievance,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but when read in the context of the two previously filed grievances of May 22, 1963, it should have been clear, at least to his sympathetic union leader, that an unjust demotional transfer based primarily upon racial discrimination was being attempted by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">Defendant contends that the reasons asserted in plaintiff\u2019s complaint for the union\u2019s alleged refusal to process his grievance do not, even when read in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>a light most favorable to the plaintiff, constitute facts showing unfair representation; also, that Count III at most contains conclusory allegations asserting unfair representation by the union in processing the grievance which he did file, and does not set forth any facts showing with particularity the circumstances constituting the unfair representation or discrimination. Such an argument chooses to wholly ignore the procedural posture in which this case is now before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">Analytically, the decisions below of grant of accelerated judgment (GCR 1963, 116) were predicated upon special defenses which disposed of the case as distinguished from entry of summary judgment under GCR 1963,117, which goes to the merits. Because a defense of failure to state a claim must be asserted by motion for summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117 and may not be made by motion for accelerated judgment under GCR 1963, 116, we can express no opinion as to whether plaintiff has alleged a cause of action for unfair representation and restrict our holding in this case to the pleaded defense of exhaustion of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">The defense asserted here, which defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment focally draws to our attention, is that of failure to secure relief through <em>contractual </em>procedures.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> We conclude that plaintiff is correct in his assertion that <em>Vaca </em>v. <em>Sipes, supra, </em>is controlling, and that plaintiff sufficiently alleged that the union acted arbitrarily in withdrawing his grievance from the contractual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>grievance machinery. It was, therefore, error for the trial court to grant defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment, since that motion solely tested the sufficiency of plaintiff\u2019s pleadings in terms of the defense of exhaustion of contractual remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The decisions of the trial court and the Court of Appeals are reversed.

After August 31, 1964, I continued contacting my shop committeeman, Bill Love, concerning my reinstatement as a crane operator and the handling of my grievance which the union was handling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>with the management. Before the strike, Love told mo that he would guarantee me that after the strike I would be reinstated as a crane operator. When I returned to work following the strike my classification was still crane hooker and I went to Mr. Love and asked him if my grievance had been settled. He told me that that very day they were having a meeting with management and that my grievance would be discussed. Approximately a week went by and I didn\u2019t hear from Mr. Love so I contacted him again and he told me that he and one of the other committee men, whose name I don\u2019t recall, had withdrawn the grievance. He further told me that if I asked him about getting back on the job as a crane operator again, I would never get back on a crane and he would personally see to that. I believe that this conversation occurred on a Wednesday or Thursday.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">\u201c2. On the following Monday I went to Local No 1292\u2019s union hall and talked with an individual who I was told ivas the president of the union. When I went in I asked to talk with the president and was referred to this individual. I told him what happened and advised him that I wanted to appeal what the grievance committee had done. He checked my file and said that my grievance had been withdrawn and there was nothing that could be done about it. He told me that the grievance had been carried through every step it could have been and that the International Union had withdrawn it in the third step.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">\u201cI again told him that I wanted to appeal and he told me that an appeal was not possible and that there was nothing that the local union could do to help me. I was told that the decision could not be appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">\u201c3. I next wrote the International Union relating the facts as to what occurred and asked them why my grievance had been withdrawn and if it had actually gotten to the third step. This letter was directed to Solidarity House and I never received a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">\u201c4. The week after I had met with the president of the local union, I went to the regional office of the union 1111 Downey Street in Flint and talked with an individual who I believe was named Larry Hubert who advised me he was a regional representative. He asked me what had occurred and I again explained everything that had happened. He called the local union hall and talked with them on the phone for some time and then advised me that there wasn\u2019t anything he could do for me. I told him that I wanted to appeal what had happened and he told me that if the local union would not permit an appeal, there was nothing he could do. He said that if the local union had withdrawn my grievance, there was nothing that I could do.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-10\">\u201c5. After my conversation with him I went back to the local union on the same day and talked again with the president. He said again that I could not appeal but that he would talk with management and see what could be done. I waited a week, the meeting with management usually occurs on Thursday, and went back to the union hall where the president told me that management would not permit me to be reinstated and there was nothing the union could do for me.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-11\">\u201c6.

At the same time plaintiff filed a separate grievance charging an unjust demotional transfer.

See, <em>e.g., Duffy </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>(1958), 353 Mich 682; <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Favell </em>(1955), 344 Mich 215; <em>Holman </em>v. <em>Industrial Stamping &amp; Manufacturing Company </em>(1955), 344 Mich 235. It is evident from the pleadings and affidavit of plaintiff in this ease that he did seek intra-union relief.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b682-8\">Black, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AN1\">(concurring). I agree with Justice Brennan\u2019s conclusion that \u201cplaintiff has sufficiently alleged that his union arbitrarily and with had faith thwarted his efforts to redress his grievance\u201d <em>(ante </em>at p 562). That is enough to call for denial of what in this record is known as a motion for accelerated judgment.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">My vote is cast to reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with denial of defendant\u2019s said motion.
