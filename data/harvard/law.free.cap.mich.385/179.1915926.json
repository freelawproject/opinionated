J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3Q\">This is a prison \u201cdead time\u201d case here in the form of habeas corpus to inquire into petitioner\u2019s detention in the State Prison of Southern Michigan at Jackson. The term \u201cdead time\u201d as a convenient shorthand desription of a period, created by statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> during which the running of a parole violator\u2019s sentence is suspended. The term will be more precisely defined herein.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Petitioner Robert D. Browning was sentenced on August 22,1958, in Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit to a two to ten year prison term for the crime of larceny from the person.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">On December 14, 1960, petitioner Browning was paroled to Summerville, Georgia. Under the terms of the interstate parole compact (hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe Compact\u201d), to which Michigan and Georgia are signatories,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Georgia, through its Board of Pardons and Paroles, assumed the duties of supervision over petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">On February 10, 1961, petitioner was arrested by Georgia State Troopers on charges of driving while intoxicated and without a Georgia license. On February 26, 1961, the Georgia authorities added charges of armed robbery. Petitioner was convicted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>of all the Georgia crimes charged and sentenced to Georgia imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">Meanwhile, on April 4, 1961, the Michigan Department of Corrections (hereinafter called \u201cthe Department\u201d), having been informed of the Georgia charges, issued a parole violation warrant<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> for petitioner\u2019s arrest and forwarded it to the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles \u201cas our (the Department\u2019s) detainer.\u201d Thereafter, the Department repeatedly inquired of the Georgia authorities as to petitioner\u2019s status, and particularly as to when he would be released. No request was made that petitioner be turned over to Michigan authorities prior to completing service of his Georgia sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">On June 15, 1965, petitioner was released by Georgia into the direct physical custody of Michigan authorities. He was promptly returned to the State Prison of Southern Michigan and was found guilty of parole violation by reason of his Georgia convictions. The parole order of December 14, 1960, was rescinded and petitioner continued imprisoned service of his Michigan sentence. Under the provisions of PA 1953, No 232 (MCLA \u00a7 791.238 [Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.2308]), petitioner was found to have accumulated four years, four months and five days \u201cdead time\u201d, that is, the period from the date of his Georgia arrest (February 10, 1961) until the date of his return to the physical custody of Michigan authorities (June 15, 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">On October 21, 1965, petitioner was paroled to Chicago, Illinois, where, pursuant to the interstate parole compact,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he was under the supervision of Illinois authorities. On February 8,1966, petitioner was arrested on charges of attempted armed robbery by the Chicago police. He was subsequently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>convicted and sentenced to four to five years in the Illinois State Penitentiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">On February 17, 1966, the Department issued a parole violation warrant for petitioner\u2019s arrest which was filed as a detainer with the Illinois authorities. Although the Department subsequently inquired as to petitioner\u2019s earliest release date, no request was made that he be turned over to Michigan authorities prior to completing service of his Illinois sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">On August 11, 1969, petitioner was paroled by the Illinois authorities and taken into direct physical custody by Michigan officials. He was promptly returned to the State Prison of Southern Michigan and found guilty of parole violation by reason of his Illinois conviction. The parole order of October 21, 1965, was rescinded and petitioner continued imprisoned service of his Michigan sentence. Under the provisions of PA 1968, No 192, \u00a7 1 (MCLA \u00a7 791.238 [Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 28.2308]), petitioner was found to have accumulated 3 years, 6 months and 3 days \u201cdead time\u201d, that is, the period from the date of his Illinois arrest (February 8, 1966) until the date of his return to the physical custody of Michigan authorities (August 11, 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">As a result of accumulated \u201cdead time\u201d totaling seven years, ten months and eight days, petitioner Browning is still serving the two to ten year sentence imposed in Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit on August 22, 1958.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">On August 18, 1969, Mr. Browning challenged the \u201cdead time\u201d deductions by filing, <em>in propria persona, </em>a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Jackson Circuit Court. The Honorable Charles J. Falahee denied the petition. The Court of Appeals denied \u201cfor lack of merit\u201d petitioner\u2019s subsequent uncounseled \u201cComplaint for Habeas Corpus,\u201d treating it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>as \u201ca complaint for writ of superintending control in the nature of mandamus.\u201d We granted leave to appeal. 383 Mich 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">The above-stated facts present for unprecedented construction and interpretation by our Court the interrelationship between the recently amended dead time statute<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the Compact.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">The Compact was adopted by Michigan in 1935. Thus, it had been in existence for quite some time when the legislature revised the statute relating to \u201cdead time\u201d in 1968. As such, a presumption arises that the legislature was aware of both its adoption and content when it redefined \u201cdead time\u201d. <em>People </em>v. <em>Buckley </em>(1942), 302 Mich 12, 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">The same presumption also obtains that the legislature, when it amended the dead time statute, realized that Michigan, unlike most states, had renounced consecutive sentencing in favor of concurrent sentencing on the grounds \u201cthat so to allow [consecutive sentences] would render the second sentence uncertain and indefinite and subject to \u2018undefined and uncertain contingencies.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Carey </em>(1964), 372 Mich 378, 380. See also, <em>In re Bloom </em>(1884), 53 Mich 597; <em>In re Lamphere </em>(1886), 61 Mich 105; <em>In re Allison </em>(1948), 332 Mich 491. Moreover, while this policy is qualified by the proviso that consecutive sentencing under specific statutory authorization is permissible <em>(Carey, supra, </em>at 380), recent actions on the part of the legislature itself with respect to the dead time statute reflect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>a clear intent on the part of that body to also favor concurrent sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Prior to the 1953 revision of the dead time statute the language contained therein specifically provided that a parole violator \u201cshall serve the second sentence [only] after the first sentence is served or annulled.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> That language was deleted in the 1953 revision of the dead time statute and was likewise omitted in the 1968 revision. The deletion of such language in the last two statutory revisions, consonant with our Court\u2019s prior construction, reflects and confirms the legislative intent that a parole violator should serve his sentences concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">The present statute continues to effect this legislative intent. Although some of the language relating to termination of \u201cdead time\u201d appears to be new, the substantive intent and design remain and are in accord with our decisional interpretations. Before the latest revision the pertinent statute provided that, in the event of parole violation, \u201cthe time from the date of his [the parolee\u2019s] declared delinquency to the date of his arrest shall not be counted as any part or portion of the time to be served.\u201d Our decisions construing this language made it clear that \u201cdate of arrest\u201d would properly he read to include \u201cdate of availability to the Michigan prison authorities.\u201d <em>In re Holton </em>(1943), 304 Mich 534; <em>In re Davis </em>(1945), 312 Mich 154; <em>In re Ginivalli </em>(1953), 336 Mich 101; <em>In re Colin </em>(1953), 337 Mich 491. Hence, when the statutory language was revised in 1968 to expressly so provide, we do not think a change in the basic meaning of \u201cdead time\u201d was intended or accomplished.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">In this context we must, as a matter of first impression, now determine the meaning of \u201cdate of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>his availability for return to any penal institution under control of the commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">The question arises because the differing circumstances between the in-state and out-state parolee results in disparate treatment under the same dead time statute. A prisoner paroled within the Michigan jurisdiction who subsequently violates his parole is immediately available for return upon his arrest and issuance of a parole violation warrant. For all practical purposes, the arrest of an in-state parolee terminates his dead time. <em>In re Holton, supra. </em>On the other hand, the prisoner paroled out-state under the Compact who violates parole by committing an offense against a foreign sovereign, does not have his \u201cdead time\u201d end until he is declared available by the foreign sovereign for return to Michigan.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The foreign sovereign, under the terms of the Compact, is not required to return the out-state parolee until the sentence imposed by that sovereign has been satisfied. As in the present case, the out-state violator could not begin to complete his Michigan sentence until he finished his prison term in the foreign jurisdiction and was handed over to the Michigan authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">In practice, the suspension of the Michigan sentence until the service of the foreign sovereign\u2019s term of imprisonment effectually imposes consecutive sentences. One does not commence until the other has expired.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Construed to operate in this manner, the \u201cdead time\u201d statute not only violates the requirement that consecutive sentences must be based upon express statutory provisions <em>(Carey, supra, </em>at 380), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>also invidiously sub-classifies the out-state parolee solely upon the basis of geography. The beneficent and rehabilitative purposes of the Compact do not require this discrimination and the dead time statute so strictly construed would constitute an unreasonable classification violative of equal protection guarantees. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Employment Security Commission </em>(1967), 379 Mich 579. Further, the statute \u2014 if viewed in this manner \u2014 contravenes the manifested legislative intent against consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">We decline to accord the dead time statute an unreasonable and strained construction. Rather, we believe that the dead time statute must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with the Compact to effect the constitutionally approved and well-established legislative intent against consecutive sentences, which abides absent some clearly expressed contrary provision. To this end, we construe and so hold that the phrase \u201cdate of availability\u201d means actual <em>or </em>constructive availability for return to the Michigan penal system. The arrest of a parolee, irrespective of the location of the arrest, coupled with issuance of a parole violation warrant and good faith effort to retake the parolee constitutes constructive availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">We conclude that petitioner was constructively available for return and has fully satisfied his penal obligation to this state. The Court of Appeals and trial court are reversed. The case is remanded to the Jackson Circuit Court for prompt entry of an order granting the writ and discharging petitioner. Petitioner\u2019s discharge may be temporarily postponed pending notification to the Illinois parole authorities, who shall be given a reasonable period in which to take such action as they deem advisable regarding petitioner.</p>\n<judges id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>Adams, T.

The statutory use of the word \u201cavailability\u201d casts a new light upon \u201cdead time\u201d and its determination. Henceforth, dead time with respect to parole violators will be computed as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b308-11\">1. The date on which an alleged violator is arrested in Michigan by any probation officer, parole officer, or peace officer on charges of technical violation, new criminal charges, or both technical violation and criminal charges will be considered the date of availability, and except as provided in Item 4, service on the sentence from which paroled will resume running as of that date. Dead time will be the time from the date of violation to the date of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">2. If an alleged violator is held on new criminal charges, regardless of whether or not there are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>also technical charges, is brought to trial on the new criminal charges and acquitted, or the charges are dismissed, or nolle prossed, the only dead time will he the time from the date of violation to the date of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">3. If there is a conviction on the new charges and the parole violator is placed on probation, dead time will he the time from the date of the violation to the date of the arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">4. If disposition of the new criminal charges results in a sentence to a jail of this state or a federal penal institution, or a jail or a penal institution in another state, the date of availability will he the date on which the violator is lawfully released from confinement on the new sentence. The time from the date of sentence to the date of such release will he declared dead time.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">5. If disposition of the criminal charges results in a sentence to confinement in an institution under the jurisdiction of the Michigan Corrections Commission, the only dead time will be the time from the date of violation to the date of arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">6. If an alleged violator is held in local confinement pending trial on new criminal charges, the Parole Board may extend the parole period, if it appears that the original fixed parole period may expire before final disposition is made on the new criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">7. If the alleged violator is arrested outside the State of Michigan, the date of availability will he the date on which authorities in the holding jurisdiction declare the alleged violator to be available for return to Michigan. The time from the date of violation to the date of declared availability will he considered dead time.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In the interest of equity, this policy will be retroactively applied to persons now serving sentence if dead time for violation of parole from the sentence being served was computed under any other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>formula. This will also apply to persons currently under parole who have forfeited time for violation of prior paroles on the current sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Since this policy is to be applied retroactively, it is important that priority be given to cases which would become eligible for parole consideration or discharge with dead time restoration.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">Restoration of dead time will be made by administrative order in accordance with this memoradum. Cases in which restoration action is taken should be stamped or identified in some manner as having been amended. From this date on, violation and custody dates will be set by the Parole Board as in the past.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">Attached is a listing of cases to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">Sincerely,</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"Ak9\">/s/ Gus Harrison</p>\n<p id=\"AB3\">Gus Harrison, Director</p>\n<p id=\"b310-9\">GH:jm</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\"> MCLA \u00a7 791.238 (Stat Ann 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 28.2308).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b301-10\"> <em>Infra, </em>p 184.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-11\"> MCLA \u00a7 750.357 (Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.589).

Before us is another appeal by a veteran convict for relief from the legal effect of successive felonies committed by him. Starting in Michigan from conviction for larceny from the person, and proceeding thence to successive convictions for armed robbery in Georgia and then in Illinois following his initial parole by Michigan, he objects to further incarceration in our state for violation of that parole. He wants credit, for time served in Georgia and Illinois, applied to service he yet owes Michigan for crimes committed in Michigan. This he asks upon allegation that the legislature of our state has intended and now intends that the service of a sentence or sentences imposed by another or several other states constitutes a part of the service of one or more sentences imposed under the laws of our state.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>I have stated the contention without verbiage. Let it stand, so that legislators may read and comprehend Mr. Browning\u2019s declaration of what is said to have been in their minds when they voted enactment of the statutes mentioned below.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Twenty-four years ago the controlling principle of today\u2019s issue came before the then Attorney General of Michigan, upon request of the Director of Corrections:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">\u201cThe director of corrections has requested the opinion of the attorney general upon the question of when a sentence for a felony committed by an escaped felon while at large commences to run, and whether it runs concurrently with the remainder of the sentence interrupted by the prison breach.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Writing for the Attorney General, assistant attorney general Peter E. Bradt quoted Justice Cardozo\u2019s opinion, for the Court, of <em>People </em>v. <em>Ingber </em>(1928), 248 NY 302 (162 NE 87). Then he concluded  (p 267):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-7\">\u201cThe attorney general holds that a prison breach interrupts the service of sentence, and that such interruption continues during the service of a second sentence for a crime committed while at large following the prison breach, despite the fact that the second sentence is served in the same prison from which escape was made. Service under the original sentence is not resumed until after completion of the sentence imposed for the crime committed by the convict unlawfully at large.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">I perceive no difference between the effect of a prison escape ending in another felony, and an effort by rehabilitative parole which results in the same or worse criminal acts. Nor do I perceive from the aforesaid statutes that the legislature has intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>or willed otherwise. As Cardozo concluded in the cited <em>Ingber </em>case; \u201cNothing short of obvious compulsion will lead us to a reading of the statute whereby the pains and penalties of crimes are shorn of all terrors more poignant than a form of words.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AyXZ\">As with other criminal appeals submitted this year, I find myself almost automatically in the minority. Such being the case, perhaps the best way to respond to majority agreement with this particular felon (without using up more useless pages of our reports) is to say simply that I agree with the Attorney General when he declares:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-5\">\u201cIn Michigan, the parolee is credited with <em>time served on parole without violations. </em>This is the intent of both the amended and prior version of the statute involved. For example, as amended MSA \u00a7 28.2308 [MCLA 1971 Cum Supp \u00a7 791.238] provides that a Michigan parolee who commits a crime while on parole:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">\u201c \u2018 . . . shall be liable, when arrested, to serve out the expired portion of his maximum imprisonment, and the time from the date of declared violation to the date of his availability for return to any penal institution under the control of the commission shall not be counted as any part or portion of the time to be served . . . \u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">\u201cSimilarily, MSA \u00a7 28.2308 [MCLA \u00a7791.238] prior to the 1968 amendment provided a Michigan parolee who violated the provisions of his parole was:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u201c \u2018 . . . liable, when arrested, to serve out the unexpired portion of his maximum imprisonment, and the time from the date of his declared delinquency to the date of his arrest shall not be counted as any part or portion of the time to be served <em>...'\"</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">Then, having pointed to a list of States furnished by the Model Penal Code (tentative draft No. 5, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>1956, p 126) in support of his statement that \u201cMichigan is not alone in granting credit only for time served on parole which is free of violations\u201d, the Attorney General concludes, and I agree:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">\u201cHence, granting petitioner credit only for time served on parole which is free of violations reflects the spirit and letter of Michigan statutes and a common practice of sister states.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">I would affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b313-7\">T.
