After purchasing pop in bottles, the girls were attracted to a mechanical hobby horse in the store. The girls set the pop bottles down near the base of the horse, and then both mounted the horse. An employee of the defendant testified that it was the policy of the management of the store not to allow two children on the horse at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">In the language of the complaint, what occurred next to plaintiff\u2019s daughter was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b767-8\">\u201c * * * while getting off of the horse after riding it, did trip and fall on empty pop bottles allowed to accumulate on the premises near the base of the electric rocking horse.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b767-9\">The Michigan Court of Appeals reversed, stating that plaintiffs failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the daughter\u2019s injuries were in fact caused by defendant\u2019s negligence. GCR 1963, 517.1, states that findings of fact should not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Relying upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number><em>Ramberg </em>v. <em>Morgan </em>(1928), 209 Iowa 474 (218 NW 492) and <em>Bruggeman </em>v. <em>City of York </em>(1916), 254 Pa 430 (98 A 970), cited in <em>Frye </em>v. <em>Detroit </em>(1932), 256 Mich 466, 469, 470, the Court stated that it is not enough for plaintiffs to show their injury was due to one of two possible causes.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-4\">Our decision must rest on determining whether or not the trial judge was clearly erroneous<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in finding from the testimony about the plaintiff\u2019s daughter Sharon that \u201cin getting off [the horse] she was cut on a glass object on the floor\u201d. Other testimony establishes the remaining necessary elements for judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The only testimony as to how the child was injured was offered by Sharon herself. She was only six years old at the time of the injury. She testified four years later. As might be suspected, her testimony was not as specific and clear-cut as a Marine sergeant barking out orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">On direct examination, these were her responses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Okay, all right, then what happened after you were sitting on the horse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>When we got off, and I fell over the bottle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-9\"># # #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-10\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>All right. Did you trip over that, or fall over that [bottle] as you were sliding off the horse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-11\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">On cross-examination, Sharon answered as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now, Sharon, how did you fall when you got off the horse?

Or don\u2019t you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I fell off.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>You fell off the horse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I don\u2019t remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Af1\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you put your foot in the stirrup to get down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Did you get off the horse first? [before her playmate]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I don\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">After the attorneys had interrogated Sharon, the judge engaged her in the following colloquy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-12\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Sharon, I want to ask you one question. Then I think we will be done, unless someone else has anything further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-13\">\u201cYou said at one time that you got off the horse. The other time you fell off. Now, did you fall off or did you step off? How did you get off the horse?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-14\"><em>\u201cThe Witness: </em>There is this thing that you get off \u2014 something like \u2014 . See, there is this horse. And then there is this thing at the bottom. And you get off the horse, and then you go down on the floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-15\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Well, how did you get off the horse? Did you fall off or did you step off after your girlfriend had finished, after the ride was over?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-16\">\u201cDo you understand what my question is? My question is: How did you get off the horse? Did you get down by yourself? Or did you slide off? Or fall off? Do you remember?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-17\"><em>\u201cThe Witness: </em>No, I think\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-18\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>I can\u2019t hear you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-19\"><em>\u201cThe Witness: </em>I think I fell off, but I can\u2019t remember.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>This is all of the pertinent testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-4\">The testimony can by no means be called precise or categorical. However, her first response to both defendant\u2019s attorney and the trial judge was that she \u201cfell.\u201d In addition to defendant\u2019s attorney she indicated that she hadn\u2019t put her foot in the stirrup on dismounting, which would be consonant with falling.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">The testimony that the Court of Appeals relied on to establish a situation different from injury while dismounting is Sharon\u2019s response to the first question on cross-examination relating to this situation, when she said: \u201cWhen we got off, and I fell over the bottle.\u201d It is arguable that this should be construed to mean that after the momentum of dismounting, Sharon \u201cfell over the bottle.\u201d However, further on in direct examination, Sharon answered \u201cYes\u201d to the question \u201cDid you trip over that, or fall over that [bottle] <em>as you were sliding off the horse?\u201d </em>The \u201cYes\u201d answer is logical only if she interpreted \u201csliding off the horse\u201d in connection with both the tripping or the falling. This would tend to indicate that the actions of getting off and falling in the first question were sequential rather than separate, in other words, getting off the horse and getting cut by glass were all part and parcel of the same momentum.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Even if our analysis of the last exchange of question and answer were demonstrably false, it is not logical to say that the response \u201cWhen we got off, and I fell over the bottle\u201d so clearly means that the falling over the bottle was separate and apart from the getting off that a court without benefit of viewing the witness can be presumed to be a better judge of the answer than the trial judge. Furthermore, whether on the spot as the trial judge was, or on review of the record, this particular re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>sponse must be read in the light of the witness\u2019s other replies relating to her falling off while it appears to this Court, without so finding, more likely that the accident occurred in connection with dismounting rather than separate from it, the best that can be said for the conclusion that the witness gave two separate distinct answers, as the Court of Appeals finds, rather than one hazy one, as the trial court finds, is that if it cannot be said one finding is clearly erroneous, it is difficult to say the other is either.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-4\">On the basis of our consideration of the above testimony we cannot conclude that the trial judge\u2019s finding about Sharon that \u201cin getting off [the horse] she was cut on a glass object on the floor,\u201d was clearly erroneous. Because of this we do not find it necessary to consider the Court of Appeals arguments based on the assumption of \u201cthe evidence being equiponderant at best\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">The Court of Appeals is reversed with costs to plaintiff and the judgment is reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b771-6\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Black, Adams, T. E. Brennan, T. G. Kavanagh, and Swainson, JJ., concurred with Williams, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b768-13\"> The change in language from old Court Rule No 64 (1945) to our present rule on this matter does not affect our status as a reviewing court. As Justice Black writing for this Court, stated in a footnote to <em>Kevreson </em>v. <em>Michigan Consolidated Gas Company </em>(1965), 374 Mich 465, 467:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b768-14\">\u201cFormer Court Rule No 64 (1945) provided that \u2018Appellant may assign as error that the judgment is against the preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 This has been changed to \u2018Appellant may assign as error that the finding on the issue tried without a jury is clearly erroneous.\u2019 GCR 1963, 810.
