On the way to the police station, Ranes confessed to four other killings. He asked to see a priest. Shortly after arriving at the station, he met and talked alone with a priest for about an hour. Immediately thereafter, he was informed that he had a right to an attorney by Sergeant Lutz. Ranes waived this right and admitted he committed the murder. He was arraigned between 3 and 4 a.m. on June 5,1964. He was advised by the judge of his right to an attorney and again said he did not want one. Following arraignment, his complete formal confession was recorded by a court reporter.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-11\">At 4:30 a.m., Dr. Clarence M. Schrier, Medical Superintendent of the Kalamazoo State Hospital, was called and requested to make a psychiatric examination of Ranes. Initially, Dr. Schrier asked to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>have Banes brought to him later in the morning. Shortly thereafter, he called back and said he would come to the police station to examine Banes at 8 a.m. Dr. Schrier brought the Clinical Director of the Kalamazoo State Hospital, Dr. William Decker, with him for the diagnosis. About six months earlier, Banes had been admitted to the hospital and Dr. Schrier had diagnosed him as a \u201csociopathic personality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Just prior to the psychiatric examination at the police station, Banes stated to an assistant prosecuting attorney, \u201cYou have mentioned something about an attorney, I think maybe I had better have one.\u201d The assistant prosecuting attorney denied his request, stating that no magistrate would be available until 9:30 a.m. to appoint an attorney. Drs. Schrier and Decker proceeded to conduct a two-hour psychiatric examination of Banes. A petition for the appointment of an attorney for Banes was filed just before noon on June 5, order of appointment was signed at 1:11 p.m. on that date, and appointed counsel ultimately reached and notified at 1:30 p.m. on June 6, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">At the trial, Banes\u2019 defense was not guilty by reason of insanity. Drs. Schrier and Decker testified for the prosecution that Banes was sane. Defendant\u2019s attorney argued unsuccessfully that their testimony should not be allowed since it had been obtained in violation of defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and his Sixth Amendment right to counsel as set forth in <em>Escobedo </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1964), 378 US 478 (84 S Ct 1758, 12 L Ed 2d 977).</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Banes was convicted of first-degree murder. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an opinion by Judge Fitzgerald, with whom Judge B. B. Burns concurred. Justice T. G. Kavanagh dissented. (13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>Mich App 182.) We granted leave to appeal. (381 Mich 793.) The case was argued at the 1970 October term. Due to the presence of two new Justices on the Court, the case was ordered resubmitted. It was again argued at the 1971 April term on May 4, 1971.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Did the admission of testimony by psychiatrists, based on their examination of defendant after he had requested but before he had received legal counsel, violate his constitutional rights and constitute prejudicial error?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">If <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona </em>(1966), 384 US 436, (86 S Ct 1602, 16 L Ed 2d 694, 10 ALR3d 974) applied, defendant\u2019s request for a lawyer would terminate the state\u2019s right to interrogate him until he had a lawyer appointed to advise him. \u201cIf the individual states that he wants an attorney, the interrogation must cease until an attorney is present.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>at p 474. <em>Miranda </em>is not retroactive. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(1966), 384 US 719 (86 S Ct 1772, 16 L Ed 2d 882), applied <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Escobedo </em>only to cases where the trials have commenced after the decisions were announced, June 13, 1966, and June 22, 1964, respectively. Ranes\u2019 trial began September 29, 1964. The question is whether <em>Escobedo </em>compels the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-8\"><em>Escobedo </em>dealt with a confession. In that case, the opinion of the Court written by Justice Goldberg stated (pp 490, 491):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">\u201cWe hold, therefore, that where, as here, the investigation is no longer a general inquiry into an unsolved crime but has begun to focus on a particular suspect, the suspect has been taken into police custody, the police carry out a process of interrogations that lends itself to eliciting incriminating statements, the suspect has requested and been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>denied an opportunity to consult with his lawyer, and the police have not effectively warned him of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent, the accused has been denied \u2018the Assistance of Counsel\u2019 in violation of the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution as \u2018made obligatory upon the States by the Fourteenth Amendment,\u2019 <em>Gideon </em>v. <em>Wainwright </em>[1963], 372 US at 342, and that no statement elicited by the police during the interrogation may be used against him at a criminal trial.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">In the present case, Banes had been taken into police custody, the police carried out a process of interrogations that lent itself to eliciting incriminating statements, and the defendant requested and was denied an opportunity to consult with a lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-7\">The people contend that he was warned of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent. The testimony of Sergeant Carl W. Lutz of the Michigan State Police is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>* * * And upon entry into the holding room, Defendant Banes was sitting there and I walked over to him, extended my hand and introduced myself as Sergeant Lutz from the Michigan State Police at Fifth District Headquarters. I then introduced him to the remaining men who were with me at this time. I said to him that I wanted to talk to him, I had been informed that he had admitted to Sergeant Duncan that he had committed the murder in the case that we were investigating, and I told him that before he did so that it was incumbent upon me to advise him to just exactly what his rights would be. I first of all told him that he needn\u2019t say a word to me unless he so desired, and I further advised him that if he did, that anything he would say to me or to the men who were with me at this particular time might and could be used against him in the event of court action. I further told him that he could be advised or be in the pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>ence of an attorney if lie so desired, and at the same time told him I thought he would need an attorney.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">The warning given by Sergeant Lutz was that the defendant did not have to say anything to him or the men with him. It was not the warning of his absolute constitutional right to remain silent which is required by <em>Escobedo. </em>It is the claim of the people that the situation in this case is analogous to that in the case of <em>Frazier </em>v. <em>Cupp </em>(1969), 394 US 731 (89 S Ct 1420, 22 L Ed 2d 684) and that defendant therefore was not denied the assistance of counsel. In <em>Frazier, </em>the defendant had begun to tell his story when he stated, \u201cI think I had better get a lawyer before I talk any more. I am going to get into trouble more than I am in now.\u201d The officer replied simply, \u201cYou can\u2019t be in any more trouble than you are in now,\u201d and the questioning session proceeded. It is to be noted that in <em>Frazier </em>the questioning had begun when the request for a lawyer was made. This is stressed by the United States Supreme Court in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-7\">\u201c * * * it is possible that the questioning officer took petitioner\u2019s remark not as a request that the interrogation cease but merely as a passing comment. Petitioner did not pursue the matter, but continued answering questions. In this context, we cannot find the denial of the right to counsel which was found so crucial in <em>Escobedo.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">In the present case, Larry Banes said: \u201cI think maybe I had better have one.\u201d His request for counsel was made before the examination began. The request was specifically denied and we can only conclude that, as a result of such denial, Larry Banes, not having been fully informed as to his constitutional rights, submitted to the psychiatric examination. It is stated in <em>Escobedo </em>(p 492):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>\u201cWe hold only that when the process shifts from investigatory to accusatory \u2014 when its focus is on the accused and its purpose is to elicit a confession \u2014 our adversary system begins to operate, and, under the circumstances here, the accused must be permitted to consult with his lawyer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">Part of the totality of the circumstances of this case which cannot be ignored is the fact that Larry Panes was admitted to the Kalamazoo State Hospital on December 24, 1963. While there, he was under diagnosis by Drs. Schrier and Decker. Dr. Decker wrote, \u201cWhile in the service the taunts of barracks companions and the theft of a five-cent bag of potato chips were sufficient reasons to justify an attempt with butcher knives to remove the causal irritant, if necessary, by murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Larry Banes was discharged from the Kalamazoo State Hospital on January 6, 1964. Five months later, at 4:30 a.m., Dr. Schrier received a call from the prosecutor and agreed to see Banes. He asked that he be brought to his office. Dr. Schrier testified: \u201cI got back in bed and suddenly it hit me as to what had happened, and I called back and stated that I would be down to the jail to visit him at 8 o\u2019clock.\u201d Dr. Schrier brought Dr. Decker with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In holding that the admission of the testimony by the psychiatrists was prejudicial error and violated defendant\u2019s constitutional right to counsel under the circumstances of this case, it must be stressed that such decision is based upon the fact that defendant was refused counsel at a critical stage of the proceedings. We do not, in this case, consider when it may be appropriate for a person accused of crime to undergo examination at an insanity hearing pursuant to CL 1948, \u00a7 767.27, as amended (Stat <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 <em>28.967),</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>or possibly in discovery proceedings by order of the trial judge. Under the circumstances of this case, when the defendant requested counsel, we are convinced that that request should have been honored in order that defendant might have the benefit of his own legal counsel\u2019s advice with regard to any psychiatric examinations he might thereafter undergo. The situation here is much the same as when a defendant is required to submit to a show-up but yet must be afforded counsel to guarantee the fairness of the ensuing proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed. The conviction is set aside and the case is remanded to the trial court for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b360-7\">T. M. Kavanagh, C.

If we are to pronounce a rule of law here, and not merely voice a visceral reaction to the instant case, we ought to state the question as abstractly as possible:</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Is the testimony of a psychiatrist offered in rebuttal of a defense of insanity inadmissible where the psychiatrist examined the defendant without the defendant having had the opportunity to consult with an attorney prior to the examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">I say the answer should be no.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>The psychiatric examination is not conducted for the purpose of obtaining the defendant\u2019s confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">A confession made to a psychiatrist would, be inadmissible to prove guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">The confession-sweating tactics which <em>Miranda </em>detailed have not been associated with medical examinations.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The doctor\u2019s testimony as to his professional opinion on the question of sanity is based upon his observation and examination of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The fact that a psychiatric or any medical examination of a defendant may involve dialogue between the doctor and the prisoner is no more significant under the Fifth Amendment than the fact that serving the prisoner his meals may involve some dialogue with the jailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">The psychiatrist is not concerned with the truth of what the defendant says; he is concerned with the medical significance of what the defendant says.

Would counsel tell the defendant to refuse to be examined? Could not the doctor examine the defendant anyway? Would a lawyer advise how the questions were to be answered so as best to convey the impression of insanity?
