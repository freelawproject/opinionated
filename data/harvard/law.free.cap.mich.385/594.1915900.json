There alone in her own home, she must have fought valiantly before submission or unconsciousness, for scratches of the defendant\u2019s face were so noticeably marked, by successive witnesses hours later, as to form an important part of the people\u2019s proof. The result of her defensive effort was a beating so vicious that she was unable to recall what happened or to identify her assailant. In the absence of reversible error \u2014 of which there simply is none \u2014 that assailant should not be granted a new trial; a new trial which, in these days of more and more shackling of law enforcement, usually means an order for outright release upon society of one whose record justifies the latest sentence imposed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b713-5\">Adams, T.
