The two were informed against on account of the violent collision of an automobile driven by Mukalla with a partially loaded petroleum tank truck operated by the defendant Zimmerman. One Anstett, a passenger in the Mukalla car, was fatally injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">As the causal events began, the truck was proceeding south on Greenfield in Detroit. The automobile was proceeding north on the same street. Zimmerman turned left toward a private driveway <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>and had nearly completed his turn when Mukalla\u2019s car crashed into the right rear side of the truck. The force of the collision was such that the truck was driven sideways with sufficient force to separate the tank from the truck chassis and overturn it.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">The issue of speed of the oncoming automobile was tried out as between the codefendants with as much if not more vigor than the prosecutor displayed in pursuing his duties. For specific details, see Division l\u2019s recount of the trial record <em>(People </em>v. <em>Zimmerman </em>[1968], 12 Mich App 241, 245-251).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Zimmerman\u2019s conviction was affirmed on appeal. This Court granted leave to review for the purpose of considering two questions: \"Whether the proffered expert testimony \u2014 of one not an eyewitness\u2014 was admissible on the question of speed of the oncoming automobile, and whether the trial judge\u2019s refusal to permit such non-eyewitness to give his opinion, of the minimal rate of approach-speed of the oncoming automobile, amounted to an abuse of discretion. We agree that no reversible error was committed and therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">In <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1964), 373 Mich 610 this Court criticized the admission of opinion testimony of a like expert witness, the main issue being that of causal negligence. There Justice Souris wrote, for our majority (p 625):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">\u201cFinally the witness was asked whether he had an opinion \u2018as to a range of speed of the Lucas car in connection with this accident at the time of the impact?\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-8\">\u201cThe witness had such an opinion, and gave it, again there being no objection. He was not, as the reader will gather, an eyewitness of the collision. The facts upon which his opinions were founded included a measurement examination of the scene of collision, examination of damage done to 1 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>cars after the collision, photos and other information given admissibly by other witnesses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Later we said (p 626) that \u201cthe foregoing is written in effort to eliminate future reception in our trial courts of like opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">It is well, alleged conflict of <em>Washburn </em>with <em>Dudek </em>v. <em>Popp </em>(1964), 373 Mich 300 considered, that our reasons for elimination of such dispensable testimony should now pass in review. In 1874 Mr. Justice Campbell wrote for the Court <em>(People </em>v. <em>Morrigan, </em>29 Mich 4, 7):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-6\">\u201cThe experience of courts with the testimony of experts has not been such as to impress them with the conviction that the scope of such proofs should be extended. Such testimony is not desirable in any case where the jury can get along without it; and is only admitted from necessity, and then only when it is likely to be of some value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Then came to our reports, in steady succession, the citations and quotations which the Court gathered in <em>In re Estate of Astolas </em>(1935), 273 Mich 189, 193, 194 <em>(Morrigan, supra, </em>included). Perhaps the soundest of all reasons, for limiting unto necessity what we loosely refer to as expert testimony, appears in <em>McNally </em>v. <em>Colwell </em>(1892), 91 Mich 527 (followed expressly in <em>Vial </em>v. <em>Vial </em>[1963], 369 Mich 534, 537). Quoting <em>McNally </em>at 536, 537:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">\u201cIt is best to limit expert testimony to its proper uses, since it is not now held in the highest esteem ; nor has it been found to be free from the infirmities and temptations that belong to human nature. And since a man\u2019s opinion cannot be met and tested, as could his testimony to the existence of a fact, expert evidence, while useful in many cases, is dangerous in all, and should be restricted, for the purpose of accuracy in determining the truth, which is the aim of all judicial investigation, to those cases where its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>use is well nigh indispensable because of questions of science or skill being involved, in which a special and peculiar knowledge is desired in order to arrive at the truth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">These observations were not new, when written. The reader desiring to pursue them may read with profit entire \u00a7\u00a7 390(392) and 391(393), headed \u201cInfirmity of expert testimony,\u201d appearing in 2 Jones, Commentaries on Evidence (Blue Book edition, 1913) pp 970-973. The sections conclude:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">\u201cWe cannot close this section without reproducing from two New York cases <em>dicta </em>which are convincing expressions of judicial distrust. \u2018We may assume, also, that their [the experts\u2019] minds were affected by that pride of opinion, and that kind of mental fascination with which men are affected when engaged in the pursuit of what they call scientific inquiries.\u2019 \u2018He [the expert] comes on the stand to swear in favor of the party calling him, and it may be said he always justifies by his works the faith that has been placed in him.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">In this case there was eyewitness testimony as well as ample proof of physical facts<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> from which the jury could reach a permissible judgment of the conduct of each driver, that is, whether such conduct did or did not amount to negligence and, if so, whether it was causal or remote. For instance the eyewitness Bloom testified respecting the lateral and longitudinal positions of the respective vehicles as of the approximate time of impact, and to having observed the Mukalla car as it approached the point of collision. He was sworn as a witness for defendant-appellant and testified, upon examination by the latter\u2019s counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number><em>\u201cQ. {By Mr. </em>Perlman) What is your opinion as to the speed of that vehicle (that of defendant Mukalla) when you saw it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The car was traveling fast, I thought fifty miles an hour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">Regarding the admissibility of Mr. Bloom\u2019s estimate of speed, see <em>Harnau </em>v. <em>Haight </em>(1915), 189 Mich 600; <em>People </em>v. <em>Schwartz </em>(1921), 215 Mich 197; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Detroit Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co. </em>(1922), 218 Mich 673; <em>Zylstra </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1928), 244 Mich 319; <em>Stehouwer </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1929), 249 Mich 76; <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Weed </em>(1938), 285 Mich 460; <em>Hammock </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1946), 313 Mich 248, and <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wahl </em>(1953), 335 Mich 601.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">In any view of the case there was no necessity for resort to a non-eyewitness opinion of speed, or for even partial encroachment by <em>expert </em>opinion upon the jury\u2019s function of finding facts and drawing inferences.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">In view of the above we do not discuss the second stated question at length. It is true that discretion is vested with the trial judge, either to receive or reject the opinions of experts, once the nature of the case and the proffered testimony properly invoke such discretion. To the point see cases cited in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawthorne </em>(1940), 293 Mich 15, 23 and the observation which, in 1879 was written for the Court by Justice Cooley in <em>McEwen </em>v. <em>Bigelow, </em>40 Mich 215, 217:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">\u201cThe court is not obliged to receive the evidence <em>of </em>every person called who may appear to have some little knowledge of the business, but who has no personal knowledge of the matters in controversy. He must decide within the limits of a fair discretion whether the experience of the supposed expert had been such as to make his opinions of any value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>It is the <em>need </em>for such testimony that counts \u2014 a factor that is absent here \u2014 and it is admissible only when the ordinary knowledge and experience of mankind will not enable the trier or triers of fact to determine what inferences should be drawn properly from complex facts previously shown in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">The corresponding likeness of a civil action for ordinary negligence, and a criminal prosecution under the statute pursuant to which Mukalla and Zimmerman were convicted (CL 1948, \u00a7 750.324 [Stat Ann 1954 Rev \u00a7 28.556]), is noted expressly lest our decision be misunderstood and extended beyond the Court\u2019s effort in <em>Washburn, supra </em>\u201cto eliminate future reception in our trial courts of like opinions.\u201d In neither instance is proof of criminal intent required. <em>People </em>v. <em>McKee </em>(1968), 15 Mich App 382, 385. As the Court observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>McMurchy </em>(1930), 249 Mich 147, 168 with respect to the cited statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-5\">\u201cOne may be civilly and criminally responsible for the negligence which causes death, though there may be some factors that would discharge one from liability for civil negligence but would not act as a release from criminal negligence. The method of determining negligence in both instances is the same.\u201d;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">and further (p 170):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b545-7\">\u201cJust as we can ascertain civil liability by certain rules, so also can we determine criminal liability by similar rules.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Prom this the reader will perceive that we here adopt no broad rule banning expert testimony, or opinion evidence which is based in part or in whole upon facts that are known personally to the witness and verified by him. We simply affirm anew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number><em>Washburn\u2019s </em>bar and apply it to prosecutions brought under the cited statute where, as here, there is no need for an expert opinion or opinions to support or oppose factual proof, already in evidence, which enables the jury and the court to render verdict and pass judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">The foregoing does not of course trench upon the admissibility of that class of opinions which, in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Richardson </em>(1888), 69 Mich 430, was written descriptively for the Court by Justice Campbell. His text, to which reference is now made, begins and proceeds (pp 436, 437):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">\u201cThe phrase \u2018expert testimony\u2019 is not entirely fortunate as designed to cover all cases where a witness may give his opinions. That is done, in a multitude of cases, by witnesses who have no more personal fitness than any one else, but who have been so placed as to have seen or heard things which can only be described to any one else by giving the impression produced on the mind or senses of the witness. These cases are so common that few persons ever think that what are rightly called facts are at the same time no more nor less than conclusions. Thus, impressions of cold or heat, light and darkness, size, shape, distance, speed, and many personal qualities, physical and mental, are constantly acted on as facts, although not uniformly judged by all observers, for the simple reason that the facts cannot be otherwise communicated. Any person can give such impressions without special experience or special intelligence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">\u201cBeyond these every-day matters, known to all men, are things which most, if not all, persons can become qualified to judge by more or less opportunities of observation, local or habitual, but which require no peculiar intelligence. Then there are branches of business or occupations where some intelligence is requisite for judgment, but opportunities and habits of observation must be combined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>with some practical experience. This seems to be the beginning or lower grade of what may be properly termed \u2018experts\u2019; a word meaning only the acquisition of certain habits of judgment, based on experience or special observation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">I vote to affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">SUPPLEMENT (December 21, 1970):</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">This case, having been previously assigned to the writer according to our internal practice, was received on briefs October 6 last. Pursuant to that assignment the foregoing opinion was submitted for consideration of the other Justices November 2. December 2 Justice Adams submitted to us his opinion for reversal, together with his opinion of the like-issue case of <em>O\u2019Dowd </em>v. <em>Linehan, </em>No 52,402. Some comment upon our manifest differences is now in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\"><em>First: </em>Though the honor is enviable, I did not initiate or propose the \u201cneed test\u201d which our Brother attributes to me. That was done long before our time, and was continued to release of 1964 <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Lucas, </em>373 Mich 610, by a long line of distinguished lawyers and judges going back to Greenleaf\u2019s evidentiary era. And when Justice Campbell wrote in 1874 \u2014 for the Court \u2014 that expert testimony \u201cis not desirable in any case where the jury can get along without it\u201d and is \u201conly admitted from necessity,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he originated for Michigan that same need test which, I submit, is something judicially better than an order <em>moderne </em>for free and easy hiring of so-called expert witnesses who, being in the business openly for big fees, offer prepossessed expert opinions for sale to those whose usual concern is that of overcoming the fact testimony of <em>lay </em>witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>Whatever the delicate description of such practice may he in legal drawing rooms, once it is put forth from the witness stand without grim cross-examination for the mercenary character thereof <em>{O\u2019Dowd </em>is a good example), the result is no less than effectively prejudicial hired testimony, manufactured <em>for profit </em>and sold to the few litigants whose pocketbooks are fat enough to supply the wherewithal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In the foregoing opinion I have quoted Jones at length. Let us hear more, now that the need test has been challenged (a part of the emphasis was supplied by the author; the rest is supplied by the present writer) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">\u201c\u00a7 372 [374]. <em>The expert not to decide questions of fact. </em>Expert testimony being an exception to the general rule of law excluding opinions from evidence, and trenching, as it does, upon the province of the jury, is not to be extended beyond <em>the necessities of the case. * </em>* <em>* </em>Whatever liberality may be allowed in calling for the opinions of experts or other witnesses, they must <em>not usurp the province of the court and jury </em>by drawing those conclusions of law or fact upon which the decision of the case depends. Although this view has been earnestly criticized, it is sustained by the undoubted weight of authority, and <em>any lawyer who has had much participation in the actual trial of cases will understand that in many cases trials would become a mere farce if zealous experts were allowed to directly express their opinions upon the very issue to be tried. </em>It would be impossible to reconcile the conflicting decisions in which the courts have considered the subject of the admissibility of opinions where objection was made that to receive them would allow the witness to trench upon the province of the jury. <em>It is the general disposition of the courts to restrict the admission of expert testimony within the strict bounds of the necessity on which </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number><em>it is founded. </em>Indeed, this kind of testimony has always been regarded by conservative jurists with disfavor. Earl, J., has said: \u2018The rules admitting the opinions of experts should not be unnecessarily extended. Experience has shown that it is much safer to confine the testimony of witnesses to facts in all cases where that is practicable, and leave the jury to exercise their judgment and experience upon the facts proved. <em>Where witnesses testify to facts, they may be specifically contradicted, and if they testify falsely, they are liable to punishment for perjury. But they may give false opinions without the fear of punishment. It is generally safer to take the judgments of unskilled jurors than the opinions of hired and generally biased experts.\u2019 \u201d 2 </em>Jones, Blue Book of Evidence (1913 Bancroft-Whitney edition), pp 908, 910.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">A pure coincidence of procedural timing has brought this <em>Zimmerman </em>prosecution for negligent homicide, and the wrongful death action of <em>O\u2019Dowd </em>v. <em>Linehan, </em>Docket No. 52,402, to this Court for submission but a month apart. In each case expert witness William E. Billings was engaged by the defendant to prepare and testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In <em>Zimmerman </em>Mr. Billings was <em>not </em>permitted to testify to the rate of speed of the oncoming Mukalla car, not having been there to see it and the fortuitous events having been observed, in whole or in part, by several testifying eyewitnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">In <em>O\u2019Dowd </em>Mr. Billings <em>was </em>permitted to testify to certain opinions, all based upon <em>ex parte </em>\u201cinvestigations\u201d made by him long after the fatal event. Justice Adams has fairly described Mr. Billings\u2019 performance in his opinion of <em>O\u2019Dowd. </em>I offer no comment upon that performance beyond observing that even Justice Adams concedes that Mr. Billings went toa far in his zeal to aid the <em>Linehan </em>defense. That admission alone is sufficient to justify my objection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>to this Michigan-new notion that \u201can expert in traffic might assist the jury\u201d when, factual proof being-available and already received, the jury needs no such assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">It is true that the courts of some of the states permit these accident reconstruction experts to testify freely. It is also true that the contending parties occasionally vie for their partisan support; the winner usually being the one with the most cash. Mr. Billings for instance hails from Cleveland. Granting his ability and industry, he has not been over-modest in making his specialty widely known. These cases <em>(Zimmerman </em>and <em>O\u2019Dowd) </em>are token of the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">Last winter Mr. Billings accepted a lead part in Michigan\u2019s 21st Institute of Advocacy, conducted March 6, 7. The institutionary topic was \u201cAutomobile Product Liability.\u201d The official handbook of the Institute portrays the nature of a trial demonstration of <em>\u201cPortnoy </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>and <em>Burns.\u201d </em>Mr. Billings, as an \u201cAccident Reconstruction Engineer,\u201d was employed by the defendant Anderson to investigate, report and make ready for testimonial \u201creconstruction.\u201d The 3-car collision investigation made of Portnoy, by Mr. Billings for hiring- lawyer Hamilton, discloses a unique similarity of <em>Portnoy </em>with <em>O\u2019Dowd. </em>His report to Mr. Hamilton advised, along with other meticulous detail :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-8\">\u201cDESCRIPTION: Traveling- east in a 1962 Cadillac Coupe deVille, Driver Anderson was rearended by Driver Burns, also eastbound, in a 1967 Buick Electra 4-door hardtop. As a result of that collision, Anderson\u2019s Cadillac was propelled across the center line into a head-on collision with a 1964 Ford Galaxie 500 4-door sedan being driven westbound at about 50 miles per hour by Portnoy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-9\">\u201c(I gather that Burns maintains that Anderson pulled from a parked position on the south shoulder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>into the eastbound lane in front of him without warning and without taillights when Burns was so close to Anderson that he did not have time even to apply his brakes, and his front right corner struck the rear left corner of Anderson\u2019s Cadillac. Anderson, on the other hand, says that he was simply driving along, eastbound, at about 45 miles per hour and was rear-ended by Burns without warning.)\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (P 66 of handbook.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">I allude to the March Institute in conjunction with <em>Zimmerman </em>and <em>O\u2019Dowd </em>solely to sharpen the point that Mr. Billings is a true professional witness whose investigatory talents, and expert opinions to be delivered in court, are for sale. His integrity as I understand is of the very best. We must presume likewise with respect to each of Mr. Billings\u2019 employers in the <em>Zimmerman, O\u2019Dowd </em>and <em>Portnoy </em>cases. Nonetheless his zeal and that of others for the causes of their employers is the taproot of our rule that expert opinions of those who, having no knowledge of the facts in issue, are generally dispensable in Michigan actions for negligence. There is no need for such opinions when factual proof is at hand and, there being no such need, they should be excluded as an evil rendered excludable by the stark fact of available and ample factual testimony, which the jurors may and should appraise for selection themselves of such inferences as they may choose to draw therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\"><em>To conclude this response: </em>It seems to me that Justice Adams\u2019 opinion is an open if unwitting invitation to joust prosecutions or actions for negli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>gence by mutual employment and deployment of professional witnesses, and to spend no little money to obtain their under-oath opinions as outright partisans. This if allowed is bound to become the very iniquity of \u201cmanufactured testimony\u201d which, for good reason, the Court deplored generally in <em>Jones </em>v. <em>The President and Trustees of the Village of Portland </em>(1891), 88 Mich 598, 604.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\"><em>Second: </em>Justice Adams\u2019 opinion advises at length of that which is so well known as to render it commonplace, first that opinion testimony of speed by foundation-qualifying <em>eyewitnesses </em>is admissible, and second that our Court has \u201con a number of occasions taken note of the reliability of circumstantial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">As to both I rejoin that we are considering here the admissibility of Mr. Billings\u2019 proffered <em>opinion </em>only, not his opinion of speed based on his own observations of the speeding or nonspeeding vehicle; also that the <em>opinion </em>he sought to deliver while on the stand did not by any known legal luminary constitute <em>circumstantial </em>evidence. The reason is that circumstantial evidence, once it is established by a witness having admissible knowledge thereof, constitutes a <em>thing </em>or <em>things, </em>not <em>opinions. </em>As such they are inflexible proofs and cannot lie, as can a witness who may be interested in the verdict to come. We said so at least in <em>Schneider </em>v. <em>Pomerville </em>(1957), 348 Mich 49, 58, and did so in the very context of all present writing, that is to say, an action wherein the issue of causal negligence is alleged and tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">The fact is that circumstantial evidence is of the essence of the best evidence rule, and is accepted properly when satisfactory direct evidence of the facts in issue is not available, or, if available, is not susceptible of that process for which jurors are duty-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>charged exclusively and in particular; the task of drawing inferences from direct proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">Lay aside, as presently and pertinently bootless, the products liability case, the will contest, the multiple or single automotive or grade-crossing collision cases, the criminal prosecution or, for that matter, the right to prosecute, sue, or defend for or on account of any matter or thing which may be actionable civilly or criminally, <em>where no witness or admissible demonstrative thing is available to supply the factual proof upon which judicial judgment may be made. </em>Lay such aside for reason that the expert\u2019s utility in all such cases is both <em>necessary and unavoidable.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Having done with all such dalliance in today\u2019s situation where eyewitness proof of essential facts is present, let us advise the profession again, as was done so helpfully from time to time by our distinguished predecessors, that naked opinions of expert witnesses, having no knowledge themselves of essential or controlling facts, are by our standard to be rejected excepting only where there is no direct and available proof of such facts. In that way we can maintain the integrity and Constance of the right of trial by jury, and guard against even partial usurpation, by hired interpreters of fact, of the fact-finding function of juries.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">As before, I vote to affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-7\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and T. E. Brennan, J., concurred with Black, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b553-8\">Adams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2z\"><em>(separate opinion). </em>I agree with Justice Black as to the result in this case. I disagree with the need test, as set forth in his opinion, to determine the admissibility of expert testimony. Plaintiffs or defendants are entitled to an oppor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>tunity to prove their ease or to disprove their opponent\u2019s case by means of all of the evidence available to them \u2014 expert or lay. If the testimony is cumulative, repetitive, or has no probative value, it may be excluded; otherwise, once the proper foundation has been laid, the testimony should be admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The importance of a proper foundation for the admission of such testimony cannot be too much stressed and will be developed later in this opinion. First, however, it will be helpful to look at what this Court has done in its rulings on the admissibility of lay testimony as to speed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In <em>Harnau </em>v. <em>Haight </em>(1915), 189 Mich 600, in commenting upon the testimony of a railroad engineer with regard to the speed of an automobile, this Court said (p 609):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-8\">\u201cBut the testimony of the witness as to what he believed to be the actual speed of the car presents a question of greater difficulty. There is no doubt about Mr. Pearson\u2019s competency to judge speed, but his opportunity to exercise such judgment in this case was very limited. He saw the automobile move through a space of only about 20 feet, \u2018after it shot from behind the tank,\u2019 to use his own words, and before the collision with plaintiff. He had no intimation that the automobile was approaching until it came into view from behind the tank, and the night was dark. * * * In the instant case the witness was a railroad engineer of long experience. The court must take notice of the fact that it was part of his business to estimate speed by observation of objects which he was passing while in his engine, both by day and night. He must furthermore be given credit for some knowledge of his own ability in this respect, and he professed to be able to give an opinion in this case. We think the court was not in error in receiving his opinion as to the speed of the car.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Schwartz </em>(1921), 215 Mich 197, a witness for the people, a train director, who testified that he was able to judge speed and that he had ridden in automobiles, was allowed to give his judgment as to the speed of defendant\u2019s car as it came toward him.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">In <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Detroit Taxicab &amp; Transfer Co. </em>(1922), 218 Mich 673, the testimony of a witness who saw defendant\u2019s taxicab coming for 40 feet was held to be admissible. This Court noted that the witness \u201ctestified that he had driven a horse and wagon for 12 years, had ridden in automobiles, once taking a trip from Detroit to Chicago, that he had a chance to observe how fast they were going, that he made the trip with two others, that they went \u201850 or 40 miles an hour,\u2019 that he watched the speedometer, that he rides often with friends who have machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In <em>Zylstra </em>v. <em>Graham </em>(1928), 244 Mich 319, this Court commented on the testimony of a witness for the plaintiff as follows (p 326):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-7\">\u201cThis witness testified he had driven an automobile for five years, that he observed the defendant\u2019s machine for a distance of 50 feet before it struck the deceased, and in so doing he was \u2018able to form a fair and intelligent judgment as to the speed at which it was traveling,\u2019 saying: \u2018My best judgment of his speed was around 25 miles an hour.\u2019 The weight of this testimony was for the jury. The court\u2019s ruling in receiving it was correct.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">In <em>Stehouwer </em>v. <em>Lewis </em>(1929), 249 Mich 76, a witness, who had never driven an automobile hut who had ridden in one very often, testified. This Court noted (p 81) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-9\">\u201cShe stated that she frequently watched the speedometers, hut admitted her inability to tell the exact mileage. She also described the distance the car was from the place of the accident when she saw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>it pass her home. She stated, however, that she could tell whether a car was driven slowly or fast, and that she could only estimate the speed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">This Court held that her testimony was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In <em>Tyler </em>v. <em>Weed </em>(1938), 285 Mich 460, four Justices found reversible error in the exclusion of evidence without specifying the evidence excluded. Justice McAllister, dissenting in part, wrote that the exclusion of the testimony of a 14-year-old boy with regard to the speed of an automobile was erroneous. He said (p 489):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-7\">\u201cPlaintiffs sought to show the speed at which defendant was driving at the time of the accident, by Max Ballenger, a boy 14 years of age. This witness testified that he had observed the speedometers in automobiles in which he had ridden and that he could also give an opinion as to how fast defendant was going, based upon his experience in observing automobiles driven on the streets.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">In <em>Hammock </em>v. <em>Sims </em>(1946), 313 Mich 248, this Court held that the trial court erred in denying plaintiff, on redirect examination, the right to give testimony as to the speed of defendant\u2019s truck. Plaintiff, a pedestrian, was struck while attempting to cross an icy street. She observed the truck advancing upon her.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-9\">In <em>O\u2019Brien </em>v. <em>Wahl </em>(1953), 335 Mich 601, this Court said (pp 604, 605):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b556-10\">\u201cPlaintiff\u2019s principal witness was the driver of the car in which she was riding, and it is the contention of the defendant that his testimony should have been stricken because it was incredible. Be Marco testified that immediately preceding the collision he observed the defendant approaching at a distance of 107 paces at an estimated speed of approximately 70 miles per hour. He further said that he continued to observe the defendant\u2019s car for a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>of seconds, but when pressed on cross-examination to be more definite, said: \u2018It happened so quickly, it was almost like the snap of a finger to me.\u2019 Primarily on the basis of this statement, defendant charges that De Marco\u2019s testimony was incredible, reasoning that it was physically impossible for an automobile to travel 107 paces in the time required for the snap of a finger.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdS\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-4\">\u201cIt may well be that his testimony was in part somewhat unrealistic and distorted, and certainly the use of the common phrase \u2018snap of a finger\u2019 in describing the time taken to travel 107 paces was inaccurate. Such discrepancies, however, could properly be taken into consideration by the jury and should be influential in determining the credibility of the witness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">From these decisions of this Court, it can readily be seen that <em>opinion testimony </em>of lay witnesses with regard to speed has repeatedly been held to be admissible even though the witnesses\u2019 opportunity to observe the speed of an automobile has been limited, or the qualifications of the witness to judge speed are little more than his own assertion of his ability to do so, or testimony of the witness borders on the incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">Considering the speeds at which automobiles now travel, the reliability of lay testimony as to speed, when given as a result of observations such as took place in the above cases, is scarcely .such as to obviate proper expert testimony with regard to such an issue. In this case, William E. Billings testified as follows as to his qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I graduated from the Harvard Engineering School in Mechanical Engineering in 1931, received my Bachelor of Science Degree.

Describe what you did, if you will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>At the scene of the accident, I did take measurements of the Highway and also the driveway which was important to the scene of the accident or the location of the accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>(interposing.) If I might interject for just a moment, I show you Defendant\u2019s Exhibit #2 and ask you if this chart is familiar to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, it is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What does this chart represent to you, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>It does represent a scale drawing of one inch equals ten feet of Greenfield Road, which is north-south in direction, between Lyndon and Eaton Streets.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>And is this the area within which you conducted your investigation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-17\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now if you will resume telling us what you did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-18\"><em>\u201cA. </em>In addition to the measurements that I took, I also made a coefficient of friction test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-19\"><em>\u201cQ: </em>Well, first of all, what is the coefficient of friction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Well, the coefficient of friction first, is a decimal fraction. When a car slides on a given pavement surface, with all wheels locked, there is naturally a retarding force bringing it to a stop. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>That force is expressed as the coefficient of friction times the gross weight of the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-4\">\u201cTo illustrate, if we have a 4000 pound car and our coefficient of friction is, for example, 75/100ths, this means that this retarding force is three quarters of the 4000 pounds, the weight of the car, or 3000 pounds. So the coefficient of friction, expressed as a decimal fraction, does indicate that retarding force as a fraction of the gross weight of the automobile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>But the coefficient of friction as a principle of physics, is not devoted solely to automobiles, is it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>No, it is devoted to any object sliding* over another object. For example, if we had a 100 pound weight on the floor here and I put a scale on it, a draw scale, and pulled it at a uniform velocity, and the scale reads 50 pounds, and the weight is 100 pounds, that would tell me the coefficient of friction between this weight and the floor is 50 pounds over 100 pounds, or one-half. In other words, 5/10ths, in that case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>But the coefficient of friction, as such, has many uses in industry, does it not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>All right. Now with respect to this test to determine the coefficient of friction, what did you do?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I used a 1960 Oldsmobile that had a calibrated speedometer on it, so that I knew the exact speed. I had a detonator fastened to the front bumper and this detonator shoots a .22 short, with yellow powder on it on the pavement when I apply the brakes and go in an emergency skid. And from a pre-determined speed, in this particular case my speeds were \u2014 on the speedometer it was 25 miles per hour in the first case and 24 miles per hour in two other cases \u2014 at this predetermined speed, with a detonator on my front bumper, I made three tests at, one at 25 miles per hour and two at 24 miles per hours each and applied the brakes and skidded to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>a stop. Then I measured from this yellow powder on the pavement up to the detonator in the stopped position of my car, which gave me the distance of slide to a stop. . Knowing the exact speed, I am able to determine this coefficient of friction, through the relationship of speed, braking distance, and that gives it to me, the coefficient of friction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was the condition of the road at the time you made your test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The test which I made was in the middle north-bound lane immediately south of the driveway which is shown on the drawing in front of the jury there. The condition of the road at that time in this middle north-bound lane was dry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>What was the result of this test, with respect to determining this coefficient of friction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I found the coefficient of friction to be 815/1000ths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>\u2018815/1000ths\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-10\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes, or 81/100ths.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now I show you Defendant Zimmerman\u2019s proposed Exhibits #25, #26, #27, #28, and #29 and ask you if you have seen those pictures before ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I have seen these pictures before.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>When did you see them, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Actually, I did have the TV film and insofar as time is concerned, not to take the exact date, but the film was in my costody [sic] temporarily and I had them \u2014 oh, I\u2019ve had them probably a month or so.

Am I correct, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-13\"><em>\u201cMr. Bedrosian [attorney for defendant MuJcalla] </em>: I stipulate to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-14\"><em>\u201cMr. Bird [assistant prosecuting </em>attorney]: That\u2019s all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Do you have such an opinion as to the minimum speed of the Ford vehicle prior to the application of his brakes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-16\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-17\">The court rephrased the question as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-18\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>Now I want to ask you a question which will make it a little simpler, I think.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-19\">\u201cDo you say that you have an opinion based on the weight of this car, and based on an assumption that it skidded 69 feet and hit this truck and knocked the tank off and spun around as you have been informed that it did; do you have an opinion that you think you can accurately tell how fast that Ford was going?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-20\"><em>\u201cA. </em>The minimum speed, your Honor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b566-21\">Thereupon the court excused the jury and there followed a long colloquy between court and counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>as to whether or not Billings should be permitted to give his opinion. During the colloquy, this exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-4\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>(interposing.) Since the jury isn\u2019t here, how fast would that car have to be going to skid 69 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\"># * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>But if this car skidded 69 feet to a stop and the car actually moved 69 feet to a stop, its speed would be 41 miles per hour without hitting anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-7\">\u201cNow, this was not told me, so I would give two answers on this. If the distance was from the beginning of the rear wheel skid, to the end of the front wheel skid, then I have to subtract wheelbase, which is nine and nine-tenths feet. In subtracting the wheelbase, I then come out with the fact that the car skidded actually 59 feet and not 69 feet, and for that, its speed would be 38 miles per hour, if it came to a stop without hitting anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-8\"><em>\u201cMr. Perlman: </em>That is with no impact?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-10\">After further discussion of the law, this exchange took place between court and counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-11\"><em>\u201cMr. Perlman: </em>Your Honor, we are not going to ask this expert for his opinion as to the cause of this accident. The jurors have been given lengths of skidmarks. The jurors have been given\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-12\"><em>\u201cThe Court: </em>(interposing.) What you want to tell me is that all you want to ask him is the speed that he thinks the car was going when he put on his brakes, is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-13\"><em>\u201cMr. Perlman: </em>There are several questions, sir. Not the speed that he thinks it was going when the brakes were applied, but the minimum speed that it could have been going to lay down those skid-marks. That is number one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-14\">\u201cNumber two: The speed of the Ford prior to the impact, the speed of this car prior to the impact, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>based upon what he has seen. The speed of the car if it had hit nothing, provided those skids were laid down first, by the front wheels. And the speed of that car if it had hit nothing and the skids were laid down by the back wheels, the beginning of the back wheels. Now these are the four questions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">While there is more to be added from the testimony of Mr. Billings as to his qualifications as a \u201ctraffic expert,\u201d it is necessary to comment at this point on the offer of proof. It should be noted that the offer of proof was Billings\u2019 opinion as to speed, based solely upon the skid marks, and that the testimony he would have given would have been a range of speed from 38 to 41 miles per hour. <em>There was no offer of proof as to speed deduced from the skid marks and the resulting action of the two vehicles after impact. </em>The witness\u2019 opinion would have been based upon the controlled tests which he made, the laws of physics, and his training and experience in traffic engineering. In <em>Winekoff </em>v. <em>Pospisil </em>(1970), 384 Mich 260, this Court has held admissible a chart headed \u201cStopping Distance \u2014 Passenger Cars,\u201d contained in the pamphlet \u201cWhat Every Driver Must Know,\u201d that is publicly distributed by the Secretary of State. In that case, it was held that judicial notice could be taken of the chart. In this case, the expert\u2019s special knowledge, the physical facts, and the tests which he conducted to determine the coefficient of friction laid a proper foundation for the admission of his testimony as to speed based upon the length of the skid marks.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">As stated at the outset of this opinion, expert testimony, like any other testimony, may be excluded if it is cumulative or repetitive or has no probative value. In this case, Zimmerman testified that when he made a second observation down Greenfield, he then saw a car approaching and he estimated it to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>be 200 to 150 feet away. Zimmerman said that the car \u201cwas coming like the dickens, flying.\u201d He further testified that had the driver of the oncoming car been going at an ordinary rate of speed, he (Zimmerman) would have had time to have cleared the roadway easy.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">Witness Bloom, who was called for defendant Zimmerman, testified that he observed the Mukalla ear from his bedroom window and that, in his opinion, it was going \u201cabout 50 miles an hour.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">Subsequent to the offer of proof by Billings, defendant Mukalla testified. He stated he was going 35 miles per hour. He could have been going faster, maybe 40, not faster than that. He admitted he had 21 moving traffic violations against him at the time, or prior to the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">While the testimony of defendant Mukalla was given subsequent to that of Billings, upon review in this Court we consider the entire record. The testimony of Billings would have added nothing to the testimony that had been given by Zimmerman and Bloom. The testimony of Mukalla, subsequent to Billings\u2019 testimony, in view of Mukalla\u2019s admission that he was driving in excess of the 30-mile-per-hour speed limit, that he was going 35 miles per hour, and that he could have been going faster, maybe 40, removes any possible error in the refusal of the trial judge to permit Billings to testify as to speed in accordance with the offer of proof. Consequently, it must be concluded that the trial judge did not err in excluding this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">Zimmerman\u2019s attorney no doubt had intended to elicit from Billings an opinion that the Mukalla car was traveling at a much greater speed than 40 miles per hour. However, at no time was an offer made of proof to this effect and the foundation for an opinion by Billings as to speed based upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>skid marks, <em>plus </em>the results of the impact of the two motor vehicles, was never laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-4\">After the colloquy between court and counsel, and the judge\u2019s decision to exclude the opinion testimony as to speed based upon the length of the skid marks, the jury was recalled and defendant Zimmerman\u2019s attorney questioned him further as to his qualifications. Thereupon the attorney for defendant Mukalla conducted cross-examination as to Billings\u2019 qualifications as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-5\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now with respect to your teaching ability: it is true, isn\u2019t it, that most of your experience around the county would be in lecturing and teaching the students, pertaining to that which you are about to testify today, isn\u2019t that true, teaching?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>My lectures to professional groups have been in the nature of teaching basics of investigation and traffic accident reconstruction, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-7\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>Now other than teaching, what experience have you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-8\"><em>\u201cA. </em>In traffic accident reconstruction?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-9\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>No, I haven\u2019t finished my question yet. What experience have you had as between the speed of motor vehicles and impact? Have you ever performed any controlled tests with respect to speeds of motor vehicles and impacts ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-10\"><em>\"A. </em>I have not involved myself in experiments of bringing cars together\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-11\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>(interposing.) First, let me\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-12\"><em>\u201cA. </em>(interposing.) May I finish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-13\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>First let me get your answer. Your answer to that question is \u2018no\u2019, isn\u2019t that true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-14\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Sir, may I finish?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-15\"><em>\u201cQ. </em>First I want the answer and then I will let you explain all you want. Have you had any actual experience in that particular field, actually controlled tests with respect to speed of vehicles and impact? Is your answer to that \u2018no\u2019, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number><em>\u201cA. </em>My answer to that is \u2018yes\u2019 with regard to speed and with regard to impact, \u2018no\u2019.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">In view of Billings\u2019 admission that he had not had any actual experience in the field of controlled tests with respect to impact of vehicles, his opinion based upon the impact of the vehicles, would have lacked a proper foundation and would have been inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">This is the age of the expert. It is too late to disregard him in the trial of cases. This does not mean that testimony is to be permitted in lawsuits by any so-called expert. There should first be the most searching examination of his credentials. It is for this reason the qualifications of Billings have been presented at length. They reveal that while he may have been an expert in some fields of traffic safety and reconstruction of the causes of traffic accidents, he was not qualified, at least upon the record in this case, as an expert on impacts. No judge would permit a doctor specializing as an anesthetist to testify as an expert on a question of child nutrition in pediatric medicine. The expert must be an expert in the precise problem as to which he undertakes to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">It is the province always of the jury, made up of common men, to weigh and decide the evidence, but in the struggle to arrive at the truth the doors may well be opened to them by experts for a proper understanding of the complex facts involved not only in travels to the moon but in connection with the movement of vehicles upon our modern-day streets and highways.</p>\n<judges id=\"b571-7\">T. G. Kavanagh, J., and Swainson, J., concurred with Adams, J.</judges>\n<author id=\"b571-8\">Williams, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Acf0\"><em>(to affirm). </em>This case concerns the standards under which an expert witness may tes<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>tify. The expertise involved is automobile accident reconstruction. One type of testimony in question is calculation of speed by the laws of physics from skid marks with other known physical factors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The other type of testimony in question is calculation of speed by the laws of physics from skid marks plus impact along with other known physical factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">The matter assumes importance beyond the instant case because the issue is of first impression in this Court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> although the matter has been considered several times in the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Furthermore, in what our Brother Adams has called the \u201cage of the expert\u201d, it is important that the jurisprudence of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>state concerning expert witnesses generally be both sound and able to cope with the challenges of the times.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">The issues in this case arose out of a prosecution for negligent homicide. The victim was a passenger in the car of defendant Mukalla that ran into a petroleum truck driven by the defendant Zimmerman. The two vehicles were traveling in opposite directions. Zimmerman turned left into a drive across Mukalla\u2019s half of the street.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The question of speed became important because defendant Zimmerman maintained that he could have safely completed his left turn in front of defendant Mukalla, had Mukalla not been \u201ccoming like the dickens, flying\u201d. Only two eyewitnesses testified. Witness Bloom, who saw the Mukalla car from his bedroom window, said Mukalla was going \u201cabout 50 miles an hour\u201d. Defendant Mukalla personally testified he was going 35 or 40 miles per hour. The speed limit was 30 miles per hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Defendant Zimmerman presumably had in mind putting witness Billings on the stand to testify as an expert that Mukalla was traveling at a faster rate of speed than he admitted on the stand. Defendant Zimmerman offered to put witness Billings on the stand as an expert on calculating speed from skid marks. While Zimmerman was attempting to lay a foundation for such testimony the trial court out of the hearing of the jury but on the record asked witness Billings how fast he calculated Mukalla was going. Witness Billings responded that on the basis of his calculation from skid marks alone Mukalla was doing 41 miles per hour. The implication, of course, was that skid marks interpreted only part of Mukalla\u2019s speed because his car did not come to a stop by braking alone but through impact with Zimmerman\u2019s truck. The implication was that if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Billings were allowed to calculate the additional stopping power as shown by the absorption of impact, the rate of speed would be greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">The trial court did not rule on the record whether witness Billings could testify on the basis of skid marks and he was never produced. Likewise the effort to produce him to testify on the basis of skid marks and impact was abandoned. Defendant Zimmerman was convicted and appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">The Court of Appeals characterized the issues as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-7\">\u201cWe must consider whether this expert witness may give his opinion as to speed of a vehicle where he has conducted several tests which form the basis of that opinion, and also inquire as to whether speed was material to the issue being tried in this case, i.e., defendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d <em>People </em>v. <em>Zimmerman </em>(1968), 12 Mich App 241, 245.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-8\">On the first issue the Court of Appeals stated its \u201cwillingness to accept such expert opinion evidence as to speed <em>when it is properly presented\u201d, </em>(emphasis added) citing pertinent authority.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, despite a recess defendant Zimmerman\u2019s counsel failed to make that proper presentation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As to the second issue, the Court of Appeals opined \u201cThere is no question as to the competence of Mr. Billings to testify as an expert witness on the issue of speed\u201d but then added they could not rule on whether it was necessary testimony as the trial court never ruled on the issue. Defendant\u2019s conviction was affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-9\">This opinion will consider the matter in the following order.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>I. Whether an expert witness should he allowed to state an opinion as to speed of an automobile based either on skid marks or on skid marks plus impact. This involves considering the \u201cstate of the art\u201d of the expertise;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\">II. Whether a proper qualification had been laid for witness Billings to testify as an expert in either skid marks or skid marks plus impact, assuming a satisfactory state of the art;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">III. Whether in the record a proper factual foundation had been laid for any expert to testify on speed from either skid marks or skid marks plus impact, assuming a satisfactory state of the art;</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">IV. Assuming a showing of a satisfactory development of the art and that a proper foundation was laid both as to the witness\u2019s expert qualification and as to the necessary data from which to testify, what is the standard of discretion that should control the trial judge in determining whether the witness should be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">I \u2014 Status of the Art</p>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">A <em>\u2014Law</em></p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">2 Jones, Evidence (5 ed), \u00a7 435, p 827, lays down a general guideline for our consideration of this matter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-9\">\u201cThe developments of science constantly influence the expansion of the field for the use of expert testimony.

These opinions have included the point of impact <em>(Zelayeta </em>v. <em>Pacific Greyhound Lines </em>[1951], 104 Cal App 2d 716 [232 P2d 572]), braking and stopping distances <em>(Kerr </em>v. <em>Caraway </em>[Fla (1955)], 78 So 2d 571).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>\u201cWe align ourselves with the authorities which hold that one properly qualified in accident investigative background may testify either from personal observation or from properly authenticated and admitted exhibits that, in his opinion, certain marks are skid marks and that they were made by a given motor vehicle and his reasons therefor.

He has had a distinguished career in many branches of the subject. At present he is Director of Research and Development, Traffic Institute, Northwestern University. In his article <em>Limitations on Accident Reconstruction, </em>8 Defense LJ 3 (1960), he had this to say at page 19:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-6\">\u201cAccident reconstruction is half art, perhaps, and half science, but it cannot honestly perform the miracles which some seem to think it should.

White entitled <em>Engineering Research in the Field of Law, </em>Ins L J 753 (1957), he pointed out that nomographs from which velocity can be calculated from skid mark measurements using various coefficients of friction have become widely distributed even in the legal profession. The article then went on to point out that two universities reached diametrically-opposed conclusions in the development of the coefficient of friction data. Finally he showed that Bureau of Public Roads tests created further doubts as to the accuracy of such nomographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">In another connection we shall later refer more comprehensively to National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report <em>37 </em>\u2014 Tentative <em>Skid-Resistance Requirements for Main Rural Highways, </em>H.

Meyer, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, a statement in that study relative f-o developing the coefficient of friction, a critical part of the calculation of speed in the skid mark calculation, is pertinent at this point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-7\">\u201cOne might object that obtaining all of these data is impractical in field tests. Although this is correct, it is also true that many currently available test results are of limited value precisely because it either was not realized that this additional information was needed or it was not possible to determine all of the pertinent parameters.\u201d (P 10.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">While there was no effort to introduce expert testimony on skid marks plus impact, the same kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>showing to qualify the state of the art is in order. In passing it would not be amiss to say the principle of conservation of energy runs into difficulty here because the amount of consumption of energy in the crash process is unknown. Vehicles only theoretically produce the same kind of dents with the same amount of force applied to them, because a particular structural member may be weaker than another for any number of reasons such as faulty welding, rust, <em>etc.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">On the closely related facts of <em>Leitch </em>v. <em>Getz </em>(1936), 275 Mich 645, 648, 649, this Court trenchantly states the principles involved in seeking to admit testimony in a new area of expertise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cPlaintiff presented a witness to offer an estimate of the speed of defendant\u2019s car, upon the basis of the weight of the cars and the distance and direction they moved after the collision. The hypothetical question did not cover the situation. No attempt was made, other than bare assertion of the witness as to his qualification, to indicate that the infinite number of points of variability in automobile collisions affords sufficient certainty of cause and effect to permit scientific speed estimates. Without such showing, we could hold the testimony no more than speculation. The testimony was properly excluded. <em>Hinderer </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>237 Mich 232 (26 NCCA 871 ).\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>C <em>\u2014Conclusions</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">There must be a showing of state of the art for any unrecognized area of expertise such that an expert therein can testify with a reasonable degree of accuracy and predictability. This is the burden of the party seeking admission for such testimony. Of course, the opposite party is free to cross-examine and offer contrary testimony.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> All of this should be on the record in case of appellate review. In the event that the judge in his discretion determines that the state of the art is satisfactory, and the witness properly qualified, and a sufficient foundation laid, the opposing party can certainly on cross-examination before the jury demonstrate the degree of accuracy or predictability that can be expected from the expertise in its present state of development.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">On the record and from the briefs and arguments in this case, we conclude that Zimmerman in seeking to use opinion evidence as to speed based on calculations critically based on skid marks did not make an adequate demonstration of a proper state of the art. Hence the trial court did not err in not admitting such testimony. This is not to say that a case cannot be made for the use of skid mark speed calculation. We conclude only that so far in this state such a case has not been made and the perfection of the state of that art is not so well recognized either in scientific and professional circles or in the courts of this country<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> so as to either compel or permit us to take judicial notice of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">As for calculation of speed on the critical basis of skid marks plus impact, no case at all was made. In all probability this is an even more complicated area <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>than skid marks. Again there is no basis for this Court to take judicial notice of the state of the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\">II \u2014 Qualification of Witness</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">This matter was not really in issue. Since it is a matter more of fact than law, little time will be spent on it except to say that from the record the trial judge might have found an adequate qualification for skid mark background but less specific support in the area of impact. See, for example, for comparison <em>Snyder </em>v. <em>N.Y.C. Transport Co. </em>(1946), 4 Mich App 38, 45. In general see McCormick, Law of Evidence \u00a7 14, p 29; 2 Jones, Evidence (5th ed), \u00a7 413, p 774; <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Trogan </em>(1961), 364 Mich 148; <em>Washburn </em>v. <em>Lucas </em>(1964), 373 Mich 610.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">III \u2014 Factual Foundation</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Whether there was a proper foundation for the presentation of expert testimony is also largely a matter of fact. But it is a matter of importance if the scientific calculations on which the expert opinion is to be based are to be accurate. The scientific formula used in connection with calculating speed from skid marks is the coefficient of friction.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">The factual basis laid for the coefficient of friction was certainly subject to vigorous cross-examination if not outright disqualification. In this connection, the following quotation on page 9 and 10 from the previously referred to National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 37, <em>Tentative Skid-Resistance Requirements for Main Rural Highways, </em>prepared by H. W. Kummer and W. E. Meyer, Department of Mechanical Engineering, The Pennsylvania State University, is significant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">\u201cThe foregoing discussion should be persuasive evidence of the necessity of identifying the test con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>ditions under which friction data are obtained when dealing with either the adhesion or the hysteresis component. When pavement friction is measured with a rubber slider or by means of a slipping or skidding tire, adhesion and hysteresis generally occur together, because no pavement surface is so smooth as to eliminate hysteresis or so well lubricated as to render adhesion trivial. Under these circumstances it becomes mandatory to state the test conditions and assure their constancy throughout the test.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-6\">\u201cThe statement We measured a friction coefficient of 0.63\u2019 is basically meaningless if it is not accompanied by the following information:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-7\">\u201c1. Surface characteristics, of which surface geometry (macro- and microscopic roughness of the mineral particles and/or binder) and the type and amount of lubricant are the most important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-8\">\u201c2. Rubber characteristics, of which the elastic and damping properties are the most important.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-9\">\u201c3. Operational parameters; that is, load or pressure acting on the slider or tire, sliding- speed, and temperature of both surface and rubber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b586-10\">\u201cOne might object that obtaining all of these data is impractical in field tests. Although this is correct, it is also true that many currently available test results are of limited value precisely because it either was not realized that this additional information was needed or it was not possible to determine all of the pertinent parameters.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-11\">What was the testimony in this case as to surface characteristics? \u201cI understand there has been no change in the pavement surface.\u201d \u201cYour coefficient of friction was determined on the dry pavement, was it not?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-12\">There was also testimony indicating that the witness tested the road in his own car with its own tires of a brand not specified at 25 miles an hour, although he later calculated that the car in question was trav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>elling at least 40 miles an hour without considering whatever additional speed might be factored in because of impact calculations.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">What does this all mean? Surface characteristics: among other things not only was the road nine months older when the expert witness tested it, but the accident occurred in January and the test was run in September. In January there was probably a saline film on the road, which would not be true in September. Rubber characteristics: the record does not indicate whether the expert witness\u2019s tires were of the same brand as the car in the accident or that they had the same amount of wear.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The hysteresis factor refers to the reactions of different types of tires with different degrees of hardness at different rates of speed.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The last factor, of course, makes the relationship of the speed of the test car to the accident car important.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\u201cDry\u201d is a generally inadequate approximation of what is required. \u201cThermal history\u201d is what is needed, and where there is not adequate comparison of thermal history in the accident and test days there can be significant variation in the coefficient of friction.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">No issue was made of whether or not a proper foundation was laid for introducing testimony, so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>there is no need for a finding or holding here. The matter was considered, however, for the reason that the prohable inadequacies in the foundation are indicative of the complication of the expertise sought to be used and the number of almost uncontrollable variables which tend to make the reliability of prediction from anything except the most exhaustive laboratory tests something less than sure. As a matter of fact, the most closely-controlled tests seem to be subject to a considerable possibility of appreciable error. This, of course, goes to the state of the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">IV \u2014 Judicial Discretion</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Assuming the trial court has found that the state of the art of the expertise in question satisfactorily passes the test, that the witness is fully steeped in the expertise and that an entirely-adequate foundation has been laid on which the witness can base his opinion, the determination as to whether or not the witness may testify is still within the trial court\u2019s discretion. Obviously, the trial court must exercise his discretion according to some reasonable standard. What is the appropriate standard?</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">The Michigan cases suggest two standards which out of context at least show discernible difference. One standard arises from an opinion of Justice Cooley in <em>McEwen </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1879), 40 Mich 215, 217. Justice Cooley spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-9\">\u201cThe court is not obliged to receive the evidence of every person called who may appear to have some little knowledge of the business, but who has no personal knowledge of the matters in controversy. He must decide within the limits of a fair discretion whether the experience of the supposed expert had been such as to make his opinions of any value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">What Justice Cooley emphasizes is whether the proposed testimony will be \u201cof value\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Another standard arises from an opinion of Justice Campbell in <em>People </em>v. <em>Morrigan </em>(1874), 29 Mich 4, 7. Justice Campbell spoke as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-4\">\u201cThe experience of courts with the testimony of experts has not been such as to impress them with the conviction that the scope of such proofs should be extended. Such testimony is not desirable in any case where the jury can get along without it; and is only admitted from necessity, and then only when it is likely to be of some value.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">What Justice Campbell emphasizes is whether the proposed testimony is \u201cnecessary\u201d and if necessary, will it be of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">These two standards on their face read quite differently. However, another factor must be considered. The three tests mentioned above are theoretically separate and apart from this standard of discretion, but in reality they cannot but have a meaningful effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">For example, it is argued that since in the instant case there were eyewitnesses who could testify to the speed of the car, it would be unnecessary to call upon expert testimony. Suppose, however, that all the facts remained the same but instead of an automobile accident reconstruction expert, there fortuitously had been a traffic officer tracking the Mukalla car with a \u201cspeedwatch\u201d with acknowledged excellent accuracy. Would it still make sense to argue that because there were two eyewitnesses who could testify to speed that the traffic officer should not testify, although on the basis of his expertise he would have the right answer ? Is it, or is it not necessary to call the witness who can solve the problem ? It would be hard on the basis of common sense to argue against using the officer and his expertise. The jury would probably not understand why they could not get what would seem like the definitive word, and perhaps the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>appellate court might not either. However, if the expert were backed by an expertise that was reputed only 50% accurate, the necessity of calling on him would seem to be much less obvious, although in either case the testimony might be said to be of value depending upon what credibility the eyewitnesses were thought to have.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">The following analysis may in part help explain the difference in standards suggested by Justices Cooley and Campbell. Justice Cooley\u2019s opinion dealt with the possible admission of the expert testimony of a plumber, and every husband who was tried at the request of his wife to make a toilet stop running knows first hand, that the help of an expert would be of value, or for that matter necessary. Justice Campbell on the other hand was dealing with possible testimony of detectives \u201cas to whether it was possible to commit the robbery in the manner charged\u201d. Probably most would agree with Justice Campbell \u201cThe subject is not a proper one for experts\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">The last statement indicates the interrelationship between the qualification of the expertise and the discretion of the court. While the derived rule may relate to the court\u2019s limits of discretion, the underlying basis was that there was no acceptable expertise. One is tempted to wonder, however, what the trial judge would have done if the proffered witness had been Sherlock Holmes.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">In our opinion, the ultimate standard is going to be one of common sense. The trial court will not exercise its discretion in a vacuum but with relation to the accuracy of the expertise, the skill of the expert, the persuasiveness of the fact foundation laid, and good judicial common sense as to whether the witness\u2019s testifying would, be in the best interests of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>The proposed Federal rule on this subject creates a reasonable and practical standard and we adopt it as a guide.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-6\">\u201cIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by special knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto.\u201d Rule 7-02, Testimony by Experts, Proposed Rules of Evidence for the US District Courts, 46 FRD, 161,314.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b591-7\">This test is adequately described by the following excerpt from the Advisory Committee\u2019s notes to Rule 7-02:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b591-8\">\u201cWhether the situation is a proper one for the use of expert testimony is to be determined on the basis of <em>assisting the trier. </em>\u2018There is no more certain test for determining when experts may be used than the common sense inquiry whether the untrained layman would be qualified to determine intelligently and to the best possible degree the particular issue without enlightenment from those having a specialized understanding of the subject involved in the dispute.\u2019 Ladd, <em>Expert Testimony, </em>5 Vand L Rev 414, 418 (1952).

It will be later quoted in the body of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">The Court did consider a similar matter in <em>Winekoff </em>v. <em>Pospisil </em>(1970), 384 Mich 260, 269. There this Court took judicial notice of the Secretary of State\u2019s pamphlet \u201cWhat Every Driver Must Know\u201d. The relevance of this pamphlet to the instant case is that both the pamphlet and calculation of speed from skid marks rely in part on the coefficient of friction.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">Two other cases almost on point are <em>Siegel </em>v. <em>Detroit Cab Co. </em>(1929), 246 Mich 620, 623, and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ray </em>(1966), 2 Mich App 623, 630, 631. <em>Siegel </em>admitted testimony of an experiment made with a similar car to that causing the accident and almost immediately after the accident to the effect that at 12 miles an hour the ear could be stopped within two feet on a dry pavement. However, this Court after stating the facts of the experiment peremptorily dismissed the matter with \u201cthis testimony was admissible\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-10\">In <em>Ray </em>a similar experiment was carried out by a state trooper. Here the Court said \u201cWe conclude that the examining magistrate properly admitted the testimony of the experiment of officer Schoenmaker, bearing on the issue of speed\u201d. In neither case did the witness attempt to calculate the speed of the offending car. The jury knew the length of the skid marks of the offending car and the witness testified as to the speed of the experimental and the stopping distance.

A rule that may be appropriate to one time and place may seem wholly inappropriate when viewed in the light of subsequent scientific development.

The upshot of these was that even highly-controlled skid mark tests were subject to significant error. If measurements are on the spot basis the error will run appreciably higher.

A quotation from this Court in <em>Prove </em>v. <em>Interstate Stages </em>(1930), 250 Mich 478, 490, is significant. The case involved a car-bus accident but no expert witness.
