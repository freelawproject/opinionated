Kavanagh, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A-t\">This is an appeal from a decision of the Court of Appeals<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> which overturned a jury verdict in favor of plaintiff, Melvin R. Hersh against defendant Kentfield Builders, Inc.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">The facts giving rise to the suit are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">Plaintiff, Melvin Hersh, a kitchen cabinet salesman, went to one of defendant Kentfield Builders, Inc.\u2019s model homes to keep a business appointment with defendant\u2019s president, Norman Steel.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">While waiting for Steel, Hersh was seriously injured in an unprovoked attack by one Benton Hutchinson, a casual laborer employed by defendant to do clean-up work and odd jobs around the models.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Hutchinson was subsequently committed to the Ionia State Hospital for the criminally insane.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">Hersh\u2019s suit was based upon defendant\u2019s asserted negligence in employing or retaining Hutchinson knowing, or by failing to be reasonably diligent in ascertaining, Hutchinson\u2019s vicious and murderous propensities.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">The jury\u2019s verdict for Hersh was set aside by the Court of Appeals on its determination that there was no evidence in the record to support the conclusion of negligence. The Court said (p 48):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201cIt is apparent from that record that Hutchinson\u2019s manner did not reveal an assaultive propensity and that his employer, who was without knowledge of the prior conviction for manslaughter, cannot be said to have acted unreasonably in hiring him as to fix \u2018fault\u2019 on the employer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">There is no dispute about the law in Michigan applicable to this case. It was held in <em>Bradley </em>v. <em>Stevens </em>(1951), 329 Mich 556, headnote 2:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201cAn employer who knew or should have known of his employee\u2019s propensities and criminal record before commission of an intentional tort by employee upon customer who came to employer\u2019s place of business would be liable for damages to such customer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-11\">The principle is stated in 34 ALR2d 390, \u00a7 9:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">\u201c\u00a7 9. Negligence; selection or retention of employee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">\u201cAs has already been noted, a duty imposed upon an employer who invites the general public to his premises, and whose employees are brought into contact with the members of such public in the course of the master\u2019s business, is that of exercising reasonable care for the safety of his customers, patrons, or other invitees. It has been held that in fulfilling such duty, an employer must use due <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>care to avoid the selection or retention of an employee whom he knows or should know is a person unworthy, by habits, temperament, or nature, to deal with the persons invited to the premises by the employer. The employer\u2019s knowledge of past acts of impropriety, violence, or disorder on the part of the employee is generally considered sufficient to forewarn the employer who selects or retains such employee in his service that he may eventually commit an assault, although not every infirmity of character, such, for example, as dishonesty or querulousness, will lead to such result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The basic disagreement is over the application of the law to the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff asserts that the conclusion of negligence is for the jury who alone may properly weigh the considerations necessary to judgment of whether the defendant acted reasonably under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">The defendant asserts that there is no evidence in the record which will support a conclusion of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">We think the trial judge was eminently correct in submitting the case to the jury. In denying the motion for a directed verdict he said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cNow, in this case, the employer defendant did learn of a prior criminal record during the time of his employment. Now, the weight of that or significance of it, as to whether he knew or should have known of the propensities, in my opinion, is a question of fact for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cCertainly there is a distinction between the Bradley versus Stevens case, 32 [sic] Michigan 556 and the case at Bar. And there\u2019s a distinction in the case of Kendall versus Glorr property case, but the principle is the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cIn the Bradley versus Stevens case, Mr. Whitfield indicates that there\u2019s a distinction, as I under<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>stand it, because of exposure to the public of employees. But there\u2019s testimony of Mr. Steel the people did come to the homes to look at them. I would take it from his testimony the jury could find these were potential customers. In a sense this employee is exposed to the public. How much would be a question for the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-6\">\u201cSo it\u2019s my opinion of the law that first that the\u2014 and I would instruct accordingly, and certainly this defendant is not a guarantor. He\u2019s not an insuror [sic], and there\u2019s no liability on the part of the employer for torts intentionally or recklessly committed by an employee beyond the scope of his master\u2019s business. But if the defendant knew or should [sic] of this man, Hutchinson\u2019s propensities and criminal record, then we \u2014 in my opinion, have a question of fact for the jury as to whether or not he \u2014 this employer knew or should have known is a close question, but there\u2019s sufficient testimony to submit that to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\u201cThe question of negligence in this case, in my opinion, is a fact question to be submitted to the jury. It\u2019s a very close question, but in my opinion, a motion for directed verdict as to the remaining defendant is denied.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">The gist of his instruction to the jury was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-9\">\u201cNow, in this case, an employer is not liable for intentional or reckless acts committed by an employee beyond the scope of his employer\u2019s business. The act of Bennie Hutchinson, of which the plaintiff complains in this action, was clearly beyond the scope of his employment, so the mere fact of the employment does not impose liability on the defendant. The defendant employer is not an insurer or guarantor of the safety of others, such as the plaintiff.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-10\">\u201cHowever, the law does impose upon employers the duty of using reasonable care in the hiring of employees, and if you find that the defendant was negligent in the hiring of Bennie Hutchinson, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>the day in question, then you should find for the plaintiffs, provided you find that such damages inflicted on the plaintiff were the proximate result of that negligence. If, however, you find that the defendant was not negligent, then you should find for the defendant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-4\">\u201cNow, in order to find negligence in this case, you must find that the defendant knew or should have known of facts which would reasonably indicate that the employee, Bennie Hutchinson, had a violent or vicious nature which was likely to result in injury to someone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\">\u201cIn determining negligence, you may take into account the defendant\u2019s knowledge that Hutchinson had been in prison. However, the mere fact that a person has a criminal record, even a conviction for a crime of violence, does not in itself establish the fact that that person has a violent or vicious nature so that an employer would be negligent in hiring him to meet the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-6\">\u201cIn determining negligence, you may also take into account the experience which the defendant had with Hutchinson over the other times that he was employed before this incident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">We think the trial judge correctly stated the law and postured the case in his instruction. Whether the employer knew or should have known of Hutchinson\u2019s vicious propensities should not be determined by any court as a matter of law, but by the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">We are not unmindful of or unsympathetic to the considerations which prompted the Court of Appeals decision. We share their concern for those persons who, having been convicted of a crime, have served the sentence imposed and so are said to have paid their debt to society and yet find difficulty in obtaining employment. In our considered view, however, their welfare as well as that of the other members of the community is better served by a rule of law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>which, requires a jury \u2014 the conscience of the community \u2014 rather than a judge, to assay the import of that fact and the circumstances giving rise to it in determining whether their employment for a given job under given circumstances is a reasonable course to follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">The Court of Appeals is reversed and the cause remanded for reinstatement of the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">Costs to appellant.</p>\n<judges id=\"b534-8\">T. M. Kavanagh, C. J., and Adams, T. E. Brennan, Swainson, and Williams, JJ., concurred with T. G-.
