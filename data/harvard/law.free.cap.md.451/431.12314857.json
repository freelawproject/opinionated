(\u201cNational Union\u201d), challenges the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding that Respondent, the Fund for Animals, Inc. (\u201cFFA\u201d), did not cause actual prejudice to National Union as a result of providing late notice of a claim against FFA under a liability insurance policy issued by National Union to FFA. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann., INS. \u00a7 19-110 (1997, 2011 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.). This case relates to three actions: (1) the Endangered Species Act case (\u201cESA Case\u201d), where FFA and other plaintiffs sued Ringling Brothers and its owner, Feld Entertainment, Inc. (\u201cFeld\u201d) for the mistreatment of Asian elephants in the Ringling Brothers\u2019 Circus; (2) the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>(\u201cRICO Case\u201d), where Feld sued FFA and the other plaintiffs named in the ESA Case for improper conduct, including paying a witness to testify in order to establish standing to sue Feld in the ESA Case and concealing those payments during discovery; and (3) the Coverage Case, where FFA sued National Union, its insurer, for not providing coverage to FFA when it was sued by Feld in the RICO Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">This appeal stems from the coverage dispute. The findings in the ESA Case were adverse to FFA and could have been used against it in the RICO case; thus, prejudicing FFA\u2019s insurer, National Union. FFA argues that although notice of the RICO claim was late under the policy, National Union, at best, could have \u201cmonitored\u201d the ESA Case and could not have intervened in, impacted, or influenced the ESA Case. Moreover, National Union was notified of the RICO Case before settlement, mediation, or a trial had taken place in the RICO action. Therefore, late notification of the RICO Case<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> was not prejudicial to National Union. Accordingly, as a matter of law, National Union was not prejudiced in investigating, settling, or defending the RICO claim as a result of any delay in receiving notice of claims brought against the insured. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"Ah6a\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">The relevant facts are taken from evidence and testimony presented at trial. FFA, a nonprofit organization dedicated to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>animal protection issues and an affiliate of the Humane Society of the United States (\u201cHSUS\u201d), was insured under a liability policy issued by National Union. The insurance was purchased to protect HSUS and its affiliates against the risks of lawsuits and claims made against them. National Union issued a \u201cNot-For-Profit Individual and Organization Insurance Policy\u201d to HSUS, which was in effect from January 7, 2006 through June 8, 2008 (\u201cthe 2007 Policy\u201d). This was a \u201celaims-made-and-reported-policy.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A \u201cClaim\u201d is defined in the policy to mean \u201c(1) a written demand for monetary relief or (2) a civil ... proceeding for monetary ... relief which is commenced by: (i) service of a complaint or similar pleading[.]\u201d \u00b6 2. (b)(1)\u2014(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The \u201cNotice/Claim Reporting Provisions\u201d section under Clause 7 of the insurance policy states \u201c[t]he Insureds shall, as a condition precedent to the obligations of the Insurer under this policy, give written notice to the Insurer of any Claim made against an Insured as soon as practicable and either: (1) anytime during the Policy Year ... or (2) within 30 days after the end of the Policy Year ... as long as such Claim is reported no later than 30 days after the date such claim was first made against an insured.\u201d \u00b6 7.(a)(l)-(2). \u201cA Claim shall be considered to have been first made against an Insured when written notice of such Claim is received by any Insured[.]\u201d \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Further, pursuant to the policy, FFA was responsible for defending itself, and National Union had a duty to advance defense costs. The insured\u2019s right to tender its defense i.e., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>transferring the obligation of the defense, and all costs associated with the insurer terminates if not exercised within 30 days of the date the claim is first made pursuant to Clause 7. \u00b6\u00b6 1 <em>&amp; </em>8. \u201cProvided that the Insureds [including FFA] have complied with the foregoing, the Insurer [National Union] shall be obligated to assume the defense of the Claim ... [o]nce the defense has been so tendered, the Insured [FFA] shall have the right effectively to associate with the Insurer [National Union] in the defense of such Claim, including, but not limited to negotiating a settlement.\u201d \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Although, the coverage dispute relates to both the ESA Case and the RICO Case, we primarily address the Coverage Case in this appeal. The other two cases are relevant because they form the basis as to why National Union believes it was actually prejudiced, enabling it to disclaim coverage under its policy. The ESA Case is a ease in which FFA was the plaintiff and adverse factual findings and a judgment were entered against FFA. Those adverse findings could have been raised against FFA in the RICO Case on grounds of collateral estoppel. National Union had no duty to defend FFA in the ESA Case because National Union provided defense coverage and FFA was acting as a plaintiff in the ESA Case. Therefore, National Union could not have affected the outcome of the ESA proceedings. In the RICO Case, FFA was sued by Feld, a defendant in the ESA Case, for misconduct that allegedly occurred during the prosecution of the ESA Case. In the Coverage Case, FFA sued its insurer, National Union, for failing to provide coverage to it. National Union disclaimed coverage on the grounds that it received late notice of the RICO Case. It further claimed that had National Union known earlier it could have stepped in and \u201cmonitored\u201d or advised FFA in the ESA Case. Intervention, National Union claims, would have prevented the adverse factual findings which prejudiced FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">In the ESA Case, FFA, an organizational plaintiff, along with other organizational plaintiffs and an individual plaintiff, Thomas Rider, sued Ringling Brothers and its owner, Feld. While the ESA Case was pending, Feld brought the RICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Case against FFA and the other organizational plaintiffs for allegedly bribing the individual plaintiff to falsely testify and commit other criminal acts, in order to establish standing to sue Feld. Feld sought to recover damages in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defending the ESA Case. FFA did not notify National Union of the RICO claim until over two years after the claim had been filed. By that time, the court in the ESA Case had ruled in favor of the defendant, Feld, on the ground that the ESA organizational plaintiffs, including FFA, lacked standing. The court also made several factual findings, including that the organizational plaintiffs had paid the individual plaintiff for testimony that was false and that those payments were concealed during discovery. National Union denied coverage on the grounds that FFA failed to provide timely notice. Subsequently, FFA brought the Coverage Case against National Union, which in turn defended on the grounds that it was prejudiced by the late notice. National Union claimed actual prejudice because it believed FFA was precluded, in the RICO Case, from contesting many of the facts found by the court in the ESA Case as those facts undermined any defense FFA might have raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">The ESA Case (Not Covered by the 2007 Policy)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The ESA Case was brought in 2000 in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before the Honorable Emmet G. Sullivan. The ESA Case was not covered by the 2007 Policy because the Policy provided coverage to FFA in defense of claims made against it by another party, not in the case where FFA was the plaintiff. FFA, the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (\u201cASPCA\u201d), the Animal Welfare Institute (\u201cAWI\u201d), and Thomas Rider sued Feld and Ringling Brothers for declaratory and injunc-tive relief, alleging Ringling Brothers\u2019 mistreated Asian elephants in its circus training techniques, violating the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1531 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">The suit was brought under \u00a7 1540(g), the citizen-suit provision of the ESA, which requires standing under the \u201ccase or controversy\u201d provision of Article III of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Constitution, meaning at least one plaintiff must make a showing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-4\">(1) that the plaintiffs have suffered an \u201cinjury in fact\u201d\u2014an invasion of a judicially cognizable interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) that there be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of\u2014the injury must be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court; and (3) that it be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\"><em>Bennett v. Spear, </em>520 U.S. 154, 167, 117 S.Ct. 1154, 1163, 137 L.Ed.2d 281, 298 (1997) (citing <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351, 364 (1992)).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Mr. Rider alleged he was emotionally attached to the elephants because he had worked for Ringling Brothers for two years, tended the elephant barns, worked as a \u201chandler\u201d, and referred to them as his \u201cgirls.\u201d He claimed that he had witnessed their mistreatment by the Ringling Brothers\u2019 employees. Further, he explained that he wished to visit the elephants again and work with them, but could not because he feared he would experience aesthetic and emotional injury from witnessing their scars and behavioral tics.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Feld filed a motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing asserting Mr. Rider did not suffer any cognizable and redressable injury and thus the plaintiffs, including FFA, could not establish standing. The district court granted the motion to dismiss. That decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which reversed and held there was a cognizable and redressa-ble injury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>ASPCA v. Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, </em>317 F.3d 334 (D.C. Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>In August 2007, Feld filed the RICO Case (discussed previously) as a separate action against FFA and the other organizational plaintiffs. While the RICO Case was pending, the ESA Case was tried as a bench trial and lasted for six weeks, from February through March of 2009. In December of 2009, the district court entered judgment in favor of Feld and held that the plaintiffs failed to establish Article III standing. Accordingly, the court determined that it lacked jurisdiction and declined to reach the merits of whether Feld violated the ESA. <em>ASPCA v. Feld Entertainment, Inc., </em>677 F.Supp.2d 55, 91, 97-98 (D.D.C. 2009). The court made findings of fact and rejected Mr. Rider\u2019s testimony, concluding he was \u201cessentially a paid plaintiff and fact witness who is not credible.\u201d 677 F.Supp.2d at 67. The court also found that since March of 2000, Mr. Rider\u2019s sole source of income was coming from payments made by animal rights advocates, including the organizational plaintiffs. 677 F.Supp.2d at 72. It was determined that payments were made directly to him from the law firm representing the plaintiffs, Meyer, Glitzenstein &amp; Crystal (\u201cMGC\u201d) and indirectly from grants from the Wildlife Advocacy Project (\u201cWAP\u201d), a non-profit run by two partners in MGC. 677 F.Supp.2d at 74. The court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\">[T]he primary purpose is to keep Mr. Rider involved with the litigation, because he is the only plaintiff who alleges a personal and emotional attachment to the elephants and an aesthetic injury based on the alleged mistreatment he claims to have witnessed while working for [Feld].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">677 F.Supp.2d at 79. Further, the court determined that the plaintiffs used the United States mail system to make payments. 677 F.Supp.2d at 77. Moreover, those payments \u201cwere not disclosed initially in discovery, by both omissions and affirmatively false statements.\u201d 677 F.Supp,2d at 88. (As discussed below, these findings are all relevant to the RICO Case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>because they form the basis for a violation of the RICO statute, and mail and wire fraud.). On appeal, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s findings. <em>See ASPCA v. Feld, </em>659 F.3d 18 (D.C. Cir. 2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">In March of 2013, Judge Sullivan granted Feld\u2019s motion as a prevailing party for attorneys\u2019 fees (filed in April 2012), under a fee-shifting provision of the ESA. 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 1540(g)(4). He further found that the ESA Case was \u201cmeritless, frivolous, and vexatious\u201d and directed the parties to submit recommendations for further proceedings to determine the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees Feld had incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The RICO Case (Covered by the 2007 Policy)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">As mentioned in the above discussion, during the ESA case, Feld filed the RICO Case in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in August of 2007 as a separate action naming the organizational plaintiffs from the ESA Case, including FFA, as defendants. Feld alleged that the RICO defendants engaged in illegal acts in the ESA Case, including paying Mr. Rider over $100,000 to falsely testify to establish emotional injury from the alleged mistreatment of elephants and attempting to conceal payments that were in the form of bribes, illegal gratuities, mail fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, and obstruction of justice. Feld sought damages in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defending the ESA Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">The complaint and summons in the RICO Case were served on FFA in September 2007. However, National Union was not notified by FFA of the RICO Case when the complaint was served, nor at any time during the 2007 Policy period (before June 8, 2008). In November 2007, Judge Sullivan, in the RICO Case, granted the defendants\u2019 \u201cMotion to Temporarily Stay All Proceedings\u201d pending the resolution of the ESA Case and indicated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-8\">[gjiven that the ESA Action is still ongoing, and because [Feld] has no choice but to continue to defend the ESA suit regardless of the outcome of its RICO claim, [Feld\u2019s] dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>ages [in the form of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in defending the ESA Case] are unascertainable at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADA\"><em>Feld Entertainment, Inc. v. ASPCA, </em>528 F.Supp.2d 1, 4 (D.D.C. 2007). It was not until January 15, 2010 that the court lifted the stay in the RICO Case. This was approximately one month after Feld had prevailed in the ESA Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">On March 1, 2010, Roger Kindler, general counsel for HSUS and its affiliates (including FFA) gave their insurance broker notice of Feld\u2019s amended complaint in the RICO Case. The letter stated HSUS and its affiliates demand coverage under the National Union Policy for the 2010 term year (\u201cthe 2010 Policy\u201d), which was substantially similar to the 2007 Policy (FFA was an \u201cAdditional Insured\u201d on the 2010 Policy as well as the 2007 Policy). The insurance broker forwarded the notice and copy of the amended complaint to National Union. National Union\u2019s claims administrator, Chartis, requested the original complaint in the RICO Case. Mr. Kindler forwarded a copy of the original complaint to Chartis and also notified it that the RICO Case had been stayed by the district court pending the outcome of the ESA Case and that the district court had scheduled mediation for both cases in June.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">On May 26, 2010, Chartis sent a letter to HSUS and FFA disclaiming coverage both under the 2010 and 2007 Policies because the RICO claim was made against FFA in 2007 and notice was not given during the 2007 Policy term (from January 7, 2006 through June 8, 2008). Mr. Kindler responded, on June 16, 2010, and contested the disclaimer. He explained that there was \u201con-going, formal mediation in the District of Columbia involving all parties, that ha[d] the potential of resolving the nest of claims between Feld [ ] and the charities and individuals named in the Amended RICO Complaint\u201d and \u201c[i]f the mediation fails, the parties and their insurance carriers [were] looking forward to, it is safe to say, years of intense litigation and the associated costs. Chartis should not be sitting on the sidelines.\u201d National Union did not respond and chose not to get involved in the RICO Case. FFA hired attorneys, engaged in mediation, filed a motion to dismiss the amended RICO complaint, pursued (unsuccessfully) an inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>locutory appeal from the denial of the motion to dismiss, and was involved in discovery for over six months.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">In March of 2013, Judge Sullivan granted Feld\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees in the ESA Case and directed the parties to submit recommendations for the appropriate amount of fees and to determine whether further proceedings were necessary. In early 2014, FFA and the other organizational defendants in the RICO Case and Feld engaged in settlement negotiations. In May 2014, Feld settled its claim for $15.75 million. In addition, Feld agreed to dismiss, with prejudice, the RICO Case as well as the pending claim for attorneys\u2019 fees in the ESA Case. FFA\u2019s share of the settlement responsibility was approximately $2.54 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">The Coverage Case</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Before Judge Sullivan ruled on Feld\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees in the ESA Case and while the RICO Case was pending, FFA filed suit (\u201cCoverage Case\u201d), from which this appeal stems, against National Union in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County on September 6, 2012. FFA alleged that National Union breached the 2007 Policy by disclaiming coverage in the RICO Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">National Union argued that Virginia law applied, which provided that late notice alone was sufficient to support disclaiming coverage and moved for summary judgment in July of 2014. On December 11, 2014, the court denied the motion and ruled that Maryland law applied. Further, the court explained that under \u00a7 19-110, to disclaim coverage based on late notice of the RICO Case, National Union had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it suffered actual prejudice due to the late notice. <em>See </em>\u00a7 19-110. In addition, because National Union did not present evidence in support of its motion to show that, \u201chad [it] been given earlier notice, it would have joined the ESA trial team and changed the result of that case,\u201d there was a genuine dispute of material fact as to the issue of actual prejudice. National Union\u2019s motion for reconsideration was also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>A four-day jury trial took place beginning on January 12, 2015. FFA presented four witnesses: Michael Markarian, the president of FFA; George Wade, the CFO of HSUS; Roger Kindler, general counsel for HSUS; Roger Zuckerman, a partner at Zuckerman Spaeder, the law firm that represented FFA in the RICO Case. Mr. Markarian testified that FFA did not notify National Union of the RICO Case when it was filed in 2007 because they viewed the suit as an \u201cintimidation tactic.\u201d They \u201cdid not view it as a serious threat\u201d because the RICO Case was stayed almost immediately after the filing. Mr. Kindler testified as to discussions with Mr. Markarian and MGC, the law firm representing the plaintiffs in the ESA case, in 2007. He indicated that when the RICO Case was filed, there was a belief that it was filed as a \u201clitigation tactic\u201d in Feld\u2019s defense of the ESA Case, not as a \u201csubstantive suit.\u201d Moreover, he believed, \u201cyou save your insurance until you need it\u201d and FFA did not need the insurance in 2007. Mr. Zuckerman testified as to the decisions made by the firm in defending and settling the RICO Case. The lawyers believed FFA had a reasonable chance of prevailing, but the potential damages were too great to justify risking trial, and \u201cthe ESA [Cjase ... had virtually no impact on the settlement decision [in the RICO case].\u201d He and others at his firm dedicated a large amount of time to researching collateral estoppel and concluded it would not preclude FFA from litigating facts decided against it in the ESA Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">At the close of FFA\u2019s coverage case, National Union moved for judgment on the grounds that the evidence presented by FFA proved National Union suffered actual prejudice as a matter of law and FFA had failed to prove its damages with reasonable certainty. The court reserved its ruling on the motion until the close of all the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">Next, National Union called its sole witness, Maureen Con-boy, the assistant vice-president for AIG Claims, Inc. (formerly Chartis), and the individual who supervised litigation. Ms. Conboy testified that National Union \u201clost the opportunity to participate in the decision to stay the [RICO Case,] ... to monitor the ESA [Case,] and to try to settle the stayed [RICO <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Case] before Judge Sullivan made his findings in December of 2009 and before Feld incurred another 11 million or so dollars in fees in the ESA [Case] during that period when [National Union] d[id not] know anything about this.\u201d She mentioned that if the notice was timely, National Union could have assigned an attorney to represent FFA in the RICO Case and could have collaborated with FFA lawyers representing FFA in the ESA Case. On cross-examination, Conboy conceded that National Union could not have appointed counsel to represent FFA in the ESA Case. Rather, they could have had panel counsel, a firm chosen by the insurer, enter an appearance in the RICO Case and \u201cmonitor\u201d the ESA Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">At the close of evidence, National Union renewed its motion for judgment and argued it suffered actual prejudice as a matter of law, referencing cases under Maryland law holding that actual prejudice exists as a matter of law when there was no timely notice of the claim until after a verdict or judgment had been entered. National Union argued that here, there was no notice of the RICO Case until after judgment was entered in the ESA Case. Further, National Union contended that it did not matter that the judgment in question was entered in the ESA Case, and not in the RICO Case, because the damages Feld sought in the RICO Case were fees incurred in defending the ESA Case and, under collateral estoppel, Judge Sullivan\u2019s factual findings in the ESA Case were preclusive of relitigation of certain issues. Thus, National Union posited, FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case was substantially impacted by the adverse factual findings made in the ESA Case. FFA responded that National Union waived the collateral estoppel argument by not raising it in its answer and, regardless, the doctrine would not apply to Judge Sullivan\u2019s factual findings in the ESA Case because they were not necessary to the judgment in that case. FFA also noted that because Mr. Zucker-man testified that the firm\u2019s decision to settle the RICO Case was not predicated on a concern about the preclusive effect of findings in the ESA Case, it was a jury question whether the defense of the RICO Case was impaired by the judgment in the ESA Case. Thus, FFA argued that prejudice as a matter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>of law did not exist and under Maryland law the issue had to be submitted to a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">In granting National Union\u2019s motion, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County ruled that the factual findings from the ESA Case\u2014(1) that \u201cRider\u2019s testimony was purchased by [the ESA plaintiffs, including FFA]\u201d; (2) that FFA \u201chad lied in discovery, and/or at the very least concealed evidence of those payments\u201d; and (3) that FFA tried to \u201cdisguise the payments [to Rider] ... as payments for media services\u201d\u2014were \u201cmaterial and relevant to the [standing] issue before [Judge Sullivan in the ESA Case]\u201d and were the basis for the judgment entered in that case. Therefore, the Circuit Court concluded that these facts were \u201cfinally determined\u201d in the ESA Case. FFA had the opportunity to \u201cfully litigate those issues\u201d and thus, collateral estoppel in a trial in the RICO Case would preclude FFA from contesting those same facts and FFA would be bound by them. Those facts would be significantly detrimental to FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case. The Circuit Court further rejected FFA\u2019s argument that collateral estop-pel was waived and concluded, in the alternative, that even if collateral estoppel did not apply in the RICO Case and factual findings in the ESA Case would not be binding on FFA, the findings necessarily would create \u201ca substantial problem in [the RICO Case] for [National Union] ... in terms of evaluating the settlement of [the RICO Case].\u201d The court finally concluded that Judge Sullivan\u2019s findings in the ESA Case would drive up the settlement value of the RICO Case, thereby prejudicing National Union, as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">On March 12, 2015, the Circuit Court for Montgomery County entered judgment in favor of National Union. FFA timely appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. The Court of Special Appeals reversed the judgment of the Circuit Court and remanded the case to the Circuit Court. The intermediate appellate court noted that if FFA had moved for judgment the court would have directed the Circuit Court to enter judgment in favor of FFA on liability. Further, if FFA did move for judgment on remand the trial court should enter judgment in FFA\u2019s favor. The Court of Special Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>In this ease, we hold that when an insured gives late notice and during the period of delay in notification the insured\u2019s defense becomes impaired, to the actual prejudice of the insurer, the insurer may disclaim coverage only if there is a causal link between the late notice and the prejudice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>Fund for Animals, Inc. v.

In other words, the burden is on the insurer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>establish that the breach or failure to give timely notice resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer. In addition, the actual prejudice element requires that the insurer show that the harm to the insurer from the lack of required notice is more than theory or conjecture. Here, National Union was not able to produce sufficient evidence of the impairment of its defense as a result of National Union receiving late notice of the RICO claim. Although the application of collateral estoppel would prejudice National Union, it could not show that it was the <em>late notice </em>of the RICO claim that resulted in actual prejudice because the outcome of the factual findings would not have changed had National Union been notified of the RICO Case earlier. That is so because National Union had no right to intervene in the ESA Case or affect its outcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">National Union\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law, on the issue of actual prejudice, is reviewed under a <em>de novo </em>standard and without deference given to the lower court. <em>District of Columbia v. </em>Singleton, 425 Md. 398, 406-07, 41 A.3d 717, 721-22 (2012); <em>Thomas v.

Furthermore, an application of collateral estoppel \u201cis a legal conclusion that this Court reviews <em>de novo.\u201d Garrity v. Md.

In addition, National Union maintains that FFA\u2019s late notice caused National Union to lose the opportunity to mitigate its risk prior to entry of the adverse ESA judgment, thus, causing National Union actual prejudice. Moreover, according to National Union, collateral estoppel would be applied against FFA in the RICO Case to the detriment of National Union. In addition, National Union maintains that it was not required to plead collateral estoppel as an affirmative defense in the Coverage Case because it was only raising actual prejudice from late notice of the RICO Case as a defense to the breach of the insurance contract. In other words, National Union contends that the doctrine of collateral estoppel was only being used as an argument to support the defense of actual prejudice. Further, National Union asserts that issues of insufficiency of evidence and FFA\u2019s entitlement to judgment as a matter of law were never presented or decided by the Circuit Court. According to National Union, this Court should review whether the Court of Special Appeals abused its discretion in essentially instructing FFA, on remand, to move for judgment on the previous trial record and directing the Circuit Court to grant it. Finally, National Union urges that the case be remanded for a new trial to be tried in accordance with any new standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>FFA, however, contends that the trial court erred as a matter of law in ruling that the evidence conclusively proved actual prejudice. National Union failed to show that prejudice resulted from FFA\u2019s untimely notice to National Union of the RICO Case. According to FFA, the uncontradicted evidence at trial was that judgment in the ESA Case \u201chad a negligible effect on [FFA\u2019s] decision to settle the RICO Case.\u201d Moreover, FFA maintains that any prejudice to its defense in the RICO Case based on allegedly binding adverse findings from the ESA Case was hypothetical. Further, according to FFA, National Union waived collateral estoppel by not raising it in its answer as required by Md. Rule 2-823(g)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">Actual Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">According to Maryland law, an insurer providing a liability insurance policy may disclaim coverage if an insured breached the policy by giving late notice of a claim and establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that late notice resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-6\">An insurer may disclaim coverage on a liability insurance policy on the ground that the insured or a person claiming the benefits of the policy through the insured has breached the policy by failing to cooperate with the insurer or by not giving the insurer required notice only if the insurer establishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the lack of cooperation or notice has resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Ins.

We have also rejected a but-for approach, which would allow a finding of actual prejudice if but for the insured\u2019s breach there was a substantial likelihood the results at trial would have been different. <em>Id. </em>The breach nonetheless must result in actual prejudice. A but-for analysis would require that no prejudice would result in the absence of a breach; however, the \u201cresults in actual prejudice\u201d element simply means that actual prejudice came about because of, or as a consequence of, the breach.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The actual prejudice element requires that the harm be more than possible, theoretical, hypothetical, speculative, or conjectural. This Court has found actual prejudice in instances where the insured\u2019s breach has: precluded the insurer from establishing a legitimate jury issue or presenting potentially outcome-determinative evidence, <em>Allstate Ins.

In defending itself, National Union had the burden to prove that late notice of the claim resulted in actual prejudice. In order for National Union to obtain a judgment as a matter of law on the defense of actual prejudice, the evidence, viewed most favorably to FFA, had to compel the conclusion that actual harm to National Union resulted from the delay in receiving notice of the RICO claim and that no reasonable jury could find otherwise. <em>Cf. Willis v. Ford, </em>211 Md.App. 708, 716, 66 A.3d 112, 116 (2013) (to obtain judgment as a matter of law on defense of contributory negligence, defendant \u201cwas required to show that there was no evidence from which the jury could find\u201d that the plaintiffs acted reasonably); <em>Lindenberg v.

It is only when the facts and circumstances only permit one inference with regard to the issue presented, that the issue is one of law for the court and not one of fact for the jury.

Ms. Conboy, on behalf of National Union, testified regarding what National Union might have done differently if it had been given earlier notice by FFA. National Union argues that it would have appointed its own panel attorney to defend FFA in the RICO Case; monitored the ESA Case; participated in the decision to stay the RICO Case; and tried to settle the RICO Case before Judge Sullivan made his factual findings in December of 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">We agree with FFA\u2019s response to this possible or hypothetical prejudice. Ms. Conboy acknowledged that the most counsel could have done in the ESA Case was to monitor it and keep National Union \u201capprised of what was happening in the ESA Case so that [it] would ... know if anything ... potentially bad was going to happen that would affect the [RICO Case].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>FFA points out that National Union\u2019s counsel could not have controlled prosecution of the ESA Case nor could it have intervened. Even if National Union had received earlier notice, its involvement in the ESA Case would have been speculative because its involvement would have been dependent upon FFA\u2019s consent. Because National Union argues it suffered prejudice based on an inability to participate in litigation in which it had no actual <em>right </em>to participate, any prejudice caused by the late notice is conjectural. Moreover, prejudice in the form of an inability to participate in litigation is not a result of late notice, it is the result of not having any right to participate in that litigation at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Furthermore, by August of 2007, the point at which National Union expected to have received notice of the RICO claim, the direction of the ESA Case was well established and it was apparent that the organizational plaintiffs had been paying Rider since 2001. Additionally, the plaintiffs had already provided discovery responses that Judge Sullivan later found to be incomplete and misleading. Moreover, there is no evidence that by appointing a panel attorney to monitor the ESA Case, National Union would have in any way impacted the outcome of that Case. Similarly, there is no evidence that had National Union appointed counsel for FFA in the RICO Case in 2007, that the case would not have been stayed and decided before the ESA Case. This is because the allegations in the RICO Case were premised on the findings entered against FFA in the ESA Case and the damages were fees incurred and continued to be incurred in the ESA Case. Judge Sullivan, who presided in both cases, found that the decision in the RICO Case had to await the outcome of the ESA Case. Lastly, there was no evidence that had National Union been notified in 2007 rather than 2010, the RICO Case would have settled or for a sum less than the actual settlement in 2014. There is no legitimate reason advanced as to why Feld would have wanted to settle the RICO Case while the ESA Case was pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">National Union analogizes this case to <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>and <em>Kemper. See Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 162, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>879 A.2d at 98; <em>Washington v. Federal Kemper Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. at 288, 482 A.2d at 503. However, the insurer\u2019s right to participate in a claim distinguishes the case <em>sub judice </em>from those cases. In those cases, the insured failed to notify the insurer of a claim until after that claim had gone to trial and a judgment had been entered against the insured. <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 190, 879 A.2d at 81; <em>Fed. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. at 290-91, 482 A.2d at 504. Further, in those cases, if notice had been timely, the insurer could have involved itself in the litigation by appointing counsel, investigating the claim, directing the defense, and even settling the claim as the insurance policy allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">In the <em>Kemper </em>case, the insurer was found to be actually prejudiced as a matter of law when the insured did not give its insurer notice of a contract and tort lawsuit brought against it. <em>Fed. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. at 294, 482 A.2d at 506. Kemper, the insurer, was not notified until after the case had been tried by a jury, the court had entered a directed verdict against the insured on one count, and the jury had found against it on two other counts. <em>Fed. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. at 290-91, 482 A.2d at 504. The Court of Special Appeals in Kemper held that \u201cKemper\u2019s rights to investigate, evaluate coverage, choose defense counsel, and attempt to settle were substantial rights which were denied by the [insured\u2019s] conduct in this case which resulted in substantial actual prejudice to the [insurer].\u201d <em>Fed. Kemper Ins. Co., </em>60 Md.App. at 294, 482 A.2d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Similarly, in <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>notice of the claim was not given until after judgment was entered on the claim. That case involved a police brutality claim against Prince George\u2019s County and three Prince George\u2019s County police officers. <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 167-68, 879 A.2d at 84-85. The Trust, the excess insurer for Prince George\u2019s County, denied coverage because the County failed to inform it of the incident, claim, and lawsuit until after the trial. The jury awarded the injured party damages of over $4.1 million. The County paid the judgment. \u201cAt no point prior to the jury verdict did the County notify the Trust of the incident involv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ing the officers and [Mr.] McCollum or of [Mr.] McCollum\u2019s suit against the County and its officers. On April 13, 2000, ten days after the jury returned its verdict, the County first wrote to the Trust, [and] informed the Trust of the judgment[.]\u201d <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 167-68, 879 A.2d at 84-85. This Court held that the untimely notice effectively nullified the insurer\u2019s contractual rights to \u201cparticipate[ ] in trial preparation, propose[ ] trial strategies, and encourage[ ] settlement.\u201d <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 193, 879 A.2d at 100. \u201cIndeed, the Trust had no opportunity to participate in the investigation, settlement, or defense before the verdict was issued.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(holding that the insurer was prejudiced under the common law, rather than \u00a7 19-110 because the Trust was technically an insurance pool and, consequently, did not meet the definition of an \u201cinsurer\u201d under \u00a7 1-101). We said, \u201c[t]he delay vitiates the purpose of the contractual notice requirement, as the insurer cannot exercise any of its rights to investigate, defend, control, or settle the suit. Accordingly, courts have held that the insurer is prejudiced as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 190, 879 A.2d at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">Unlike the case at bar, in <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>and <em>Kemper, </em>the late notice resulted in actual prejudice because it eliminated the insurer\u2019s right to control or participate in litigation against its insured and to resolve the claim or employ a more effective strategy. Thus, the actual prejudice in <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust </em>and in <em>Kemper </em>was that the late notice resulted in the impairment of <em>actual rights </em>held by the insurers with respect to the litigation. Here, National Union never had a right to participate in any part of the litigation in the ESA Case because that case involved FFA acting as a plaintiff to sue Feld; FFA was not seeking defense coverage from National Union in the ESA Case. Thus, having no actual right to involvement in the ESA Case, National Union did not suffer any <em>actual </em>prejudice. Although National Union contends that in addition to appointing panel counsel, it could also have advised FFA, the harm resulting from its inability to do so is merely hypothetical. Nothing bound FFA to abide by or to even entertain National Union\u2019s advice. Moreover, National <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Union was aware of the RICO Case less than two months after the stay was lifted and before the merits of that case had been reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">This Court, in <em>Home Indemnity Co. v. Walker, </em>found no actual prejudice existed in that case. 260 Md. 684, 685, 278 A.2d 429, 429 (1971). The insured notified the insurer that she was involved in an automobile accident. <em>Walker, </em>260 Md. at 685, 273 A.2d at 429. The insurer unsuccessfully attempted to settle the case with the plaintiffs lawyer which led to the plaintiff filing suit. <em>Id. </em>During this time, the insured moved to California without notifying the plaintiff. <em>Walker, </em>260 Md. at 686, 273 A.2d at 430. The plaintiff was eventually able to locate the insured, serve her, and obtain a default judgment. <em>Id. </em>When the plaintiff presented the default judgment to the insurer, the insurer refused to pay the money judgment and claimed actual prejudice based on \u201cthe fact that it received written notice of the filing of the suit \u2018after it was too late to do anything about it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Walker, </em>260 Md. at 687, 273 A.2d at 431. This Court held that the insured\u2019s failure to notify did not deprive the insurer of all opportunity to settle, even after default judgement. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, in the instant case, National Union had the opportunity to get involved in mediation and settlement in the RICO Case but declined. Further, we held in <em>Walker </em>that the insurer was not actually prejudiced despite the plaintiffs pointing out to the insurer that they could use the default judgment as leverage in settlement negotiations. <em>Walker, </em>260 Md. at 687, 273 A.2d at 430 (The comment \u201cI am sure you would like time to re-examine your file, etc. and possibly to increase your offer for an out-of-court settlement\u201d was stated by the plaintiffs in a letter to the insurer.). Here, there is an even weaker argument for finding actual prejudice as Feld never suggested or took the position that the findings from the ESA Case had increased the settlement value of the RICO Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">In <em>Allstate, </em>this Court held that the automobile liability insurer was actually prejudiced when the insured breached the cooperation clause of the insurance policy by refusing to attend depositions, respond to interrogatories and demands <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>for documents, and attend trial. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. at 128, 767 A.2d at 843. The insured\u2019s actions precluded the insurer from presenting evidence that the insured was driving at a normal speed, concerned about ice, and had hazard lights on at the time of the accident. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. at 129, 767 A.2d at 844. If this evidence had been presented a jury could have reasonably found no negligence by the insured in the operation of the vehicle. <em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. at 116, 767 A.2d at 837.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-6\">The prejudice was not in terms of how the jury would actually have viewed this evidence, whether the jury would have found it believable or not believable, for that is purely a matter of speculation. The prejudice lies in the fact that there was a credible defense to be presented and that Kirby\u2019s non-cooperation precluded State Farm from even presenting that defense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b492-7\"><em>Allstate Ins. Co., </em>363 Md. at 129-30, 767 A.2d at 844. Though there was also a breach of the insurance contract when FFA did not provide timely notice, unlike in <em>Allstate, </em>there was no lost opportunity to present evidence resulting in actual prejudice to National Union. Although the findings in the ESA Case would naturally affect the outcome in the RICO Case because they would establish a violation of the RICO Act and constitute mail and wire fraud, National Union was not affected in its right to investigate, settle, or defend the RICO claim. This is so because National Union could not have intervened in, impacted, or influenced the outcome of the ESA Case. The ESA Case was a completely separate action, which did not involve National Union. National Union had no duty to defend where its insured was suing another party. National Union only had the right to be involved in the RICO Case, as that case involved its insured, FFA, defending claims brought against it. Moreover, National Union was notified shortly after the stay was lifted in the RICO Case, before mediation, settlement or a trial in the RICO Case had taken place.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Maryland law requires proof of actual prejudice to avoid policy holder forfeiture and insurance company windfall. <em>Local Gov\u2019t Ins. Trust, </em>388 Md. at 185-86, 879 A.2d at 95. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>lack of a connection or link between the alleged actual prejudice and delayed notice, and the notion that an insurer can hang its disclaimer on any developments that occurred before notice was given, regardless of whether the earlier notice would have made a difference in the outcome of the case, is inconsistent with \u00a7 19-110.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">We hold that an insurer must show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the insured\u2019s delay in giving notice resulted in actual prejudice to the insurer in order to disclaim coverage under \u00a7 19-110. National Union could not show, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the late notice resulted in actual prejudice in order to disclaim coverage. National Union argued it was actually prejudiced because it believed FFA was precluded in the RICO Case from contesting many of the facts found by the court in the ESA Case, as those facts undermined any defense FFA might have raised. Although FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case <em>may </em>have been hindered by the adverse findings from the ESA Case, this alleged prejudice was not attributable to the late notice FFA gave to National Union concerning the RICO Case. The ESA case did not involve National Union and it could not have intervened in, impacted, or affected the ESA findings. Prejudice in the form of National Union\u2019s inability to do anything it might have done had it received earlier notice is entirely speculative. Moreover, National Union\u2019s inability to participate in the ESA Case was not the result of <em>late notice, </em>but rather, was the result of lacking any <em>right </em>to participate in the case. Further, National Union was informed by FFA of the RICO Case almost immediately after the stay in the RICO Case was lifted and before mediation, settlement, or the merits of the case had been reached. Therefore, National Union was not prejudiced in investigating, settling, or defending the RICO Case as a result of it receiving late notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Collateral Estoppel</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\u201cThe doctrine of collateral estoppel precludes a party from re-litigating a factual issue that was essential to a valid and final judgment against the same party in a prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>action.\u201d <em>Shader v.

Lingo, </em>249 Md. 33, 39, 238 A.2d 100, 104 (1968)).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-9\">In addition, collateral estoppel as a defense to a claim is an affirmative defense and must be raised in a party\u2019s answer. Md. Rule 2-323(g)(4). The defense is waived if it is not raised properly. Md. Rule 2-323(a). The Court of Special Appeals agreed with National Union that FFA\u2019s waiver argument, that National Union did not specifically raise collateral estoppel as a defense in the Coverage Case, was meritless. National Union\u2019s defense to the breach of the insurance contract claim was that it could disclaim coverage due to actual prejudice resulting from FFA\u2019s breach of the 2007 Policy by providing late notice of the RICO Case. National Union claimed that by the time it had notice of the RICO Case, in 2010, Judge Sullivan had already made findings of fact detrimental to FFA in the ESA Case. And, moreover, National Union contends, in the RICO Case, Feld could have raised collateral estoppel offensively to preclude FFA from contesting the court\u2019s factual findings. Therefore, according to National Union, it was not defending the breach of the insurance contract claim against it on the ground of collateral estoppel, rather it was asserting actual prejudice. National Union pointed out that Feld could have asserted the doctrine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>of collateral estoppel in the RICO Case and that would have prejudiced FFA\u2019s defense and therefore ultimately prejudiced National Union. National Union contends it was not required to plead collateral estoppel as an affirmative defense in its answer in the Coverage Case because it was not raising the doctrine as a defense, rather it was asserting the doctrine to demonstrate actual prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">The Circuit Court found that Judge Sullivan, in the RICO Case, would have likely precluded FFA from re-litigating factual findings made in the ESA Case. The findings in the ESA Case were that \u201cRider [was] essentially a paid plaintiff,]\u201d the organizational plaintiffs used the United States mail system to make payments, and the payments \u201cwere not disclosed initially in discovery, by both omissions and affirmatively false statements.\u201d <em>Feld Entm\u2019t, Inc., </em>677 F.Supp.2d at 67, 77, 83. Further, the Circuit Court reasoned that findings in the ESA Case were related to the same issues that formed the basis for Feld\u2019s RICO, conspiracy, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution claims; hence, the issues were fully litigated. The court noted that Judge Sullivan made findings regarding those issues (which he knew overlapped issues pending in the RICO Case). In addition, the Circuit Court noted that FFA had the opportunity and did contest those issues, thus, it would conserve judicial resources to preclude relitigation of identical factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">In our view, under the collateral estoppel doctrine, in the RICO Case, FFA could have been precluded from contesting those same prejudicial facts and would have been bound by them. Moreover, those facts could have been significantly detrimental to FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case. Alternatively, even if collateral estoppel did not apply and the factual findings in the ESA Case were not binding on FFA in the RICO Case, as the Circuit Court pointed out, the findings had the potential to create prejudice in terms of evaluating the settlement of the RICO Case and could drive up the settlement value.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>Assuming <em>arguendo </em>that collateral estoppel would have prejudiced the RICO Case due to the adverse factual findings made in the ESA Case\u2014that FFA paid Mr. Rider for testimony, concealed those payments, and used the United States mail system\u2014it could certainly have hindered FFA\u2019s defense in the RICO Case or driven up the amount of the settlement demand. However, as we discussed, National Union could not establish in the Coverage Case that <em>late notice </em>of the claims resulted in <em>actual </em>prejudice because National Union had no right to involvement in the ESA Case. At best, National Union could have \u201cmonitored\u201d that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">Instruction on Remand</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The Court of Special Appeals noted that if FFA had moved for judgment in the Coverage Case, the court would have directed the Circuit Court to enter judgment in favor of FFA on liability. Further, if FFA did move for judgment on remand the trial court should enter judgment in FFA\u2019s favor; however, the determination of damages was not before the intermediate appellate court and that issue would have to be decided on remand. We hold that the Court of Special Appeals did not exceed its authority and abuse its discretion, by instructing the trial court on remand to permit the filing and granting of a belated motion for judgment, even though such a motion was never filed at the time of trial, <em>Ray v. State, </em>206 Md.App. 309, 337 n.13, 47 A.3d 1113, 1128 n,13 (2012), <em>aff'd, </em>435 Md. 1, 76 A.3d 1143 (2013) (to be preserved, \u201can issue simply needs to be \u2018raised in or decided by the trial court,\u2019 regardless of which party raises the issue\u201d); Md. Rule 2-501 (f) (noting that the court \u201cshall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party\u201d). National Union could not have satisfied its burden under \u00a7 19-110 and therefore judgment should not have been granted in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">In addition, Md. Rule 8-131(a) grants the appellate courts of this State discretion to review any unpreserved issue. <em>Jones, </em>379 Md. at 715, 843 A.2d at 784-85.
