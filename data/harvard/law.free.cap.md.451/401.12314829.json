Kor-Ko, Ltd. (Kor-Ko), the principal Petitioner in the present case,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> seeks to overturn the Maryland Department of the Environment\u2019s (MDE) grant of a construction permit to Maryland Crematory, LLC (MC), to operate a crematorium in the same commercial/industrial park building in Millersville, Maryland, containing Kor-Ko\u2019s business operations.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">MC submitted in 2011 a permit application to the MDE for the construction of a human remains crematory incinerator at 408 Headquarters Drive, Suite 10, Millersville, Maryland 21108. The air emissions from the incineration of human remains may produce a panoply of toxic pollutants, including, among other contaminants, arsenic, chromium, dioxins, and mercury. On 27 October 2011, the MDE notified MC that its original application submission failed to quantify the crematory\u2019s future toxic output or show that the emissions \u201cwill not unreasonably endanger public health,\u201d pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR) 26.11.15.04 and 26.11.15.06. The MDE allowed MC 90 days to supplement its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">MC submitted a Toxic Air Pollutant Analysis on 7 December 2011, but the MDE found the supplemented application deficient, as memorialized in a letter to MC dated 27 December 2011. MC re-supplemented its application in January and February of 2012 with additional information, but, again, the MDE notified MC that its application remained lacking. On 21 March 2012, however, the MDE pivoted somewhat. In a letter to MC, the MDE concluded that MC \u201cprovided an overall sufficient toxics analysis within the 90 day requirement.[<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>] The 90 day clock is stopped[,]\u201d but that some details of the application \u201cstill need[ed] to be addressed[.]\u201d In a follow-up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>document, the MDE explained that, despite MC\u2019s application remaining \u201cinadequate with regards to dioxin and furan emissions,\u201d the MDE \u201cwas ultimately able to resolve this ... inadequacy of the compliance demonstration\u201d by performing its own calculations as to the quantitative and qualitative models for these toxins.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">The MDE reached and published a Tentative Determination, on 9 August 2012, to issue the permit because the agency expected the crematory would meet the relevant air quality requirements. Following an advertised legislative-style public hearing held by the MDE on 6 September 2012, opponents of the proposed issuance of the permit (including Petitioners) submitted, on 13 November 2012, supplemental written comments.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Combining hypothetical toxin dispersion and concentration data with information from an EPA database about the specific contaminants emitted by human remains incinerators, the MDE compared (in a modeling exercise) the maximum concentrations of MC\u2019s anticipated pollutants with screening levels determined safe for human exposure. The MDE\u2019s screening process found that the predicted pollutant concentrations, modeled at ground level at the boundary of the commercial park in which MC proposed to locate its business, would not endanger unreasonably human health. URS Corp., a consultant hired by opponents of the proposed permit action, calculated independently that the anticipated pollutants\u2019 dispersal and concentration levels, measured at the rooftop air handlers height of MC\u2019s building (in which Kor-Ko was an existing tenant) within the commercial park, several pollutants, particularly arsenic and mercury, would reach concentrations that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>exceed the MDE\u2019s threshold levels for safety for human health.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Effective 24 July 2013, the MDE issued the construction permit, together with its Final Determination and responses to some of the previously received public comments, including the URS report.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On 16 August 2013, Kor-Ko and other parties to the agency proceedings sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County of the MDE\u2019s Final Determination to issue the permit. In an order entered on 26 September 2014, the court remanded the matter to the MDE to analyze specifically MC\u2019s potential emissions\u2019 toxicity to people in adjacent buildings in the office park that use rooftop air handlers. On the MDE\u2019s direct appeal, the Court of Special Appeals reversed, in an unreported opinion, remanding the case to the circuit court with instructions to affirm the MDE\u2019s issuance of the permit. Kor-Ko filed electronically, on 21 April 2016, its petition for writ of certiorari.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> On 23 June 2016, we granted Kor-Ko\u2019s petition to consider potentially the following questions, as formulated by Kor-Ko:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">The overriding question presented in this action for judicial review is whether MDE erred by issuing a permit to a facility that will unreasonably endanger human health. <em>See </em>COMAR \u00a7 26.11.15.06.

Did MDE err by concluding that its \u201cair toxics regulations do not apply\u201d anywhere within the entire commercial park?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeJ\">3. Did MDE, having reached an erroneous conclusion on those two questions, err by not evaluating whether emissions of toxic air pollutants will unreasonably endanger the health of the neighboring tenants, including Petitioners?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">\u201cWhen this or any appellate court reviews the final decision of an administrative agency ..., the court looks through the circuit court\u2019s and intermediate appellate court\u2019s decisions, although applying the same standards of review, and evaluates the decision of the agency.\u201d <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty. v. Surina, </em>400 Md. 662, 681, 929 A.2d 899, 910 (2007) (citing <em>Mastandrea v. North, </em>361 Md. 107, 133, 760 A.2d 677, 691 (2000)). Our analysis, therefore, focuses squarely on the MDE\u2019s decision to issue the contested construction permit. Our review is limited generally to the administrative record. Md. Code, Environment Art. (EN), \u00a7 1\u2014601(d) (2013 Repl. Vol.).</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">The applicable level of judicial scrutiny depends often on the nature of the agency\u2019s process and/or action, e.g., quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative. On one hand, this Court described agency processes or actions as quasi-judicial when:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AXB\">\u201c(1) the act or decision is reached on individual, as opposed to general, grounds, and scrutinizes a single property ... and (2) there is a deliberative fact-finding process with testimony and the weighing of evidence.\u201d Normally, that requires a contested case hearing, so that evidence (as opposed to informal statements of general beliefs) may be presented, challenged, and analyzed, in order that reasonable credibility determinations can be made.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-8\"><em>Md. Bd. of Pub. Works v. K Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons at Kent Island LLC, </em>425 Md. 482, 515, 42 A.3d 40, 59 (2012) (quoting <em>Md. Overpak Corp. v. Mayor and City Council of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number><em>Baltimore, </em>395 Md. 16, 33, 909 A.2d 235, 245 (2006)). On the other hand, an agency process or action is seen as quasi-legislative when \u201c \u2018the [action] is one making a new law\u2014an enactment of general application prescribing a new plan or policy[, as opposed to] one which merely looks to or facilitates the administration, execution, or implementation of a law already in force and effect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons, </em>425 Md. at 514, 42 A.3d at 59 (quoting <em>City of Bowie v.

Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s Cnty., </em>258 Md. 454, 463, 267 A.2d 172, 177 (1970)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The MDE\u2019s issuance of the construction permit to MC appears facially to fall in-between our recognized indicia distinguishing adjudicative from legislative agency processes or actions. By issuing the permit, the MDE affected directly the rights and responsibilities of the applicant, MC, not crematorium operators at-large. The State environmental statute, however, forbids contested hearings in this kind of permit application process,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> although the MDE\u2019s procedures did involve, for example, fact-intensive consideration of scientific information'\u2014the computer modeling of the dispersion and concentration of toxins from the crematory, the assumptions and conclusions of which could be, and were, contested via the submission of opposing public comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">In 2016, this Court applied the standards of appellate review for quasi-judicial decisions to a permit decision by the MDE in a scenario governed by the same permitting statute involved in the present case:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> \u201c[although this statute does not set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>a standard of review, the substantial evidence and arbitrary and capricious standards apply where an \u2018organic statute\u2019 authorizes judicial review without a contested case hearing and does not set forth a standard of review.\u201d <em>Md. Dep\u2019t of Env\u2019t v. Anacostia Riverkeeper, </em>447 Md. 88, 118, 134 A.3d 892, 910 (2016), <em>reconsideration denied </em>(May 20, 2016) (citing <em>Supervisor of Assessments of Carroll Cnty. v.

With respect to the findings of fact, judicial review is highly deferential. With respect to determining legal error, it is much less so.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-4\"><em>Hovnanian\u2019s Four Seasons, </em>425 Md. at 514, 42 A.3d at 58 n.15 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">This standard requires our review to be \u201cnarrow and highly deferential\u201d with respect to administrative fact-finding. <em>Trinity Assembly of God of Baltimore City, Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore Cnty., </em>407 Md. 53, 78, 962 A.2d 404, 418 (2008). \u201cAn agency decision based on regulatory and statutory interpretation is a conclusion of law. Even when reviewing an agency\u2019s legal conclusions, an appellate court must respect the agency\u2019s expertise in its field. When an agency interprets its own regulations or the statute the agency was created to administer, we are especially mindful of that agency\u2019s expertise in its field.\u201d <em>Carven v. State Ret. &amp; Pension Sys. of Md., </em>416 Md. 389, 406, 7 A.3d 38, 49 (2010) (citations and quotation marks omitted). Compared with a question of statutory interpretation, \u201c[w]hen the construction of an administrative regulation rather than a statute is in issue, deference is even more clearly in order.\u201d <em>Md. Transp. Auth. v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288, 799 A.2d 1246, 1254 (2002) (citations and quotation marks omitted). We grant such deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation of its regulations because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-j\">agency rules are designed to serve the specific needs of the agency, are promulgated by the agency, and are utilized on a day-to-day basis by the agency. A question concerning the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule is as central to its operation as an interpretation of the agency\u2019s governing statute. Because an agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation, the agency\u2019s expertise is more pertinent to the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule than to the interpretation of its governing statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><em>King, </em>369 Md. at 289, 799 A.2d at 1254 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Put another way, the courts do not play the role of an \u00fcber administrative agency in reviewing the actions of state or local administrative bodies, but, rather we exercise discipline in our review so as not to cross the separation of powers boundary.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">Prior to building a human remains incinerator or other similarly-regulated source of air pollution, an applicant must obtain a construction permit from the MDE. COMAR 26.11.02.02B. Pursuant to COMAR 26.11.15 and 26.11.16, the MDE regulates Toxic Air Pollutants (TAPs) and provides related procedural requirements to prevent unreasonable danger to human health, among other objectives. COMAR 26.11.15.06, Ambient Impact Requirement, subsection A(l), reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-7\">A. Requirements for New Installations, Sources, or Premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b443-8\">(1) Except as provided in \u00a7 A(2) of this regulation, a person may not construct, modify, or operate, or cause to be constructed, modified, or operated, any new installation or source without first demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department using procedures established in this chapter that total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">Permit applicants may satisfy this requirement by exemption, COMAR 26.11.15.03B(4) (not applicable in the present case), or by demonstrating compliance via \u201ca screening analysis or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>second tier analysis,\u201d COMAR 26.11.15.07B(1), explained in COMAR 26.11.16.02 as a process of predicting the toxic and carcinogenic effects of the TAPs to be emitted by the source the applicant seeks to construct and operate.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">In its Brief, the MDE describes its screening and modeling process as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b444-5\">Under this approach, the Department sets the screening levels conservatively to ensure that the emissions will not unreasonably [en]danger human health. More specifically, to establish the screening level for a particular pollutant, the Department usually takes a value that measures \u201cthe airborne concentrations of a substance ... representing] conditions to which nearly all workers may be exposed without adverse health effects,\u201d COMAR \u00a7 26.11.15.01B(18), and then further divides that already safe value by 100. COMAR \u00a7 26.11.16.03A(1). The applicant then uses an air-dispersion computer model approved by the Department to determine whether the ground level concentrations of the predicted emissions for each pollutant will be below the relevant screening level at different distances away from the crematory. COMAR \u00a7 26,11.16.02C(l)(a). The most conservative air-dispersion model, which was the model used in this case, is called SCREEN3.... If the projected emissions from the crematory do not exceed the screening levels, the permit applicant has complied with the ambient impact require-ment.[<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b445-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>Kor-Ko argues that, by relying on toxin concentrations modeled at the boundary of the commercial park at ground level, but not within the commercial park (of which MC\u2019s and Kor-Ko\u2019s shared building is a part) at the level of rooftop air handlers, the MDE misinterpreted and misapplied unlawfully its own regulations\u2019 terms \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cambient air,\u201d rendering thereby its permit issuance unsupported by substantial evidence, legally erroneous in substance and procedure, and arbitrary and capricious. The MDE answers that it interpreted and applied properly the terms \u201cpremises\u201d and \u201cambient air,\u201d and that, in the event we were to agree with Kor-Ko, we should remand the proceedings to the MDE, rather than invalidate the permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">I. The MDE Interpreted \u201cPremises\u201d Permissibly As a Matter of Law and Applied It Without Apparent Arbitrariness or Capriciousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Kor-Ko argues that the \u201cpremises\u201d in question comprises the building in which the crematory is to be located, not the area at and inside the boundary of the entire commercial park of which the building is a part, and that, accordingly, modeling the output of toxins in the air emissions from the crematory vent at the boundary of the entire office/industrial complex was insufficient to protect the health of the tenants and employees within the buildings of the commercial park. The MDE answers that the regulatory definition and agency interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d renders the boundary of the commercial park the proper locus for modeling, and that its screening levels applied at that point are conservative enough, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>if met, to protect people inside the complex as well from unreasonable danger to their health.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">COMAE 26.11.15.06A(1), Ambient Impact Requirement, Requirements for New Installations, Sources, or Premises, states that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-5\">a person may not construct, modify, or operate, or cause to be constructed, modified, or operated, any new installation or source without first demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department using procedures established in this chapter that total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health,</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACb\">(emphasis added). As discussed <em>supra, </em>an applicant\u2019s regulatory compliance may be demonstrated by modeling the dispersion and concentration of toxins: \u201c[e]missions shall be quantified in sufficient detail to determine whether the premises complies with the requirements of the chapter.\u201d COMAR 26.11.15.04A(2) (emphasis added). \u201c \u2018Premises\u2019 means all the installations or other sources that are located on contiguous or adjacent properties and that are under the control of one person or under common control of a group of persons.\u201d COMAR 26.11.15.01B(12), COMAR 26.11.01.01B(86).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">MDE review of a permit application, therefore, requires the modeling of toxin concentrations at the boundary of the applicant\u2019s \u201cpremises.\u201d Thus, our review of the MDE\u2019s permit issuance implicates the task of regulatory interpretation. <em>\u201c </em>\u2018[T]he interpretation of an agency rule is governed by the same principles that govern the interpretation of a statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Carven, </em>416 Md. at 407, 7 A.3d at 49 (quoting <em>Miller v.

The use in these regulations of the term \u201cpremises\u201d lends a whiff of reasonableness to the MDE\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>\u2019<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b450-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>Third, and of greatest potency here, the MDE argues that its interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d protects adequately the health of the tenants and employees in the MC/Kor-Ko building and other buildings in the commercial development. For noncancerous toxins, the MDE\u2019s screening levels are set conservatively at l/100th of their \u201cthreshold limit value\u201d (TLV). CO-MAR 26.11.16.03A(1). The TLV of a given toxin is \u201cthe airborne concentration of a substance that, according to the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), represents conditions to which nearly all workers may be exposed without adverse effect[.]\u201d COMAR 26.11.15.01B(18). Additionally, similarly conservative formulae are provided to screen non-cancerous toxins that do not have a TLV. COMAR 26.11.16.03A(2). For carcinogenic effects, the MDE uses screening levels standardized to the following rubric: if a person were exposed to a toxin continuously for 70 years, it would increase the person\u2019s cancer risk by one in 100,000. COMAR 26.11.16.03B(1). The MDE believes that such conservative screening requirements prevent MC\u2019s future emissions from endangering unreasonably human health\u2014not only the health of humans beyond the commercial park, but also that of people working within the commercial complex.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Because we are reviewing the MDE\u2019s interpretation of its own regulations, \u201cwe are especially mindful of that agency\u2019s expertise in its field.\u201d <em>Carven v. State Ret. &amp; Pension Sys. of Md., </em>416 Md. 389, 406, 7 A.3d 38, 49 (2010). Accordingly, we defer to the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d and conclude that it is permissible legally, and neither arbitrary nor capricious, as applied via the MDE\u2019s decision to rely on the modeling and screening of toxin concentrations at the bound<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>ary of the commercial park on the ground, rather than requiring modeling at the rooftops of any building within the complex.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">II. We Need Not Address Directly the MDE\u2019s Interpretation of \u201cAmbient Air,\u201d but We Shall Comment on the Question for the Collateral Purpose to Guide Future Agency Proceedings, Their Judicial Review, and the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Because, in holding that the MDE interpreted permissibly \u201cpremises,\u201d we defer to the MDE\u2019s expert opinion that its use of conservative screening values for toxins at the boundary of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>the commercial park protected adequately human health <em>inside the park, </em>we need not resolve the \u201cambient air\u201d interpretation dispute,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> which addresses the same \u201coverriding question\u201d presented by Kor-Ko: \u201cwhether MDE erred by issuing a permit to a facility that will unreasonably endanger human health.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">To guide perhaps future similar administrative proceedings, instances of their judicial review, and ideally the Legislature, however, we choose to comment on the portentous challenge inherent in the review of the sort of relatively nebulous agency procedure as we have here, which prohibits contested hearings and fails to require more formal and comprehensive explication of the reasoning of the agency for its Final Determination in these types of environmental permitting cases (beyond the \u201cbrief explanation\u201d contained in the Tentative Determination, \u201cfact sheet or sheets,\u201d and the selective instances of agency responses prompted by some of the public comments).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AOs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>The MDE argues that, because it now embraces the EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cambient air,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> it would be precluded from modeling toxins at the rooftop level of the air handlers because doing so would be tantamount to modeling indoor air, an action the MDE concludes is beyond its jurisdiction. The record includes the MDE\u2019s express rejection, however, in response to a public comment received regarding the Tentative Determination, of the referenced EPA definition as not governing, controlling, or even applying to the MDE\u2019s ambient air regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqO\">The Maryland air toxics regulations under COMAR 26.11.15 and 26.11.16 have never been incorporated into the Maryland State Implementation Program (SIP), and are not subject to federal approval. Federal regulations do not govern or otherwise control these state-only regulations. As such, the federal definition of ambient air cited by the Permit Opponents does not apply to the Maryland air toxics regulations with regard to the Ambient Impact Requirement of COMAR 26.11.15.06.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">The MDE\u2019s apparent change of mind regarding its position on the application of the EPA\u2019s definition of \u201cambient air\u201d would hamper our appellate review (if it were necessary to engage with the \u201cambient air\u201d debate) because, typically, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>court may affirm an agency decision only for the reasons the agency gave in reaching its decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ARuZ\">judicial review of administrative action differs from appellate review of a trial court judgment. In the latter context the appellate court will search the record for evidence to support the judgment and will sustain the judgment for a reason plainly appearing on the record whether or not the reason was expressly relied upon by the trial court. However, in judicial review of agency action the court may not uphold the agency order unless it is sustainable on the agency\u2019s findings and for the reasons stated by the agency.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-4\"><em>Walker v. Dep\u2019t of Hous. &amp; Cmty. Dev., </em>422 Md. 80, 107, 29 A.3d 293, 309 (2011) (quoting <em>United Steelworkers of Am. AFL-CIO, Local 2610 v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>298 Md. 665, 679, 472 A.2d 62, 69 (1984)) (emphasis added). The MDE\u2019s appellate assertion that the EPA definition of \u201cambient air\u201d controls, or, at the very least, coincides with, its interpretation of its ambient air regulations was, most likely, not a reason on which the agency relied in issuing the permit, because the record indicates that, at the time of the MDE\u2019s Final Determination, the MDE appeared to hold at arm\u2019s length the EPA definition. Although the MDE\u2019s post-hoc position on the relevance of the EPA definition was of little concern to the Court of Special Appeals, the MDE\u2019s original reasoning is not perfectly clear, at least in part because the Legislature did not require it to express its reasoning in written, detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but rather fostered a somewhat looser and elusive decisional process. The problems experienced here by us in performing our duties are, in equal measures, inherent in the administrative process and how the MDE addressed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Suffice it to say for now, despite our venting here, we find succor in what we said about the uniqueness of this sort of agency \u201crecord\u201d and decisional process in <em>Anacostia River-keeper.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">Applying the substantial evidence standard of review to a case where no contested case hearing took place may seem <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>anomalous because there is no formal record that was presented before an administrative law judge. EN \u00a7 1-606, however, expressly details the documents that can be included in a record. EN \u00a7 l-606(c)(l)-(9). For example, EN \u00a7 1-606 stipulates that any draft permit, comments submitted to MDE during the public comment period, transcripts of public hearings on the permit application, and responses to submitted comments constitute part of the administrative record. Thus, we are essentially reviewing the same record that we would have examined, excluding the administrative law judge\u2019s decision, had the merits of this case been subject to a contested case proceeding. Accordingly, our review of the issuance of the Permits fits within the substantial evidence standard of review contemplated by SG [State Government] \u00a7 10-222.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-4\"><em>Md.

We must honor, however, the deferential standard of review that guides our assessment of the type of agency action before us. Accordingly, we hold that the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d as extending to the property line of the commercial park, is free of legal error, and, the MDE\u2019s application of the term <em>vis-a-vis </em>allowing the modeling of toxins at that property line was not arbitrary or capricious. The MDE\u2019s issuance of the permit to construct MC\u2019s incinerator, therefore, was permissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

The MDE maintains, and Kor-Ko does not dispute, that the entire commercial park is owned by a single landlord/business entity, Stone Snyder, meeting thereby the \"control of one person or under common control of a group of persons\u201d prong of the regulatory definition of \u201cpremises,\" The record includes scattered bits of evidence about ownership of the commercial park, such as an apparent property tax document indicating that Stone Snyder may own a property of over nine acres; communications about the installation of a septic system revealing that Stone Snyder owns the parcel located at 408 Headquarters Drive, Suite 10, Millersville, Maryland (MC's specific location within the complex); maps suggesting that the commercial park has a single owner; and Kor-Ko\u2019s representation before the circuit court suggesting that a single landlord owns the complex. This \"evidence,\u201d although decidedly indirect, taken together with the fact that Kor-Ko did not challenge the MDE\u2019s assertion that a single landlord owns the commercial park, suggests that a single landlord, which may be Stone Snyder, is indeed the sole owner.

Offering a counter-argument, Kor-Ko posits that a proper interpretation of the regulatory definition of \"premises\" must reference also the definitions of \"installation\u201d and \"source.\u201d Based on the definitions provided <em>supra </em>in note 11, Kor-Ko states that \" \u2018[p]remises\u2019 means the equipment or machinery that emits air pollution, not the property where the equipment or machinery is located.\u201d This interpretation limits the geographical span of the \u201cpremises\u201d to the incinerator itself. The very definition of \"source,\u201d however, defines the term, in part, as \"property that contributes to air pollution,\u201d suggesting that Kor-Ko\u2019s proposed interpretation is overly narrow. EN \u00a7 2-101(i).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b449-5\">. Consistent with EN \u00a7 1\u2014606(c)(4)\u2019s requirement that the agency record in this kind of case must include \u201c[a] statement or fact sheet explaining the basis for the determination by the Department or Board,\u201d the MDE issued an explanatory fact sheet with its Tentative Determination on 9 August 2012, but the document did not provide any substantial reasoning for the MDE\u2019s choice to model toxins at the boundary of the commercial park for the purpose of determining health effects. There are two potentially illuminating conclusoty statements, however, in the fact sheet: under the heading \"Applicable Regulations,\u201d the MDE referenced \"COMAR 26.11.15.06U which prohibits the discharge of toxic air pollutants to the extent that the emissions will unreasonably endanger human health.\u201d Later, under the heading \"Toxic Air Pollutant Compliance Demonstration and Analysis,\u201d the MDE stated, in reference to COMAR 26.11.15.06, \"[t]he projected maximum off-site ground level concentrations, in any direction, for Toxic Air Pollutants are at or below all applicable screening levels.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The use of the term \"off-site\u201d suggests consistency with the MDE\u2019s current asserted interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d and the term appears a few times in the MDE's responses to public comments. The MDE\u2019s argument in its brief, that \u201coff-site\u201d means beyond the boundary of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>commercial park, relies on two supplemental fact sheets (which the MDE contends are guidance documents) that the MDE submitted for the first time on appeal (impermissibly, according to Kor-Ko), and these fact sheets are the basis of the MDE\u2019s argument that it applied a \u201clongstanding understanding of the term \u2018premises\u2019 here.\u201d Even if we were to consider those two supplemental fact sheets in our review, there is scant support elsewhere for the conclusory contention that the MDE maintained a \"longstanding\u201d and consistent interpretation as that asserted here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\">. Even if the entire commercial park is owned by Stone Snyder, the MDE\u2019s invocation of landlord-tenant law principles as directive of an outcome in its favor is not very persuasive. In response to Kor-Ko\u2019s point that the commercial park is not under common control because the landlord leased parts of the complex to other businesses, the MDE states that, \u201cas between the owner of real property and any one of the tenants, the owner of a leased property typically retains ultimate control over the common areas of the property.\u201d Kor-Ko retorts that control of common areas is irrelevant because that is not where MC operates its business. The MDE presses on, positing that the landlord retains control because, even when it transfers some level of control to a tenant via a lease, the landlord \u201chas ultimate control because it is the landlord who determines how much of that control to give away.\u201d We conclude that these tit-for-tat arguments are not particularly helpful in deciding this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">Also unhelpful is Kor-Ko\u2019s appropriation of the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s interpretation of \u201cproperty line\u201d espoused in the context of a criminal law case. <em>Fitzgerald v.

The <em>Fitzgerald </em>Court found the Fourth Amendment inapplicable beyond the \"property line\u201d of a rented apartment, meaning the physical boundary of the abode: \"such places [as apartments] ... do not typically throw out penumbral curtilages or surrounding Fourth Amendment buffer zones as do many, albeit not all, houses.\u201d <em>Fitzgerald, </em>153 Md.App. at 666, 837 A.2d at 1026.

The health of Kor-Ko\u2019s employees is the 'human health' MDE is charged with protecting.\u201d Kor-Ko does not proffer, nor can we find, any principle of interpretation that requires the consistent inteipretation of a term across disparate legal domains. As discussed above, moreover, we defer to the MDE\u2019s expert opinion that its calculations made at the boundary of the commercial park protect sufficiently the health of Kor-Ko\u2019s employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b452-5\">. Kor-Ko maintains that the MDE had a legal duty to model toxins within the commercial park, and specifically, at the height of building rooftops where presumably air intake handlers were situated, in order to fulfill its duty to protect human health. The MDE responds that calculating toxin concentrations at the rooftop level is tantamount to modeling indoor air, an activity for which the MDE lacks arguably jurisdiction, and that, in any event, modeling toxins at ground level protects sufficiently human health.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b452-6\">. Thus, even if we rejected the MDE's \u201cambient air\u201d argument that modeling air at the rooftops is equivalent legally to modeling indoor air, and agreed with Kor-Ko that \"ambient air\u201d exists indeed within the commercial park at the height of the building air handlers, the outcome here would not change because we would be bound to our fully-dispositive conclusion that the MDE allowed permissibly the boundary of the commercial park to serve as the location for modeling toxins for the purpose of determining health effects, based on our ratification of the MDE's interpretation of \"premises.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b452-7\">.

I disagree with the Majority\u2019s adoption of the Maryland Department of the Environment (\u201cMDE\u201d)\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d as extending to the property line of the commercial park. Rather, I would hold that Kor-Ko, Ltd. (\u201cKor-Ko\u201d)\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d is correct, and that \u201cpremises\u201d means the individual suite in which the crematory is to be located, not the area at and inside the boundary, or property line, of the commercial park in which the suite is located. Indeed, although the majority opinion is well written and contains no mistakes in any of the applicable standards or case law, the Majority does not review the plain language of the relevant Code of Maryland Regulation (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) and the obvious intent of the regulations, and the Majority does not consider the practical outcome associated with adopting the MDE\u2019s interpretation. With evenhandedness, the Majority expressly acknowledges that \u201cKor-Ko\u2019s perception that the MDE failed to consider adequately the health of people within the commercial park is understandable.\u201d Maj. Op. at 425, 152 A.3d at 855. Nonetheless, the Majority defers to the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises.\u201d Maj. Op. at 420-21, 152 A.3d at 853. I disagree with that conclusion because the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises\u201d is not based on a consistent, long-standing practice, but rather represents a matter of first impression that has wide-ranging practical implications beyond this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">Because this case involves regulatory interpretation, the principles of regulatory construction are applicable. \u201cThe interpretation of an agency rule is governed by the same principles that govern the interpretation of a [sjtatute.\u201d Thanner Enters., LLC v. Balt. Cty., 414 Md. 265, 277, 995 A.2d 257, 264 (2010) (citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted). To that end, the \u201cprimary objective is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the Legislature.\u201d Id. at 277, 995 A.2d at 264 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). As we have recognized, \u201c[t]he most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent is the statute\u2019s plain language as ordinari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>ly understoodt,]\u201d and \u201c[i]f statutory language is unambiguous when construed according to its ordinary and everyday meaning, then we give effect to the statute as it is written.\u201d Id. at 277, 995 A.2d at 264 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). However, if \u201cthe language is ambiguous because it gives rise to more than one reasonable interpretation, we must look to other indicia to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, including the relevant statute\u2019s legislative history, the context of the statute within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions.\u201d Twigg v. State, 447 Md. 1, 24, 133 A.3d 1125, 1139 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn all cases, when confronted with construing the meaning of a statutory provision, we must provide a reasonable interpretation\u2014one that is consonant with logic and common sense.\u201d Id. at 24,133 A.3d at 1139 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">Code of Maryland Regulation (\u201cCOMAR\u201d) 26.11.15.06A(1), concerning the ambient impact requirement for new installations, sources, or premises, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\">[A] person may not construct, modify, or operate, or cause to be constructed, modified, or operated, any new installation or source without first demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Department using procedures established in this chapter that total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A74u\">(Emphasis added). And, COMAR 26.11.15.04A(2) states that emissions from new installations must be \u201cquantified in sufficient detail to determine whether the premises complies with the requirements of [the State\u2019s Air Quality Regulations].\u201d (Emphasis added). COMAR 26.11.01.01B(36) and COMAR 26.11.15.01B(12) define \u201cpremises\u201d as \u201call the installations or other sources that are located on contiguous or adjacent properties and that are under the control of one person or under common control of a group of persons,\u201d No Maryland case has addressed what the term \u201cpremises\u201d means when applied in the context of these regulations, and, as the majority opinion recognizes, the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>\u201cpremises\u201d is not a longstanding and consistent interpretation of the term. See Maj. Op. at 419-20 n.14,152 A.3d at 852 n.14. The matter before the Court is one of first impression.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Applying basic principles of regulatory construction, I would conclude that the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises\u201d conflicts with the plain language of COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1), which clearly refers to \u201cpremises\u201d as being the location of the new installation or source from which toxic emissions are discharged. COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) states, in relevant part, that a person may not construct or operate \u201cany new installation or source without first demonstrating ... that the total allowable emissions from the premises of each toxic air pollutant discharged by the new installation or source will not unreasonably endanger human health.\u201d By tying the new installation or source to the toxic emissions from the premises, as used in COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1), \u201cpremises\u201d plainly means the space or unit from where the emissions are coming, <em>ie., </em>the location of the new installation or source; COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) does not refer to other spaces from which there are no toxic emissions or pollutants, and which are not affected by the new installation or source. It is the installations and sources of toxic emissions that are key to determining what the premises are, not other areas entirely unassociated with the installations and sources of toxic emissions. Indeed, in the context of this case, it would be illogical for \u201cpremises\u201d to mean a whole commercial park development where the installation or source of toxic emissions will be the crematory located in only one suite of the commercial park and where the other suites do not contain installations or sources of toxic emissions that would need to be regulated. In other words, the entire commercial park is not an installation or source of toxic emissions, and it strains reason to conclude that the entire commercial park must be the \u201cpremises\u201d under COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Moreover, adopting the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises\u201d as meaning the entire commercial park, extending to the property line, poses two problems. First, the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises\u201d sets up an unnecessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>demarcation between renters and owners that produces an unreasonable result. If Maryland Crematory, LLC (\u201cMC\u201d) owned the suite in the commercial park building in which the crematory is to be located\u2014which it does not\u2014then, according to the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d the premises would be the suite itself to its property line, and not the entire commercial park to its property line. This is so because the suite, if owned by MC, would be under the \u201ccontrol of one person or under common control of a group of persons[,]\u201d as \u201cpremises\u201d is defined by COMAR 26.11.01.01B(36) and CO-MAR 26.11.15.01B(12). In other words, the premises would be limited to the area within the property line that is under the control of one person or under the common control of a group of persons, <em>ie., </em>the suite owned by MC. However, because MC rents the suite in the commercial park building, the MDE interprets \u201cpremises\u201d as including the entire commercial park, extended to its property line, which is under the control of a single landlord/business entity, Stone Snyder. Put simply, utilizing the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d sets up an unnecessary and unwarranted distinction between renters of properties and owners of properties. This is obviously an arbitrary and, indeed, nonsensical outcome that should be avoided. See Twigg, 447 Md. at 24, 183 A.3d at 1139 (\u201cIn all cases, when confronted with construing the meaning of a statutory provision, we must provide a reasonable interpretation\u2014one that is consonant with logic and common sense.\u201d (Citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-4\">Second, the obvious goal or intent of regulations concerning ambient impact and compliance with toxic emissions standards is to safeguard human health. COMAR 26.11.15.06A(1) expressly states that a person may not construct, modify, or operate any new installation or source without first demonstrating that the toxic emissions from the installation or source \u201cwill not unreasonably endanger human health.\u201d Holding that the whole commercial park, to its property line, is the premises for purposes of regulatory compliance in this case could render environmental testing less effective and even meaningless in future cases, and undermine the intent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>regulations to protect human health. Indeed, under the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d there could be a development comprised of rental units, under the \u201ccontrol of one person or under common control of a group of persons[,]\u201d so large that environmental testing would be rendered meaningless if the installation or source of toxic emissions were a single location or suite within the development. Stated otherwise, if the commercial park in this case were larger and included a larger area within its property line, but the crematory remained just in one suite of the commercial park building, the screening requirements would nonetheless remain the same, but the toxic emissions would be measured against the larger area. As such, under the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises,\u201d there could be a premises so large that environmental testing would serve no practical purpose in measuring and limiting toxic emissions. Thus, applying the MDE\u2019s interpretation of the term \u201cpremises\u201d is simply not logical, and may lead to results that are not consistent with the regulation\u2019s intent to safeguard human health.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">Given that the MDE\u2019s interpretation of \u201cpremises\u201d is not a longstanding and consistent interpretation that has been tested and applied over time with workable results, there is less of a basis to defer to the MDE\u2019s interpretation in this instance. Accordingly, I would conclude that the plain language of the relevant COMAR, practical considerations, and the need for regulatory compliance to protect human health lead to the conclusion that \u201cpremises\u201d means the individual suite in which the crematory is to be located, not the area at and inside the boundary, or property line, of the commercial park in which the suite is located.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Judge Greene and Judge McDonald have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
