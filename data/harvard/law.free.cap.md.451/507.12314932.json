The Liquor Board found that Kougl violated these Rules and ordered a 30-day suspension of his liquor license. Kougl argues that the Rules require actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the licensee, and, therefore, he did not violate them when his employee solicited prostitution and exposed her breasts without his knowledge. We hold that the Liquor Board Rules at issue impose strict liability on licensees for prohibited conduct that occurs on their premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">In April 2013, Detective Fletcher Jackson of the Baltimore City Police Department\u2019s Special Enforcement Section, Vice Division, conducted an undercover investigation at Club Harem (\u201cthe Club\u201d), an adult entertainment establishment<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> owned by Respondent Steven Kougl.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> During his investigation, one of the Club\u2019s employees, Jamaica Brickhouse, approached Detective Jackson and engaged him in conversation. After introducing herself, Brickhouse exposed her breasts to Detective Jackson and invited him to touch them. He complied. Detective Jackson then asked Brickhouse if her breasts \u201ctast[ed] as good as they look[ed].\u201d At this point, Brickhouse proposed a lap dance or going to \u201cthe VIP\u201d where they could \u201cdo whatever\u201d so he could \u201cfind out.\u201d Detective Jackson asked if \u201cwhatever\u201d meant sexual intercourse, and Brickhouse confirmed that it did. She also clarified that it would cost $170 for the VIP room plus a tip for her services. Detective Jackson offered a $100 tip, and Brickhouse accepted. But no money was exchanged because Brickhouse went on stage to perform and Detective Jackson left the Club. She was charged with prostitution about eight months later.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">In July 2014, approximately 15 months after the incident, the Liquor Board charged Kougl with violations of three Liquor Board Rules. Specifically, it charged him with violations of: (1) Rule 4.17(a), which prohibits the solicitation of prostitution on a licensee\u2019s premises; (2) Rule 4.17(b), which prohibits indecent exposure on a licensee\u2019s premises; and (3) Rule 4.18, which prohibits the violation of federal, state, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>local laws on a licensee\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a hearing on July 17, 2014, the Liquor Board found that Kougl violated all three Rules and imposed a 30-day suspension of his liquor license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Kougl petitioned for judicial review of the decision in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. The Circuit Court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Kougl appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. He argued that because he had no knowledge of Brickhouse\u2019s prohibited activity, he had not violated Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), or 4.18.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He claimed that the Rules do not impose strict liability. In a published opinion, the court reversed. It held that the plain meaning of the words \u201csuffer,\u201d \u201cpermit,\u201d and \u201callow,\u201d as used in Rules 4.17 and 4.18 \u201cnecessarily require that some level of knowledge by the licensee must be established by the evidence.\u201d <em>Kougl v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Balt. City, </em>228 Md.App. 314, 330, 137 A.3d 1062 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The court further held that this knowledge requirement may be satisfied by evidence of actual or constructive knowledge. <em>Id. </em>at 331,137 A.3d 1062. In defining actual knowledge, the intermediate appellate court explained that there are two types: (1) \u201cactual awareness or an actual belief that a fact exists\u201d and (2) \u201cdeliberate ignorance\u201d or \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Because there was no evidence of Kougl\u2019s actual or constructive knowl<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>edge of Brickhouse\u2019s conduct, the court concluded that the Liquor Board erred in finding him guilty of violating the Rules at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">The Liquor Board noted a timely appeal. We granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider the following question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">Did the Liquor Board correctly interpret its [R]ules to impose upon licensees strict liability for sexual display, performance, or illegal activity conducted on licensed premises, where the pertinent portions of the [R]ules contain no language limiting a licensee\u2019s responsibility to situations where the licensee has actual or constructive knowledge of the offending conduct?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">Because we answer this question in the affirmative, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b543-8\">By statute, the General Assembly authorized local liquor boards to promulgate regulations advancing Maryland Code (1957, 2016 Repl. Vol), \u00a7 1-201 of the Alcoholic Beverages Article (\u201cAB\u201d), which aims \u201c[t]o obtain respect and obedience to law and to foster and promote temperance\u201d in furtherance of \u201cthe protection, health, welfare, and safety of the people of the State.\u201d AB \u00a7 1\u2014201 (a)(1)(i)\u2014(ii), (a)(3). The statute specifically authorizes the Liquor Board to \u201cadopt regulations to carry out this article.\u201d Md. Code (1957, 2016 Repl. Vol.), AB \u00a7 12-210(a). In 1998, the Liquor Board promulgated revised Liquor Board Rules. We are tasked with reviewing its interpretation of these regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-9\">In Maryland, judicial review of an administrative agency action \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cty., </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226 (1994). Although judicial review of an agency\u2019s factual findings is \u201cquite narrow,\u201d \u201cit is always within our prerogative to determine whether an agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>conclusions of law are correct,\u201d <em>Adventist Health Care, Inc. v. Md. Health Care Comm\u2019n, </em>392 Md. 103, 120-21, 896 A.2d 320 (2006) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). If an agency\u2019s conclusion is based on an error of law, it will not be upheld. <em>Hoyle v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs for Balt. City, </em>115 Md.App. 124, 129, 692 A.2d 1 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b544-4\">But \u201c[e]ven with regard to some legal issues, a degree of deference should often be accorded the position of the administrative agency.\u201d <em>Finucan v. Md. Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance, </em>380 Md. 577, 590, 846 A.2d 377 (2004) (citation omitted). Appellate courts should ordinarily give \u201cconsiderable weight\u201d to \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers.\u201d <em>Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005). In this regard, \u201cthe expertise of the agency in its own field of endeavor is entitled to judicial respect.\u201d <em>Finucan, </em>380 Md. at 590, 846 A.2d 377 (citations omitted). An agency is granted further deference when it interprets a regulation it promulgated, rather than a statute enacted by the Legislature. <em>Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>295 Md. 586, 593, 457 A.2d 1146 (1983). \u201cBecause an agency is best able to discern its intent in promulgating a regulation, the agency\u2019s expertise is more pertinent to the interpretation of an agency\u2019s rule than to the interpretation of its governing statute.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b544-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Liquor Board argues that Liquor Board Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18 impose strict liability on licensees for violations that occur on licensed premises. Therefore, it maintains, Kougl violated the Rules regardless of whether he had actual or constructive knowledge of his employee\u2019s conduct. The Liquor Board contends that the plain language meaning of \u201cpermit,\u201d \u201csuffer,\u201d and \u201callow\u201d do not require knowledge. Furthermore, the Liquor Board argues that the use of \u201cknowingly\u201d in only one provision of the Rules shows that it did not intend to impose a knowledge requirement in the other provi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>sions. Lastly, the Liquor Board urges us to apply the three-factor test from <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 647 A.2d 1041 (1988), to conclude that because the Liquor Board did not designate a mental state requirement in the language of the Rules, they impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Kougl contends that a licensee must have actual or constructive knowledge of the conduct at issue to violate the Rules. In other words, he maintains that the Rules require the Liquor Board to show that the licensee either knew or reasonably should have known about the goings-on to breach the regulations. He argues that the words \u201cpermit,\u201d \u201csuffer,\u201d and \u201callow\u201d require a licensee to have knowledge of the offending conduct. Thus, he contends, the Liquor Board was required to show that he knew or should have known about his employee\u2019s actions to find a violation of the Rules and suspend his liquor license.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">Plain Language Meaning</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">Although we accord an agency considerable deference in interpreting its own regulations, we review its conclusions of law for error by applying our well-settled principles of statutory interpretation. <em>Hranicka v. Chesapeake Surgical, Ltd., </em>443 Md. 289, 297-98, 116 A.3d 507 (2015) (citation omitted). Therefore, we begin by analyzing whether the plain language of the Rules supports imposing strict liability. Like a statute, a regulation\u2019s plain language is \u201cthe best evidence of its own meaning.\u201d <em>Total Audio-Visual Sys., Inc. v. Dep\u2019t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, </em>360 Md. 387, 395, 758 A.2d 124 (2000) (citations omitted). When interpreting the regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>tion, \u201cit is proper to consult a dictionary or dictionaries for a term\u2019s ordinary and popular meaning.\u201d <em>Chow v. State, </em>393 Md. 431, 445, 903 A.2d 388 (2006) (citations omitted). \u201c[W]hen the language is clear and unambiguous, our inquiry ordinarily ends there.\u201d <em>Christopher v. Montgomery Cty. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>381 Md. 188, 209, 849 A.2d 46 (2004) (alteration in original) (citation omitted). We conduct this plain language inquiry within the context of the regulatory scheme, and \u201cour approach is a commonsensical one designed to effectuate the purpose, aim, or policy of the enacting body.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">Liquor Board Rule 4.17 governs sexual conduct and obscenity on licensed premises.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Sections (a) and (b) of the Rule provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-5\">(a) No licensee shall permit or suffer his premises to be used for the purpose of any sexual activity, nor shall any licensee permit or suffer any employee, patron or frequenter to solicit any person for prostitution or other immoral purposes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">(b) No licensee shall permit or suffer any person to appear in any act or other performance with breasts or the lower torso uncovered; nor shall any licensee knowingly permit or suffer his premises to be used for the conduct, exhibition or performance of an obscene act or other performance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">(Emphasis added.) The Liquor Board found that Kougl \u201cpermitted] or suffered] [an] employee ... to solicit [a] person for prostitution\u201d in violation of Rule 4.17(a). It also found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>Kougl \u201cpermit[ted] or suffered] [a] person to appear in [an] act or other performance with breasts ... uncovered\u201d in violation of Rule 4.17(b).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Kougl argues that because he was not aware of his employee\u2019s conduct, he did not \u201cpermit\u201d or \u201csuffer\u201d her actions. In other words, he contends that Rule 4.17 includes an actual or constructive knowledge requirement. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\"><em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>(Black\u2019s) provides three definitions for \u201cpermit\u201d: (1) \u201c[t]o consent to formally\u201d; (2) \u201c[t]o give opportunity for\u201d; and (3) \u201c[t]o allow or admit of.\u201d <em>Permit, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). To consent to something formally, the actor certainly must know about the approved activity. But the second definition\u2014\u201c[t]o give opportunity for\u201d\u2014does not require the actor\u2019s knowledge of the conduct at issue. <em>Black\u2019s </em>provides as an example, \u201c[L]ax security permitted the escape.\u201d Just as lax security could permit an escape without knowledge that it is happening, licensees can permit prohibited conduct without knowledge of the offending behavior. Similarly, the third definition does not require knowledge on the part of the actor because, as discussed below, a licensee can \u201callow\u201d prohibited conduct without knowledge that it is occurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">To choose the appropriate definition, we look to the agency\u2019s interpretation of its own regulation. <em>Md. Transp. </em>Auth. <em>v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 288-89, 799 A.2d 1246 (2002) (citations omitted). We give deference to an agency\u2019s interpretation \u201cunless it is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Md. Comm\u2019n on Human Relations, </em>295 Md. at 593, 457 A.2d 1146 (\u201cthe agency\u2019s construction of its rule is entitled to weight\u201d). Because neither is the ease here, we hold that a licensee can unknowingly \u201cpermit\u201d conduct prohibited by Rules 4.17(a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number><em>Black\u2019s </em>defines \u201csuffer\u201d as \u201c[t]o allow or permit (an act, etc.).\u201d <em>Suffer, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. As established above, \u201cpermit\u201d does not require knowledge, and\u2014as discussed below\u2014neither does \u201callow.\u201d <em>Black\u2019s </em>provides \u201cto suffer a default\u201d as an example of how \u201csuffer\u201d is used. <em>Id. </em>A loan enters default when the borrower fails to make payments, regardless of whether the borrower was aware of the obligation to pay. Accordingly, by its plain meaning, \u201csuffer\u201d does not impose a knowledge requirement on Rules 4.17(a) or (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Moreover, other states interpreting the words \u201cpermit\u201d and \u201csuffer\u201d in liquor board regulations have concluded that they impose strict liability. <em>See, e.g., Div. of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Maynards Inc., </em>192 N.J. 158, 927 A.2d 525, 538 (2007) (\u201cIt has long been the law in New Jersey that, in the context of the regulation of alcoholic beverages, the word suffer ... imposes responsibility on a licensee, <em>regardless of knowledge ....\u201d </em>(emphasis in original) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>City of West Allis v. Megna, </em>26 Wis.2d 545, 133 N.W.2d 252, 253 (1965) (regulation that provide[d] \u201cno keeper of a tavern ... shall ... suffer or permit\u201d anyone under 21 to enter the licensed premises impose[d] strict liability).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The Liquor Board found that Kougl also violated Rule 4.18, which prohibits illegal conduct on a licensee\u2019s premises.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Rule provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>No licensee shall commit or allow the commission on his premises of any act which shall be contrary to any federal, state or local statute, law or ordinance or against the public peace, safety, health, welfare, quiet or morals.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-4\">(Emphasis added.) Similar to his argument regarding Rules 4.17(a) and (b), Kougl argues that \u201callow\u201d requires actual or constructive knowledge. The plain meaning of the word proves otherwise. The first definition in <em>Black\u2019s </em>for \u201callow\u201d includes \u201c[t]o put no obstacle in the way of\u2019 and \u201cto suffer to exist or occur.\u201d <em>Allow, </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary. These definitions do not contain a knowledge requirement. A licensee could both \u201cput no obstacle in the way of\u2019 illegal conduct and not realize it is happening.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\"><em>Black\u2019s </em>also defines \u201callow\u201d as \u201c[t]o give consent to; to approve\u201d and \u201c[t]o grant permission,\u201d which require the actor\u2019s knowledge. But, as discussed above, our task is not to determine whether any possible definition includes a knowledge requirement. Rather, it is to determine whether the Liquor Board\u2019s interpretation of its Rules is legally correct. <em>See Adventist Health Care, </em>392 Md. at 120-21, 896 A.2d 320 (citations omitted) (Courts review an agency\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo.). </em>Because an accepted definition of \u201callow\u201d does not require knowledge\u2014and we grant the Liquor Board\u2019s interpretation some deference\u2014we hold that Rule 4.18 imposes strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">The Liquor Board also argues that in the absence of other language designating a mental state requirement, the use of the term \u201cknowingly\u201d in the second part of Rule 4.17(b) suggests the agency intended those Rules that do not include the term to impose strict liability. In response, Kougl contends that \u201cknowingly\u201d was included in the second phrase of 4.17(b) by \u201chappenstance.\u201d We agree with the Liquor Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">The Court of Special Appeals analyzed a Liquor Board Rule with a similar structure to Rule 4.17(b) in <em>Hoyle v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City, </em>115 Md. App. 124, 692 A.2d 1 (1997). It concluded that the Liquor Board Rule prohibiting the sale of alcohol to minors imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>strict liability on licensees. <em>Id. </em>at 130, 692 A.2d 1. Rule 4.01(a) provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b550-4\">(a) No licensee shall sell or furnish alcoholic beverages to any person under twenty-one (21) years of age or to any person with the knowledge that such person is purchasing or acquiring such beverages for consumption by any person under twenty-one (21) years of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">(Emphasis added.) Comparing the Rule\u2019s two phrases, the court explained that as opposed to the second phrase\u2014the prohibition on selling alcohol to someone buying it for a minor\u2014the first phrase\u2014the prohibition on selling alcohol to anyone under twenty-one\u2014\u201cstands alone, unmodified by express terms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 130, 692 A.2d 1. Emphasizing that the agency interpreted this regulation to impose strict liability, the court concluded that \u201cthe intent of the [Liquor] Board was to make those licensees who furnish alcoholic beverages to anyone under the age of twenty-one strictly liable for the offense.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">Additionally, in <em>State of Maryland Central Collection Unit v. Jordan, </em>405 Md. 420, 952 A.2d 266 (2008), we held that a statute requiring vehicle owners to maintain car insurance imposed strict liability due, in part, to the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cknowingly\u201d elsewhere in the statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 952 A.2d 266. The statute at issue was \u201csilent as to whether knowledge or intent is a required element for a violation thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 430, 952 A.2d 266. Although we acknowledged that the \u201cabsence of such language in a statute ... does not necessarily make it a strict liability offense,\u201d we reasoned that because the Legislature articulated a mental state requirement for other provisions within the statutory scheme, it intentionally omitted one from the provision at issue. <em>Id. </em>at 430-32, 952 A.2d 266 (citing <em>Staples v. United States, </em>511 U.S. 600, 619, 114 S.Ct. 1793, 128 L.Ed.2d 608 (1994)) (additional citations omitted). We explained, \u201cThe Legislature\u2019s omission of a <em>mens rea </em>requirement in [this provision] ... leads us to conclude that the Legislature deliberately chose not to make knowledge an element of the offense of maintaining the required security on an automobile.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 431-32, 952 A.2d 266; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number><em>see also Outmezguine v. State, </em>335 Md. 20, 43, 641 A.2d 870 (1994) (When the surrounding provisions contained a knowledge requirement, the \u201cconspicuous absence\u201d of such a requirement in the offense of photographing a minor engaged in sexual activity revealed an intent to impose strict liability.); <em>Garnett v. State, </em>332 Md. 571, 585-86, 632 A.2d 797 (1993) (Omitting \u201cknows or should reasonably know\u201d from the statutory rape provision, but including it in surrounding provisions, \u201cindicates that the Legislature aimed to make statutory rape with underage persons a more severe prohibition based on strict criminal liability.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\">When interpreting a regulation, we must read each provision in the context of the regulatory scheme to ensure that \u201cno word, clause, sentence, or phrase is rendered surplus-age, superfluous, meaningless, or nugatory.\u201d <em>In re Kaela C., </em>394 Md. 432, 467, 906 A.2d 915 (2006) (citation omitted). An interpretation of the Rules that requires the licensee to act with actual or constructive knowledge would render superfluous the word \u201cknowingly\u201d in Rule 4.17(b). Thus, we conclude that Rules 4.17(a), 4.17(b), and 4.18 do not include a knowledge requirement\u2014they impose strict liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">The plain language meaning of the Rules comports with the purpose of Maryland\u2019s liquor regulations, which seek to ensure respect and obedience for the law. AB \u00a7 1-201(a)(l)(i). Additionally, a liquor license is a privilege, and the Liquor Board has the power to circumscribe that privilege as \u201cdeemed necessary to prevent [its] abuse.\u201d <em>Piscatelli v. Bd. of Liquor License Comm\u2019rs, </em>378 Md. 623, 639, 837 A.2d 931 (2003) (quoting <em>Dundalk Liquor Co. v. Tawes, </em>201 Md. 58, 65, 92 A.2d 560 (1953)); AB \u00a7 12-2101(a). We agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court that \u201cacceptance of the privileges and benefits of a liquor license in this State carries with it the burden that licensees are held to an exacting standard of conduct.\u201d <em>Maynards, </em>927 A.2d at 539. Moreover, as the Wisconsin Supreme Court has recognized, being subject to strict liability is \u201ca price that the [licensee] pays for the privilege of becoming licensed.\u201d <em>City of West Allis, </em>133 N.W.2d at 254.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number><em>Dawkins </em>Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b552-4\">In addition to its plain meaning arguments, the Liquor Board contends that the Rules \u00e1re \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d under the three-factor analysis applied in <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>313 Md. 638, 547 A.2d 1041 (1988). Thus, it argues, the Rules appropriately impose strict liability on licensees to further their regulatory purpose. In response, Kougl points to <em>State v. McCallum, </em>321 Md. 451, 583 A.2d 250 (1991), where this Court held that a criminal statute prohibiting driving on a suspended license did not satisfy the <em>Dawkins </em>factors and therefore required actual or constructive knowledge on the part of the driver. He urges us to adopt the definition of knowledge from Judge Chasanow\u2019s concurring opinion, which includes \u201cwillful blindness.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">In <em>Morissette v. United States, </em>342 U.S. 246, 72 S.Ct. 240, 96 L.Ed. 288 (1952), the Supreme Court defined \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d as \u201cregulations which heighten the duties of those in control of particular industries, trades, properties or activities that affect public health, safety or welfare.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254, 72 S.Ct. 240. It distinguished \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d from traditional common-law, criminal offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\">These cases do not fit neatly into any of such accepted classifications of common-law offenses, such as those against the state, the person, property, or public morals. Many of these offenses are not in the nature of positive aggressions or invasions, with which the common law so often dealt, but are in the nature of neglect where the law requires care, or inaction where it imposes a duty. Many violations of such regulations result in no direct or immediate injury to person or property but merely create the danger or probability of it which the law seeks to minimize.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b553-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 255-56, 72 S.Ct. 240. The Supreme Court explained that \u201clawmakers ... have sought to make such regulations more effective by invoking criminal sanctions to be applied by the familiar technique of criminal prosecutions and convictions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 254-55, 72 S.Ct. 240 (footnote omitted). Furthermore, courts have allowed legislatures to forego the traditional mental state requirement for criminal acts and impose strict liability for these offenses. <em>Id. </em>at 258-59, 72 S.Ct. 240.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">In <em>Dawkins v. State, </em>we analyzed three factors to determine whether statutes prohibiting the possession of a controlled dangerous substance and the possession of drug paraphernalia constituted \u201cpublic welfare offenses.\u201d We held that the statutes did not constitute \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d and declined to impose strict liability. <em>Dawkins, </em>313 Md. at 651-62, 547 A.2d 1041. Relying on <em>Morissette, </em>we explained that strict liability \u201cpublic welfare offenses\u201d often have the following characteristics: (1) they are \u201cregulatory in nature\u201d; (2) they involve light fines or penalties; and (3) \u201cregardless of the defendant\u2019s state of mind, the defendant is generally in a position to prevent the violation from occurring.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 644-45, 547 A.2d 1041 (citing <em>Morissette, </em>342 U.S. at 256, 72 S.Ct. 240) (additional citations omitted). But this three-factor inquiry is not applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">Recognizing that criminal liability generally requires criminal intent, the <em>Dawkins </em>Court analyzed whether it was appropriate for a criminal statute to impose strict liability. <em>Id. </em>at 643, 547 A.2d 1041 (\u201cAt common law, a crime occurred only upon the concurrence of the individual\u2019s act and his guilty state of mind.\u201d). We have explained, \u201cThe requirement that an accused have acted with a culpable mental state is an axiom of criminal jurisprudence.\u201d <em>Garnett, </em>332 Md. at 578-80, 632 A.2d 797 (describing scholars\u2019 rejection of strict criminal liability). Therefore, we are \u201creluctant to read into criminal statutes an intent of the [Legislature to forego a mens rea requirement.\u201d <em>Owens v. State, </em>352 Md. 663, 671, 724 A.2d 43 (1999). Consequently, we apply the <em>Dawkins </em>factors to criminal statutes to determine whether \u201cthe Legislature intended to eliminate the requirement of <em>mens rea </em>and create a strict liability public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>welfare offense.\u201d <em>McCallum, </em>321 Md. at 456, 583 A.2d 250; <em>see also Lowery v. State, </em>430 Md. 477, 501-03, 61 A.3d 794 (2013) (applying <em>Dawkins </em>analysis to criminal prohibition on hydraulic clam dredging in a protected area).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Because the Liquor Board Rules are civil regulations, however, there is no presumption against strict liability. <em>See Mesbahi v. Md. State Bd. of Physicians, </em>201 Md.App. 315, 339, 29 A.3d 679 (2011) (When interpreting civil regulatory statutes, \u201c[t]he presumption against strict liability offenses in criminal law is irrelevant.\u201d); <em>Council on Am.-Islamic Relations Action Network, Inc. v. Gaubatz, </em>123 F.Supp.3d 83, 87 (D.D.C. 2015) (declining to impose criminal law\u2019s presumption against strict liability to civil provisions of the D.C. Wiretap Act); <em>Long v. Hammond, </em>164 N.C.App. 486, 596 S.E.2d 839, 845-46 (2004) (rejecting argument that presumption against strict liability applies to civil aspect of state licensing requirements for ERISA certified health plans). Therefore, we do not need to apply the <em>Dawkins </em>analysis to determine whether the presumption has been overcome. Because we decline to apply the <em>Dawkins </em>factors to the Liquor Board Rules at issue, the Court\u2019s reasoning in <em>McCallum </em>is not analogous to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Liquor Board Rules 4.17(a) and (b), and 4.18 impose strict liability on licensees for offending conduct that occurs on their premises. Therefore, the Liquor Board was not required to show that Kougl knew or should have known about his employee\u2019s actions to find a violation of the Rules and impose a sanction. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. COSTS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENT.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-6\">. We use the term \"adult entertainment establishment\u201d for description only.

For each of the charges, Kougl was found guilty by a 2-1 vote. The Liquor Board\u2019s then-Chairman Thomas Ward and Commissioner Harvey E. Jones voted guilty on all three charges.

Kougl also argued that the Liquor Board\u2019s decision was not supported by sufficient findings of fact and conclusions of law to permit judicial review. <em>Kougl v.

Neither party has appealed this portion of the court's decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b545-7\">. During oral argument, through counsel, Kougl also argued that only statutes and regulations concerning minors, such as the Liquor Board Rule at issue in <em>Hoyle v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners for Baltimore City, </em>115 Md.App, 124, 692 A.2d 1 (1997), impose strict liability. We have acknowledged that \u201c[l]egislators generally have broader discretion in enacting laws to promote the health and welfare of children than they have for adults.\u201d <em>Owens v. State, </em>352 Md. 663, 681, 724 A.2d 43 (1999). But we have never held that strict liability applies only to regulations seeking to protect minors, and we decline to do so here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\">.
