We hold that there is such a mechanism\u2014the common law writ of mandamus. Our review in this particular case awaits the provision by the Commission of the record of its proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b664-13\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">\n<em>A. Discipline or Removal of Judges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b664-15\">The State Constitution provides a special process for the discipline, removal, or involuntary retirement of a judge who commits misconduct or who is found to suffer from a disabili<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ty. Maryland Constitution, Article IV, \u00a7\u00a7 4A-4B.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In particular, the Constitution creates the Commission and empowers it to undertake investigations and conduct hearings concerning complaints about judges. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 4B(a)(l). At the conclusion of an investigation and any hearing, the Commission may \u201cissue a reprimand\u201d to a judge or \u201crecommend to the Court of Appeals the removal, censure, or other appropriate disciplining of a judge or, in an appropriate case, retirement.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 4B(a)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\">The General Assembly has codified and elaborated in statute some of the powers conferred on the Commission by the Constitution for its investigations and hearings. Maryland Code, Courts <em>&amp; </em>Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cCJ\u201d), \u00a7 13-401 <em>et seq. </em>In particular, the statute provides for the issuance and enforcement of subpoenas, service of process, administration of oaths or affirmations by witnesses, and grants of immunity to witnesses. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">The Constitution delegates to the Court of Appeals the task of prescribing the rules that govern the Commission\u2019s investigations and proceedings. Maryland Constitution, Article IV, \u00a7 4B(a)(5). The Constitution further directs that the proceedings before the Commission are confidential and privileged, except as provided by rule or order of the Court of Appeals. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number><em>Id., </em>\u00a7 4B(a)(3). However, the record of Commission proceedings and any proceeding filed in the Court of Appeals loses its confidential character. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">Pursuant to the Constitution, this Court has adopted rules governing the Commission\u2019s investigations, hearings, and other proceedings. Those rules are currently codified in Maryland Rule 18-401 <em>et seq.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Pertinent to this case, those rules define \u201csanctionable <em>conduct\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>conduct for which a judge may be disciplined or removed. Maryland Rule 18\u2014401(k).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Upon receiving a complaint alleging such misconduct by a judge, the Commission\u2019s Investigative Counsel may conduct a preliminary investigation. Maryland Rule 18-404. The Judicial Inquiry Board, also created by the rules, monitors the investigation, receives a report from the Investigative Counsel, and makes a recommendation to the Commission about what, if any, further action to take on a complaint. Maryland Rules 18-403, 18-404. If the matter is not resolved at an earlier stage of the investigation or during the Judicial Inquiry Board process, and if the Commission finds probable cause to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>judge has committed sanctionable conduct, the Commission may direct the Investigative Counsel to file charges against the judge with the Commission. Maryland Rule 18-407(a). Those charges, and the judge\u2019s response to them, become the subject of an evidentiary hearing before the Commission. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\">The rules provide a judge accused of misconduct with various procedural rights in connection with the Commission\u2019s hearing on the charges. Maryland Rule 18-407(b)-(i). Among other things, the rules provide for notice to the judge of the charges and allow the judge to submit a written response. Maryland Rule 18-407(b)-(c). The judge has a right to be represented by counsel, to have subpoenas issued for testimony by witnesses and the production of evidence, to examine the Commission record, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. Maryland Rule 18\u2014407(f). The pre-hearing exchange of information between the judge and Investigative Counsel is governed by the discovery rules applicable to civil actions in the circuit courts; the Chair of the Commission is authorized to carry out the function of a circuit court judge in limiting discovery, issuing protective orders, and otherwise resolving discovery disputes. Maryland Rule 18-407(g)(3). The hearing before the Commission on the charges is to be conducted in accordance with the rules of evidence and is to be stenographi-cally recorded. Maryland Rule 18-407(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">The Commission is to make findings of fact under a clear and convincing standard of proof and either dismiss the charges, reprimand the judge, or refer the matter to the Court of Appeals for other discipline. Maryland Rule 18\u2014407(j). If the matter is referred to this Court, the Commission is to create a record of its proceedings, including a transcript. Maryland Rule 18-407(k).</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">\n<em>B. Proceeding Before the Commission Concerning Judge White</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Although we have not yet been provided with the Commission\u2019s record in this matter, we understand from the parties\u2019 submissions and selected documents posted on the Commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>sion\u2019s website<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that the following description of prior proceedings is either undisputed or is set forth in materials that may be judicially noticed.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">1. Alleged Judicial Misconduct in <em>Joyner v. Veolia Transportation Services</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">This case traces its genesis to several hearings during 2014 in a civil action in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City over which Judge Pamela J. White presided. <em>Louise V. Joyner v. Veolia Transportation Servs. Inc., et al. </em>Case No. 24C14000589 (Baltimore City Circuit Court). Rickey Nelson Jones represented the plaintiff in that matter. Although not pertinent to our disposition of the legal question before us, we summarize briefly the proceedings in that litigation that resulted in the complaint against Judge White, as found by the Commission in its order in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\"><em>Hearing on Motion to Dismiss Punitive Damages </em>Claim\u2014 <em>May 5, 2011</em></p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">The <em>Joyner </em>matter came before Judge White on May <em>5, </em>2014, for a hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim for punitive damages. During Mr. Jones\u2019 argument on behalf of the plaintiff, Judge White, in a raised voice, stated to Mr. Jones, \u201c[a]re you telling me with a straight face, as an officer of the court, that the actions of an insurance adjuster from another company [, <em>ie., </em>a company that was not an insurer of the defendant] should be attributed to defendant Veolia?\u201d Mr. Jones answered in the affirmative. Judge White then asked, \u201c[d]o you have any legal authority that gives you the chutzpah<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> to claim punitive damages in a negligence case for actions by an adjuster not employed by Veolia that would have allowed me to attribute ill will to Veolia?\u201d The Commission later found that, during this exchange, \u201cJudge White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>yelled and treated [Mr.] Jones in a rude, disrespectful, and unprofessional manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">\n<em>Pretrial Conference; Show Came Order for Plaintiffs Failure to Attend</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">During 2014, Judge White was also in charge of the Circuit Court\u2019s Civil Alternative Dispute Resolution (\u201cADR\u201d) Program. On September 17, 2014, a pretrial conference was held in the <em>Joyner </em>matter in accordance with the ADR Program. Jeff Trueman, Deputy Director of the ADR Program, and Senior Judge Paul Alpert conducted the pretrial conference. Counsel for defendant Veolia, a corporate representative of defendant Veolia, and Mr. Jones attended. Mr. Jones\u2019 client, Ms. Joyner, did not attend the pretrial conference\u2014a violation of the Circuit Court\u2019s scheduling order.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">On October 9, 2014, Judge White issued a show cause order in the <em>Joyner </em>matter. The order required that Ms. Joyner and Mr. Jones personally appear on October 31, 2014, and show cause as to why they should not be held in constructive civil contempt for failing to comply with the requirement of the Circuit Court\u2019s scheduling order that Ms. Joyner attend the pretrial conference.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">\n<em>Trial Date and Postponement\u2014October 15, 201k</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">By coincidence, the <em>Joyner </em>matter was scheduled for trial, also before Judge White, on October 15, 2014. On that day, Mr. Jones asked for a postponement and also asked Judge White to recuse herself from the case. Judge White heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>argument from Mr. Jones regarding his motion. The Commission later concluded that \u201c[Mr.] Jones argued that Judge White had exhibited \u2018harshness\u2019 toward his client, had not shown his client consideration for her disabilities, and had \u2018insulted\u2019 him at the May 5, 2014 hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Judge White ultimately decided to recuse herself from the trial of the <em>Joyner </em>case, but not from the show cause hearing related to the pretrial conference. In addressing Mr. Jones\u2019 motion for her recusal, Judge White stated in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-6\">... [B]ecause I am incredulous, because I am in disbelief, because I find myself incapable of believing virtually anything that Mr. Jones has just told me, I\u2019m in the unfamiliar territory of finding that I must recuse myself from any further proceedings in this case because I cannot believe anything that the Reverend Rickey Nelson Jones Esquire[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>] \u2014I\u2019m reading off the letterhead\u2014tells me. I think that 99% of what Mr. Jones has told me about his conduct on behalf of his client is pure bullshit[.] So I\u2019m forced to recuse myself and I can\u2019t get past the idea that I cannot believe a darn thing that Mr. Jones tells me now. So I am compelled under ... Rule 2.11 [of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct][<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] to disqualify myself in any further proceedings in this case, because I now believe based on Mr. Jones\u2019 conduct and representations in this case, in his discussion and exploration of who struck John in recent days about his request for accommodation, all without following the precise instructions and procedures in the Scheduling Order and the website and resources available to him, I find that I cannot be impartial. I am personally biased or prejudiced concerning Mr. Jones and his conduct. So, I\u2019m going to recuse myself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Judge White then addressed Mr. Jones\u2019 motion for postponement. The Commission later found that \u201c[w]hen [Mr.] Jones stated that he had appeared in postponement court the previous day, Judge White pointed toward and raised her voice at [Mr.] Jones for initiating another instance of <em>ex parte </em>communication.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Judge White then stated to Mr. Jones:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aq7u\">I am dumbfounded at your irresponsible behavior, Mr. Jones. All the more reason I am compelled by your dumbfounding behavior to recuse myself because I cannot believe a single word you say. And what I am compelled to do now because the Rules of Professional Conduct and the Judicial Code compel me to do so is to reexamine what I just said and heard and reported on the record whether I must report you to the Attorney Grievance Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge White stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b671-5\">As for you, Mr. Jones, I have no way of knowing whether my pique and my frustration as to your performance in recent days will warrant my recusal in any further and future cases pending before this court. I take each case as it comes ... While I\u2019m shocked, frustrated, appalled, and consequently don\u2019t believe anything Mr. Jones has told me about the conduct of his office and himself in this case, and I don\u2019t believe that he has honored the court\u2019s orders in this case, I don\u2019t understand or believe that necessarily will carry over to any future other cases. I will take each case as it comes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Notwithstanding her decision to recuse herself from the trial of the <em>Joyner </em>case, Judge White stated that she would preside over the October 31, 2014, hearing regarding the show cause order she had issued because, as she stated, it was her \u201cresponsibility to address it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">On October 15, 2014, Mr. Jones filed an Emergency Motion with Circuit Administrative Judge W. Michel Pierson for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>assignment of the October 31, 2014, show cause hearing to a judge other than Judge White. Judge White was not notified of the motion. Judge Pierson denied that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">\n<em>Trial of the Joyner Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">The <em>Joyner </em>case went to trial the following week, on October 20, 2014, before another judge of the Circuit Court and resulted in a defense verdict. Ms. Joyner pursued an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which remains pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\n<em>Show Cause Hearing\u2014October SI, 2014-</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWS\">At the October 31, 2014, show cause hearing, Mr. Jones defended his attempt to excuse his client\u2019s absence from the pretrial conference. Mr. Jones contended that he had in fact complied with the rules because he had requested in his pretrial statement that Ms. Joyner be excused from the pretrial conference due to her health issues. When Mr, Jones cited case law purportedly in support of this contention, Judge White noted \u201c[h]ow interesting that [the case is] captioned as an Attorney Grievance complaint.\u201d The Commission later noted in its Findings of Fact:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b672-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge White found [Mr.] Jones in contempt for his failure and refusal to comply with the Scheduling Order and pre-trial conference procedures. She stated that [Mr.] Jones\u2019 argument that he complied with the Scheduling Order was \u201cshocking\u201d and was \u201csoundly and roundly rejected.\u201d During her oral ruling, and by written order dated November 12, 2014, Judge White ordered [Mr.] Jones to pay attorney\u2019s fees to opposing counsel, related to his appearing at the pre-trial conference and the show cause hearing, and to write letters of apology to Mr. Trueman and to Judge Alpert for his \u201crude and uncivil behavior\u201d at the pre-trial conference. Judge White made no mention at any time during the October 31, 2014 hearing, or within the written order, that she had previously recused herself from the <em>Joyner </em>case fled by [Mr.] Jones on behalf of Ms. Joyner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b672-9\">We are advised that Mr. Jones appealed the contempt order in the <em>Joyner </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>2. Complaints to Commission, Investigation, and Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Mr, Jones filed multiple complaints concerning Judge White with the Commission beginning on October 20, 2014. Following an investigation, and with the authorization of the Commission, Investigative Counsel filed charges dated March 31, 2016 against Judge White. Investigative Counsel alleged that Judge White had violated various provisions of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> All of the charges concerned Judge White\u2019s conduct during the three hearings in the <em>Joyner </em>case during 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">3, Pre-Hearing Proceedings Concerning the Charges</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Judge White filed an Answer to the charges on May 2, 2016. In her answer, Judge White offered a detailed recitation of the proceedings before her in the <em>Joyner </em>case and denied that her actions or statements during the hearings violated the Code of Judicial Conduct. Judge White also filed a motion to dismiss the charges. Among other things, Judge White argued that the pending appeal before the Court of Special Appeals in the <em>Joyner </em>case concerned related issues and that the Commission\u2019s proceeding on Mr. Jones\u2019 complaints against her had not complied with the procedural rules governing Commission proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Judge White also directed discovery requests to Investigative Counsel pursuant to the civil discovery rules. The Chair of the Commission struck requests for admission and interrogatories propounded by Judge White on the ground that Investigative Counsel was not a \u201cparty\u201d for purposes of the discovery rules. Judge White appealed that ruling to the full Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">After holding a hearing on the motion to dismiss on June 27, 2016, the Commission denied the motion, adopting the re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>sponse of Investigative Counsel. The Commission also opined that, even if it believed Judge White\u2019s arguments had merit, it had no authority to dismiss the charges prior to an evidentiary hearing. The Commission also noted that the rules provided for its Chair to decide discovery disputes, that the Chair\u2019s rulings had not deprived Judge White of a fair discovery process, and that, in any event, it lacked authority to review a ruling of its Chair denying discovery to Judge White.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">4. Evidentiary Hearing and Commission Order</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">On July 7 and 8, 2016, the Commission conducted an evidentiary hearing on the charges. On August 3, 2016, the Commission issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and an Order of Public Reprimand. The Commission found by clear and convincing evidence that Judge White had committed sanctionable conduct. In particular, the Commission found that Judge White\u2019s treatment of Mr. Jones at the May 5, 2014 and October 15, 2014 hearings violated a provision of the Maryland Code of Judicial Conduct that requires judges to conduct themselves in a way that promotes public confidence in the impartiality of the judiciary.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The Commission also found that Judge White\u2019s participation in the October 31, 2014 show cause hearing, after she had admitted to bias toward Mr. Jones, violated not only that provision, but several other provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct that require a judge to act impartially and to disqualify himself or herself from proceedings in which the judge\u2019s impartiality might reasonably be questioned.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The Commission determined that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>a public reprimand was the appropriate disposition under the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">\n<em>C. Proceedings After the Commission\u2019s Order</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">On September 1, 2016, Judge White filed with this Court a pleading entitled \u201cAppeal and, in the Alternative, Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\u201d In this filing, Judge White sought to have us review two issues: (1) whether the Commission had denied her procedural due process; and (2) whether the Commission had erred in finding sanctionable conduct and reprimanding her.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">With respect to the claim of a denial of due process, Judge White asserted that she was not notified of Mr. Jones\u2019 various complaints for many months, that she was not provided with a copy of the Judicial Inquiry Board\u2019s report in a timely manner, that her written response to the charges may not have been provided to the Commission, that she was denied pre-hearing discovery to which she was entitled, and that her presentation of evidence at the hearing was unfairly restricted. With respect to the Commission\u2019s finding of sanctionable conduct and imposition of a reprimand, Judge White challenged the Commission\u2019s decision to the extent it was based on her decision not to recuse herself from the show cause hearing in the <em>Joyner </em>case after she had recused herself from the trial of that case.</p>\n<p id=\"A1T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>On September 16, 2016, the Commission filed a motion to dismiss the appeal and for denial of the petition for writ of <em>certiorari, </em>arguing that Judge White had no right to appellate review in the matter, and that there were no grounds for the grant of a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>Judge White filed an opposition to the Commission\u2019s motion to dismiss on September 23, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"A6Iy\">On September 28, 2016, this Court ordered that the matter be set for a show cause hearing for the limited purpose of addressing the following questions related to the first issue raised by Judge White:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2qy\">(1) Whether this Court has jurisdiction to decide whether [Judge White] was denied procedural due process during the Commission proceedings where the ultimate disposition of the Commission was a public reprimand?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaF\">(2) Whether, if the Court has such jurisdiction, the Commission failed to comply with the Maryland Rules governing its proceedings such that [Judge White] was denied procedural due process during those proceedings?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AXU\">The Court held oral argument on November 4, 2016. In this opinion we address the first question. Resolution of the second question awaits the filing of the Commission\u2019s record with us and any further submissions by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"AAqM\">II</p>\n<p id=\"APg\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"ADL\">The immediate question before us is whether there is any mechanism for us to review Commission proceedings when the Commission determines that a reprimand is the appropriate discipline\u2014a form of discipline that the Constitution authorizes the Commission to impose on its own without referring the matter to us.</p>\n<p id=\"AB8E\">We hold that there is no constitutional or statutory basis for this Court to exercise <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction to review the Commission\u2019s proceedings. We do have original jurisdiction, however, to conduct a limited review, pursuant to a common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>law writ of mandamus, of Judge White's claims that the Commission abused its discretion and deprived her of the procedural due process guaranteed by the State Constitution and Maryland Rules. In order to conduct that review, we direct the Commission to file the record of its proceedings with us. To the extent that Judge White asks for review of matters that preceded the filing of charges, she must submit a written waiver of confidentiality to the Commission,</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">\n<em>A. Whether an Accused Judge is- Entitled to Procedural Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">There is no question that a judge under investigation by the Commission or charged by the Commission with misconduct is entitled to due process. As outlined earlier, Article IV of the State Constitution sets forth the grounds on which a judge may be disciplined, removed, or retired, provides some basic parameters for Commission investigations and proceedings, and states the consequences of removal or involuntary retirement. The Constitution defers to this Court the task of designing a fair process by rule. Our rules embody the fundamental elements of procedural due process\u2014they provide a judge with notice of the charges, an opportunity to respond to the charges in writing, pre-hearing discovery, and a hearing conducted under the rules of evidence. When the Commission refers a matter to this Court, the judge has an opportunity to file exceptions and to be heard.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-6\">There is also no question that, when the Commission recommends certain types of discipline to this Court\u2014censure, removal, or other discipline\u2014our review may include the fairness of the Commission proceeding. For example, in the first reported case concerning a Commission recommendation\u2014a recommendation for censure of two judges\u2014this Court considered a due process challenge to the Commission proceedings. <em>See In re Diener, </em>268 Md. 659, 671, 677-79, 804 A.2d 587 (1973) (adopting, with some editing, the Commission\u2019s analysis why its procedures did not violate the judges\u2019 right to procedural due process). While this Court concluded that the proceedings in that case accorded the judges due process, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>Court noted that the Commission is bound \u201cby the fundamental rules of fairness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 682, 304 A.2d 587. In another case involving a recommended censure of a judge, the majority opinion of this Court and a dissenting opinion debated at some length whether the charges in that case were based on an unconstitutionally vague standard\u2014an issue that relates to the notice aspect of procedural due process. <em>In re </em>Foster, 271 Md. 449, 476-77, 486-504, 318 A.2d 523 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Under the Constitution and our rules, an accused judge is entitled to these elements of procedural due process\u2014notice, an opportunity to respond, a fair hearing\u2014 regardless of the <em>outcome\u2014i.e., </em>whether the Commission ultimately decides to dismiss the charges, reprimand the judge, or recommend that we censure, discipline, or remove the judge. Of course, a minor deviation from the rules without prejudice to the judge would not undermine this guarantee. To paraphrase a principle sometimes stated in the context of criminal proceedings, an accused judge is entitled to a fair proceeding, but not necessarily a perfect proceeding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nor does the promise of a fair process entitle a judge to any particular outcome in a given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">\n<em>B. Whether There is a Mode of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">The question before us is whether there is any opportunity for review of the fairness of a Commission proceeding when the Commission elects to reprimand a judge itself in lieu of recommending other discipline by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-8\">1. Appeal and <em>Certiorari</em></p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">Judge White has characterized her request for review in the alternative as either an appeal or a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>\u201cIt is an often stated principle of Maryland law that appellate jurisdiction, except as constitutionally authorized, is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>determined entirely by statute, and that, therefore, a right of appeal must be legislatively granted.\u201d <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Bd. of Supervisors of Elections, </em>345 Md. 477, 485, 693 A.2d 757 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1053, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998); <em>see also Maryland-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n v. Smith, </em>333 Md. 3, 7, 633 A.2d 855 (1993). Neither the constitutional provisions that create the Commission process nor any statute provides for an appeal of a Commission reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\">With respect to granting a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>this Court\u2019s authority is set forth in CJ \u00a7 12-201, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6O\">Except as [limited by] \u00a7 12-202 of this subtitle, <em>in any case or proceeding pending in or decided by the Court of Special Appeals upon appeal from a circuit court or an orphans\u2019 court or the Maryland Tax Court, </em>any party, including the State, may file in the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari to review the case or proceeding. The petition may be filed either before or after the Court of Special Appeals has rendered a decision, but not later than the time prescribed by the Maryland Rules. In a case or proceeding described in this section, the Court of Appeals also may issue the writ of certiorari on its own motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">(emphasis added). As is evident, at a minimum, a case must be \u201cpending in or decided by the Court of Special Appeals upon appeal from a circuit court or an orphans\u2019 court or the Maryland Tax Court\u201d in order for this Court to grant a writ of <em>certiorari. </em>This case does not satisfy that criterion. Thus, CJ \u00a7 12-201 does not provide this Court with a statutory basis to grant a writ of <em>certiorari.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">2. Common Law Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b679-7\">While there is no <em>appellate </em>jurisdiction for review of Judge White\u2019s claims, this Court is able to review her allegation that the Commission proceeding denied her procedural due process as a petition for a common law writ of mandamus. Although Judge White\u2019s filing in this Court was entitled \u201cAppeal and, in the Alternative, Petition for Writ of Certiorari,\u201d the filing\u2019s label does not prevent this Court from treating the filing as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>request for a common law writ of mandamus. <em>See, e.g., Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 500, 693 A.2d 757 (\u201cEven where a particular action against an administrative agency was allegedly brought under a statutory judicial review provision, and did not purport to be a mandamus action, this Court has looked to the substance of the action, has held that it could be treated as a common law mandamus or certiorari action ... \u201d); <em>see also Board of License Comm\u2019rs for Anne Arundel County v. Corridor Wine, Inc., </em>361 Md. 403, 411-12, 761 A.2d 916 (2000) (nonstatutory judicial review of administrative adjudicative decision generally denominated as a \u201cmandamus\u201d action).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">\n<em>Nature of Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">\u201cMandamus is an original action, as distinguished from an appeal.\u201d <em>Goodwich v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145, 680 A.2d 1040 (1996) (citation and quotation omitted). It is \u201can extraordinary remedy that is generally used to compel inferior tribunals, public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular duty imposed upon them which in its nature is imperative and to the performance of which the party applying for the writ has a clear legal right. The writ ordinarily does not lie where the action to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>reviewed is discretionary or depends on personal judgment.\u201d <em>Falls Road Community Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. Baltimore County, </em>437 Md. 115, 139, 85 A.3d 185 (2014) (citations and quotations omitted); <em>Dep\u2019t of Human Resources, Baltimore City Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Hayward, </em>426 Md. 638, 646, 45 A.3d 224 (2012). This Court has repeatedly recognized that \u201c[cjourts have the inherent power, through the writ of mandamus, to correct abuses of discretion and arbitrary, illegal, capricious or unreasonable acts; but in exercising that power care must be taken not to interfere with the legislative prerogative, or with the exercise of sound administrative discretion, where discretion is clearly conferred.\u201d <em>Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 281, 40 A.2d 673 (1945); see <em>also Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379, 45 A.2d 73 (1945); <em>Hammond v. Love, </em>187 Md. 138, 143-44, 49 A.2d 75 (1946) <em>cf. Lamb v. Hammond, </em>308 Md. 286, 303-04, 518 A.2d 1057 (1987). \u201cWhere the obligation to perform some particular duty is unclear or involves the exercise of any \u2018vestige of discretion,\u2019 ... the writ of mandamus will not be granted.\u201d <em>Baltimore County v. Baltimore County Fraternal Order of Police Lodge No. 4, </em>439 Md. 547, 571-72, 96 A.3d 742 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">\n<em>Review of Claim that Commission Denied Due Process</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">As outlined above, the Commission has a duty to provide procedural due process, as set forth in the State Constitution and Maryland Rules, to an accused judge who is the subject of one of its proceedings. Thus, under a writ of mandamus, this Court may properly review Judge White\u2019s claim that the Commission deprived her of procedural due process. Were it otherwise, the fundamental fairness embodied in the process set out in the Constitution and rules could be an empty promise.</p>\n<p id=\"b681-7\">\n<em>Review of Merits of Reprimand</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b681-8\">Our review under a writ of mandamus, however, is limited. The Constitution and our rules provide for the Commission to issue a reprimand without approval or review by this Court. The Commission\u2019s decision to issue a public reprimand is properly classified as a non-ministerial discretionary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>act that is dependent upon the judgment of the Commission members. <em>Once the Commission has provided an accused judge with the requisite due process, </em>it is entrusted to the Commission\u2019s discretion whether to dismiss the charges, reprimand the judge, or recommend other discipline to us. Thus, a writ of mandamus is not available to review a claim that the Commission erred in concluding that a judge committed sane-tionable conduct or in its judgment to reprimand the judge as a result of that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">III</p>\n<p id=\"ARU\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">For the reasons stated above, we conclude that this Court has authority to consider Judge White\u2019s arguments as to whether the Commission proceeding accorded her with the due process required by the Maryland Constitution and the Maryland Rules. However, we are not able at this juncture to conduct that review.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The Commission has not responded in any detail to Judge White\u2019s contentions that she did not receive the process she was due. At oral argument, counsel for the Commission expressed some hesitation about responding specifically to the arguments of Judge White concerning the Commission\u2019s alleged deviations from the Maryland Rules, given the confidentiality that clothes much of the Commission\u2019s pre-charging activities. To a certain extent, that concern is well taken. <em>See </em>Maryland Constitution, Article TV, \u00a7 4B(a)(3); Maryland Rule 18-409.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-7\">The statement of charges and the proceedings before the Commission that followed the filing of the statement of charges are <em>not </em>confidential. Maryland Rule 18-409(a)(3). However, the investigation and the process involving the Judicial Inquiry Board, and any other proceedings prior to the filing of charges remain confidential, unless the accused judge files a written waiver of confidentiality. Maryland Rule 18-409(b)(1). To the extent that Judge White bases her claims on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>events that occurred prior to the filing of charges, she should file a written waiver of confidentiality with the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">In order to carry out the review of Commission proceedings for which we have jurisdiction, we direct the Commission to file the record of the proceedings concerning its charges against Judge White, including that part of its record relating to the pre-charging period for which Judge White waives confidentiality. Once the record has been filed with the Court, the parties shall submit additional briefs and an appropriate record extract, according to a schedule set forth by future order of the Court. Such briefing shall be limited to the question of whether the Commission proceedings failed to comply with the Constitution and Maryland Rules and, if so, whether any such failure affected the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-6\">IT IS SO ORDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-6\">.
