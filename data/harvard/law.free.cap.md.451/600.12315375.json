Petitioner, a general contractor who successfully bid for work on a City of Baltimore construction project, argues that Respondent, the project\u2019s design engineering firm, owes it a tort duty of care because Respondent knew that Petitioner would rely on its designs in bidding and constructing the project. We shall hold, that, in the absence of contractual privity, physical injury, ox-risk of physical injury, design professionals in large government construction projects do not owe a tort duty to those who bid for and contract with a government entity.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">The City of Baltimore (\u201cCity\u201d) conti-acted with Rummel Klepper <em>&amp; </em>Kahl, LLP (\u201cEngineer\u201d) to design upgrades to the Patapsco Wastewater Treatment Plant. Under the contract, Engineer was tasked with designing the plans for two interrelated projects, Sanitary Contract 852R (\u201cSC 852R\u201d) and Sanitary Contract 845R (\u201cthe companion project\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc.\u2019s (\u201cContractor\u201d) complaint, Engineer\u2019s responsibilities under the contract included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>\u2022 Developing the design for SC 852R and its companion project;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-4\">\u2022 Developing drawings and specifications for prospective contractors to use when submitting bids and for the successful contractor to use for construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-5\">\u2022 Developing construction timetables for the projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">\u2022 Providing responses to questions from prospective bidders regarding the design of the projects;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-7\">\u2022 Evaluating and commenting on contractors\u2019 bids;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-8\">\u2022 Evaluating and approving submissions from the successful contractor during construction;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-9\">\u2022 Inspecting the successful contractor\u2019s work during construction to ensure conformance with Engineer\u2019s design; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-10\">\u2022 Evaluating and accepting the successful contractor\u2019s work and certifying the work to the City.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">The City opened both projects up to bids through its competitive bidding process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Contractors that submitted bids had to be prequalified as being able to complete the work required by the designs. Contractor<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was the successful bidder for SC 852R,.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under its contract with the City, Contractor agreed to construct 34 denitrification filter cells (\u201cDNF cells\u201d), which are concrete tubs that hold untreated wastewater, next <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>to the existing wastewater treatment facility. Contractor was also to construct \u201cpipes and pipe support systems\u201d for SC 852R. During construction, Contractor encountered leaking and other problems, which resulted in delays and cost overruns.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">In 2014, Contractor filed a complaint against Engineer in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking to recover its financial losses. According to Contractor\u2019s complaint, Engineer designed the DNF cells using expansion and contraction joints that were meant to accommodate changes in water pressure in the cells. On completion, the water retention ability of the DNF cells was tested. The testing revealed leaks due to cracks in the expansion joints. Contractor averred that it constructed the DNF cells according to Engineer\u2019s design, and any leaking from the expansion joints was a \u201cdirect result of deficiencies in [Engineer\u2019s] design.\u201d It alleged \u201csubstantial additional costs, expenses and time to remediate the leaks.\u201d Contractor also claimed that Engineer\u2019s \u201cdesign of the pipe support system was defective,\u201d which caused it to suffer additional financial losses and delays.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Finally, Contractor averred that Engineer failed to timely complete the design for SC 852R\u2019s companion project, which \u201chindered and delayed\u201d Contractor\u2019s construction of SC 852R. Engineer also allegedly failed to warn SC 852R\u2019s prospective bidders of the delayed completion of the companion project\u2019s design and established an unreasonable time line for the completion of SC 852R, which Contractor relied on when submitting its bid. As a result, Contractor claimed, it \u201cincurred significant cost, expense and time for which [Engineer] is responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">In its three-count complaint against Engineer, Contractor brought a professional negligence claim, a negligent misrepresentation claim, and a cause of action based on Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552. As to the professional negligence claim, Contractor alleged that an \u201cintimate nexus\u201d and \u201ccontractual privity equivalent\u201d existed between it and Engineer, and that Engineer owed it a duty of reasonable care \u201cexer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>cised by similarly situated design professionals.\u201d Contractor further alleged that it was a foreseeable party who \u201cwould utilize and directly rely upon [Engineer\u2019s] professional services including, but not limited to, the preliminary and final design of [SC 852R].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b637-4\">In its negligent misrepresentation claim, Contractor asserted that because Engineer designed the interrelated projects, it was aware that any delay in the design of the companion project would impact SC 852R. Contractor also claimed that Engineer intended prospective bidders like Contractor to rely on the time line it had developed for SC 852R when submitting bids for the project, and an intimate nexus and privity equivalent existed between it and Engineer, establishing a duty. In Contractor\u2019s words, Engineer owed it \u201ca duty to fairly and accurately describe the contract duration for [SC 852R] as well as the status of the [companion project\u2019s] design.\u201d In addition, Contractor alleged, Engineer knew that the companion project\u2019s design was not sufficiently complete to allow for timely completion of SC 852R. Therefore, Contractor claimed, Engineer had a duty to advise prospective bidders, including Contractor, that SC 852R could not be completed within the time frame it had established. Finally, in its Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 cause of action, Contractor alleged that Engineer provided designs, plans, and specifications for the construction of SC 852R, which contained deficiencies, and knew or should have known that Contractor would rely on those documents, causing it damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Engineer filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. In its motion, Engineer argued that without privity between the parties, no legally cognizable tort duty ran from Engineer to Contractor that would permit recovery of purely economic losses. Engineer also argued that the intimate nexus test and Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 concepts of extra-contractual duty do not apply to design professionals and, even if they did, Contractor failed to allege facts satisfying these tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>The Circuit Court granted Engineer\u2019s motion to dismiss due to lack of privity between Contractor and Engineer. Contractor appealed. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Contractor\u2019s complaint based on lack of privity. <em>Balfour Beatty Infrastructure, Inc. v. Rummel Klepper &amp; Kohl, LLP, </em>226 Md.App. 420, 130 A.3d 1024 (2016). It held that the economic loss doctrine barred Contractor\u2019s negligence and negligent misrepresentation claims, and that privity equivalent concepts of extra-contractual duty did not apply in Contractor\u2019s case. <em>Id. </em>at 445, 452-53, 459-60, 130 A.3d 1024.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-4\">We granted Contractor\u2019s Petition for Writ of Certiorari to consider the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">1. Does the economic loss doctrine bar a general contractor\u2019s professional negligence claim against a design professional on a government construction project under the privity-equivalent analysis of the intimate nexus test?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">2. Does the economic loss doctrine bar a general contractor\u2019s action for negligent misrepresentation against a design professional on a government construction project?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-7\">3. Does the economic loss doctrine bar a general contractor\u2019s action under the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 against a design professional on a government construction project?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b639-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>Because we answer yes to all three questions and decline to apply the privity-equivalent component of the intimate nexus test, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">We review a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion to dismiss to determine whether it was legally correct. <em>Kiriakos v. Phillips, </em>448 Md. 440, 454, 139 A.3d 1006 (2016) (citation omitted). In conducting this review, we assume that the facts and allegations in the complaint, and any inferences that may be drawn from them, are true and view them in a light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Rounds v. Md-Nat\u2019l Capital Park &amp; Planning Comm\u2019n, </em>441 Md. 621, 636, 109 A.3d 639 (2015) (citation omitted). The Court does not, however, accept conclusory allegations and assertions containing insufficient facts as true. <em>State Ctr., LLC v. Lexington Charles Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>438 Md. 451, 497, 92 A.3d 400 (2014) (citation omitted). We only consider the well-pleaded facts to determine whether the complaint states a cause of action for which relief may be granted. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Contractor\u2019s overarching contention is that the economic loss doctrine<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> does not apply to its claims of professional negligence, Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552, and negligent misrepresentation because it only applies in products <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>liability cases. Instead, Contractor avers, the intimate nexus test applies to its claims, and the alleg\u2019ations in its complaint satisfy the test. Therefore, Contractor asserts, Engineer owes it a duty of care and may be held liable in tort for the economic losses it has incurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">Engineer urges us to apply the economic loss doctrine, which is a principle courts have used to limit the expansion of tort liability absent privity. Engineer avers that under this doctrine there is no liability without privity when a plaintiff has suffered only economic loss without physical injury or risk thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">Professional Negligence</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Contractor contends that Engineer is liable for damages it sustained under a negligence theory. Contractor asserts that Engineer owed it a duty of care, and Engineer breached that duty when it failed to: (1) properly design DNF cells and a pipe support system for the SC 852R project; (2) establish a reasonable timetable for the SC 852R project; (3) timely design the companion project; and (4) inform Contractor that completion of the companion project\u2019s design was delayed. Contractor avers that the allegations contained in its complaint establish a privity-equivalent intimate nexus between it and Engineer.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, Contractor contends, Engineer owed it a tort duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">To establish a negligence claim, a plaintiff must allege facts showing that: (1) the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care; (2) the defendant breached that duty; (3) the plaintiff sustained an injury or loss; and (4) the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty was the proximate cause of the plaintiffs injury. <em>100 Inv. Ltd. P\u2019ship v. Columbia Town Ctr. Title Co., </em>430 Md. 197, 213, 60 A.3d 1 (2013) (citation omitted). In a negligence claim against a provider of professional services, the professional is held to the standard of care of his or her profession. <em>See Schultz v. Bank of Am., N.A., </em>413 Md. 15, 28-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>29, 990 A.2d 1078 (2010). But without a duty of care, there is no liability in negligence. <em>Walpert, Smullian &amp; Blumenthal, P.A. v. Katz, </em>361 Md. 646, 666, 762 A.2d 582 (2000) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">Maryland defines \u201cduty\u201d as \u201can obligation to which the law will give effect and recognition to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u201d <em>Jacques v.

As Professors Prosser and Keeton have explained, duty is \u201can expression of the sum total of those considerations of policy which lead the law to say that the plaintiff is entitled to protection.\u201d W. Page Keeton et ah, Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 53, at 358 (5th ed. 1984). \u201cTo determine whether a tort duty exists in a particular context, we examine: (1) \u2018the nature of the harm likely to result from a failure to exercise due care,\u2019 and (2) \u2018the relationship that exists between the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>100 Inn Ltd, P\u2019ship, </em>430 Md. at 213-14, 60 A.3d 1 (quoting <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 534, 515 A.2d 756).</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">\n<em>Privity, Tort Duty, and the Economic Loss Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">The economic loss doctrine represents a judicial refusal to extend tort liability to negligence that causes purely economic harm in the absence of privity, physical injury, or risk of physical injury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See Seely v.

In Maryland, the economic loss doctrine bars recovery when the parties are not in privity with one another or the alleged negligent conduct did not result in physical injury or risk of severe physical injury or death. <em>Lloyd, </em>397 Md. at 128-29, 916 A.2d 257; <em>see also Morris v.

Whiting-Turner Contracting Co., </em>308 Md. 18, 22, 517 A.2d 336 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b643-4\">We discussed the evolution of tort law and the economic loss doctrine in the construction context in <em>Whiting-Turner. </em>In that case, condominium owners brought a negligence suit against the general contractor and architect who constructed their condominiums, alleging that defectively constructed electrical ductwork had created a fire hazard, rendering the units uninhabitable.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We recognized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-5\">privity is not an absolute prerequisite to the existence of a tort duty in this type of case, and that the duty of builders and architects to use due care in the design, inspection, and construction of a building extends to those persons foresee-ably subjected to the risk of personal injury because of a latent and unreasonably dangerous condition resulting from that negligence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b643-6\"><em>Whiting-Turner, </em>308 Md. at 22, 517 A.2d 336. Therefore, we concluded, the condominium owners could recover the reasonable cost of fixing the defective ductwork even without privity or actual physical harm. <em>Id. </em>at 35, 517 A.2d 336.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">In reaching its holding, the <em>Whiting-Turner </em>Court discussed the traditional requirement of privity in construction cases and the erosion of that requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b643-8\">In its early development, the law relating to builders and architects generally held that their duty did not extend to those with whom they had no contractual privity. Gradually, however, exceptions to the general rule of nonliability were judicially recognized. Actions in negligence were permitted, for example, where the contractor had practiced fraud or deceit or had deliberately concealed defects in the work; where construction created a condition that was imminently or inherently dangerous; or where the contractor created a nuisance per se.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 24-25, 517 A.2d 336 (footnote omitted). Examining the gradual progression of tort law, the Court relied on Professors Harper, James, and Gray for their acknowledgment that in building and construction work \u201c[t]he modern tendency has been to measure the scope of duty here by the same broad principles of negligence as are generally applied in the field of accidental injuries.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 26, 517 A.2d 336 (quoting 3 F. Harper, F. James &amp; 0. Gray, The Law of Torts \u00a7 18.5, at 708-10 (2d ed. 1986)). The Court concluded, \u201c[T]he rule of nonlia-bility ... has now evolved into a general rule of liability where the result of negligence is the creation of a dangerous condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27, 517 A.2d 336 (emphasis added). To explain this duty, it used the words of Professors Prosser and Keeton:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-4\">[T]he contractor is liable to all those who may foreseeably be injured by the structure, not only when he fails to disclose dangerous conditions known to him, <em>but also when the work is negligently done. </em>This applies not only to contractors doing original work, but also to those who make repairs, or install parts, as well as supervising architects and engineers. There may be liability for negligent design, as well as for negligent construction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b644-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 27-28, 517 A.2d 336 (emphasis in original) (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 104A, at 723 (5th ed. 1984)). Therefore, the recovery of economic losses for the repair or remedy of defective conditions was permitted, provided it was necessary to prevent physical injury. In other words, the prospect of physical injury was sufficient to warrant imposing a tort duty in the absence of privity.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">\n<em>The Intimate Nexus Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">In cases where there were no safety concerns and the risk was purely economic, as in this case, the privity requirement did not erode so quickly or so far. Instead, in such cases we have refrained from finding a tort duty absent privity or its equivalent\u2014i.e., an \u201cintimate nexus.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>537, 515 A.2d 756; <em>Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 681, 762 A.2d 582; <em>see also 100 Inv. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>430 Md. at 219, 60 A.3d 1. Put differently, the intimate nexus test requires the relationship between the parties to be sufficiently close\u2014or intimate\u2014to support finding a tort duty. <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 535, 515 A.2d 756. In these cases, if an intimate nexus was established, a duty of care was owed, and the defendant could be held liable to the plaintiff for pecuniary losses. <em>Id. </em>at 534, 515 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-4\">In Jacques\u2014where we adopted the intimate nexus test\u2014the Court ruled that a bank owed its customers a duty of reasonable care in processing a home loan application. In reaching its holding, the Court discussed two leading cases from the Court of Appeals of New <em>York\u2014Glanzer v. Shepard, </em>233 N.Y. 236, 135 N.E. 275 (1922), and <em>Ultramares Corporation v. Touche, </em>255 N.Y. 170, 174 N.E. 441 (1931)\u2014to determine whether an intimate nexus existed between the parties and, consequently, a duty of care was owed. <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 535-36, 515 A.2d 756. In <em>Glanzer, </em>the court permitted a bean purchaser to recover purely economic losses in tort from a public bean weigher even though the weigher\u2019s contract was with the bean seller. <em>Glanzer </em>held that the weigher owed a duty in tort to the purchaser because the sale of the beans was the end goal of the transaction, and, as a public weigher, in undertaking to weigh the beans he assumed a duty to do so with reasonable care. <em>Glanzer, </em>135 N.E. at 276-77. In discussing <em>Glanzer, </em>the <em>Jacques </em>Court emphasized the nature of the contractual relationship between the seller and the weigher and that the weigher held itself out as \u201cskilled and careful in its calling.\u201d <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 535-36, 515 A.2d 756 (citing <em>Glanzer, </em>135 N.E. at 276).</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">In <em>Ultramares, </em>on the other hand, the same court declined to impose a tort duty of care running from accountants to recipients of their audit reports for alleged negligent misrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>resentations in the reports. The <em>Ultramares </em>court reasoned that if it imposed a duty, a \u201cthoughtless slip or blunder ... may expose accountants to a liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class.\u201d <em>Ultramares, </em>174 N.E. at 444. Distinguishing <em>Glanzer, </em>the <em>Ultramares </em>court reasoned that the \u201cintimacy of the resulting nexus\u201d between the weigher and the purchaser \u201cwas so close as to approach that of privity, if not [be] completely one with it,\u201d which warranted finding a tort duty, <em>Id. </em>at 445-46. The court found that the accountants in <em>Ultramares, </em>by contrast, did not have such a relationship with the recipients of their audit reports. <em>Id. </em>at 446. The <em>Jacques </em>Court emphasized that even though the accountants were generally on notice that nonclients might rely on their audit reports, the relationship between them and the nonclients was not close enough to support finding an intimate nexus\u2014and corresponding tort duty\u2014like in <em>Glanzer. Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 536, 515 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-4\">The <em>Jacques </em>Court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b646-5\">As the magnitude of the risk increases, the requirement of privity is relaxed\u2014thus justifying the imposition of a duty in favor of a large class of persons where the risk is of death or personal injury. Conversely, as the magnitude of the risk decreases, a closer relationship between the parties must be shown to support a tort duty. Therefore, if the risk created by negligent conduct is no greater than one of economic loss, generally no tort duty will be found absent a showing of privity or its equivalent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b646-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 537, 515 A.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">Relying on <em>Glanzer </em>and <em>Ultramares, </em>the <em>Jacques </em>Court \u201cexaminfed] carefully the relationship that existed between these parties\u201d because \u201cthe harm likely to result from negligent processing of a loan application is limited to economic loss.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 535, 515 A.2d 756. The Court found that the relationship between the parties amounted to a contract because the bank agreed to process the customers\u2019 loan application and \u201clock in\u201d a specific interest rate in exchange for a processing fee. <em>Id. </em>at 537-38, 515 A.2d 756. This contract, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>Court reasoned, included an implied promise by the bank to use reasonable care in processing the application. <em>Id. </em>at 540, 515 A.2d 756. The Court also considered the customers\u2019 reliance on the bank and found that they were \u201cparticularly vulnerable and dependent on the [blank\u2019s exercise of due care\u201d because the bank was aware of the restrictive financing provisions in the customers\u2019 contract for sale, which required them to settle with whatever loan they could obtain at the agreed rate of interest. <em>Id. </em>at 540\u201441, 515 A.2d 756. Therefore, we held that the bank owed the customers a duty in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Based on Judge Cardozo\u2019s description of the defendants\u2019 professions as a \u201cpublic calling\u201d in <em>Glanzer </em>and <em>Ultramares, </em>the <em>Jacques </em>Court also found relevant \u201cthe nature of the business of the party upon whom the burden is sought to be imposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 515 A.2d 756. The Court emphasized the \u201cpublic nature\u201d of the bank. <em>Id. </em>at 542, 515 A.2d 756. It reasoned that the banking industry is \u201caffected with the public interest\u201d and banks and their officers have been \u201cheld to a high degree of integrity and responsiveness to their public calling,\u201d which also supported finding a tort duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">Fourteen years later, in <em>Walpert, </em>an accountant liability case, we adopted the three-part test from <em>Credit Alliance Corporation v. Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., </em>65 N.Y.2d 536, 493 N.Y.S.2d 435, 483 N.E.2d 110 (1985), as one way to establish an intimate nexus between parties. <em>Walpert, </em>361 Md. at 674, 762 A.2d 582. The <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test requires the plaintiff to show: (1) the accountants were aware that their financial reports were to be used for a particular purpose; (2) a known party was intended to rely on the reports; and (3) conduct linking the accountants to the party that demonstrates the accountants\u2019 understanding of the party\u2019s reliance. <em>Id. </em>In adopting the test, we noted that the reason for requiring privity or its equivalent to impose tort liability is \u201cto limit the defendant\u2019s risk exposure to an actually foreseeable extent, thus permitting a defendant to control the risk to which the defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 671, 762 A.2d 582. After examining duty analyses from other jurisdictions, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>concluded that the <em>Credit Alliance </em>test most closely reflected Maryland\u2019s policy concerns because it would \u201climit[ ] the unpredictable and unlimited nature of economic damages.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 675, 762 A.2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">Initially, the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test applied only to accountants, but we have since applied it to title examiners. <em>See 100 Inv. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>430 Md. at 222, 60 A.3d 1. But <em>Walpert </em>is the only case in which we have used the test to find an <em>intimate </em>nexus between an individual and a third party not in privity.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 361 Md. at 693-94, 762 A.2d 582,</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">We have, however, considered whether there was an intimate nexus between parties without applying the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test. We found that the parties\u2019 relationship lacked an intimate nexus in the following cases: <em>Blondell v. Littlepage, </em>413 Md. 96, 991 A,2d 80 (2010) (no tort duty owed by one attorney to another in joint representation); <em>Remsburg v. Montgomery, </em>376 Md. 568, 831 A.2d 18 (2003) (leader of a hunting party owed property owners no duty of care); <em>Jones v. Hyatt Ins. Agency, Inc., </em>356 Md. 639, 741 A.2d 1099 (1999) (insurance agent who failed to obtain insurance not liable to accident victim); <em>Noble v. Bruce, </em>349 Md. 730, 709 A.2d 1264 (1998) (attorney not liable to non-client beneficiaries of a will); <em>Erie Ins. Co. v. Chops, </em>322 Md. 79, 585 A.2d 232 (1991) (insurer\u2019s failure to comply with statutory duty to report lapse in motorist\u2019s coverage to the Motor Vehicle Administration did not render it liable to accident victims).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">In other situations, we considered the relationship between the parties sufficient to establish an intimate nexus. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number><em>Weisman v. Connors, </em>312 Md. 428, 540 A.2d 783 (1988), involved an employee who sued his employer for alleged negligent misrepresentations made during pre-employment negotiations\u2014at two in-person meetings and in several phone conversations the employer had made certain promises to induce him to leave his previous employer. <em>Id. </em>at 432-33, 540 A.2d 783. Because the employer\u2019s objective was to \u201csell\u201d the employee on the idea of leaving his current employer during \u201cface-to-face precontractual discussions,\u201d we held that a jury could find that there was an intimate nexus between the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 448-49, 540 A.2d 783. In reaching this conclusion, we reasoned that the employee \u201chad a great stake in receiving accurate information\u201d and the employer \u201chad to realize that negligence on his part in conveying such information could result in considerable economic harm to [the employee].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 449, 540 A.2d 783. Because their relationship \u201cmore closely resemble[d] the intimacy of the <em>Glanzer </em>parties than the remoteness of the <em>Ultramares </em>relationship,\u201d the jury could find a tort duty. <em>Id. </em>Similar negligent misrepresentations in \u201cintensive communications\u201d regarding employment were the basis for liability in <em>Griesi v. Atlantic General Hospital Corporation, </em>360 Md. 1, 756 A.2d 548 (2000).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Weisman </em>and <em>Griesi </em>illustrate that we consider the closeness of the relationship between the parties\u2014especially one party\u2019s reliance on the other party\u2019s exercise of due care\u2014when determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>there is an intimate nexus that would support finding a duty of care.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">In <em>Chicago Title Insurance Co. v. Allfirst Bank, </em>394 Md. 270, 905 A.2d 366 (2006), we found a privity-equivalent intimate nexus between the third-party drawer of a check and a depositary bank. Without citing the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test, we used one of its criteria in our analysis\u2014linking conduct.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 299, 905 A.2d 366. The check at issue was made payable to the depositary bank (not the bearer) for the purpose of paying off a customer\u2019s mortgage loan as part of a refinancing. <em>Id. </em>at 278, 905 A.2d 366. Instead of applying the funds to the outstanding balance, the depositary bank credited the customer\u2019s personal, non-mortgage account. <em>Id. </em>When the customer then defaulted on his loan, the drawer\u2014the title company that conducted the settlement\u2014learned that the funds had been misapplied and the original mortgage had never been released. <em>Id. </em>at 279, 905 A.2d 366. In finding an intimate nexus, we reasoned that the depositary bank had already received one check from the drawer and a payoff request from the new lender. <em>Id. </em>at 298-99, 905 A.2d 366. Thus, the bank knew, or should have known, that the title company expected the proceeds of the check to pay off the loan. <em>Id. </em>As a result, we held that the depositary bank had a duty to the title company to exercise due care in handling its check. <em>Id. </em>at 300, 905 A.2d 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">These cases illustrate that regardless of whether we apply the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test, our privity-equivalent analysis in economic loss cases looks for linking conduct\u2014 enough to show the defendant knew or should have known of the plaintiffs reliance. This means, of course, that context is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>critical. <em>Blondell, </em>413 Md. at 122, 991 A.2d 80 (quoting Dan B.

We have yet to apply the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test or the privity-equivalent analysis in the public construction context and, as discussed below, Engineer argues that there are many reasons why we should not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">\n<em>The Construction Industry and the Privity-Equivalent Intimate Nexus Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">First, Engineer avers, the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>criteria only apply to accountants.

Without a contract, Engineer contends, the economic loss doctrine bars Contractor\u2019s claims. Contractor, on the other hand, asserts that its lack of a contract with Engineer is precisely why we should permit it to bring a negligence claim under the intimate nexus test.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Jurisdictions are split over whether to apply the economic loss doctrine in the construction context.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <em>See </em>A.

We are not persuaded by Engineer\u2019s arguments that the <em>Credit AlliancefWalpert </em>test must be limited to accountants. As we have said, \u201ceven states which limit tort actions for negligent performance of a contract generally permit recovery in tort for economic losses caused by the negligent services of a professional.\u201d <em>100 Inv. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>430 Md. at 228, 60 A.3d 1 (citation omitted). We have emphasized that \u201cin those occupations requiring peculiar skill, a tort duty to act with reasonable care will be imposed on those who hold themselves out as possessing the requisite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>skill,\u201d regardless of whether the parties are in contractual privity. <em>Jacques, </em>307 Md. at 541, 515 A.2d 756. These occupations include \u201cprofessionals such as physicians, attorneys, architects, and public accountants.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Instead, we find persuasive the logic of states barring negligence claims for purely economic damages against design professionals in complex construction projects absent privity. But our view turns on the unique aspects of large-scale public construction, rather than the finer distinctions of tort law.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-4\">The New York Court of Appeals, in <em>Ossining, </em>extended the <em>Credit Alliance </em>test to design professionals in the construction industry.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> <em>Ossining, </em>541 N.Y.S.2d 335, 539 N.E.2d at 95. Although acknowledging that the <em>Credit Alliance </em>test had developed \u201cin the context of cases involving accountants,\u201d the court refused to draw a \u201ccategorical distinction\u201d between architects and accountants. <em>Id., </em>541 N.Y.S.2d 335, 539 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>at 94-95.

An Indiana case explains the construction industry\u2019s contractual landscape well:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b656-5\">Perhaps more than any other industry, the construction industry is vitally enmeshed in our economy and dependent on settled expectations. The parties involved in a construction project rely on intricate, highly sophisticated contracts to define the relative rights and responsibilities of the many persons whose efforts are required\u2014owner, architect, engineer, general contractor, subcontractor, materials supplier\u2014and to allocate among them the risk of problems, delays, extra costs, unforeseen site conditions, and defects. Imposition of tort duties that cut across those contractual lines disrupts and frustrates the parties\u2019 contractual allocation of risk and permits the circumvention of a carefully negotiated contractual balance among owner, builder, and design professional.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b656-6\"><em>Indianapolis-Marion Cty. Pub. Library, </em>929 N.E.2d at 737-38 (quoting Sidney R. Barrett, Jr., <em>Recovery of Economic Loss in Tort for Construction Defects: A Critical Analysis, </em>40 S.C. L.

U.S. Gypsum Co., </em>315 Md. 741, 556 A.2d 1126 (1989), a case decided before we adopted the <em>Credit Alliance/Walpert </em>test, Contractor argues that to establish a duty under a negligent misrepresentation theory, the defendant only needs to know the class of potential plaintiffs, not the specific potential plaintiff. Contractor\u2019s reliance on <em>Village of Cross Keys </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">In <em>Village of Cross Keys, </em>a condominium developer and architect sued the manufacturer that designed a curtain wall system for negligent misrepresentation, alleging that errors in the design documents, upon which they relied in constructing a curtain wall, resulted in water leaks in several condominium units. <em>Id. </em>at 745, 748, 556 A.2d 1126. The manufacturer had paid to publish the design in a construction industry trade catalogue that design professionals, including the architect in the case, purchase. <em>Id. </em>at 757, 556 A.2d 1126 n.6. The Court held that the manufacturer did not owe the developer and architect a duty of care because they had not used several of the manufacturer\u2019s component parts required by the design. <em>Id. </em>at 759-60, 556 A.2d 1126. In dicta, the Court declined to foreclose the possibility that a manufacturer could be held liable for deficiencies in such designs. <em>Id. </em>at 758-59, 556 A.2d 1126. The Court stated, \u201cAlthough the group of persons who may be expected to rely upon information of this kind may be large, they are identifiable, particularly if the group is limited to architects and structural engineers. That their names cannot be known in advance is of no consequence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 758, 556 A.2d 1126. The Court emphasized that the reason the manufacturer could be held liable was that it would profit from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>sale of its component parts as a result of publishing the design in the catalogue. <em>Id. </em>at 759, 556 A.2d 1126.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\">Contractor argues that this dicta supports imposing a tort duty on Engineer, but we disagree. Unlike <em>Village of Cross Keys, </em>this case involves an underlying web of contracts that allocates risk and liability. In <em>Village of Cross Keys, </em>the architect and developer used the curtain wall design specifications they found in a trade magazine. They had no opportunity to negotiate a contract with the manufacturer regarding the cost or remedies. There was no competitive bidding process or contract governing liability. Here, by contrast, Contractor had the opportunity to review Engineer\u2019s design, ask for clarifications, and submit a bid detailing how much it would cost to construct the project. In other words, Contractor was able to evaluate whether it could complete the project and at what cost, and the City was free to accept or reject its bid. If Contractor was not satisfied with the City\u2019s contract, it could have negotiated different terms or bid on a different project.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Contractor also included in its complaint a \u201cRestatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552\u201d count. This Restatement section describes a type of negligent misrepresentation, and was cited with approval in our discussion of duty and what constitutes a privity equivalent in <em>Swinson v. Lords Landing Village Condominium, </em>360 Md. 462, 758 A.2d 1008 (2000). We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-6\">One \u201cequivalent\u201d is stated in \u00a7 552 of the [Restatement (Second) of Torts] (1965), which, in relevant part, provides that (1) a person who, in the course of its business, supplies false information for the guidance of others in their business transactions, is subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by their justifiable reliance on that information, if the person fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in obtaining or communicating the information, and (2) the liability of a person who is under a public duty to give the information extends to loss suffered by any of the class of persons for whose benefit the duty is created, in any of the transactions in which it is intended to protect them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 477, 758 A.2d 1008. This description of a privity equivalent, like others, still depends upon judicial recognition of a tort duty. But we have already concluded that the privity-equivalent intimate nexus test does not apply to large-scale government construction projects such as this one because the complex web of contractual arrangements predominates and injecting a tort duty is not in the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">We apply the economic loss doctrine and decline to impose tort liability on Engineer for purely economic injuries alleged by Contractor that was neither in privity nor suffered physical injury or risk of physical injury. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

Did the [Court of Special Appeals] err by applying the economic loss doctrine to a limited class of professionals\u2014designers in government contracts\u2014to shield an engineer from liability to a contractor when the engineer knows that its services will be relied upon to the contractor\u2019s detriment if the engineer's services are negligently performed; i.e., [do] the intimate nexus and privity equivalent \u201ctests\u201d apply to an action by a contractor against an engineer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-10\">2. Does the economic loss doctrine bar a government contractor's action under the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 552 against an engineer who negligently supplied information when all other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>elements are met and when other professional providers of information are not so protected?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b639-9\">3. Does the economic loss doctrine bar a government contractor\u2019s action for negligent misrepresentation against an engineer when the engineer: (a) intended the contractor to rely upon the representations (i.e., [its] design); (b) knew that the contractor would rely upon the design; and, (c) knew that the contractor would be harmed if the design was negligently performed?</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b639-10\">. The economic loss doctrine is also referred to as the \"economic loss rule.\u201d We will use \"economic loss doctrine\u201d throughout this opinion for consistency,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b640-8\">. Contractor concedes that it does not have a contract with Engineer.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b641-7\">. Before the rise of negligence in the early twentieth century, courts typically required privity of contract to find a tort duty, even in cases of physical injury. This rule originated from the 1842 English case, <em>Winterbottom v. Wright, </em>152 Eng. Rep. 402 (1842). In <em>Winterbottom, </em>the Court of the Exchequer ruled that the driver of a stagecoach who was injured when its wheel collapsed had no cause of action against the defendant who had been hired to maintain the coach because there was no privily of contract between them. Although the court only held that there was no breach of contract action, courts interpreting the case took it to mean that a tort action was also precluded. <em>See </em>W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts \u00a7 104A, at 668 (5th ed. 1984); <em>Council of Co-Owners Atlantis Condo., Inc. v. Whiting-Turner Contracting Co,, </em>308 Md. 18, 27 n,3, 517 A.2d 336 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b642-4\">. The origin of the economic loss doctrine in its modem form is typically traced to <em>Seely v. White Motor Company, </em>63 Cal.2d 9, 45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d 145 (1965) (Traynor, C.J.), a products liability case. 5 Philip L. Bruner &amp; Patrick J. O\u2019Connor, Jr., Bruner &amp; O\u2019Connor Construction Law \u00a7 17:89 (2002). In <em>Seely, </em>David Seely purchased a truck manufactured by White Motor Company from Southern Truck Sales for his heavy-load hauling business. Right after purchase, Seely noticed that the track \"bounced violently.\u201d <em>Seely, </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 147. Ultimately the brakes on the track failed and the truck flipped over, but Seely did not sustain any injuries. Seely then sued Southern and White for damages to repair the truck, lost profits, and the money he had paid toward the purchase price. <em>Id. </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 147-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">The California Supreme Court held that Seely could recover damages for lost profits and money paid toward the purchase price of the truck on a warranty theory of liability. <em>Id. </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 148. In so holding, the court rejected a strict products liability theory of recovery because consumers do not typically communicate their economic expectations to manufacturers and manufacturers cannot use disclaimers to limit their liability. <em>Id. </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 150. If this were the case, the court reasoned, the manufacturer \"would be liable for damages of unknown and unlimited scope.\u201d <em>Id. </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 150-51. Thus, absent an agreement, the manufacturer should not be held liable for losses that were purely economic. <em>Id. </em>45 Cal.Rptr. 17, 403 P.2d at 151.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b643-9\">.
