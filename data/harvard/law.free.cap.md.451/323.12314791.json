Under Maryland law, generally, insurers are required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>provide drivers with liability, PIP, and uninsured/underin-sured motorist (\u201cUM/UIM\u201d) coverage. See Md. Code Ann., Ins. (1997, 2011 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\u201cIN\u201d) \u00a7\u00a7 19-504,19-505, 19-509; Md. Code Ann., Transp. (1977, 2012 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.) (\u201cTR\u201d) \u00a7 17-103. And, where a motor vehicle insurance policy contains PIP coverage and UM/UIM coverage, an insurer is required to provide PIP coverage to an insured or an insured\u2019s resident family member who is injured in a motor vehicle accident \u201cwhile occupying a motor vehicle for which the coverages described in [IN] \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 [ (PIP coverage) ] and 19-509 [ (UM/UIM coverage) ] are not in effect[.]\u201d IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i). The definition of a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014501(b)(2)(ii), however, expressly excludes taxicabs as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of Subtitle 5 of Title 19 of the Insurance Article; thus, IN \u00a7 19-505(a) does not require insurers to offer PIP coverage in policies insuring taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">This case raises the overall issue of whether an insurer of a personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy, which includes PIP coverage, is responsible for PIP coverage for injuries that an insured sustained while driving a taxicab owned by the insured but not covered by the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy, or whether the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy\u2019s owned but not insured exclusion applies, such that the insurer is not responsible for PIP coverage under those circumstances. To answer that overarching question, this Court must determine three very specific issues: (1) whether a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the statutory exclusion from PIP coverage under IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) and for the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i); (2) whether \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) means uninsured altogether, uninsured for PIP coverage, or not insured under the relevant motor vehicle liability insurance policy; and (3) whether the exclusion in the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy in this case\u2014which excluded coverage, in pertinent part, for the insured \u201cwhile occupying a motor vehicle owned by [the insured] ... and which is not insured under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>liability coverage of this policy\u201d (capitalization omitted)\u2014is authorized by the statutory exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii), the \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">As to the primary question presented in this case, we hold that an insurer of a personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy, which includes PIP coverage, is not responsible, as a result of the application of the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy\u2019s owned but not insured exclusion, for PIP coverage for injuries the insured sustained while driving a taxicab owned by the insured but not covered by the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy. As to the more specific underlying issues, we conclude that: (1) a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) and for the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i); (2) \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d under IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) means uninsured for PIP coverage, such that a motor vehicle, including a taxicab, that is not insured for PIP coverage is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii); and (3) the exclusion in the personal motor vehicle insurance policy in this case is authorized by the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii). Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">On November 14, 2011, Alhassan Bundu-Conteh (\u201cBundu-Conteh\u201d), Respondent, was rear-ended by a motor vehicle while driving his taxicab. Bundu-Conteh sustained personal injuries. At the time of the accident, Bundu-Conteh owned two vehicles: a 1997 Jeep Grand Cherokee (\u201cthe Jeep\u201d) and a 2006 Ford Crown Victoria taxicab (\u201cthe taxicab\u201d). The Jeep was insured under a liability and no-fault policy with State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company (\u201cState Farm\u201d), Respondent, which included PIP coverage. The taxicab was insured by Amalgamated Insurance Company (\u201cAmalgamat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>ed\u201d) and earned liability-only coverage, which does not include PIP coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">Following the accident, Bundu-Conteh submitted a PIP claim to State Farm for the injuries that he sustained. State Farm denied Bundu-Conteh\u2019s PIP claim, relying on the following exclusion (\u201cthe third exclusion\u201d) for no-fault coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-5\">Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-6\">THERE IS NO COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-7\"># * #</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-8\">3. FOR YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE WHILE OCCUPYING A MOTOR VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE AND WHICH IS NOT INSURED UNDER THE LIABILITY COVERAGE OF THIS POLICY!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">Bundu-Conteh subsequently filed a complaint with the Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cthe MIA\u201d), Petitioner. In the complaint, Bundu-Conteh contended that the third exclusion was inapplicable to him because, at the time of the accident, he was driving a taxicab, which IN \u00a7 19-501(b)(2)(ii) excludes from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Alternatively, Bundu-Conteh argued that, even if the taxicab were categorized as a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d the third exclusion in the State Farm policy is incompatible with well-settled Maryland law.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>On December 27, 2012, after completing its review of the ease, the MIA concluded that State Farm\u2019s denial of Bundu-Conteh\u2019s PIP claim violated IN \u00a7\u00a7 4-118,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 19-505,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 19-513,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and 27-303.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the MIA determined that, pursuant to IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d), State Farm is obligated to provide PIP benefits to its insured policy holders who are injured in a motor vehicle accident, subject to limited exclusions. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>ing to the MIA, the third exclusion in State Farm\u2019s policy is incompatible 'with the exclusions under IN \u00a7 19-505(c) and thus constitutes \u201can arbitrary and capricious denial of a claim without just cause[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">On January 25, 2013, State Farm appealed the MIA\u2019s determination and requested a hearing. Specifically, State Farm contended that the third exclusion fell squarely within the \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion under IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) and, thus, was permissible. According to State Farm, the taxicab was \u201cuninsured\u201d for the purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) because it was not insured under the State Farm policy. Both State Farm and the MIA, on Bundu-Conteh\u2019s behalf, filed with the Maryland Insurance Commissioner (\u201cthe Commissioner\u201d) cross-motions for summary decision. On August 15, 2013, the Commissioner held a hearing on the cross-motions for summary decision. On January 24, 2014, the Commissioner issued a Memorandum and Final Order, concluding that State Farm\u2019s denial of coverage to Bundu-Conteh violated IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-513. The Commissioner determined that the third exclusion is not a permissible exclusion under IN \u00a7 19-505(c). Specifically, the Commissioner determined that, under the plain language of IN \u00a7 19-505(e)(l)(ii), the meaning of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is \u201ca motor vehicle without insurance.\u201d Thus, the Commissioner concluded that to interpret IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) as excluding coverage for individuals like Bundu-Conteh, who carried PIP coverage on their vehicles and were not injured while in an \u201cuninsured\u201d vehicle, \u201cwould be contrary to the remedial legislative purpose of assuring compensation for damages to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to fault.\u201d The Commissioner, therefore, granted the MIA\u2019s motion for summary decision and ordered State Farm to pay Bundu-Conteh\u2019s PIP claim arising from the accident plus 1.5% interest for each intervening month starting 30 days after Bundu-Conteh first submitted his PIP claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">On February 20, 2014, State Farm filed in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City (\u201cthe circuit court\u201d) a petition for judicial review. On January 9, 2015, the circuit court issued a Memo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>randum and Order reversing the Commissioner\u2019s Final Order. On January 29, 2015, the MIA noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion dated March 15, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. State Farm subsequently requested that the Court of Special Appeals report the opinion. On June 1, 2016, the Court of Special Appeals reported the opinion. See Md. Ins. Admin. v. State Farm Mut. Auto, Ins. Co., 228 Md.App. 126, 137 A.3d 310 (2016). The MIA thereafter filed in this Court a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>which we granted on September 2, 2016. See Md. Ins. Admin. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins., 450 Md. 102, 146 A.3d 463 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AAb\">The Parties\u2019 Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">The MIA contends that the Court of Special Appeals erred by not affording deference to the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of IN \u00a7 19-505. According to the MIA, the Commissioner correctly determined that, at the time of the accident, Bundu-Conteh was not driving an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d and, thus, the exclusion under IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1)(ii) does not apply. Indeed, the MIA argues that the taxicab was neither a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d nor \u201cuninsured.\u201d Furthermore, the MIA asserts that the third exclusion of State Farm\u2019s policy is not authorized by IN \u00a7 19-505(c), and thus is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">State Farm responds that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of \u201cuninsured\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505 was erroneous. Specifically, State Farm argues that well-established Maryland law requires that the definition of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d be interpreted contextually, and, in this context, \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d refers to vehicles without PIP coverage. Thus, State Farm asserts that Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab was, by definition, an uninsured motor vehicle at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">State Farm further contends that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of the taxicab as \u201cinsured\u201d for the purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505 provides a windfall for individuals like Bundu-Con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>teh, who, theoretically, could carry PIP coverage on only one vehicle, purchase multiple other vehicles, insure them at the bare minimum level of coverage, and subsequently rely on the single PIP policy to cover all of the vehicles. State Farm also argues that the Commissioner misapplied relevant Maryland case law. Specifically, State Farm argues that the Commissioner erroneously relied on Nasseri v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co., 390 Md. 188, 888 A.2d 284 (2005), which, according to State Farm, is distinguishable from the instant case, as it did not contemplate the owned but uninsured exclusion under IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">In reply, the MIA contends that the Commissioner\u2019s plain language interpretation of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is consistent with the underlying legislative intent underlying the no-fault provisions of the Insurance Article. The MIA argues that the General Assembly enacted the owned but uninsured exclusion to specifically address \u201cuninsured\u201d <em>vehicles\u2014ie. </em>vehicles entirely lacking insurance\u2014not those lacking only PIP coverage. Additionally, the MIA asserts that the statutes in the Insurance Article are remedial, and should be liberally construed in favor of the insured. Furthermore, the MIA maintains that the Commissioner\u2019s interpretation of IN \u00a7 19-505 would not provide insured motorists like Bundu-Conteh with a windfall, but, in the event that it did, this would be an issue for the General Assembly to resolve.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">In Md. Aviation Admin. v. Noland, 386 Md. 556, 571, 873 A.2d 1145, 1154 (2005), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">A court\u2019s role in reviewing an administrative agency adjudicatory decision is narrow; it is limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">(Citations and internal quotation marks omitted); see also Charles Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. Vann, 382 Md. 286, 295, 855 A.2d 313, 319 (2004) (\u201cWhen an agency makes \u2018conclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>sions of law\u2019 in a contested case, the [Administrative Procedure Act] permits the court, on judicial review, to decide the correctness of the agency\u2019s conclusions and to substitute the court\u2019s judgment for that of the agency\u2019s.\u201d (Citations omitted)). Furthermore, \u201can administrative agency\u2019s interpretation and application of the statute which the agency administers should ordinarily be given considerable weight by reviewing courts.\u201d Bd. of Physician Quality Assurance v. Banks, 354 Md. 59, 69, 729 A.2d 376, 381 (1999) (citations omitted). \u201cHowever, if we determine that the agency\u2019s decision is based on an erroneous conclusion of law, no deference is given to those conclusions.\u201d Kenwood Gardens Condos., Inc, v. Whalen Props., LLC, 449 Md. 313, 325, 144 A.3d 647, 655 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">In addition, because the issue in this case involves statutory interpretation, we set forth the pertinent rules of statutory construction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">As this Court has explained, to determine that purpose or policy, we look first to the language of the statute, giving it its natural and ordinary meaning. We do so on the tacit theory that the General Assembly is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the General Assembly\u2019s intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute\u2019s meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives, and the purpose of the enactment under consideration. We have said that there is an ambiguity within a statute when there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia\u2014among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">In construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which is appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Bottini v. Dep\u2019t of Fin., 450 Md. 177, 187-89, 147 A.3d 371, 378 (2016) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">Relevant Law</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">In 1972, the General Assembly required PIP coverage as part of a larger statutory scheme that introduced no-fault coverage to the Maryland insurance marketplace and created <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund (\u201cthe MAIF\u201d) to expand access to motor vehicle insurance. See 1972 Md. Laws 281-82 (Ch. 73, H.B. 444). This Court has remarked that \u201c[t]he requirement of [PIP] coverage was a major innovation in 1972; it represented the State\u2019s limited endorsement of the concept of no-fault automobile insurance, then being widely touted as the answer to perceived flaws in our system of compensating those injured in motor vehicle accidents.\u201d Md. Auto. Ins. Fund v. Perry, 356 Md. 668, 675, 741 A.2d 1114, 1118 (1999). Broadly, \u201c[t]he thrust of the 1972 law was to extend, not restrict, insurance protection, especially a limited amount of primary, no-fault benefits for wage loss and basic medical expenses.\u201d Id. at 675, 741 A.2d at 1118. Indeed, this Court has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-4\">PIP is a form of no fault insurance, that allows the insured to recover for medical expenses and lost income resulting from a motor vehicle accident. Its main purpose is to assure financial compensation to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to the fault of a named insured or other persons entitled to PIP benefits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">TravCo Ins.

See IN \u00a7 19-505(c). Relevant to this case is the \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1) (ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">An insurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAW0\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>(ii) the named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an injury that occurs while the named insured or family member is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\">1. the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\">2. an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">The General Assembly created the owned but uninsured exclusion through the enactment Chapter 573 of the Acts of 1982 (\u201cChapter 573\u201d). 1982 Md.

Nat\u2019l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, 288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734 (1980). In that case, the plaintiff, Doris Gartelman (\u201cGartelman\u201d), was injured while driving her husband\u2019s moped when another motor vehicle forced the moped off the road. See id. at 153, 416 A.2d at 735. At the time of the accident, the moped was uninsured, but Gartelman claimed PIP and UM coverage under her husband\u2019s insurance policy with Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance (\u201cPennsylvania National\u201d). See id. at 153, 416 A.2d at 735. Pennsylvania National denied Gartelman\u2019s claim, relying on an owned but uninsured exclusion in the policy. See id. at 155, 416 A.2d at 736. Given that Maryland\u2019s motor vehicle insurance statutes did not include or authorize an owned but uninsured exclusion, this Court invalidated Pennsylvania National\u2019s policy exclusion, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7a\">[The statute] expressly provides for only four exclusions from the required PIP coverage. It does not expressly provide an exclusion for an insured occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by a named insured. We decline to insert such an exclusion which would be contrary to the remedial legislative purpose of assuring compensation for damages to victims of motor vehicle accidents without regard to fault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">Id. at 156-157, 416 A.2d at 737. Indeed, following Gartelman, we remarked that \u201cthis Court has consistently held that exclusions from statutorily mandated insurance coverage not expressly authorized by the [General Assembly] generally will not be recognized.\u201d Nasseri, 390 Md. at 198, 888 A.2d at 290 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In rendering the Final Order, the Commissioner relied on Nasseri, 390 Md. 188, 888 A.2d 284, so we set forth the facts and holdings of that case in detail. In Nasseri, id. at 196, 888 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>A.2d at 288-89, we held that a taxicab driver was entitled to PIP coverage from the insurance policy on his personal vehicle when he sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident while driving a taxicab that he did not own. The plaintiff, Ebrahim Nasseri (\u201cNasseri\u201d), was injured in a motor vehicle accident while driving a taxicab that belonged to Action Taxicab, Inc. See id. at 191, 888 A.2d at 285. The taxicab was covered under a liability-only policy, but Nasseri maintained insurance coverage, including PIP coverage, on his personal vehicle through GEICO General Insurance Company (\u201cGEICO\u201d). See id. at 191, 888 A.2d at 285-86. Nasseri filed a claim on his GEICO policy for the injuries that he sustained in the accident. See id. at 191, 888 A.2d at 286. GEICO denied the claim, arguing that, because Nasseri was driving a taxicab at the time of the accident, he was not injured in a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505. Nasseri, 390 Md. at 191, 888 A.2d at 286. Furthermore, GEICO asserted that Nasseri\u2019s policy did not apply because it included an exclusion that specified that an insured was \u201cnot covered if injured while in, or through being struck by, any motor vehicle which is not an insured auto if it is ... available for the regular use of the insured.\u201d Id. at 190-92, 888 A.2d at 285-86 (ellipsis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The trial court found in favor of GEICO. See id. at 192, 888 A.2d at 286. We reversed. See id. at 193, 888 A.2d at 286.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">Turning first to the issue of whether Nasseri was involved in a \u201cmotor vehicle accident,\u201d we observed the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIq\">For purposes of this case, we shall assume <em>arguendo </em>that the statutory phrase \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d in subsection [IN \u00a7 19\u2014501](c)(l) incorporates the taxicab exclusion in subsection [IN \u00a7 19\u2014501 ](b)(2)(ii), and that an accident between two taxicabs might not be a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d within the meaning of subsection [IN \u00a7 19-501](c)(l). Nevertheless, as long as another motor vehicle, which is not a taxicab or bus, is involved in the accident, such accident plainly comes within the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d in subsection [IN \u00a7 19-501](c)(l). The subsection requires only the involvement of one motor vehicle for there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>to be a motor vehicle aecident; it does not require that all vehicles involved in the collision be \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA0C\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\">Nasseri was certainly injured in a motor vehicle accident under the language of the statute, and [IN] \u00a7 19-605 provides PIP coverage for anyone injured in <em>any </em>motor vehicle accident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Nasseri, 390 Md. at 193-94, 888 A.2d at 287 (italics in original). Interpreting the language of IN \u00a7 19-513, we explained that the circumstances of Nasseri\u2019s accident appeared to fall squarely within the coverage contemplated under the Insurance Article:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">The applicability of [IN] \u00a7 19-505, under the circumstances of this case, is reinforced by the language of [IN] \u00a7 19-513(d)(1)\u00ae [ ]. [IN \u00a7 ] 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i) states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">\u201c[ ](1) The insurer under a policy that contains the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle shall pay the benefits described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 to an individual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-8\">(i) while occupying a motor vehicle for which the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle are not in effect....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-9\">It would appear that the above-quoted language was directly aimed at circumstances like those presented here. The vehicles \u201cfor which the coverages described in [IN] \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509\u201d would legally not be \u201cin effect\u201d are taxicabs, buses, vehicles owned by the State of Maryland, and vehicles for which the first named insured has made \u201can affirmative written waiver of PIP benefits.\u201d In this case, Nasseri had an insurance policy providing PIP benefits, and he was occupying a motor vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect. A holding that he was not entitled to PIP benefits, precisely because he was occupying a vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect, could not be reconciled with [IN] \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Nasseri, 390 Md. at 194-95, 888 A.2d at 287-88 (emphasis added) (ellipsis in original) (brackets and footnotes omitted). We considered the legislative intent behind excluding taxicabs from classification as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d and observed that the rationale for doing so was merely to exclude taxicabs and certain other vehicles from compulsory PIP and similar coverage. See id. at 195-96, 888 A.2d at 288. Thus, we explained that \u201c[t]he purpose was not to negate required PIP and other required coverages, under policies on all other types of motor vehicles, whenever a taxicab happened to be involved in an accident with another type of motor vehicle.\u201d Id. at 196, 888 A.2d at 288. We, therefore, concluded that \u201can insured, who has PIP coverage under a policy on the insured\u2019s motor vehicle, and who is injured in an accident while occupying a different motor vehicle owned by someone else, is ordinarily entitled to PIP coverage under the policy on the insured\u2019s vehicle.\u201d Id. at 196, 888 A.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">We also considered whether GEICO\u2019s \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion was permissible under IN \u00a7 19-505. See Nasseri, 390 Md. at 197, 888 A.2d at 288.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Looking to the plain language of IN \u00a7 19-505(c), we concluded that the \u201cregular use\u201d exclusion was not one of the exclusions contemplated by the General Assembly, and thus was impermissible. See Nasseri, 390 Md. at 197-98, 888 A.2d at 289. We observed that, under well-settled law in Maryland, this Court will not expand the exclusions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>insurance coverage beyond those explicitly enumerated by the General Assembly. See id. at 198, 888 A.2d at 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">As to an owned but uninsured exclusion, in Gov\u2019t Emps. Ins. Co. v. Comer, 419 Md. 89, 98, 18 A.3d 830, 835 (2011), this Court upheld the exclusion of UM/UIM coverage under IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1) when the vehicle was owned by the insured but covered under a different insurance policy. IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1) pertains to UM/UIM benefits, and includes language that closely mirrors IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-5\">(f) Exclusions.\u2014An insurer may exclude from the uninsured motorist coverage required by this section benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah-\">(1) the named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an injury that occurs when the named insured or family member is occupying or is struck as a pedestrian by an uninsured motor vehicle that is owned by the named insured or an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">In Comer, 419 Md. at 98,18 A.3d at 835, we concluded that a motorcycle was \u201cuninsured\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-509(f)(1)\u00bb and thus was excluded from coverage. In that case, the plaintiff, Ray Comer (\u201cComer\u201d), was injured in a motor vehicle accident when his motorcycle collided with another vehicle. See id. at 91-93,18 A,3d at 831-32. The medical costs associated with Comer\u2019s injuries exceeded $200,000. See id. at 92,18 A,3d at 831. Comer had insured the motorcycle under a policy with Progressive Insurance Co., which included an UM/UIM limit of $50,000. See id. at 92,18 A.3d at 831. At the time of the accident, Comer was living with his father, who owned a 2000 Buick that was covered under a policy with GEICO with a UM/UIM limit of $300,000. See id. at 92, 18 A.3d at 831. Comer filed a claim with GEICO, asserting that he qualified as \u201cinsured\u201d because he lived with his father. See id. at 92,18 A.3d at 832. GEICO denied Comer\u2019s claim on the ground of the following policy exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b376-7\">\u201cEXCLUSIONS</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAWk\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>4. <em>Bodily Injury </em>sustained by an <em>insured </em>while occupying a motor vehicle owned by an <em>insured </em>and not described in the declarations and not covered by the bodily injury and property damage liability coverages of this policy is not covered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">Id. at 93, 18 A.3d at 832 (emphasis in original). Comer filed a complaint against GEICO, and the trial court ultimately issued a declaratory judgment in Comer\u2019s favor, finding that GEI-CO\u2019s exclusion was ambiguous and impermissible under IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1). See Comer, 419 Md. at 93-95, 18 A.3d at 832-33. We reversed. See id. at 100,18 A.3d at 836.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Turning first to the issue of ambiguity, we determined that the language in GEICO\u2019s exclusion was not ambiguous, and observed that the language of the exclusion \u201cclearly preclude[d] coverage of Comer\u2019s claim under the GEICO policy[ ]\u201d because he was driving a vehicle that he owned and that was not covered under the GEICO policy, Id. at 96,18 A.3d at 834. We then considered whether the exclusion was permissible under IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1), and concluded that it was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">In determining whether exclusion number 4, as applied to this case, is authorized by the statute, the only possible ambiguity is the statute\u2019s reference to \u201can uninsured motor vehicle\u201d owned by the family member. Nevertheless, Comer\u2019s motorcycle was \u201cuninsured\u201d under the declarations and liability coverage of the GEICO policy. Moreover, as earlier noted ... the word \u201cuninsured\u201d in [IN] \u00a7 19-509 includes \u201cunderinsured.\u201d Comer\u2019s motorcycle was clearly an underin-sured motor vehicle.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Comer, 419 Md. at 98, 18 A.3d at 835. In reaching this conclusion, we observed that invalidating the owned but uninsured UM/UIM exclusion could potentially produce an illogical result:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">One purpose of exclusion 4 in the GEICO policy, as well as a purpose of [IN] \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1), is obviously to prevent a family, owning several motor vehicles, from insuring only one or two of them with an insurer, leaving the other vehicles uninsured, or underinsured under a different policy, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>and being able to claim uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits from the first insurer even though no premium was \u25a0 paid to the first insurer for coverage of the other vehicles. An interpretation of the Insurance Code that would allow this would be unreasonable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Comer, 419 Md. at 98,18 A.8d at 885.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">Our holding in Comer, id. at 100, 18 A.3d at 836, was informed by the Court of Special Appeals\u2019s decision in Powell v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 86 Md.App. 98, 585 A.2d 286 (1991). Specifically, in Powell, id. at 100,115, 101, 585 A.2d at 287, 294, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that an owned but uninsured exclusion was authorized by IN \u00a7 19-509(f)(l)\u2019s predecessor.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In that case, Kenneth Powell (\u201cMr. Powell\u201d) was injured in a motor vehicle accident while driving his wife (\u201cMrs. Powell\u201d)\u2019s vehicle. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d 286-87. Mrs. Powell\u2019s vehicle was covered under a policy with State Farm, which included $20,000/$40,000 in UM/UIM coverage. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d 286-87. Mr. Powell\u2019s vehicle, also covered under a policy with State Farm, included $100, 000/$300,000 in UM/UIM coverage. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 287. Following the accident, Mr. Powell submitted a claim to State Farm under the policy covering his vehicle. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 287. State Farm denied the claim, relying on the following exclusion contained in the policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-6\">THERE IS NO COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-7\">* * * * \u215d \u215d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-8\">2. FOR <em>BODILY INJURY </em>TO <em>YOU </em>... WHILE <em>OCCUPYING </em>... A MOTOR VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU, YOUR SPOUSE OR ANY <em>RELATIVE, </em>and which is not insured under the liability coverage of this policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 287 (emphasis in original). Mr. Powell contended that the exclusion was invalid, because, as the named insured on the policy, Mr. Powell had coverage that followed him and applied to any vehicle he drove. See id. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>100-01, 585 A.2d at 287. The Court of Special Appeals disagreed, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-4\">We do not believe the statute, by extending coverage to the insured when involved in any accident, enlarged the class of \u201cinsured motor vehicles\u201d under policies of insurance. Thus, when [Mr. Powell\u2019s] policy\u2019s language excludes coverage for a <em>vehicle </em>owned by the named insured or his spouse and which was not insured under the liability coverage of \u201cthis policy,\u201d it was referring to vehicles not described in the policy of insurance at issue, such as [Mrs. Powell\u2019s vehicle]. The clause provides that the uninsured motorist coverage under Mr. Powell\u2019s policy does not apply if he was occupying a motor vehicle owned by his wife that was not described as an insured vehicle in his policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">Id. at 102-08, 585 A.2d at 288 (emphasis in original). Thus, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the policy clearly excluded coverage for vehicles owned by the insured or a member of the insured\u2019s family and not covered under the policy. See id. at 103, 585 A.2d at 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">As to the policy\u2019s compliance with IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(l)\u2019s predecessor, the Court of Special Appeals observed that \u201cwhen a policy provision is not in conflict with the statute, that provision will be enforced, the statute\u2019s underlying purpose notwithstanding.\u201d Id. at 107, 585 A.2d at 290 (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted). The Court of Special Appeals noted that the underlying policy considerations for the exclusions contained in IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(l)\u2019s predecessor would be contravened by Mr. Powell\u2019s interpretation of the statute as granting coverage to the insured regardless of which vehicle was involved in the accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">The obvious purpose of the policy exclusion as to uninsured vehicles is to prohibit a person from purchasing insurance for one car only and utilizing that coverage as to other vehicles owned by the insured through the \u201cin any accident\u201d provision of the policy. This type of prohibition is not against public policy. To apply its language as [Mr. Powell] urges would invite multi-vehicle families to insure only one vehicle. It would play havoc with premium determinations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>and otherwise be detrimental to the process of providing liability protection to the motorists, and others, of Maryland. [Mr. Powell]\u2019s interpretation of the clause, if adopted, would be, as we see it, contrary to public policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Id. at 107-08, 585 A.2d at 290. The Court of Special Appeals was unpersuaded by Mr. Powell\u2019s contention that his wife\u2019s vehicle was not \u201cuninsured\u201d for the purpose of the exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANK\">To hold as [Mr. Powell] also urges, <em>ie., </em>that [Mrs. Powellj\u2019s vehicle was not <em>uninsured </em>because it was covered under another policy, would be to permit an owner to buy excess coverage under one policy for one vehicle at a relatively small premium and coverage under a separate policy for his other vehicles at a lesser cost, and have the excess coverage of the first policy apply to the vehicles covered under the subsequent policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">Id. at 110, 585 A.2d at 291 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). The Court of Special Appeals found support for its holding in the legislative intent behind IN \u00a7 19-509(f)(l)\u2019s predecessor. See Powell, 86 Md.App. at 111, 585 A.2d at 292. Indeed, the Court of Special Appeals observed that the General Assembly\u2019s addition of the \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion following this Court\u2019s decision in Gartelman evinced the General Assembly\u2019s intent \u201cthat the exclusion extend to vehicles owned by a named insured\u2019s spouse that are not covered under the policy at issue.\u201d Powell, 86 Md.App. at 111, 585 A.2d at 292. Thus, the Court of Special Appeals declined to \u201cin-creas[e] the minimum required coverage by judicial fiat.\u201d Id. at 118, 585 A.2d at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">In Gonzalez v. Md. Auto. Ins. Fund, 628 A.2d 101, 101-02 (D.C. 1993), a case factually similar to the instant case, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (\u201cDC Court of Appeals\u201d) relied on Powell in concluding that a taxicab was an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of an owned but uninsured UM/UIM coverage exclusion. The insured, Mario Gonzalez (\u201cGonzalez\u201d), owned a taxicab and a personal vehicle, which he insured under different policies. See id. at 101. Gonzalez maintained only liability coverage on the taxicab, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>carried UM/UIM coverage under his policy with the MAIF on his personal vehicle. See id. Gonzalez sustained personal injuries when an uninsured motorist struck his taxicab. See id. He subsequently filed a claim for coverage with the MAIF, which denied his claim on the grounds that the taxicab was an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d See id. at 101-02. Applying Maryland law, the DC Court of Appeals agreed with the MAIF, concluding that, \u201cunder the reasoning of the <em>Powell </em>[Cjourt, the exclusion from [Gonzalezjs MAIF policy of his taxi is not contrary to public policy and thus applies.\u201d Gonzalez, 628 A.2d at 108.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Here, as to the overall question presented in this case, we hold that an insurer of a personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy, which includes PIP coverage, is not responsible, as a result of the application of the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy\u2019s owned but not insured exclusion, for PIP coverage for injuries that the insured sustained while driving a taxicab owned by the insured but not covered by the personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Stated in terms of this case, we hold that the third exclusion in State Farm\u2019s policy applies and that State Farm is not responsible for PIP coverage for the injuries that Bundu-Conteh sustained while driving the taxicab, which was owned by Bundu-Conteh, but not insured with State Farm; <em>ie., </em>Bundu-Conteh is not entitled to PIP coverage under the State Farm policy. As to the more specific issues underlying that predominant holding, we conclude that: (1) a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(e)(l)(ii) and the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i); (2) \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) means uninsured for PIP coverage, such that a motor vehicle, including a taxicab, that is not insured for PIP coverage is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1)(ii); and (3) the third exclusion in the State Farm policy in this case is authorized by the owned but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">In this case, we are confronted with a circumstance in which broad application of the statutorily provided definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19~501(b), and specifically IN \u00a7 19\u2014601(b)(2) (ii)\u2019s exclusion of a taxicab as a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d potentially renders other sections of Subtitle 5 of Title 19 of the Insurance Article illogical. To discern the meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as it is defined in IN \u00a7 19\u2014501(b) and as it is used in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) (\u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d) and IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i) (\u201cmotor vehicle\u201d), we apply the rules of statutory construction. We begin by examining the language of IN \u00a7 19-501(b), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-5\">(b) <em>Motor </em>vehicle.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">(1) \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d means a vehicle, including a trailer, that is operated or designed for operation on a public road by any power other than animal or muscular power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-7\">(2) \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d does not include:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-8\">(i) a bus as defined in \u00a7 11-105 of the Transportation Article; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-9\">(ii) a taxicab as defined in \u00a7 11-165 of the Transportation Article.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">By its language, IN \u00a7 19-501(b) excludes certain vehicles\u2014 namely, buses and taxicabs\u2014that would otherwise be considered \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d under IN \u00a7 19-501(b)(l)\u2019s definition, because a bus or a taxicab certainly is a vehicle \u201cthat is operated or designed for operation on a public road by [] power other than animal or muscular power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">We observe, however, that IN \u00a7 19-501(b)\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and its exclusion of a taxicab as a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d differ from the ordinary, commonsense meaning and understanding of the term \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d See Bottini, 450 Md. at 195, 147 A.3d at 382 (\u201cTo ascertain the natural and ordinary meaning of [a term], we look to dictionary definitions as a starting point.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). Merriam-Webster defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201can automotive vehicle not operated on rails; <em>especially: </em>one with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>rubber tires for use on highways[.]\u201d Motor Vehicle, Merriam-Webster (2016), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ motor+vehicle [https://perma.cc/2RJX-P5JH]. And, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as \u201c[a] wheeled conveyance that does not run on rails and is self-propelled, especially] one powered by an internal-combustion engine, a battery or fuel-cell, or a combination of these.\u201d Motor Vehicle, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed.' 2014). Thus, under the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and even under IN \u00a7 19-501(b)(l)\u2019s basic definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d a taxicab is a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">Moreover, the ordinary meaning of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d closely aligns with the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in TR \u00a7 ll-135(a), which does not contain any exclusions for taxicabs or buses as IN \u00a7 19-501(b) does. For purposes of the Maryland Vehicle Law, TR \u00a7 ll-135(a) defines a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ALt\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014(1) \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d means ... a vehicle that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">(i) Is self-propelled or propelled by electric power obtained from overhead electrical wires; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">(ii) Is not operated on rails.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">(2) \u201cMotor vehicle\u201d includes a low speed vehicle[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">As stated above, IN \u00a7 19-501(b) provides a similar definition of the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d but excludes certain specified vehicles that would otherwise be considered \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d ie., buses and taxicabs.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">Significantly, the Insurance Article does not define the term \u201ctaxicab,\u201d but instead references the definition in TR \u00a7 11-165. See IN \u00a7 19\u2014501(b)(2)(ii) (\u201c \u2018Motor vehicle\u2019 does not include ... a taxicab as defined in \u00a7 11-165 of the Transportation Article,\u201d). TR \u00a7 ll-165(a) defines \u201ctaxicab\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArfQ\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014\u201cTaxicab\u201d means, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a motor vehicle for hire that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>(1) Is designed to carry seven or fewer individuals, including the driver; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-4\">(2) Is used to accept or solicit passengers for transportation for hire between those points along highways in this State as the passengers request.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">(Emphasis added),<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In other words, under TR \u00a7 11\u2014165(a), a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d just as it is under the plain meaning of the term.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">Thus, IN \u00a7 19-501(b)\u2019s definition of \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d with the exclusion of a taxicab as a motor vehicle, sharply conflicts with the ordinary meaning of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d and the definition of a \u201ctaxicab\u201d in TR \u00a7 ll-165(a). Considering these differing definitions, it is apparent that the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d is subject to more than one reasonable interpretation, specifically as it pertains to taxicabs, and thus is ambiguous. Indeed, in excluding taxicabs from categorization as \u201cmotor vehicles,\u201d IN \u00a7 19\u2014501(b)(2)(ii) specifically references TR \u00a7 11-165, in which a \u201ctaxicab\u201d is defined as a \u201cmotor vehicle.\u201d Furthermore, importantly, the provisions of the Insurance Article relevant to the present case, IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) and IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i), discuss exclusions and benefits only in the context of \u201cmotor vehicles.\u201d IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-7\">An insurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAZy\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-8\">(ii) the named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an injury that occurs while the named insured or family member is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b384-9\">1. the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>2. an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS3\">(Emphasis added). And IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-4\">The insurer under a policy that contains the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle shall pay the benefits described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 to an individual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">(i) while occupying a motor vehicle for which the coverages described in \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-509 of this subtitle are not in effect;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">(Emphasis added). And, IN \u00a7 19-505(a)(l)(i) provides that PIP coverage shall be provided, in pertinent part, to \u201cthe first named insured ... who is injured in any motor vehicle accident, including an accident that involves an uninsured motor vehicle or a motor vehicle the identity of which cannot be ascertained!.]\u201d (Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">This definitional conundrum becomes problematic in circumstances, such as those of the instant case, wherein an individual occupying a taxicab or other non-motor vehicle seeks to avail him- or herself of the protections provided by IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-513, <em>ie., </em>PIP coverage. Although the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under IN \u00a7 19-501(b) expressly excludes taxicabs, we observe that, when that definition is applied to other provisions of the Insurance Article\u2014namely, IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-513\u2014it produces an unreasonable and indeed illogical result. Were we to exclude taxicabs from classification as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-513, any passenger who is injured while riding in a taxicab and who personally carries PIP coverage through his or her own motor vehicle liability insurance policy would be unable to make a claim for PIP coverage. This is so because, as discussed above, a taxicab is not required to obtain PIP coverage; accordingly, because PIP coverage is not in effect, IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l) applies, IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">The insurer under a policy that contains [PIP and UM/ UIM] coverages ... shall pay the benefits ... to an individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident: (i) while occupying a motor vehicle for which [PIP and UM/UIM] coverages ... are not in effect; or (ii) by a motor vehicle for which [PIP and UM/UIM] coverages ... are not in effect as a pedestrian!.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">(Paragraph breaks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In other words, for an insured\u2019s PIP coverage to follow the insured, the insured would need to be injured in a motor vehicle accident while occupying a motor vehicle (not a taxicab) that does not have PIP coverage, or would need to be injured in a motor vehicle accident by being struck by a motor vehicle (not a taxicab) as a pedestrian. Under these circumstances, a passenger of a taxicab that did not have PIP coverage, but who had PIP coverage under his or her own motor vehicle liability insurance policy and who was involved in a motor vehicle accident, would have PIP coverage only if the passenger jumped or fell out of the taxicab and was hit, as a pedestrian, by the motor vehicle. In that case, IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(ii) would apply, and PIP coverage would follow the passenger. For example, had Bundu-Conteh been a pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle, there would be no dispute as to his PIP coverage, subject to any applicable exclusions. This is, obviously, an absurd result that the General Assembly could not have intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Although we did not directly decide in Nasseri whether a taxicab was a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for the purpose of IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(1), we highlighted the illogical result that would arise were we to determine that passengers of a taxicab were unable to avail themselves of PIP coverage contained in their own motor vehicle liability insurance policies simply because they were in a taxicab at the time of an accident:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-7\">Nasseri was injured in an accident involving his taxicab and a motor vehicle which was neither a taxicab nor a bus. Nasseri was certainly injured in a motor vehicle accident under the language of the statute, and [IN] \u00a7 19-505 provides PIP coverage for anyone injured in <em>any </em>motor vehicle accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>The applicability of [IN] \u00a7 19-505, under the circumstances of this case, is reinforced by the language of [IN] \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i) ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b387-4\">It would appear that the [] language [of IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i) ] was directly aimed at circumstances like those presented here. The vehicles \u201cfor which [PIP and UM/UIM] coverages ...\u201d would legally not be \u201cin effect\u201d are taxicabs, buses, vehicles owned by the State of Maryland, and vehicles for which the first named insured has made \u201can affirmative written waiver of PIP benefits.\u201d In this case, Nasseri had an insurance policy providing PIP benefits, and he was occupying a motor vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect. A holding that he was not entitled to PIP benefits, precisely because he was occupying a vehicle for which PIP benefits were not in effect, could not be reconciled with [IN] \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Nasseri, 390 Md. at 194-95, 888 A.2d at 287-88 (footnotes and brackets omitted). Plainly, such a result would run entirely counter to the remedial nature of the motor vehicle insurance statutes and the purpose of PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Furthermore, nothing in the legislative history of 1977 Md. Laws 2656-57 (Ch. 655, H.B. 1272), which deleted taxicabs from the definition of \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d in what is now IN \u00a7 19\u2014501 (b)(2)(ii), indicates that the General Assembly intended to prevent taxicab passengers from availing themselves of PIP coverage contained in their own motor vehicle liability insurance policies, should they be injured in a motor vehicle accident. As we explained in Nasseri, 390 Md. at 195-96, 888 A.2d at 288, \u201c[t]he legislative enactment which deleted taxicabs from the definition of \u2018motor vehicles\u2019 for purposes of certain coverages mandated by the Insurance Code ... was not\u201d a \u201csweeping\u201d change; rather, \u201cthe purpose of Ch[apter] 655 was simply to provide that the compulsory automobile liability insurance policies on taxicabs and certain other vehicles did not have to contain policy provisions for PIP and some other statutory coverages.\u201d Indeed, in Nasseri, id at 196, 888 A.2d at 288, we specifically stated that House Bill 1272\u2019s \u201cpurpose was not to negate required PIP and other required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>coverages, under policies on all other types of motor vehicles, whenever a taxicab happened to be involved in an accident with another type of motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In House Bill 1272\u2019s file, in discussing the impact of House Bill 1272, the MAIF characterized the bill as a money-saving measure, which was forecasted to save the MAIF $577,465 annually. The Taxicab Association of Baltimore City also supported the measure on the ground that mandatory PIP coverage was not intended to apply to taxicabs. The General Assembly\u2019s intent was not to leave otherwise insured individuals unprotected the moment they set foot inside a taxicab. Our construction of the definition of \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d under IN \u00a7 19-501(b) is informed by the remedial purpose of the motor vehicle insurance statutes. As we observed in Gartelman, 288 Md. at 159, 416 A.2d at 738, \u201cMaryland\u2019s uninsured motorist statute is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed in order to promote its purpose of recovery for innocent victims of motor vehicle accidents.\u201d (Citation omitted). To exclude taxicabs from classification as \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7\u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) and 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i) would flout the statutes\u2019 remedial purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Taking into account the language of IN \u00a7 19-501(b) and its legislative history, and to avoid an illogical and contrary result, we conclude that a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) and for the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i), <em>ie., </em>that the term \u201cmotor vehicle,\u201d as used in IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-506 and 19-513, encompasses taxicabs for the purposes of PIP coverage and benefits as well as exclusion from PIP coverage. In so concluding, we do not disturb prior case law interpreting IN \u00a7 19-501 as exempting taxicabs from mandatory PIP and UM/UIM coverage, but not from mandatory liability coverage. See, e.g., Md. Auto. Ins. Fund v. Sun Cab Co., Inc., 305 Md. 807, 813, 506 A.2d 641, 644 (1986). Stated otherwise, nothing in this opinion stands for the proposition that taxicabs are now required to carry PIP coverage. We also note that our conclusion that taxicabs are \u201cmotor vehicles\u201d for purposes of the owned but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) and for the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i) is wholly consistent with how the terms \u201ctaxicab\u201d and \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d are defined in TR \u00a7\u00a7 ll-165(a) and 11-135(a), respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Applying this interpretation of the term \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d in this case leads to the determination that Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505 and 19-513.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, under IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i), Bundu-Conteh, as an insured who has PIP coverage under his personal motor vehicle liability insurance policy with State Farm and who was injured in a motor vehicle accident<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> while occupying a motor <em>vehicle\u2014i.e., </em>the taxicab\u2014for which PIP coverage was not in effect, ordinarily would be entitled to PIP coverage through State Farm, unless an exclusion precluded PIP coverage. Cf. Nasseri, 390 Md. at 196, 888 A.2d at 288-89 (\u201c[A]n insured, who has PIP coverage under a policy on the insured\u2019s motor vehicle, and who is injured in an accident while occupying a different motor vehicle owned by someone else, is ordinarily entitled to PIP coverage under the policy on the insured\u2019s vehicle.... [T]he fact that Nasseri was driving a taxicab furnished no valid basis for denying him PIP benefits required by the Insurance Code.\u201d (Footnote omitted)). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>having determined that Bundu-Conteh was injured in a motor vehicle accident while occupying a motor vehicle, we turn to the exclusions authorized by IN \u00a7 19-505(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Relevant to this case is the owned but uninsured exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii), which provides, in pertinent part, that the \u201cinsurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for ... the named insured ... for an injury that occurs while the named insured ... is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by ... the named insured[.]\u201d (Emphasis added). The phrase \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d is not defined in IN \u00a7 19-505 or in the definitional statute, IN \u00a7 19-501.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Indeed, what \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d means for purposes of the exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014605(c)(l)(ii) appears to be a matter of first impression. As to that, we are presented with several alternatives: namely, that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014605(c)(l)(ii) could mean uninsured altogether, uninsured for PIP coverage, or not insured under the relevant motor vehicle liability insurance policy. We conclude that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) means uninsured for PIP coverage, such that a motor vehicle that is not insured for PIP coverage is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii). We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">First, we are not persuaded that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) simply means not insured under the relevant motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Obviously, any motor vehicle, including a taxicab, insured under one motor vehicle liability insurance policy would not be insured under a different motor vehicle liability insurance policy. Not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>being insured under a particular motor vehicle liability insurance policy does not squarely answer what \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d means in the context of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii). As explained below, this is entirely consistent with Comer and Powell, where the vehicles at issue were not insured with UM/UIM coverage under the relevant motor vehicle liability insurance policies in those cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">We also disagree that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) broadly means a vehicle without any insurance at all. Specifically, the MIA contends that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(e)(l)(ii) means uninsured <em>altogether\u2014ie., </em>without any insurance\u2014and argues that the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the owned but uninsured exclusion was to exclude only motor vehicles totally lacking insurance. In support of its position, the MIA relies on information contained in Senate Bill 983\u2019s file, which indicates that the General Assembly was aware of this Court\u2019s holding in Gartelman and, indeed, enacted Chapter 573, which created the owned but uninsured exclusion, as a result of Gartelman.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, the MIA asserts that the General Assembly sought to prevent only individuals operating a motor vehicle entirely without insurance, as Gartelman was, from availing themselves of the PIP coverage contained in another policy. We disagree with the MIA\u2019s interpretation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent. Here, we review the plain language of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) with an eye toward the real-world outcome that the General Assembly sought to address. See Bottini, 450 Md. at 188, 147 A.3d at 378 (\u201c[T]he meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which is appears.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>(Citation omitted)). Although Gartelman was operating the moped without any insurance, the outcome for the insurer in that case would have been the same had Gartelman carried liability-only <em>insurance\u2014ie., </em>Pennsylvania National would have been required to pay Gartelman\u2019s UM coverage for an accident occurring while Gartelman drove a motor vehicle owned by her husband but uninsured under the Pennsylvania National policy. See Gartelman, 288 Md. at 158, 416 A.2d at 735. This is the outcome that the General Assembly sought to mitigate through the enactment of Chapter 573. We observe that, were we to adopt the MIA\u2019s broad interpretation of \u201cuninsured,\u201d the legislative intent underpinning IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) would not be effectuated as the outcome would essentially be the same as in Gartelman.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Rather, we conclude that, when read in context, the plain language of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(e)(l)(ii) means uninsured for PIP coverage. IN \u00a7 19-505 concerns PIP coverage only, with IN \u00a7 19-505(a) mandating PIP coverage, IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(b) setting forth the minimum benefits required, and IN \u00a7 19-505(c) setting forth permissible exclusions from PIP coverage. IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii), the owned but uninsured exclusion, specifically begins with the clause \u201c[a]n insurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for[.]\u201d The plain language of that clause relates solely to PIP <em>coverage\u2014ie,, </em>the coverage described in IN \u00a7 19-505. The owned but uninsured exclusion states that PIP coverage may be excluded for the named insured \u201cfor an injury that occurs while the named insured ... is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by[] the named insured[.]\u201d IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii). Because IN \u00a7 19-505 concerns only PIP coverage, it is reasonable to read the plain language of \u201cuninsured\u201d to mean uninsured for purposes of <em>PIP\u2014ie., </em>not insured for PIP coverage. Indeed, given IN \u00a7 19-505\u2019s sole focus on PIP coverage, it would not make sense for the term \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) to apply to a motor vehicle that is uninsured altogether.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">Our reading of \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19-506(c)(l)(ii) to mean uninsured for PIP coverage is consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>with the manner in which Maryland courts have interpreted the owned but uninsured exclusion as it relates to UM/UIM coverage to mean uninsured for UM/UIM coverage under the applicable policy, and not to mean uninsured altogether. Indeed, the owned but uninsured exclusions for PIP and UM/ UIM coverage closely mirror one another, and were enacted as part of the same legislation. See Chapter 573; IN \u00a7\u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii), 19\u2014509(f)(1). Thus, analogizing to the owned but uninsured exclusion for UM/UIM coverage is instructive.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">As an example, in Powell, 86 Md.App. at 115, 585 A,2d at 294, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that an owned but uninsured exclusion was authorized under IN \u00a7 19-509(f)(l)\u2019s predecessor, which was the owned but uninsured exclusion for UM/UIM coverage. Again, in that ease, both vehicles were insured and had UM/UIM coverage, albeit in different amounts. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 286-87. In other words, neither vehicle was uninsured altogether. Mr. Powell sought coverage under the policy insuring the vehicle not involved in the accident, which had the higher UM/UIM coverage. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 286-87. That policy, however, had an exclusion for bodily injury to the insured that occurred while the insured occupied a motor vehicle owned by the insured or his or her spouse and that was not insured under the liability coverage of the policy. See id. at 100, 585 A.2d at 287. Despite the circumstance that the vehicle involved in the accident was insured under a separate policy and thus not uninsured altogether, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that the owned but uninsured exclusion was authorized, and operated to preclude coverage under the policy at issue. See id, at 103, 115, 585 A.2d at 288, 294. In so concluding, the Court of Special Appeals specifically rejected the contention that the vehicle involved in the accident was not \u201cuninsured\u201d\u2014-ie., essentially an argument that, if the vehicle were considered insured, then the exclusion would not apply\u2014explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">\u2022 To hold as [Mr. Powell] also urges, <em>ie., </em>that [Mrs, Powellj\u2019s vehicle was not <em>uninsured </em>because it was covered under another policy, would be to permit an owner to buy excess coverage under one policy for one vehicle at a relatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>small premium and coverage under a separate policy for his other vehicles at a lesser cost, and have the excess coverage of the first policy apply to the vehicles covered under the subsequent policies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Id. at 110, 585 A.2d at 291 (emphasis in original) (footnote omitted). The same could be said concerning PIP coverage\u2014 <em>ie., </em>concluding that a vehicle that is insured under another policy without PIP coverage is \u201cinsured\u201d such that the owned but uninsured exclusion is not applicable could result in permitting an insured to purchase PIP coverage under one policy for one vehicle and to not purchase PIP coverage under a second policy for a different vehicle, yet have the PIP coverage of the first policy apply to vehicles covered under the second policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">Similarly, in Comer, 419 Md. at 97-98, 18 A.3d at 835, this Court held that an owned but uninsured exclusion in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy was authorized under IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1) and applicable in the case, even though the vehicle involved in the accident was insured under a separate policy, that had different UM/UIM coverage. In other words, as in Powell, the vehicle at issue in Comer was not uninsured altogether. And, in Comer, 419 Md. at 98, 18 A.3d at 835, this Court explained that one purpose of the insurance policy\u2019s exclusion and the owned but uninsured exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014509(f)(1)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b394-6\">is obviously to prevent a family, owning several motor vehicles, from insuring only one or two of them with an insurer, leaving the other vehicles uninsured, or underin-sured under a different policy, and being able to claim [UM/UIM] benefits from the first insurer even though no premium was paid to the first insurer for coverage of the other vehicles.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Again, the same concern is present as to PIP coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">The MIA contends that Comer and Powell are inapplicable to the present case, as UM/UIM and PIP coverage are distinguishable. To be sure, UM/UIM coverage and PIP coverage are distinct. However, as discussed above, in the context <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>of the owned but uninsured exclusions, the public policy-considerations underpinning those decisions are equally applicable to the instant case. Indeed, to hold, as the MIA contends, that an insured who carries no-fault insurance on one vehicle can then extend that coverage to other vehicles owned by the insured but covered under liability-only coverage, such that that other vehicle is considered \u201cinsured\u201d and not \u201cuninsured\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii), would create an unreasonable result wherein the insurer providing PIP coverage on one vehicle becomes responsible for claims made on another vehicle for which the insured has chosen not to obtain PIP coverage. Cf. Powell, 86 Md.App. at 102, 685 A.2d at 288 (\u201cWe do not believe the statute, by extending coverage to the insured when involved in any accident, enlarged the class of \u2018insured motor vehicles\u2019 under policies of insurance.\u201d).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Having concluded that \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) means uninsured for PIP coverage, we consider whether Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab, which was a motor vehicle as determined above, was an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle.\u201d We conclude that Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab was, in fact, an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d because it was uninsured for PIP coverage; indeed, it is clear from the record that Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab had liability-only coverage and did not have PIP coverage. Thus, although, as discussed above, Bundu-Conteh would generally have PIP coverage through State Farm, even for injuries sustained while driving his taxicab, such PIP coverage properly may be excluded pursuant to IN <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>\u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) because Bundu-Conteh, the named insured, was injured while occupying an uninsured motor vehicle that he owned. Accordingly, we must next determine whether the third exclusion in the State Farm policy in this case is authorized by the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1)(ii). We conclude that third exclusion is authorized and applicable, and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The third exclusion in the no-fault coverage section of the State Farm policy provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">Exclusions</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">THERE IS NO COVERAGE:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-7\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-8\">3. FOR YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE WHILE OCCUPYING A MOTOR VEHICLE OWNED BY YOU OR ANY RESIDENT RELATIVE AND WHICH IS NOT INSURED UNDER THE LIABILITY COVERAGE OF THIS POLICY[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b396-9\">In other words, the provision excludes from no-fault cover<em>age\u2014ie., </em>PIP coverage\u2014any personal injury to the insured while the insured was occupying a motor vehicle owned by the insured, but not covered by liability provisions of the State Farm policy. The third exclusion is unambiguous, and clearly precludes coverage of Bundu-Conteh\u2019s PIP claim under the State Farm policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-10\">As to whether the exclusion is authorized by the General Assembly, we note that \u201c[t]his Court has consistently held that exclusions from statutorily mandated insurance coverage not expressly authorized by the [General Assembly] will not be recognized,\u201d Comer, 419 Md. at 97, 18 A.3d at 834 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that the third exclusion in the State Farm policy is authorized by the General Assembly, and thus is valid. IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-11\">An insurer may exclude from the coverage described in this section benefits for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAMTt\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-12\">(ii) the named insured or a family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>injury that occurs while the named insured or family member is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-4\">1. the named insured; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">2. an immediate family member of the named insured who resides in the named insured\u2019s household.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Here, Bundu-Conteh was the named insured, he was occupying a motor vehicle (the taxicab) owned by him when he was injured, and the taxicab was not insured for PIP coverage and, as such, was \u201cuninsured\u201d within the meaning of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii). What we said in Comer, 419 Md. at 98,18 A.3d at 835, on this point rings equally true in this case\u2014obviously, one purpose of the third exclusion in the State Farm policy and IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) is to prevent a named insured, who owns several motor vehicles, from insuring only one of them with an insurer, leaving the other vehicles uninsured for PIP coverage under a different policy, and then being able to claim PIP coverage and benefits from the first insurer even though no premium was paid to the first insurer for coverage of the other vehicles. Indeed, \u201c[a]n interpretation of the Insurance Code that would allow this would be unreasonable.\u201d Comer, 419 Md. at 98, 18 A.3d at 835. Put simply, the third exclusion in the State Farm policy is authorized by IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) and is applicable under the circumstances of this case. Thus, State Farm properly denied Bundu-Conteh\u2019s PIP claim, as Bundu-Conteh was not entitled to PIP coverage and benefits for the injuries that he sustained while driving the taxicab.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">In sum, we conclude that a taxicab is a \u201cmotor vehicle\u201d for purposes of the owned but uninsured exclusion from PIP coverage set forth in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) and for the payment of benefits under IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i), and that Bundu-Con-teh\u2019s taxicab is a motor vehicle for those purposes. We further determine that an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) means a motor vehicle uninsured for PIP coverage, such that a motor vehicle, including a taxicab, that is not insured for PIP coverage is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(1)(ii). Applying that term to the circumstances of this ease leads to the conclusion that Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab, which was not insured for PIP cover<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>age, is an \u201cuninsured motor vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(1)(H), such that an insurer may properly exclude PIP coverage under the owned but uninsured exclusion. And, we conclude that the third exclusion in the State Farm policy is a valid exclusion that is permissible under IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii). Accordingly, we hold that the third exclusion in the State Farm policy applies in this case, and that State Farm is not responsible for PIP coverage for injuries that Bundu-Conteh sustained while driving the taxicab, which was owned by Bundu-Conteh, but not insured with State Farm. Stated otherwise, we determine that Bundu-Conteh is not entitled to PIP coverage under the State Farm policy under the circumstances of this case. As such, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

He also owned a car that he used for his taxicab business, which he insured with another company that insures taxicabs. Consistent with Maryland law, that insurer did not provide PIP coverage in its policy. (There is no dispute that taxicabs are excluded from the State law concerning PIP coverage\u2014that is, automobile insurers are not required to offer PIP coverage for taxicabs\u2014and there is no indication in the record that they do.)</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">As the Majority opinion indicates, it is often said that PIP coverage follows the <em>person\u2014ie., </em>the insured. Majority op. at 339-40,152 A.3d at 804-05. It is thus undisputed that, if Mr. Bundu-Conteh were walking down the street and hit by a car, he would receive PIP benefits under the policy. If he were riding a bicycle and were involved in a motor vehicle accident, he would be covered. If he were a passenger in a taxicab when it collided with another car, he would be covered. If he were driving a taxicab owned by someone else, he would be covered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">State Farm argues, and the Majority opinion apparently agrees, that PIP coverage does not follow Mr. Bundu-Conteh if he is in an accident while driving a taxicab that he owns and that he has fully insured in accordance with the requirements of State law. The Maryland Insurance Administration (\u201cMIA\u201d), which administers the State Insurance Law, rejected such an incongruous interpretation. So should we.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\n<em>PIP Coverage</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">As the Majority opinion recounts, beginning in 1972, State law required PIP coverage as part of motor vehicle insurance to cover economic losses resulting from automobile accidents. As the Majority opinion also notes, this requirement was indisputably remedial legislation. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 336-38, 357-58, 152 A.3d at 802-03, 815. PIP coverage was part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>no-fault automobile insurance reforms that were adopted in a number of states during the 1970s and 1980s. It was intended to compensate victims of automobile accidents for economic damages more quickly and efficiently, with lower administrative costs and without regard to fault. <em>See generally </em>J.M. Anderson, P. Heaton, &amp; S. J. Carroll, The U.S. Experience with No-Fault Automobile Insurance: A Retrospective (Rand Corporation 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u201cPIP is a pure social risk-allocating mechanism. By mandating PIP, the State has made a public policy decision to provide monetary relief to nearly every victim of a motor vehicle accident occurring in Maryland. Mandatory PIP shifts the risk of caring for these victims from the State to the private sector.\u201d A. Janquitto, Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance (3d ed. 2011) \u00a7 9.1 at 497.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Pertinent to this case, while Maryland law requires PIP coverage on most vehicle policies, it does not require PIP coverage in policies covering taxicabs or buses. IN \u00a7 19-501(b).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> According to the record in this case, the insurer of Mr. Bundu-Conteh did not offer PIP coverage and there is no indication in the record that such coverage is available in Maryland from any insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\n<em>The Statutory Authorization for an \u201cOwned but Uninsured\u201d Exclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">When an insured has PIP coverage through a policy, the insurer must pay PIP benefits whenever the insured is in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>volved in a \u201cmotor vehicle accident\u201d unless the law provides for an exclusion and the insured\u2019s policy includes that exclusion. IN \u00a7 19-505(e). The exclusion at issue in this case appears in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii)l. That provision allows an insurer to have certain exclusions from PIP coverage, including an exclusion for \u201can injury that occurs while the named insured ... is occupying an uninsured motor vehicle owned by ... the named insured.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\n<em>What the \u201cOimed hut Uninsured\u201d Exclusion Means</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">In denying PIP coverage to Mr. Bundu-Conteh, State Farm relied on an exclusion in its policy that it traces to the authorization for an \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion in IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii). On its face, the statutory provision does not apply to this case. Mr. Bundu-Conteh was not occupying an \u201cuninsured\u201d motor vehicle. The taxicab <em>was </em>insured\u2014indeed, it is undisputed that the vehicle had all the insurance coverage required by State law for taxicabs, although that coverage does not include PIP coverage. (Indeed, the record indicates that the insurance company that provided the policy for Mr. Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab does not even offer PIP coverage). State Farm\u2019s argument that its denial of coverage is justified by this provision requires one to rewrite the <em>statute\u2014ie., </em>that the exclusion extends to \u201can injury that occurs while the named insured ... is occupying an-u-ninsured a motor vehicle that, even if insured by another policy, lacks PIP coverage and that is owned by ... the named insured....\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">If the statute were rewritten in that manner, it would be quite at odds with the other exclusions in the statute. Other than an exclusion for a non-resident pedestrian involved in an accident outside Maryland,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the other exclusions all are designed to deny benefits to a person involved in some kind of wrongdoing. In particular, the other exclusions are for (1) a person who intentionally causes the accident,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (2) a person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>operating a vehicle he knows is stolen,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (3) a person committing a felony or attempting to elude the police at the time of the accident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In this context, it is evident that the exclusion for an accident involving an \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d vehicle is meant to allow insurers to deny benefits to those who fail to comply with the compulsory automobile insurance requirement.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The Majority opinion suggests that the exclusion is meant to prevent one who owns multiple automobiles from waiving PIP coverage on all but one of the vehicles and then collecting PIP benefits if the individual happened to be in an accident in one of the cars for which he had waived PIP coverage.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Majority op. at 333-84, 345-51, 366-67, 152 A.3d at 801, 808-11, 821. However, the statute already eliminates that possibility. As the Majority opinion notes elsewhere, under IN \u00a7 19-506(b), a waiver of PIP coverage for one vehicle means that the insured forgoes PIP benefits anywhere. <em>See </em>Majority op. at 338-39, 152 A.3d at 803-04. But that is not this case. Mr. Bundu-Conteh did not waive PIP coverage in his State Farm policy. Nor did he waive PIP coverage for his taxicab; under State law, the insurer did not offer it to him and was not required to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The legislative history of the statute confirms this understanding of the statute. Authorization for an \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion was added to the statute by the Legislature in 1982. Chapter 573, Laws of Maryland 1982. That bill was evidently a response to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Pennsylvania Nat. Mut. Gas. Ins. Co. v. Gartelman, </em>288 Md. 151, 416 A.2d 734 (1980), in which the claimant sought PIP benefits under her husband\u2019s automobile policy after she was injured while occupying a vehicle (a moped) that had no insurance at all. This Court held that, in the absence of legislative authorization, an insurer could not deny PIP benefits to one who was insured under a policy including such benefits, but who was injured while operating an uninsured vehicle.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The legislative file contains copies of the <em>Gartelman </em>decision; it also contains a copy of a floor report, which notes that the bill was \u201cin response to\u201d that decision. As indicated above, the <em>Gartelman </em>decision involved a situation in which the injured party was operating a vehicle <em>without any insurance,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is also notable that, in the synopsis of the bill that appears in the floor report, the only definition of \u201cuninsured vehicle\u201d in the synopsis refers to a \u201cvehicle whose coverage is less than the coverage <em>required to be provided by law.\u201d </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Thus, neither the plain language of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) nor its legislative history supports a. denial of PIP coverage to an insured who also owns and operates a properly insured taxicab. As this Court has stated on numerous occasions: \u201cWhere statutory language is plain and unambiguous, and expresses a definite meaning consonant with the statute\u2019s purpose, courts must not insert or delete words to make a statute express an intention different from its clear meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Moreover, given the remedial purpose of the statutory requirement of PIP coverage, the statute should be construed liberally to promote its purpose.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">Given the plain language of the statute and its legislative history, it is perhaps unsurprising that the agency charged with administering the State insurance law agrees with this interpretation. As the Majority opinion notes, the Insurance Commissioner concluded that the authorization for an \u201cowned but uninsured\u201d exclusion in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii) refers to a motor vehicle without any insurance. Majority op. at 332-33, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>152 A.3d at 800-01. The MIA\u2019s construction of the statute is entitled to considerable weight. <em>Crofton Convalescent Center, Inc. v. DHMH, </em>413 Md. 201, 215, 991 A.2d 1257 (2010); <em>Maryland Aviation Administration v. Noland, </em>386 Md. 556, 572, 873 A.2d 1145 (2005); <em>Maryland Insurance Commissioner v. Kaplan, </em>434 Md. 280, 298, 75 A.3d 298 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Moreover, an authoritative treatise on the State motor vehicle insurance law likewise agrees with this interpretation. <em>See </em>A. Janquitto, Maryland Motor Vehicle Insurance (3d ed. 2011) \u00a7 9.8(A)(7) at pp. 541-44. The treatise author ties this interpretation of the exclusion to the rest of the motor vehicle insurance law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-5\">In many respects, the exclusion of insureds who own uninsured vehicles is a common denominator running through Maryland\u2019s comprehensive motor vehicle insurance scheme. This exclusion appears, in various forms, in Subtitle 5\u2019s regulation of PIP and uninsured motorist coverages, and in the Uninsured Division [of the Maryland Automobile Insurance Fund] sections of Subtitle 6. The purpose of the exclusion is simple. It furthers Maryland\u2019s comprehensive insurance scheme by encouraging the owner of an uninsured motor vehicle to become insured by imposing on him the penalty of exclusion form coverage for failure to obtain insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-6\"><em>Id. </em>at p. 543 (quotation marks and citations omitted). After analyzing IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) in some detail, the treatise author concludes that \u201cuninsured should be given its ordinary meaning\u2014a vehicle without insurance\u2014though, arguably it also includes a vehicle insured by a policy with liability insurance that did not meet the requirements of Title 17 of the Transportation Article.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at p. 544. In the case before us, Mr. Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab is not a vehicle without insurance; nor is it a vehicle whose policy does not comply with the requirements of Title 17 of the Transportation Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">It is also notable that a related provision of the State insurance law provides that an insurer who provides a policy with PIP coverage <em>\u201cshall pay [PIP] benefits </em>... to an individ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>ual insured under the policy who is injured in a motor vehicle accident ... while occupying a motor vehicle for which [PIP] coverage[ ] [is] not in effect.\u201d IN \u00a7 19\u2014513(d)(l)(i) (emphasis added). This indicates that the absence of PIP coverage does not equate to \u201cuninsured\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> This Court has opined that this provision is directly aimed at accidents in which the insured occupies a taxicab or bus, as taxicabs and buses are vehicles for which PIP coverage would not be in effect. <em>Nasseri v.

The Majority opinion relies primarily on <em>GEICO </em>v. <em>Comer, </em>419 Md. 89, 18 A.3d 830 (2011), by analogy for this proposition. Majority op. at 345-48, 363-66, 152 A.3d at 808-10, 819-20. The analogy does not work. In that case, Mr. Comer was injured while riding a motorcycle in an accident with an underinsured motorist. He was eligible for uninsured motorist (\"UM\u201d) benefits under both the policy that covered the motorcycle, as well as a more generous policy covering his father\u2019s automobile. The UM provision of the motorcycle policy was exhausted as a result of a set-off by benefits obtained from the tortfeasor\u2019s policy and Mr. Comer therefore sought UM benefits under the more generous provisions of his father\u2019s policy. The insurer of the father's policy declined to provide UM benefits to Mr. Comer under an exclusion that pertained to injuries suffered while occupying a vehicle not covered by that policy. This Court held that the policy exclusion was permissible under a provision of the UM statute. The Court reasoned that the purpose of such an exclusion \u201cis obviously to prevent a family, owning several motor vehicles, from insuring only one or two of them with an insurer, leaving the other vehicles uninsured, or underinsured under a different policy, and being able to claim uninsured or underinsured motorist benefits from the first insurer ....\u201d 419 Md. at 98, 18 A.3d 830.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">As noted in the text above, in contrast to the UM statute, the PIP statute contains a waiver provision under which a waiver for one vehicle would waive PIP coverage for all. Thus, the circumstance imagined in the Majority opinion\u2014obtaining PIP coverage for one vehicle, waiving it for other vehicles owned by the same person, and attempting to collect PIP benefits for accidents involving the other vehicles\u2014would not occur.</p>\n<p id=\"AyI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>State Farm made a similar \"windfall\u201d argument in its brief but, presumably because it does not work, abandoned it at oral argument in favor of a \"windfall\u201d scenario that might be termed \"Seven Cabs for Seven Brothers.\u201d Under this scenario, several siblings would all live in the same household, would all have PIP coverage under the same vehicle owned by a parent, would all own taxicabs insured without PIP coverage, and would all have claims resulting from motor vehicle accidents involving their respective cabs.

The Court also held that a policy provision that excluded uninsured motorist (\"UM\u201d) coverage for individuals like the claimant in <em>Gartel-man </em>was also not authorized by the statute in that the statutory authorization only permitted exclusion of UM benefits for the <em>owner </em>of an uninsured vehicle involved in the accident and not other insured parties, such as the claimant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. In its analysis of the <em>Gartelman </em>decision, the Majority opinion concludes that a construction of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii) to refer to a vehicle without any insurance would lead to the same result in <em>Gartel-man </em>as under the prior statute and therefore be contrary to legislative intent.

State Farm asserts that such an interpretation contradicts the authorized exclusion for an \"owned but uninsured\u201d vehicle in IN \u00a7 19-505(c)(l)(ii). But there is only a contradiction if one adopts the extremely broad interpretation of the exclusion advanced by State Farm. If one interprets these provisions according to their plain language, they are perfectly compatible. A well-known canon of statutory construction prefers compatible constructions of statutory language over contradictory constructions. <em>E.g., CashCall, Inc. v. Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation, </em>448 Md. 412, 431, 139 A.3d 990 (2016). The \"owned but uninsured\u201d exclusion provision (IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii)) allows exclusion of benefits when the insured occupies a vehicle that the insured owns and that carries no insurance. By contrast, IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i) makes clear that PIP benefits are to be paid when the insured is injured while occupying a vehicle without PIP coverage. In this case, Mr. Bundu-Conteh's taxicab was properly insured; therefore, the exclusion authorized by IN \u00a7 19\u2014505 (c)(1)(ii) does not apply. But that taxicab, consistent with Maryland law, did not itself have PIP coverage and thus PIP coverage was \"not in effect.\u201d IN \u00a7 19-513(d)(l)(i) makes clear that, in that situation, PIP benefits are to be paid.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b406-7\">. As noted earlier, the decision reached by the Majority opinion also depends on its conclusion that a taxicab is a \"vehicle\u201d for purposes of IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii), despite the fact that taxicabs are excluded from the definition of \"vehicle\u201d in IN \u00a7 19-501(b)\u2014a definition that applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>to IN \u00a7 19\u2014505(c)(l)(ii). I see no need to reach that issue. That is because: (1) there is no dispute in this case that Mr. Bundu-Conteh was involved in a \"motor vehicle accident\u201d because, as in <em>Nasseri, </em>390 Md. at 193-94, 888 A.2d 284, the other car involved in the accident was not a taxicab; and (2) Mr. Bundu-Conteh\u2019s taxicab was not \"uninsured\u201d for the reasons set forth in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
