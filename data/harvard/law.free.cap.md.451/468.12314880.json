Code Ann., Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(a) (2002, 2010 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.). Ian Schlakman and Frank Richardson (Appellees), along with Dan Sparaco, were among the candidates in the 2016 General Election vying for a seat representing Council-manic District Twelve on the Baltimore City Council.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appel-lees challenged the decisions of the Baltimore City Board of Elections (\u201cCity Board\u201d) to certify Mr. Sparaco as an eligible candidate and the State Board of Elections (\u201cState Board\u201d) to include him as a candidate for the District Twelve seat on the 2016 General Election ballot. They maintained that Mr. Spara-co\u2019s failure to comply with statutory filing requirements in a timely manner disqualified him from running for election as a candidate for the District Twelve vacancy. Appellees sought to have the City Board withdraw its certification of Mr. Sparaco\u2019s candidacy and the State Board strike his name from the ballot. When the relief they sought was not forthcoming, Appellees went to court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Appellees initially challenged Mr. Sparaco\u2019s qualifications in court by filing on August 25, 2016 an action against the State Board of Elections in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking an injunction \u201cprohibiting ... [the] State Board from violating Maryland Law\u201d and other relief. The federal court dismissed Appellees\u2019 lawsuit out of hand because then counsel had not been admitted to practice before the federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">On September 20, 2016, Appellees then filed the instant action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County against Linda H. Lamone and Armstead B. C. Jones, Jr., in their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>official capacities as the Administrator of the State Board of Elections and Election Director of the Baltimore City Board of Elections, respectively. <em>See </em>Md. Code Ann,, Elec. Law \u00a7 6-209(a) (2002, 2010 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.); Elec. Law \u00a7 12-203(a)(8).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">On September 22, after notifying the Boards\u2019 counsel, Appellees submitted an <em>ex parte </em>request for an immediate temporary restraining order. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 15-504. The Circuit Court granted the request on September 22 and issued the temporary restraining order directing Appellants to remove Mr. Sparaco\u2019s name from ballots and granting further relief. On September 23, Appellants filed direct appeals both to the Court of Special Appeals as well as this Court. <em>See </em>Elec. Law \u00a7 12-203(a)(3). On that date, this Court entered an order staying both the temporary restraining order and all further Circuit Court proceedings pending our review. On September 27, Appellants filed a \u201cPetition for Certiorari and Request for Expedited Review,\u201d On October 6, we granted <em>certiorari, </em>before consideration of the direct appeal by the Court of Special Appeals. <em>Lamone, et al. v. Schlakman, </em>450 Md. 214, 147 A.3d 393 (2016). We also allowed Appellants\u2019 request for expedited review and heard oral argument on October 18, following which we entered an order lifting the stay, vacating the temporary restraining order, and remanding the case to the Circuit Court with instructions to dismiss the complaint. <em>Id. </em>The mandate issued forthwith, and we now explain the reasons for our decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">Appellants have advanced the following question for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Did the circuit court err in entering an <em>ex parte </em>temporary restraining order that requires the defendants to remove the name of a qualified candidate from the ballot in Baltimore City Councilmanic District No. 12 for the 2016 General Election?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we agree that the temporary restraining order was granted in error. Appellees\u2019 state court challenges to the State Board\u2019s and City Board\u2019s actions were untimely and are barred by laches. Moreover, Appellees have not demonstrated any basis for relief on the merits under any theory of action or avenue for relief. The City Board\u2019s certification of Mr. Sparaco as a qualified candidate, and the State Board\u2019s listing of his candidacy, complied with the provisions of the Election Law Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The operative facts are not in dispute.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Ian Schlakman was the Green Party candidate for the District Twelve Council-manic seat on the Baltimore City Council. Frank W. Richardson and Dan Sparaco were independent candidates for the same vacancy. By February 3, 2016, Appellees Schlakman and Richardson had each filed a declaration of intent or certificate of candidacy with the Baltimore City Board of Elections, filings that were required of them as part of the process by which each would qualify for a place on the ballot for the District Twelve seat. <em>See generally </em>Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-301(a), (d); COMAR 33.01.06.01B(2) (definition of \u201ccandidate filing document\u201d includes certificate of candidacy and declaration of intent).</p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">Anticipating a run for the District Twelve seat, Dan Sparaco formed a candidate committee in September 2015, and filed his campaign finance report with the State Board of Elections on January 13, 2016. <em>See </em>Elec. Law \u00a7 13-202. He did not file his declaration of intent by February 3, however. Instead, on May 20, 2016, Mr. Sparaco filed suit in the United States District <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Court for the District of Maryland, challenging the constitutionality of the early filing deadline for unaffiliated candidates.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Sparaco v. Lamone, </em>No. 1:16-cv-1579-GLR (D. Md). Mr. Sparaco voluntarily dismissed this suit on August 15, 2016.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">On July 11, 2016, Mr. Sparaco filed with the City Board his declaration of intent to seek nomination by petition for the District Twelve seat. On August 2, the City Board approved the petition signatures that had been submitted by Mr. Spara-co, and certified his candidacy pursuant to Elec. Law \u00a7 6-208(b)(1), which governed the certification of petitions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The State Board included Mr. Sparaco\u2019s name on the ballot and on August 31 posted on its website ballot proofs that included his name, as well as those of Appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On August 25, 2016, Appellees filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking to enjoin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>what they perceived as the State Board\u2019s violation of the Maryland Election Law. <em>Schlakman et al. v. Md. State Bd. of Elections, </em>No. 1:16-cv-02968 (D. Md.). They complained that the State Board was effectively rewriting the statute\u2019s candidate filing deadline by including Mr. Sparaco\u2019s name on the ballot, and that the State Board\u2019s actions had harmed their campaign for the contested seat because they would be forced to \u201ccompete in an election against an ineligible candidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Appellees\u2019 federal suit was dismissed on September 20 because their former attorney was not admitted to the bar of that court. The district judge ordered all pleadings stricken, noting that the clerk had not been authorized to accept any previous filings, and prohibited the clerk from receiving the complaint and \u201call subsequent filings.\u201d <em>See </em>D. Md. Loe. Adm. R. 101.1(a), (b)(i), (\u00fc), 102.1(a)(i) (D. Md.).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The action before us was docketed on September 20 in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Appellees contested the Boards\u2019 actions pursuant to Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 6-209 and 12-202(a). In an eight-count complaint, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as the issuance of a writ of mandamus and a temporary restraining order which would \u201crequire that [Appellants] remove the name of Dan Sparaco from any and all ballots to be distributed to voters in Baltimore City Councilmanic District No. 12 for the 2016 General Election.\u201d On September 20, Appellees\u2019 attorney notified counsel for the Boards that they would be filing a motion for a \u201cTRO/preliminary injunction\u201d in the Circuit Court.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Appellees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>served the Boards\u2019 counsel with the TRO motion and accompanying documents on September 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">On September 22, 2016, the Circuit Court issued the temporary restraining order that is the subject of this appeal. The court found that there were \u201cno material facts in dispute.\u201d The court also concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-6\">3. [The] Court finds that Plaintiffs, registered voters and candidates for the Baltimore City Council in Councilmanic District No. 12, have raised a substantial question concerning whether Defendants are violating Maryland law by their including the name of Dan Sparaco as a candidate for Baltimore City Council in Councilmanic District No. 12 on ballots to be distributed to voters for the 2016 General Election. [The] Court further finds that the Defendants\u2019 actions, unless restrained, may act in contravention of the Plaintiffs\u2019 claimed rights before this Court has had the opportunity to determine those rights and effectively moot this case. [The] Court finds that this outcome would harm Plaintiffs\u2019 legitimate interests. The Court further finds that this harm will be immediate, substantial, and irreparable. * \u215c *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-7\">5. Accordingly, Linda H. Lamone, in her official capacity as State Administrator, Maryland State Board of Elections, and Armstead B. C. Jones, Sr., in his official capacity as Election Director, Baltimore City Board of Elections (collectively \u201cDefendants\u201d) are ORDERED to remove the name of Dan Sparaco from any and all ballots to be distributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>voters in Baltimore City Councilmanic District No. 12 for the General Election and ENJOINED from distributing to voters any ballot containing the name of Dan Sparaco as a candidate for election in the 2016 General Election. FURTHER, those working under Defendants\u2019 direction and in concert with them shall be and hereby are ENJOINED temporarily to take any action to frustrate or impede this relief.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">This appeal and our grant of certiorari followed. <em>Schlakman, </em>450 Md. at 214,147 A.8d at 898 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">\n<em>Standards of Review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">We review the Circuit Court\u2019s decision to issue a temporary restraining order for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Schisler v. State, </em>394 Md. 519, 534, 907 A.2d 175, 185 (2006). <em>See generally LeJeune v. Coin Acceptors, Inc., </em>381 Md. 288, 300-01, 849 A.2d 451, 458-59 (2004) (reviewing a preliminary injunction). To the extent the Circuit Court\u2019s exercise of discretion is based on an interpretation of law, that aspect of the ruling below is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>because \u201ceven with respect to a discretionary matter, a trial court must exercise its discretion in accordance with correct legal principles.\u201d <em>LeJeune, </em>381 Md. at 301, 849 A.2d at 459 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see Cabrera v. Penate, </em>439 Md. 99, 106, 94 A.3d 50, 54 (2014) <em>{de novo </em>review of circuit court\u2019s interpretation of Election Law Article). We review the factual findings of the lower court for clear error. <em>See Toms v.

Lamone, </em>398 Md. 233, 248-49, 919 A.2d 1276, 1286-87 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">\n<em>Timeliness of Challenge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">Appellees sought review of the City Board\u2019s actions pursuant to Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 6-209(a) and 12-202. Appellants initially responded that Appellees may not rely on Elec. Law \u00a7 6-209 to attack the candidacy of Mr. Sparaco.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">Title 6 of the Election Law Article governs petitions, including petitions in support of a candidate\u2019s nomination. <em>See </em>Elec. Law \u00a7 6-208(c)(l). Subtitle 2 governs the content of petitions, determinations as to their format or the sufficiency of local law or charter amendment on a ballot, validation of signatures and affidavits of petition circulators, the processes for filing, and the final determination of the sufficiency of the petitions. Further, Subtitle 2 affords judicial review to challenge determinations with respect to petitions and time limitations for fifing for judicial review. <em>See </em>Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 6-201-6-210. Elec. Law \u00a7 6-209 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-8\">\u00a7 6-209. Judicial Review.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-9\">(a) <em>In </em>general\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-10\">(1) A person aggrieved by determinations made under \u00a7 6-202, \u00a7 6-206, or \u00a7 6-208(a)(2) of this subtitle may seek judicial review:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-11\">(i) in the case of a statewide petition, a petition to refer an enactment of the General Assembly pursuant to Article XVI of the Maryland Constitution, or a petition for a congressional or General Assembly candidacy, in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-12\">(ii) as to any other petition, in the circuit court for the county in which the petition is filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>(2) The court may grant relief as it considers appropriate to assure the integrity of the electoral process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">(3) Judicial review shall be expedited by each court that hears the cause to the extent necessary in consideration of the deadlines established by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-6\">(b) <em>Declaration </em>relief.\u2014Pursuant to the Maryland Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act and upon the complaint of any registered voter, the circuit court of the county in which a petition has been or will be filed may grant declaratory relief as to any petition with respect to the provisions of this title or other provisions of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">By its terms, Elec. Law \u00a7 6-209 applies to determinations made with respect to the validity or sufficiency of petitions and their supporting documentation, and does not address the specific qualifications or eligibility of a candidate. Moreover, even if Title 6 provided an avenue to Appellees for their challenge to Mr. Sparaco\u2019s candidacy, their complaint was filed in the wrong court and came too late. <em>See </em>Elec. Law \u00a7 6-209(a)(l)(ii). Elec. Law \u00a7 6-210 sets forth various deadlines in the petition process, and provides the following deadlines for seeking judicial review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-8\">\u00a7 6-210. Schedule of process.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-9\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-10\">(e) <em>Judicial </em>review\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, any judicial review of a determination, as provided in \u00a7 6-209 of this subtitle, shall be sought by the 10th day following the determination to which the judicial review relates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-11\">(2)(i) If the petition seeks to place the name of an individual or a question on the ballot at any election, except a presidential primary election, judicial review shall be sought by the day specified in paragraph (1) of this subsection or the 63rd day preceding that election, whichever day is earlier, (ii) If the petition seeks to place the name of an individual on the ballot for a presidential primary election in accordance with \u00a7 8-502 of this article, judicial review of a determination made under \u00a7 6-208(a)(2) of this subtitle <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>shall be sought by the 5th day following the determination to which the judicial review relates.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Although the City Board certified Mr. Sparaco\u2019s petition pursuant to then Elec. Law \u00a7 6\u2014208(b)(1), Elec, Law \u00a7 6-209 does not provide a remedy for Appellees to challenge Mr. Sparaco\u2019s candidacy based on their assertion that he failed to adhere to the deadlines for filing his candidacy documents.

Law \u00a7 12\u2014202(b)(1), Appellants contend that Appellees acted too late to seek declaratory, injunctive and mandamus relief in the circuit court because their complaint fell outside of the ten-day \u201cwindow\u201d afforded by Elec. Law \u00a7 12\u2014202(b)(1) for a challenger to seek a remedy for acts or omissions relating to an election. They also aver that Appellees\u2019 challenge is foreclosed by laches.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Seeking to avoid procedural default, Appellees insist that the filing of their federal action \u201cwithin 10 days of their becoming aware\u201d of the allegedly improper certification of Mr. Sparaco as a candidate for the District Twelve seat tolled the running of the Section 12-202(b)(l) limiting period. Appellees accordingly urge this Court to credit their filing in the United States District Court under the savings provision of Maryland Rule 2-101(b), which elaborates when a federal filing may be deemed to be timely filed in our courts. They also maintain that their filing for a writ of mandamus excuses any delay in their judicial challenge because the limitations period set forth in Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>As noted, Elec. Law \u00a7 12\u2014202(b)(1) requires a challenge to be made \u201c10 days after the act or omission or the date the act or omission became known to the petitioner!.]\u201d Yet, \u201c[b]ecause the action [before us is] an equitable one, however, laches, rather than direct application of the statutory time period, [is] the proper focus.\u201d <em>Fraternal Order of Police v. Montgomery County, </em>446 Md. 490, 509, 132 A.3d 311, 332 (2016) (discussing <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 668-70, 876 A.2d at 704-05). <em>See also </em>Md. Rule 2-323 (recognizing laches as an affirmative defense). Notwithstanding the equitable nature of Appel-lees\u2019 claims and the relief they seek, we may gauge their delay against the statutory limitations period because \u201ccourts sitting in equity will apply statutory time limitations in determining, at least as an outside limit, whether laches has run.\u201d <em>Fraternal Order of Police, </em>446 Md. at 509, 132 A.3d at 322 (citing <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 670, 876 A.2d at 704-05). In <em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Board of Cosmetologists, </em>we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-5\">[L]aches is an inexcusable delay, without necessary reference to duration, in the assertion of a right, and unless mounting to the statutory period of limitations, mere delay is not sufficient to constitute laches, if the delay has not worked a disadvantage to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b514-6\"><em>Salisbury Beauty Schools v. State Board of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 63, 300 A.2d 367, 385 (1973). The following observation by this Court in <em>Stevens v. Bennett, </em>234 Md. 348, 199 A.2d 221 (1964) comes to mind:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-7\">The authorities indicate that even when the remedy for a claimed right is only in equity the period of limitations most nearly apposite at law will be invoked by an equity court, provided there is not present a more compelling equitable reason\u2014such as fraud or other inequitable conduct which would cause injustice if the bar were interposed\u2014why the action should not be barred. 34 Am.

As noted above, a statutory limitations period, such as that provided by Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b)(l), provides a benchmark for the application of laches, as it will, against which this Court can assess whether the Appellees\u2019 delay in filing in the Circuit Court was unreasonable and whether it prejudiced the interests of Appellants. <em>See Liddy, </em>398 Md. at 242, 919 A.2d at 1282-83.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">We shall hold that Appellees\u2019 judicial challenge is barred as a matter of law by laches. Even granting, <em>arguendo, </em>that they did not learn of the City Board\u2019s certification of Mr. Sparaco\u2019s candidacy until August 15, 2016, their challenge under Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(a) came too late because they did not file the instant action in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County until September 20, 2016, when their complaint was docketed by the clerk and, on this record, their delay was unreasonable and prejudicial to Appellants and the election process.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>At the outset, we discern no basis on this record to hold that Appellees\u2019 obligation to file in the appropriate circuit court, as instructed by Elec. Law \u00a7 12\u2014202(b)(1) was tolled by their failed attempt to file suit in the United States District Court, The savings provision of Maryland Rule 2-101, as pertinent here, reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">Rule 2-101, Commencement of action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">(a) Generally. A civil action is commenced by filing a complaint with a court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">(b) After Certain Dismissals by a United States District Court or a Court of Another State. Except as otherwise provided by statute, if an action is filed in a United States District Court or a court of another state within the period of limitations prescribed by Maryland law and that court enters an order of dismissal (1) for lack of jurisdiction, (2) because the court declines to exercise jurisdiction, or (3) because the action is barred by the statute of limitations required to be applied by that court, an action filed in a circuit court within 30 days after the entry of the order of dismissal shall be treated as timely filed in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">Maryland Rule 2\u2014101(b) offers no support for Appel-lees\u2019 assertion that the instant lawsuit in the Circuit Court was tolled by their filing in the United States District Court. The federal court\u2019s disposition of Appellees\u2019 federal action does not fit within the relevant factors enumerated in Rule 2-101(b). That court did not dismiss the federal suit for \u201clack of jurisdiction,\u201d because that court did not have the occasion to consider the issue of jurisdiction. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-101(b)(l). Nor did the federal court \u201cdecline to exercise jurisdiction\u201d in the first instance. <em>See </em>Md. Rule 2-101(b)(2). <em>See generally </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c) (enumerating bases for a federal court\u2019s decision to \u201cdecline\u201d to exercise jurisdiction). Instead, the district judge had no occasion to address the merits of Appel-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>lees\u2019 federal complaint because the clerk was ordered not to accept the complaint for filing <footnotemark>11</footnotemark>:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">For the reasons stated at today\u2019s teleconference, Plaintiffs\u2019 Complaint is STRICKEN and DISMISSED without prejudice.

Rule 2\u2014101(b) was never triggered, the consequences of Appellees\u2019 untimely judicial challenge in Circuit Court will not be alleviated by application of the savings provision of Md. Rule 2-101(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">We turn to Appellees\u2019 claim that because they also sought a writ of mandamus, the limitations period set forth in Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b)(l) does not apply to bar their judicial challenge to the City Board\u2019s certification of Mr. Sparaco. The short answer to Appellees\u2019 argument is that laches operates to bar their mandamus claim as well. We do not agree with Appellees that, by seeking a writ of mandamus, they can, in every case, circumvent the time constraints of Elec. Law \u00a7 12\u2014202(b)(1) by pursuing an alternate challenge to an election board\u2019s actions.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Again, \u201cif the equities so require,\u201d courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>are at liberty \u201cto assess the facts of a purely equitable action independent of the statutory time limitations applicable at law.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 670, 876 A.2d at 705. We again stress, however, that \u201cany claim against a state electoral procedure must be expressed expeditiously.\u201d <em>Liddy, </em>398 Md. at 250, 919 A.2d at 1287 (citation omitted). Accordingly, our analysis as to reasonableness of the delay and resulting prejudice in the case before us is informed by this precept, as well as the delay as measured against the \u201cbenchmark\u201d limitations period for election challenges established by the General Assembly in Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Appellees have offered no valid explanation as to why they waited until September 20 to cause their judicial challenge to be docketed in the Circuit Court. To be sure, they attempted to file in the United States District Court, and this effort was both unsuccessful, because counsel had not been admitted to practice there, and did not comport with the explicit requirement of Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b) which mandates that a challenge be filed in the circuit court. It also appears, according to Appellants, that Appellees waited until September 14, 2016, to serve Appellants with their federal motion for a temporary restraining order. This delay \u201cmust be juxtaposed against [their] duty to petition for redress without delay when the election approaches[.]\u201d <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 672, 876 A.2d at 705.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">With respect to prejudice, Appellants point out that the delay in not filing until September 19, or September 20 when Appellees\u2019 case was docketed by the clerk, preceded \u201conly days before the scheduled mailing of absentee ballots to military and overseas voters.\u201d Appellees counter that they filed this action before any ballots had been sent out, and speculate that \u201ceven if those ballots had been mailed they would have been few in number.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>We are not convinced that the equities favor Appellees in light of their eleventh hour challenge. Although Appellees filed their action in the Circuit Court seven weeks before the General Election, the election process had begun in earnest. Moreover, even though Appellees claim not to have become aware of Mr. Sparaco\u2019s candidacy until August 15, 2016, when he dismissed his federal lawsuit, the State Elections Board had by that time listed him as an \u201cactive\u201d candidate on August 2. By August 4, Mr. Sparaco had provided enough signatures to be placed on the ballot. On August 31, his name was included on proofs of the 2016 General Election ballot which were posted on the State Board\u2019s website. In their answer to the complaint, Appellees indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-5\">The defendants admit that federal law requires that, if an absentee military or overseas citizen voter has requested mail delivery of an absentee ballot for the 2016 general election before September 24, 2016, the deadline for mailing such ballots is September 24. The defendants further state that the State Board had arranged to have absentee ballot packages assembled and mailed on September 21-22 and that counsel for the plaintiffs had been advised of that schedule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">In view of this, the following observation by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is apposite. Affirming the denial of a preliminary injunction sought by Ralph Nader to compel the State of Illinois to place his name on the Presidential ballot, the court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">By waiting as long as he did to sue, and despite the strenuous efforts by the district court and this court to expedite the litigation, Nader created a situation in which any remedial order would throw the state\u2019s preparations for the election into turmoil. Absentee ballots have already been mailed to voters who will be overseas on election day, see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1973ff\u20142(e)(2), and the remaining absentee ballots will be mailed on September 23.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-8\"><em>Nader v. </em>Keith, 385 F.3d 729, 736 (7th Cir. 2004). We could not agree more with the observation by the Ohio Supreme Court in <em>Blankenship v. Blackwell, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 567, 817 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>382, 387 (2004), when that Court emphasized that \u201c[o]ur consistent requirement that expedited election cases be filed with the required promptness is not simply a technical nicety.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We cautioned in <em>Ross </em>that we would not craft a <em>per se </em>rule to apply laches where an election challenge falls outside the limitations period set by the statute. <em>Ross, </em>387 Md. at 671, 876 A.2d at 705. We shall not do so here. Nevertheless, the delay occasioned by Appellees\u2019 failure to file in the Circuit Court until their case was docketed on September 20, coming as it does over a month after August 15, 2016, the date that they maintain was their first notice of Mr. Sparaco\u2019s certification, comes close to that mark. Appellees have not explained this delay, or explained why they did not institute a parallel action in the Circuit Court within the time limits mandated by Elec. Law \u00a7 12-202(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Although we conclude that Appellees\u2019 circuit court challenge to the Boards\u2019 actions is barred as untimely and foreclosed by the operation of laches, we also conclude, in the alternative, that their entitlement to the relief they sought fails because Appellees cannot succeed on the merits, regardless of their theory of action or the nature of the remedy they seek. A temporary restraining order will be set aside if the party seeking such interlocutory relief will not succeed on the merits of the dispute. <em>Fuller v. Republican Cent. Committee of Carroll Cnty., </em>444 Md. 613, 635, 120 A.3d 751, 764 (2015). A fair reading of the Election Law Article reveals that Mr. Sparaeo was not required to file either a declaration of intent or certificate of candidacy on February 3, 2016, as Appellees insist.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">\n<em>The Election Law Article</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b520-8\">The principles of statutory interpretation are well-established:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-9\">We have stated the controlling principles of statutory construction so often that only the briefest exposition is necessary. Our predominant mission is to ascertain and implement the legislative intent, which is to be derived, if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>possible, from the language of the statute (or Rule) itself. If the language is clear and unambiguous, our search for legislative intent ends and we apply the language as written and in a commonsense manner. We do not add words or ignore those that are there. If there is any ambiguity, we may then seek to fathom the legislative intent by looking at legislative history and applying the most relevant of the various canons that courts have created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-5\"><em>Dowmes v. Dowmes, </em>388 Md. 561, 571, 880 A.2d 343, 349 (2005) (citations omitted); <em>see Drew v. First Guar. Mort. Corp., </em>379 Md. 318, 327, 842 A.2d 1, 6 (2003) (ascertaining legislative intent is the principal goal of statutory interpretation). We examine the legislation as a whole, reviewing the language and context of the provisions at issue. As we recently emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5r\">We, however, do not read statutory language in a vacuum, nor do we confine strictly our interpretation of a statute\u2019s plain language to the isolated section alone. Rather, the plain language must be viewed within the context of the statutory scheme to which it belongs, considering the purpose, aim, or policy of the Legislature in enacting the statute. We presume that the Legislature intends its enactments to operate together as a consistent and harmonious body of law, and, thus, we seek to reconcile and harmonize the parts of a statute, to the extent possible consistent with the statute\u2019s object and scope.... In every case, the statute must be given a reasonable interpretation, not one that is absurd, illogical or incompatible with common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Atz\"><em>CashCall, Inc. v. Md. Comm\u2019r of Fin. Regulation, </em>448 Md. 412, 431, 139 A.3d 990, 1002 (2016) (quoting <em>Gardner v. State, </em>420 Md. 1, 8-9, 20 A.3d 801, 806 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">The parties vigorously dispute the meaning of those provisions of the Election Law Article that pertain to the filing of certificates of candidacy and declarations of intent by prospective candidates who seek a nomination by petition. Appellees insist that the recent amendments to the Election Law Article, specifically Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703, evince the General Assembly\u2019s intent to require all candidates, including peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tion candidates and those nominated by non-principal political parties, to file by the same \u201cCandidacy Filing Deadline,\u201d which they insist was February 3, 2016, the pre-primary filing deadline set forth in Elec. Law \u00a7 5-303(a). Appellants counter that the language of the statute militates in favor of the Boards\u2019 interpretation that the deadlines for filing the declaration of intent and certificate of candidacy for a nomination by petition are as set forth in Elec. Law \u00a7 5\u2014703(d)(1)\u2014\u201cnot later than 5 p.m. on the first Monday in August in the year of the general election for the office.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the plain language of the Election Law provisions at issue supports Appellants\u2019 view that a candidate such as Mr. Sparaco was not required to make the required filings until the first Monday in August preceding the General Election.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We therefore agree with Appellants and explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">For present purposes, the operative provisions of the Election Law Article are set forth within Subtitles 3 and 7 of Title 5 of the statute. Title 5 broadly governs candidates. Subtitle 3, Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 6-301 - 5-305, relates to the required certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>cates of candidacy; and Subtitle 7, Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5-701-5-706, addresses nominations.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Subtitle 3 governs the substantive elements of a prospective candidate\u2019s certificate of candidacy, such as the information to be provided, how and where that certificate must be filed, and other requirements such as a filing fee and financial disclosures.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Elec. Law \u00a7 5-301, the introductory provision for Subtitle 3, provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-7\">\u00a7 5-301. In general.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-8\">(a) <em>In </em>general.\u2014An individual may become a candidate for a public or party office only if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-9\">(1) the individual files a certificate of candidacy in accordance with this subtitle; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-10\">(2) the individual does not file a certificate of withdrawal under Subtitle 5 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-11\">Section 5-303 addresses filing deadlines, as Appellees maintain, and indeed relevantly provides for a pre-primary filing deadline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-12\">\u00a7 5-303. When filed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-13\">(a) In general.\u2014Except as provided in subsections (b) and (c) of this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-14\">(1) in the year in which the Governor is elected, a certificate of candidacy shall be filed not later than 9 p.m. on the last Tuesday in February in the year in which the primary election will be held; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-15\">(2) for any other regularly scheduled election, a certificate of candidacy shall be filed not later than 9 p.m. on the Wednesday that is 83 days before the day on which the primary election will be held.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-16\">This Elec. Law \u00a7 5-303(a)(2) pre-primary deadline for filing a certificate of candidacy does not govern the filing deadline for a candidate who seeks nomination by petition. That deadline is set by Subtitle 7. The introductory provision for Subtitle 7 elaborates three avenues for securing a nomination for a place on a ballot, depending on whether the prospec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>tive candidate seeks nomination by a political party that engages in the primary process, a party that does not use a primary, or a candidate who must secure enough signatures on a nominating petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-5\">\u00a7 5-701. In general</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-6\">Nominations for public offices that are filled by elections governed by this article shall be made:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-7\">(1) by party primary, for candidates of a principal political party;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-8\">(2) by petition, for candidates not affiliated with any political party; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">(3) in accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the political party, for candidates of a political party that does not nominate by party primary.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b524-10\">Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703, in turn, governs the nomination of a petition candidate such as Mr. Sparaco, and pertinently reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-11\">\u00a7 5-703. Nomination by petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-12\">(a) Scope.\u2014Except for a candidate for a nonpartisan county board of education, this section applies to any candidate for public office subject to this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-13\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A candidate for public office may be nominated by petition under this subtitle if the candidate is not affiliated with any political party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-14\">(c) <em>Declaration of </em>intent.\u2014(1) A candidate for public office who seeks nomination by petition shall file a declaration of intent to seek nomination by petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-15\">(2) The declaration of intent shall be filed with the board at which the candidate files a certificate of candidacy under Subtitle 3 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-16\">(3) The declaration of intent shall be filed as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-17\">\u2021 \u2021 \u215c</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-18\">(ii) in a year in which the President and Mayor of Baltimore City are elected, by the date and time specified for a candidate to file a certificate of candidacy;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAeei\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>(d) <em>Certificate of </em>Candidacy.\u2014(1) A candidate for public office who seeks nomination by petition shall file a certificate of eandidacy not later than 5 p.m. on the first Monday in August in the year of the general election for the office.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Appellees aver that Mr. Sparaco\u2019s filing deadline for the certificate of candidacy, and thus the declaration of intent, must be dictated by Elec. Law \u00a7 5-303(a)(2), because, they maintain, the \u201clanguage of [Elec. Law] \u00a7 5-703(3)(ii) clearly and unambiguously set[s] the deadline for filing a declaration of intent for an independent candidate [presumably a petition candidate] who wished to seek election in 2016 at February 3, 2016.\u201d To them, \u201cthe date and time specified for a candidate to file a certificate of candidacyf,]\u201d can only be the deadline set forth at Elec. Law \u00a7 5-303(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Essentially, Appellees brush aside the clear language of Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(d), which sets the filing deadline in August. To be sure, Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(d)(2) dictates that a candidate by petition must comply with certain substantive filing requirements as to the content of the certificate of candidacy and place of filing, as those requirements are set forth in Subtitle 3 regardless of the type of candidate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Contrary to Appellees\u2019 argument, however, Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(d)(1) explicitly sets the filing deadline by a candidate such as Mr. Sparaco, who sought nomination by petition. This is so because Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(d)(2), while referring to Subtitle 3\u2019s substantive requirements, does not incorporate that subtitle\u2019s pre-primary filing deadline, but instead retains the filing deadline for petition candidates within Subtitle 7, for, with emphasis added, it provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-7\">(2) Except for the time of filing, the certificate of candidacy of a candidate who seeks nomination by petition shall comply with the requirements for a certificate of candidacy under Subtitle 3 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(f) further confirms the importance of the August filing deadline:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-5\">(f) <em>Time and place for filing </em>signatures.\u2014(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, a petition that contains the required number of signatures specified under subsection (e)(1) of this section shall be filed with the appropriate board by 5 p.m. on the first Monday in August in the year in which the general election is held.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-6\">(2) In a special election to fill a vacancy in the office of Representative in Congress, a petition that contains the required number of signatures shall be filed with the State Board by 5 p.m. on the day of the special primary election.!<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">Moreover, the interplay between the two Subtitles is further demonstrated by Elec. Law \u00a7 5\u2014301(d), which, with emphasis added, dictates:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b526-8\">(d) <em>Petition </em>candidates.\u2014A candidate who seeks nomination by petition shall file a certificate of candidacy as provided in \u00a7 5-703 of this title.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">In sum, while Subtitle 3 outlines certain formal requirements for all candidates, petition candidates must meet the filing deadline set forth in Subtitle 7. Mr. Sparaco met that deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Although the language of the statute is clear, a brief view of legislative history of relevant provisions of the Election Law Article provides a context for our holding and confirms our interpretation of the statute. We have said that \u201cthe resort to legislative history is a confirmatory process; it is not undertaken to contradict the plain meaning of the statute.\u201d <em>Mayor &amp; City Council of Balt. v.

Prior to the 2015 amendments, Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014 708(c)(3)(ii) (2014) and 5-703.1(c)(3)(ii) (2014) required candidates seeking nomination by petition and nomination by a \u201cnon-primary\u201d political party each to file a declaration of intent \u201cin a year in which the President is elected, by July 1[J\u201d Moreover, Elec.

The 2015 amendments to the relevant provisions of the Election Law Article were intended to make the deadlines con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>gruent.

Indeed, as noted above, the deadlines for both declarations of intent and certificates of candidacy now \u201ccoincide.\u201d The deadline for filing declarations of intent for these types of candidates is by 5 P.M. on the first Monday in August as stated in Elec. Law \u00a7\u00a7 5\u2014703(d)(1) and 5-703.1(d)(l).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">The operative language of the Election Law Article is clear. A candidate who seeks nomination by petition is not required to file a certificate of candidacy or declaration of intent by February 3, 2016. The City and State Boards properly certified and listed Mr. Sparaco as a qualified candidate for the District 12 Council seat. Given the clear language of the Election Law Article, we hold that the filing deadline for Mr. Sparaco was set forth in Elec. Law \u00a7 5-703(d)(l) to be on August 1, 2016, the first Monday of August prior to the General Election.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>It is also clear that the legislative history of the relevant provisions of the Election Law Article comply with our interpretation of the filing deadline in this case. Therefore, it is unlikely that the General Assembly would retreat from the current filing deadline to an earlier deadline and by doing so invite the disapproval long ago predicted by its legal advisor in 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">For the above reasons, on October 18, 2016, we vacated the temporary restraining order under review, and remanded the case to the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County with directions to dismiss the underlying action.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b503-8\">. For purposes of this opinion, we shall refer to Richardson and Schlakman as the \"Appellees,\u201d and Linda H. Lamone, Administrator of the State Board of Elections, and Armstead B. C. Jones, Jr., Election Director of the Baltimore City Board of Elections, as \"Appellants.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b504-8\">. Although the election has been decided, this case is not moot, because \"the issues properly presented, and their effects on independent [and petition] candidacies, will persist as the [Election Law is] applied in future elections.\u201d <em>See Storer v.

Appellees maintain that Mr. Sparaco's federal lawsuit prompted the Board to reconsider its view that the deadline for filing a declaration of intent and certificate of candidacy was February 3, 2016.

The State Board most certainly misapprehended the correct deadline, as was shown by the Memorandum and by the fact that until August 26, 2016, its website misstated the deadline for filing the documents at issue as February 3, 2016. Our analysis does not require us to dwell on the State Board\u2019s shifting interpretations of the correct deadline date.
