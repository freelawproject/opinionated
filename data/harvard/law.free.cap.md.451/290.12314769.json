Proc.\u201d) of the Maryland Code, provides relief to a Petitioner who alleges \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that he was erroneously deemed criminally responsible during his 1985 reverse waiver hearing, when he should have been deemed not criminally responsible (\u201cNCR\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">On October 22, 1984, then f\u00edfteen-year-old Dameron Small-wood (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) fatally stabbed Madge K. Gibson (\u201cMs. Gibson\u201d) in her Baltimore County apartment. Petitioner was charged as an adult, but sought to be tried as a juvenile. At a reverse waiver hearing,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> held February 6-7, and March 8, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>1985, several psychiatric experts testified regarding Petitioner\u2019s amenability to treatment and opined that he was not \u201clegally insane\u201d at the time of the crime. The circuit court denied Petitioner\u2019s request to transfer the case back to juvenile court. Petitioner was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder and other related charges following a not guilty, agreed statement of facts proceeding, and sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">Twenty-six years later, the psychiatrist who originally examined Petitioner concluded her original diagnosis was incorrect. The psychiatrist now opined that Petitioner should have been deemed NCR at the time of his 1985 proceedings. Petitioner subsequently filed a petition for \u201cwrit of actual innocence\u201d under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, alleging that this revised expert opinion constituted \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that generated a \u201csubstantial or significant possibility that the result [of Petitioner\u2019s 1985 proceeding] may have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the Circuit Court for Baltimore County\u2019s denial of Petitioner\u2019s petition for a writ of actual innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">For purposes of our discussion, the events giving rise to our inquiry revolve around three events: (1) the reverse waiver <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>hearing held on February 6, 7 and March 8,1985; (2) the plea agreement proceeding where Petitioner pled not guilty on an agreed statement of facts held on March 13, 1985; and (3) the motions hearing relative to the petition for writ of actual innocence held on November 2, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">According to Dr. Ellen McDaniel\u2019s (\u201cDr. McDaniel\u2019s\u201d) original January 24, 1985 psychiatric report, her testimony from Petitioner\u2019s 1985 reverse waiver hearing, and her deposition testimony from November 17, 2011, Petitioner grew up in a highly abusive, toxic domestic environment that greatly impacted his mental development. Petitioner\u2019s father was an alcoholic, and his mother was \u201can extremely bizarre, at times explosive woman\u201d who suffered from severe mental illness. As a child, Petitioner was verbally and physically abused by his mother. She once beat Petitioner and his siblings so badly that they required hospitalization. She also threatened \u201cto beat [Petitioner] on the head and watch his brains flow out.\u201d By the age of ten, Petitioner had lived in three foster homes, which were also abusive settings, and attended several different schools. Petitioner also spent two years in a residential psychiatric facility for children, before returning to live with his mother. During this time, Petitioner and his brother slept on the floor, and did not have sufficient clothing to wear to school.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">In the week prior to Ms. Gibson\u2019s death, Petitioner was suspended from school for talking back to a teacher. Petitioner\u2019s mother became angry and refused to let him leave the house for several days. She also screamed, nagged, and yelled at him repeatedly throughout the weekend. At one point, she told him \u201cshe was going to cut [him] up and put [him] in a bag and throw [him] in the dumpster.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">On the morning of October 22, 1984, Petitioner\u2019s mother finally let Petitioner leave the house to purchase cat food. While Petitioner was out, he continued to hear her voice, screaming, like a \u201cbuzzing in his ear,\u201d and began fantasizing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>After purchasing the cat food, Petitioner went to his old neighborhood and the apartment building where he had previously lived with his mother. Petitioner knocked on the door of one of the apartments and a woman answered. Petitioner asked if the \u201cman of the house was home,\u201d but when the woman\u2019s husband came to the door, Petitioner mumbled about being at the wrong house and left.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Petitioner then knocked on Ms. Gibson\u2019s door, and announced he had a package to deliver that required Ms. Gibson\u2019s signature. When Ms. Gibson opened the door, while on the phone with her daughter, Petitioner stabbed her ten times.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, Petitioner fled, and was observed disposing of a bloody, brown paper bag, and several articles of clothing disappeared from his person. Ms. Gibson later died from her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">I. Reverse Waiver Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">After Petitioner was indicted for first-degree murder and related offenses, his attorneys petitioned for a reverse waiver hearing to transfer Petitioner\u2019s case from adult to juvenile court. During the reverse waiver hearing, held on February 6, 7 and March 8, 1985, Petitioner\u2019s attorneys first called Dr. Lawrence Donner (\u201cDr. Donner\u201d), a psychologist, to testify about his diagnoses of Petitioner. Dr. Donner testified that he diagnosed Petitioner with: (1) major depression, recurrent, and (2) an identity disorder. Dr. Donner defined \u201cidentity disorder\u201d as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>a condition which if not treated develops into a borderline personality, which indicates that an individual who is rather extremely unpredictable, may have explosive rage attacks, has problems about their own identity because they have never had a role model to identify with, have marked changes in their mood have [a] poor notion of who they are.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">Dr. Donner also explained that a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder was excluded as to Petitioner because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcCH\">[t]here is a problem with diagnostic impressions, and that is his age. He fits very well a diagnosis of borderline personality, but because of his age one cannot make that diagnosis in view of that diagnosis involves the fact that he suffers from, what I see as major depression, recurrent, that he has been depressed much of his life and that he suffers from an identity disorder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-6\">**\u00bb</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-7\">You cannot make the diagnosis of borderline personality until an individual is 18 years of age because they are still malleable, still plastic. But if [Petitioner] had the same features that he has now at 18 years of age there is no question in my mind a diagnosis\u2014I would diagnose him as a borderline personality just by virtue of age.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-8\">Dr. Donner also opined that Petitioner did not suffer from a mental disorder that caused him to be \u201clegally insane,\u201d specifically stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-9\">[] I am airing conservatively^] [I]t\u2019s conceivable he was having a psychotic episode, but I am not testifying to that effect. I cannot say that that didn\u2019t happen, but I am not testifying that it did. [Petitioner] has difficulty distinguishing at times between reality and fantasy. I am not here to testify that he was psychotic at the time, but I cannot say that he wasn\u2019t psychotic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-10\">Dr. Donner concluded that, without treatment, Petitioner had \u201ca good chance of becoming a borderline personality.\u201d Dr. Donner recommended that Petitioner be waived to juvenile court so he could be admitted into a secure treatment facility.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s attorneys then called Dr. McDaniel to testify regarding her diagnoses of Petitioner and the January 24, 1985 psychiatric report she authored regarding his mental status. Dr. McDaniel concluded that Petitioner was \u201cdefinitely suffering from a mental disorder[,]\u201d and \u201chis problems were intimately tied up [with] the crime.\u201d Dr. McDaniel also found that Petitioner had been \u201cabsorbed\u201d in his \u201cJack the Ripper fantasy\u201d when he attacked Ms. Gibson, <em>see supra </em>n. 2, but noted that Petitioner told her Ms. Gibson\u2019s \u201cscreams \u2018made me snap out of it. I realized that what I was doing was wrong.\u2019 \u201d Dr. McDaniel also noted several times in her report that Petitioner appeared \u201cdepressed\u201d during her interviews with him. Ultimately, Dr. McDaniel concluded in her report that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">[Petitioner] is an emotionally disturbed fifteen year old boy who lives a great portion of his life in fantasies. He has suffered through significant trauma during his childhood; including physical and emotional abuse, constant separations and abandonments by family members, and institutionalization in foster homes and a psychiatric facility. The content of his fantasies partially reflects his rage and feelings of helplessness that have developed over years of repeated severe stress. These fantasies also protect him from feeling despair by endowing him with superpowers which enable him to avoid oppression by adults and win admiration. I do not find him psychotic because he does not demonstrate the thought process disturbance, the paranoid ideation, or the extreme mood swings that are symptoms of psychotic illness. However, [Petitioner\u2019s] contact with reality is tenuous and when under stress, he withdraws into his daydreams for comfort and escape.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">During the reverse waiver hearing, Dr. McDaniel acknowledged she had difficulty diagnosing Petitioner due to his age because he was \u201cemotionally still in the process of changing,\u201d and she \u201ccould not pigeonhole him into a diagnosis[.]\u201d On that basis, Dr. McDaniel chose diagnostic categories that were flexible, but not necessarily the most \u201caccurate reflections of what[] [was] going on.\u201d Ultimately, Dr, McDaniel diagnosed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Petitioner with: (1) atypical conduct disorder of adolescence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and (2) mixed personality disorder with depressive and schizoid features. Dr. McDaniel indicated that she diagnosed Petitioner with a conduct disorder due to his age. She also noted that when she discussed mixed personality disorder with depressive and schizoid features, she was emphasizing her two main findings: (1) that Petitioner was severely depressed, and (2) that Petitioner deals with his conflicts and depression by withdrawing into a fantasy world\u2014the schizoid aspect. Dr. McDaniel further explained that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-5\">When I talk about a personality disorder I am\u2014what is referred to is a sort of a life-style of difficulty, usually in the area of interpersonal relationships. When I say mixed personality disorder, again, I don\u2019t think that [Petitioner] has solidified in that diagnostic category. So it\u2019s one of those diagnoses that says he really doesn\u2019t belong in any other diagnosis [sic], that it\u2019s an open door yet. But basically what I am referring to is a lifelong history of difficulty in relationships with others. In large part this has been because he has not had any stable, consistent, supportive figures with whom to relate. And it has been reflected in other areas, such as his peer group relationships, his difficulty relating to authority figures and his retreat from relationships into his fantasy world. That\u2019s what I meant by the personality disorder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Despite these diagnoses, Dr. McDaniel concluded that Petitioner was not \u201clegally insane\u201d at the time he stabbed Ms. Gibson. Dr. McDaniel also recommended that Petitioner be adjudicated by the juvenile court because he would benefit from treatment in a secure facility rather than in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Dr. James E. Smith, II, a court psychiatrist, also testified, but was not asked about Petitioner\u2019s criminal responsibility. Dr. Smith stated that on the one occasion he met with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Petitioner, Petitioner was oriented, coherent, and displayed no signs of psychosis. Dr. Smith diagnosed Petitioner with a personality disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">The circuit court denied Petitioner\u2019s request for a reverse waiver. At no point during the proceeding was the extent of Petitioner\u2019s criminal responsibility contested or discussed at length by either party or any of the psychiatric experts who testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">Thereafter, on March 13, 1985, Petitioner followed the advice of his attorney and entered a plea of not guilty on an agreed statement of facts. On the same day, Petitioner was convicted of first-degree murder and other related offenses, and sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">II. Dr. McDaniel\u2019s Revised Psychiatric Diagnoses</p>\n<p id=\"b330-8\">In 2009, Petitioner was represented by a new attorney who requested Dr. McDaniel reconsider her prior opinion that Petitioner was not \u201clegally insane\u201d at the time of the 1985 reverse waiver hearing. Dr. McDaniel reassessed her 1985 opinion, and in 2011 reached the contrary conclusion that Petitioner was NCR when he stabbed Ms. Gibson in 1984. Dr. McDaniel determined that at the time of the offense, Petitioner was actually suffering from: (1) major depressive disorder, severe, with episodes of dissociation, and (2) post-traumatic stress disorder (\u201cPTSD\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">Dr. McDaniel attributed her revised opinion to several findings that she argued were not available when she originally evaluated Petitioner. Notably, Dr. McDaniel cited scientists\u2019 better understanding of dissociation,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> particularly in connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>tion to PTSD. Dr. McDaniel also noted that scientists had learned more about PTSD and how \u201cstress actually changes the anatomical features of the brain[.]\u201d She also found that trauma \u201cchanges the brain circuitry[]\u201d and can increase the chance of developing certain disorders, including PTSD. These changes can also cause someone to \u201cmisperceive[ ] current day situations[.]\u201d Dr. McDaniel stated that research on the biological basis for this phenomenon appeared only in the last several years, even though the PTSD diagnosis has existed since before the 1980s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Dr. McDaniel also contended that the \u201cdiagnostic nomenclature\u201d in the DSM had changed. For example, in the 1980s the DSM-III said that \u201cdiagnosis of a Personality Disorder should be made only when the characteristic features are typical of the individual\u2019s long-term functioning!!,]\u201d but the manual observed that \u201cmanifestations are generally recognizable by adolescence or earlier and continue throughout most of adult life....\u201d DSM-III at 305. In contrast, the DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000, states that \u201cPersonality Disorder categories may be applied to children or adolescents\u201d only in \u201crelatively unusual instances,\u201d because \u201ctraits of a Personality Disorder that appear in childhood will often not persist unchanged into adult life.\u201d Am. Psychiatric Ass\u2019n, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 687 (4th ed., text rev., 2000). Considering those scientific advances, revisions in the DSM, and her post-hoc professional experience since the 1980s, Dr. McDaniel concluded that her initial diagnosis of an atypical conduct disorder or mixed personality disorder was naive and incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Based on her revised diagnoses, Dr. McDaniel further concluded that Petitioner was NCR at the time of the offense because his \u201cmajor depression with dissociative episodes and PTSD\u201d rendered him unable to conform his behavior to the requirements of law. Dr. McDaniel concluded that during the stabbing of Ms. Gibson, Petitioner had \u201cbrok[en] with reality during [his] periods of dissociation,\u201d including the day of the offense. Dr. McDaniel acknowledged that Petitioner made decisions and acted deliberately before<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and after the crime,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but that Petitioner slipped into an \u201caltered state of consciousness[ ]\u201d at the time he stabbed Ms. Gibson.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Dr. McDaniel also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>indicated that Petitioner\u2019s deliberate actions before and after the offense may \u201clook[ ] like conscious behavior, but we don\u2019t know what he [was] doing in his mind;\u201d and his actions could have been a \u201creflection of this fantasyt,]\u201d <em>see supra </em>fn. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">III. Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">On August 29, 2011, Petitioner filed a Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence pursuant to Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. Petitioner requested the court vacate his conviction and order a new trial because \u201cthe discovery of the lack of criminal responsibility.. .is newly discovered evidence which creates a substantial or significant possibility that the result of [his] prosecution, . .in 1984-85 may have been different.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">On November 2, 2012, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County conducted an evidentiary hearing on the petition. The circuit court received Dr. McDaniel\u2019s 2011 deposition testimony discussing the bases for her revised diagnoses.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court also heard live testimony from the State\u2019s expert, clinical psychiatrist Dr. Christiane Tellefsen (\u201cDr. Tellefsen\u201d), who disputed the psychiatric basis for Dr. McDaniel\u2019s revised opinion. Dr. Tellefsen first noted that PTSD was an available diagnosis in 1984 and was included in the DSM III, <em>see supra </em>fn. 6, and that it was actually a more common diagnosis in the 1980s then it is now.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Dr. Tellefsen testified that Petitioner\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>history was consistent with a diagnosis of PTSD, and that a key symptom for individuals suffering from PTSD is \u201cavoidance[,]\u201d meaning the individual tends \u201cto withdraw from society or withdraw from situations that are stressful to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Dr. Tellefsen also noted that dissociation is a symptom rather than a diagnosis, and that when a person dissociates \u201cthey\u2019re often engaged in automatic behavior so they\u2019re not engaged in novel behavior[,]\u201d and one of the first things a diagnostician looks at if someone says they dissociated is \u201cwhat [ ] the thing [was] that they were doing, was this a novel physical activity for them or a novel activity in general for them. Did it involve automatic behavior, sort of reflexive behavior or not, did it involve intentional behavior or not[?]\u201d Dr. Tellefsen further testified that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-6\">[i]n rare cases, someone might diagnosis [sic] a teenager with a personality disorder, but you really\u2014you have to be very careful about that because you don\u2019t know what development is going to do to them as they get older. They don\u2019t know if they\u2019re going to grow out of it essentially. And that has always been understood through the, you know, the DSM III, DSM IV, [DSM] IV-TR... that you have to be very careful about doing that. And there are\u2014I think it\u2019s written as a caveat in both editions of the manual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">Dr. Tellefsen concluded the facts in the instant case did not support Dr. McDaniel\u2019s revised diagnoses for several reasons. First, Dr. McDaniel\u2019s diagnosis of dissociation did not make sense because people who dissociate tend to engage in repetitive, rather than novel behavior, and Petitioner did not have a history of violence. Second, there were no indications that Petitioner was dissociating at any other point before or after the offense.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Third, Petitioner was not previously diagnosed with dissociation. Dr. Tellefsen also noted that Petitioner was not diagnosed with psychotic behavior, and that individuals who typically satisfy the NCR test have severe mental disor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ders that cause the individual to lose touch with reality or become psychotic.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, Dr. Tellefsen testified that Dr. McDaniel could not \u201cweave\u201d the PTSD and dissociation diagnoses into Petitioner\u2019s activities because the evidence indicated that Petitioner acted deliberately and was able to \u201ccurb[ ] his behavior\u201d at various points before and after the stabbing.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">During closing arguments, the circuit court observed that Dr. McDaniel\u2019s deposition testimony was \u201crife with inconsistencies,\u201d specifically noting that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">I didn\u2019t understand anything about\u2014Dr. McDaniel\u2019s testimony in the deposition, and I read it carefully and [heard] about this notion that there was no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder back in 1984 and that she didn\u2019t have the ability to diagnose that then, which is what I understood her testimony to have been. That is preposterous. Post-traumatic stress disorder plainly existed as a DSM diagnosis back in 1984.1 do not know why she couldn\u2019t have diagnosed it back in 1984. She can diagnose it in 2011.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-7\">This episodic dissociation business, you know, I just\u2014I\u2014 that\u2019s not a DSM III or IV diagnosis. And I recognize that there\u2019s some legitimate debate between the parties as to whether or not the evidence supports a logical conclusion that this could have been some sort of a dissociation episode under the circumstances. But again, I imagine, although I didn\u2019t hear this, that there was no reason why that couldn\u2019t have been a part of the analysis back in 1984.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-8\">And there\u2019s this odd business in [Dr. McDaniel\u2019s] testimony about the fact that she now believes that you cannot diagnosis [sic] someone under the age of 18 with a personality disorder, but that she was incapable of reaching that conclusion back in 1984.1 don\u2019t understand that at all.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>On February 12, 2013, the circuit court denied the petition. In its memorandum, the circuit court concluded that Petitioner \u201cis ineligible to seek relief under an \u2018actual innocence\u2019 statute[ ]\u2019 \u201d because \u201che is maintaining that he is actually guilty, but is not criminally responsible.\u201d After reviewing the legislative history of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, the circuit court found that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-5\">the plain language of the statute and its legislative history suggest that its application was meant to be limited to those who are innocent of the crime. Nothing about the legislative history of the provision suggests that it was intended to include a claim made decades after a conviction that a defendant was guilty of a crime, but not criminally responsible for its commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">The circuit court also observed that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-7\">[w]hile expert opinion testimony is certainly \u2018evidence\u2019 in the broad sense of the word, the courts must be especially vigilant in assessing the reliability and the credibility of an opinion which comes about more than a quarter century after a final verdict under these circumstances. Generally, it is safe to conclude that an expert\u2019s opinion, which changes 26 years after the original opinion is rendered, because the expert \u201clacked experience\u201d when the original opinion was rendered will never be considered \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d under any rational standard.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">The circuit court concluded that Dr. McDaniel\u2019s revised opinion was not \u201cnewly discovered evidence,\u201d because \u201c[tjhere was no change between 1984 and the present in the <em>facts </em>of this case. No new or different fact was unearthed or otherwise discovered suggesting that the Petitioner\u2019s [proceeding] was unfair in 198[5].\u201d (Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-9\">The circuit court also found that, even if a revised expert\u2019s opinion qualified as newly discovered evidence, Dr. McDaniel\u2019s revised testimony should be accorded \u201c[virtually no weight].\u201d The circuit court noted that Dr, McDaniel\u2019s testimony was \u201cgenerally replete with psychological double-speak and rationalizations designed to obfuscate.\u201d The circuit court also found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>that \u201cthroughout [Dr. McDaniel\u2019s] testimony she refused to commit to a concrete timeframe within which the Petitioner was allegedly dissociating, or an explanation as to why this dissociation would have formed an adequate basis for a plea of not criminally responsible.\u201d The circuit court concluded,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">Dr. McDaniel failed.utterly to convince the undersigned that she could not have made the same diagnosis in 1984 as she made in 2011; or that she could not have reached the same conclusion concerning the lack of criminal responsibility in 1984 as she purported to reach in 2011. She did not persuade the undersigned that the DSM-III contained material mistakes or errors in 1984 that, if changed, would have affected her opinion as to criminal responsibility in 1984. Her 2011 analysis was illogical, and her conclusions were unreliable as a matter of the application of ordinary common sense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">The circuit court also concluded it could not \u201cattribute significant weight to [Dr. McDaniel\u2019s] \u2018new\u2019 opinions[ ]\u201d because she described Petitioner\u2019s mental state as \u201cfantasy,\u201d \u201ca daydream,\u201d and \u201cbreaking with reality,\u201d but \u201cfail[ed] to commit herself to a logically conclusive window of time within which the Petitioner could be deemed to have been incapable of conforming his behavior to the requirements of the law.\u201d The circuit court observed this was in \u201cstark contrast to the cogent analysis by Dr. Tellefsen, While Dr. Tellefsen did not evaluate the Petitioner, and while she did not render an opinion on criminal responsibility, her assessment of Dr. McDaniel\u2019s diagnostic framework highlighted its rather clear deficiencies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">IY. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 Opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In a reported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s denial of the petition. <em>See Dameron Smallwood v. State of Maryland, </em>227 Md.App. 1, 132 A.3d 342 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">The Court concluded that despite the absence of an express requirement in Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 requiring a petitioner to aver the conviction was based on an offense the petitioner did not commit, judicial precedent established Maryland Rule 4-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>332, which contains such a requirement, as a judicial interpretation of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301. <em>See id. </em>at 8, 132 A.3d at 345 (citing <em>Douglas v. State, </em>423 Md. 156, 182 n. 14, 31 A.3d 250, 266 n. 14 (2011)). The Court also cited <em>Douglas </em>for the proposition that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 provides a defendant the \u201copportunity to seek a new trial based on newly discovered evidence that speaks to his or her actual innocence, as evident from the title of the statute itself.\u201d <em>See </em>423 Md. at 176, 31 A.3d at 262.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Additionally, the Court cited <em>Yonga v. State, </em>where this Court acknowledged that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 \u201cis silent on the issue\u201d of whether a person who entered a guilty plea could be granted a writ of actual innocence, but we ultimately concluded that the writ is not available to attack a conviction entered following a guilty plea. <em>See </em>446 Md. 183, 130 A.3d 486 (2016). We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b338-6\">[t]he history of the legislation, our implementation through our Rules as well as our understanding of what \u201cactual innocence\u201d means, juxtaposed against what a guilty plea involves, however, inform our conclusion that a person who has pled guilty may not later avail himself or herself of the relief afforded by the Petition for a Writ of Actual Innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b338-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 194-95,130 A.3d at 492.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">The Court of Special Appeals concluded that for a petitioner to be eligible to bring a petition for writ of actual innocence under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, the petitioner must \u201cexpressly deny committing the act that led to the conviction,\u201d which Petitioner failed to do in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-9\">Additional facts shall be provided, <em>infra, </em>to the extent they prove relevant in addressing the issues presented.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b338-11\">Generally, the standard of review when appellate courts consider the legal sufficiency of a petition for writ of actual innocence is <em>de novo. State v. Hunt, </em>443 Md. 238, 247, 116 A.3d 477, 482 (2015). Courts reviewing actions taken by a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>circuit court after a hearing on a petition for writ of actual innocence limit their review, however, to whether the trial court abused its discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 248, 116 A.3d at 482 (citing <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 188, 31 A.3d at 269).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">I. Petition for Writ of Actual Innocence Requires A Defendant to be Innocent of the Underlying of the Crimes For Which He or She Was Convicted</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In 2009, the General Assembly enacted Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 as the latest in a string of statutes that sought to create postconviction relief for defendants. <em>See infra, </em>I.2.a.; <em>see also McGhie v. State, </em>449 Md. 494, 523-24, 144 A.3d 752, 769 (2016) (Raker, J., dissenting) (discussing the schematic context in which Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 was enacted). We are compelled to clarify how broadly Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 should be applied in the context of a defendant who was deemed criminally responsible, but more recently obtained a revised psychiatric diagnosis that alleges that he should have been deemed NCR at the time of his original 1985 reverse waiver hearing. The dispute regarding whether Petitioner may bring a successful action under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 hinges on what the phrase \u201cactual innocence\u201d means in the context of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">To determine the appropriate scope of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, we noted in <em>Douglas </em>that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-9\">[i]n statutory interpretation, our primary goal is always to discern the legislative purpose, the ends to be accomplished, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>or the evils to be remedied by a particular provision, be it statutory, constitutional or part of the Rules. We begin our analysis by first looking to the normal, plain meaning of the language of the statute, reading the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory. If the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, we need not look beyond the statute\u2019s provisions and our analysis ends. Occasionally we see fit to examine extrinsic sources of legislative intent merely as a check of our reading of a statute\u2019s plain language. In such instances, we may find useful the context of a statute, the overall statutory scheme, and archival legislative history of relevant enactments.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">423 Md. at 178, 31 A.3d at 263 (quoting <em>Evans v.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301, we reiterate that in <em>Douglas, supra, </em>we concluded that we \u201c[read] the statute as a whole to ensure that no word, clause, sentence or phrase is rendered surplusage, superfluous, meaningless or nugatory.\u201d <em>Douglas, </em>423 Md. at 178, 31 A.3d at 263 (quoting <em>Evans v.

Proc. \u00a7 8-301 is not defined or clarified in the body of the statute. We therefore look to the definition of the words themselves to determine the plain meaning. \u201cActual\u201d is defined as: (1) \u201cexisting in act and not merely potentially[;]\u201d (2) \u201cexisting in fact or reality[;]\u201d or (3) \u201cnot false or apparent.\u201d MERRIAM WEBSTER DICTIONARY ONLINE, https \u00a1//wWW.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/actual (https://perma.cc/F9AP-44RE) (last accessed: December 6, 2016). \u201cInnocence\u201d is defined as \u201cfreedom from legal guilt of a particular crime or offense[;]\u201d Merriam webster dictionary online, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innocence (https://perma.cc/4TDW-EZ 4K) (last accessed: December 6, 2016); \u201c[t]he state, quality or virtue of being innocent, especially...

Black\u2019s Law Dictionary also defines \u201cactual innocence\u201d as \u201c[t]he absence of facts that are prerequisites for the sentence given to a defendant.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Under a plain interpretation of these words, \u201cactual innocence\u201d means a defendant is not guilty of a crime or offense in fact. In other words, \u201cactual innocence\u201d means the defendant did not commit the crime or offense for which he or she was convicted. This interpretation of \u201cactual innocence\u201d is further substantiated by a review of the statutory scheme in which Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301was enacted and the statute\u2019s own legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">2. Legislative History</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">The statutory scheme within which Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 was enacted and the statute\u2019s legislative history reinforce our view that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 limits relief to convicted defendants who did not commit the crimes for which they were convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">a. Statutory Scheme</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Prior to 2001, a convicted person had two avenues for postconviction relief under Maryland law. First, the convicted person could bring a claim under Title 7 of the Criminal Procedure Article, commonly known as the Uniform Postcon-viction Procedure Act. Md. Code (Repl. Vol. 2013), \u00a7\u00a7 7-101 <em>et seq. </em>of the Criminal Procedures Article. Under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-102:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-8\">(a) ... a convicted person may begin a proceeding... if the person claims that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-10\">(1) the sentence or judgment was imposed in violation of the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution or laws of the State;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-11\">(2) the court lacked jurisdiction to impose the sentence;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-12\">(3) the sentence exceeds the maximum allowed by law; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-13\">(4) the sentence is otherwise subject to collateral attack on a ground of alleged error that would otherwise be available under a writ of habeas corpus, writ of coram nobis, or other common law statutory remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>The relief offered to a convicted defendant under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-102 is limited, however, to constitutional claims. <em>Id. </em>This postconviction claim must also be filed within ten years after the sentence is imposed, unless extraordinary cause for filing later can be shown. Crim. Proc. \u00a7 7-103(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Second, a convicted person could bring a claim for postcon-viction relief under Maryland Rule 4-331. Maryland Rule 4-331 contains three independent avenues of postconviction relief. First, under sub-section (a), \u201c[o]n motion of the defendant filed within ten days after a verdict, the court, in the interest of justice, may order a new trial.\u201d Md. Rule 4-331(a). Second, under sub-section (b),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-6\">[t]he court has revisory power and control over the judgment to set aside an unjust or improper verdict and grant a new trial:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-7\">(A) in the District Court, on motion filed within 90 days after its imposition of sentence if an appeal has not been perfected;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-8\">(B) in the circuit courts, on motion filed within 90 days after its imposition of sentence. Thereafter, the court has revisory power over the judgment in case of fraud mistake, or irregularity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-9\">* * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-10\">Third, under sub-section (c):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-11\">The court may grant a new trial or other appropriate relief on the ground of newly discovered evidence which could not have been discovered by due diligence in time to move for a new trial pursuant to section (a) of this Rule:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-12\">(1) on motion filed within one year after the later of</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-13\">(A) the date the court imposed the sentence, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-14\">(B) the date the court received a mandate issued by the final appellate court to consider a direct appeal from the judgment or belated appeal permitted as postconviction relief.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b344-15\">\u2021 \u215c \u215c</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>In 2001, the General Assembly enacted an alternative post-conviction remedy, titled \u201cPetition for DNA testing and preservation of scientific identification evidence[.]\u201d Crim.

Proc. \u00a7 8-201 was enacted, we amended Maryland Rule 4-331 to provide that, on a motion filed at any time, a defendant could move for a new trial \u201cbased on DNA identification testing not subject to the procedures of [Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201] or other generally accepted scientific techniques the results of which, if proved, would show that the defendant is innocent of the crime of which the defendant was convicted.\u201d Maryland Rule 4-331(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">Finally, in 2008, the General Assembly amended Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-201 to state \u201ca petitioner may move for a new trial under this section on the grounds that the conviction was based on unreliable scientific identification evidence and a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>possibility exists that the petitioner would not have been convicted without the evidence.\u201d Crim.

Rosenberg on H.B. 366, before the House Judiciary Committee (Feb. 17, 2009) (\u201cHB 366 would make certain that convicted persons who discover new evidence supporting their <em>innocence </em>can present that evidence in a court of law.\u201d) (emphasis added); Testimony of Executive Director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project Shawn Armbrust on H.B. 366, before the House Judicial Committee (Feb. 17, 2009) (\u201c!HB 366] would create a remedy for <em>innocent </em>prisoners who currently have no legal mechanism <em>to prove their innocence </em>in Maryland courts. This bill, if appropriately amended, will result in the <em>freedom of those innocent men and women </em>in Maryland who cannot prove their <em>innocence </em>through DNA testing.\u201d) (emphasis added); State of Maryland Office of the Public Defender, Position on Proposed Legislation: SB 486, submitted to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (dated April 1, 2009) (\u201cThe bill is designed to close a gap in Maryland\u2019s postconviction and new trial procedures that prevent certain defendants from litigating <em>their claims of innocence </em>and establishing that they have been wrongly convicted.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Additionally, the testimony discussing the types of evidence the statute might address, confirm that the statute was only intended to apply to petitioners alleging newly discovered evidence that would exonerate them. For example, Delegate Rosenberg contemplated relief for convicted persons under the statute when \u201c!s]cientific evidence\u2014once thought to be credible\u2014may be found to be unreliable or completely false after subsequent research and analysis\u201d or \u201ca confession of guilt by a third person\u201d comes to light. <em>See </em>Testimony of Delegate Samuel I. Rosenberg on H.B. 366, before the House <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Judiciary Committee (Feb. 17, 2009). Assistant Public Defender Suzanne Drouet also noted that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">Science that was one time considered state of the art, for example, comparative bullet lead analysis, arson investigations, microscopic hair analysis, forensic odontology, which is bite-mark analysis, have discovered that they are in fact not particularly accurate and not particularly reliable. But it can take years or decades in some cases to make that discovery. As a result these defendants are also locked out of the courtroom.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Testimony of Assistant Public Defender Suzanne Drouet on S.B. 486, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 19, 2009). Other stakeholders to the bill also provided categories of evidence that could support a finding of innocence, but were precluded under existing postconviction statutes, including: (1) a confession by another individual to having committed the crime; (2) acknowledgement by an eyewitness or other evidence indicating he was mistaken; (3) acknowledgment by an eyewitness or other evidence indicating that the witness intentionally lied; or (4) evidence casting serious doubt on the reliability of scientific evidence used against the defendant. <em>See </em>Memorandum from the Governor\u2019s Office of Crime Control and Prevention and the Office of the Public Defender to Chairman B. Frosh and Members of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, at 8-9 (Jan. 15, 2009). In each example, the contemplated \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d would potentially exonerate the convicted defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">Finally, the testimony presented to the General Assembly repeatedly acknowledged that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 would only apply to a \u201cnarrow subset\u201d of convicted persons. Testimony of Senator Delores G. Kelley on S.B. 486, before the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (Feb. 19, 2009) (\u201cNow we are talking about a <em>very narrow subset of people in this </em>bill....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>see also </em>State of Maryland Office of the Public Defender, Position on Proposed Legislation: SB 486, submitted to Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee (dated April 1, 2009) (\u201cThis bill affords an avenue of relief for a <em>small </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>number of defendants </em>who otherwise would have no means of litigating their claims of <em>innocence.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Based on the statutory scheme for postconviction relief under Maryland law, and the legislative history that clarifies the intended purpose of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, we agree with the State that \u201c[sjection 8-301 was designed to enable wrongfully convicted defendants to exonerate themselves using newly discovered non-biological evidence.\u201d Only defendants who can allege that they are \u201cactually innocent,\u201d meaning they did not commit the crimes for which they are convicted, may bring a petition for relief under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">3. Maryland Rule 4-332</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">Maryland Rule 4-332, adopted by this Court on September 8, 2011, became effective on October 1, 2011. Petitioner filed his petition for a writ of actual innocence on August 11, 2011, two months before Maryland Rule 4-332 went into effect. Although Maryland Rule 4-332 does not govern Petitioner\u2019s case, it is pertinent to clarify the relationship between Maryland Rule 4-332 and Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">Petitioner argues that Maryland Rule 4-332\u2019s requirement that a defendant state \u201cthat the conviction sought to be vacated is based on an offense that the petitioner did not commit\u201d overrides the contents of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 because the statute does not require such a statement. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 4-332(d)(9). As we held, <em>supra, </em>Petitioner\u2019s characterization of Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 is incorrect because the statute does require a petitioner to allege he or she did not commit the crime he or she was convicted of in order to bring a claim under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">Additionally, although Petitioner contends that our rule-making authority is limited to adopting rules concerning practice and procedures, and that our rules may not \u201cabridge, enlarge or modify... substantive rights[,]\u201d <em>Mercantile-Safe Deposit &amp; Trust Co. v. Slater, </em>227 Md. 459, 467, 177 A.2d 520, 524 (1962), we have previously held that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>is \u201cboth procedural in nature and [ ] a remedial statute[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>].... \u201d <em>State v. Matthews, </em>415 Md. 286, 297, 999 A.2d 1050, 1057 (2010) (citing <em>Gregg, </em>409 Md. at 715, 976 A.2d at 1008-09 (2009)) (internal quotation marks omitted). We also noted in <em>Matthews, </em>decided before Maryland Rule 4-382 was implemented, that \u201c[i]t is appropriate to give [petitioner] the benefit of a liberal construction of the petition, particularly in light of the salutary purpose of [Section 8-301], the dearth of case law... concerning what a petition must contain in order to satisfy the strictures of [Section 8-301], and the lack, so far, of rules of procedure to guide the process.\u201d 415 Md. at 298, 999 A.2d at 1057 (quoting <em>Simms v. State, </em>409 Md. 722, 732, 976 A.2d 1012 (2009)). Thus, our own precedent recognized the need for procedural guidance on how to properly implement Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301, which Maryland Rule 4-332 provides.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">II. Even If Petitioner Were Deemed Not Criminally Responsible, Petitioner is Not \u201cActually Innocent\u201d of the Underlying Crime</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Maryland Rule 4-242 governs the entry of a defendant\u2019s plea in a criminal matter, and states that \u201c[a] defendant may plead not guilty, guilty, or, with the consent of the court, nolo contendere. <em>In addition to any of these pleas, </em>the defendant may enter a plea of not criminally responsible by reason of insanity.\u201d Md. Rule 4-242(a) (emphasis added). Crim. Proc. \u00a7 3-109 governs criminal responsibility for criminal conduct. Under \u00a7 3-109:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-7\">(a) A defendant is not criminally responsible for criminal conduct if, at the time of that conduct, the defendant, because of a mental disorder or mental retardation, lacks substantial capacity to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-8\">(1) appreciate the criminality of that conduct; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b351-9\">(2) conform that conduct to the requirements of law.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>In <em>Langworthy v. State, </em>this Court considered the legal effect when a defendant, who pled not guilty and NCR, was adjudicated guilty, but found NCR. 284 Md. 588, 594, 399 A.2d 578, 581-82 (1979). Of import to this case, we concluded in <em>Langworthy </em>the Court of Special Appeals erred by holding that the defendant could not appeal from an \u201cacquittal\u201d because the defendant \u201cwas found guilty of rape, and the dismissal of the appeal precluded appellate review of that <em>conviction, </em>As we have seen, the existing statutory scheme patently contemplates that there be first a determination of guilt or innocence under the general plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 598, 399 A.2d at 594 (emphasis added). We also concluded that \u201cthe clear legislative intent regarding the successful interposition of a plea of insanity is not that an accused is to be found not guilty of the criminal act it was proved he committed, but that he shall not be punished therefor.\u201d <em>Langworthy, </em>284 Md. at 598, 399 A.2d at 584. As we succinctly stated in <em>Pouncey v. State, </em>\u201cin the clearest possible terms, <em>Langworthy </em>disposes of the contention that a criminal defendant cannot be found both guilty and insane.\u201d 297 Md. 264, 268, 465 A.2d 475, 478 (1983) (internal footnote omitted); <em>see also Treece </em>v. <em>State, </em>313 Md. 665, 684, 547 A.2d 1054, 1064 (1988) (\u201cThe issue presented by a plea of not criminally responsible, however, does not arise until a guilty verdict has been found. The issues of guilt and criminal responsibility are separate.\u201d) (internal citations omitted). In <em>Pouncey </em>we also observed that \u201ca finding of insanity is not tantamount to an absence of <em>mens rea, </em>or inconsistent with a general intent to commit a crime[,]\u201d and the determination in that case that the defendant was not criminally responsible for her conduct, \u201cmerely relieve[d] her of liability for punishment under the criminal law.\u201d <em>Pouncey, </em>297 Md. at 269, 465 A.2d at 478.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Petitioner was found NCR at the time of his 1985 reverse waiver hearing, relief would not be available under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 because a claim of NCR is not tantamount to being \u201cactually innocent,\u201d defined <em>supra. </em>There is no dispute between the parties that on October 22, 1984, Petitioner knocked on Ms. Gibson\u2019s door, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>told her he had a package she needed to sign for, and when she answered the door he stabbed her ten times causing her death. Regardless of whether Petitioner was \u201cfantasizing\u201d or \u201cdissociating\u201d when he attacked Ms. Gibson, his actions caused her death, and he was adjudicated \u201cguilty\u201d of murdering her. <em>Langworthy </em>and its progeny establish the separation of the guilt phase and criminal responsibility phase when a defendant pleads NCR. Just because evidence exists suggesting Petitioner could have been found NCR at the time of his 1985 proceeding does not alter the fact that he was still \u201cguilty\u201d of killing Ms. Gibson, and his original conviction would therefore not be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">In summary, this Court concludes that Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 requires a petitioner to allege he or she is \u201cactually innocent,\u201d meaning he or she did not commit the crime, to petition for relief under the statute. Even if Petitioner was found NCR at the time of the 1985 proceeding, he was still guilty of killing Ms. Gibson, and therefore, was not \u201cactually innocent\u201d of the crime for which he was convicted. Accordingly, Petitioner\u2019s claim under Crim. Proc. \u00a7 8-301 fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.
