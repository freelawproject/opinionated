Accordingly, the trial court should not have conducted a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine its admissibility, and we will not address Mr. Phillips\u2019 contention that the trial court\u2019s ruling at that hearing was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">The State charged Mr. Phillips with the first-degree murders of his ex-girlfriend, Wynetta Wright, and their eleven-month-old daughter, Jaylin Wright, which took place on May 31, 2011. Wynetta died of a gunshot wound to the head. Her body was found in a park near the Hillcrest Heights Community Center in Prince George\u2019s County. Jaylin died of hyperth-ermia as a result of being left in a hot vehicle for an extended period of time. Her body was found in Wynetta\u2019s car in a parking lot near the park. Mr. Phillips admitted to meeting with Wynetta in the park in the early morning hours of May 31, but denied any involvement in her death or Jaylin\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">The police obtained DNA samples from the crime scenes, the victims, and Mr. Phillips, which were tested in June 2011 by forensic chemist Jessica Charak of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department Crime Laboratory (\u201cPrince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u201d or \u201cLaboratory\u201d). Two samples are relevant to this appeal: a buccal swab<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> from Mr. Phillips, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>and a sample obtained from the steering wheel of Wynetta\u2019s car. Based on Ms. Charak\u2019s analysis, she concluded that the steering wheel sample was consistent with Mr. Phillips\u2019 DNA profile and, therefore, he could not be excluded as a contributor to the sample. Ms, Charak found that the steering wheel sample also contained genetic material from Wynetta, Jaylin, and at least two additional unknown contributors. Ms. Charak calculated that (&lt;[t]he chances of selecting an unrelated individual from the random population who would be included as a possible contributor to the mixed DNA profile obtained from the evidence sample ... are approximately ... 1 in 2.93 million individuals in the African American population.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">Prior to trial, Mr. Phillips filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the State\u2019s DNA evidence and related expert testimony. Mr. Phillips argued that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s methods of analyzing complex, low-template DNA<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> samples were not generally accepted as reliable in the relevant scientific community, and thus the evidence was inadmissible under <em>Frye-Reed. </em>The State responded that the DNA evidence and related expert testimony were automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915, and thus a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing was not necessary to determine admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">The DNA Admissibility Statute in effect throughout Mr. Phillips\u2019 proceedings provided that DNA evidence \u201cis admissible to prove or disprove the identity of any person,\u201d so long as certain conditions are fulfilled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">(a) Definitions.\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">(2) \u201cDeoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\u201d means the molecules in all cellular forms that contain genetic information in a chemical structure of each individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">(3) \u201cDNA profile\u201d means an analysis of genetic loci that have [sic] been validated according to standards established by:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">(i) The Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM); or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">(ii) The DNA Advisory Board of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">(b) <em>In </em>general.\u2014A statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board is sufficient to admit a DNA profile under this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-10\">(c) Purposes.\u2014In any criminal proceeding, the evidence of a DNA profile is admissible to prove or disprove the identity of any person, if the party seeking to introduce the evidence of a DNA profile [complies with specified notice requirements].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1998) (emphasis added) (amended 2016). Ms. Charak\u2019s report contained the following statement of validation: \u201cThe DNA profiles reported below were determined by procedures which have been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b217-12\">The trial court conducted two hearings to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. First, the trial court held a hearing to determine whether the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory was in compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute, which would render the evidence automatically admissible without the need for a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing. At this initial hearing, the trial court determined that the Laboratory was not in compliance with the Statute, and therefore the DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>evidence was not automatically admissible. Next, the trial court conducted a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the Laboratory\u2019s methods of analysis were generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific community. The trial court concluded that the Laboratory\u2019s methods satisfied this standard, and therefore the DNA evidence would be admissible at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">Mr. Phillips was tried before a jury beginning on January 14, 2013. The trial court admitted into evidence the analysis of the buccal swab and steering wheel sample, and Ms. Charak testified regarding her conclusions. On January 17, 2013, the jury convicted Mr. Phillips of the first-degree murders of Wynetta and Jaylin, and related charges. On March 22, 2013, the trial court sentenced Mr. Phillips to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Mr. Phillips appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the convictions. <em>Phillips v. State, </em>226 Md.App. 1, 4, 126 A.3d 739 (2015). Mr. Phillips then petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, requesting review of whether the lower courts erred in holding that the DNA evidence was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed.</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em>, </em>The State filed a conditional cross-petition, requesting review of whether the lower courts erred in holding that the DNA evidence did not qualify for automatic admissi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>bility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We granted both the petition and the cross-petition on March 25, 2016. <em>Phillips v. State, </em>446 Md. 704, 133 A.3d 1110 (2016).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">The trial court\u2019s determination that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory was not in compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute, to the extent that this is a factual finding, will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. <em>See Bottini v. Dep\u2019t of Fin., </em>450 Md. 177, 187, 147 A.3d 371 (2016) (\u201cWe give due regard to the trial court\u2019s role as fact-finder and will not set aside factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d (quoting <em>Breeding v. Koste, </em>443 Md. 15, 27, 115 A.3d 106 (2015))). However, \u201c[w]hen the trial court\u2019s decision involves an interpretation and application of Maryland statutory and case law, our Court must determine whether the [trial] court\u2019s conclusions are legally correct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(second alteration in original) (quoting <em>Breeding, </em>443 Md. at 27, 115 A.3d 106).</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">Mr. Phillips argues that the trial court erred in admitting the DNA evidence at trial because the State did not establish at the <em>Fry e-Reed </em>hearing that the methods used by the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory in conducting its analysis are generally accepted as reliable within the relevant scientific community. Before we can address that argument, however, we must determine the threshold issue of whether Mr. Phillips was even entitled to a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing regarding the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">In Maryland, scientific evidence can become admissible either by statute, \u201cif a relevant statute exists,\u201d or by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>establishing general acceptance in the relevant scientific community under <em>Frye-Reed. Armstead v. State, </em>342 Md. 38, 54, 673 A.2d 221 (1996). Here, a relevant statute exists\u2014the DNA Admissibility Statute, CJP \u00a7 10-915. The DNA Admissibility Statute provides that DNA evidence is admissible so long as certain notice requirements are met and the analysis is accompanied by \u201c[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\u201d CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1998) (amended 2016). \u201cWhen the General Assembly has enacted legislation rendering evidence admissible, \u2018the only way to contest the validity of the underlying principles involved would be to argue that the statutes violate one\u2019s right to due process of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Armstead, </em>342 Md. at 57, 673 A.2d 221 (quoting L. McLain, <em>Maryland Evidence \u00a7 4.014(c), </em>at 278 (1987 &amp; 1999 Cum. Supp.)). Mr. Phillips has not argued before this Court that the DNA Admissibility Statute violates his right to due process.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, if the DNA evidence offered by the State at Mr. Phillips\u2019 trial satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 10-915, then Mr. Phillips was not entitled to a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine its admissibility. Therefore, we must first determine whether the DNA evidence introduced against Mr. Phillips qualified for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\n<em>A The Parties\u2019 Contentions and Lower Courts\u2019 Rulings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Mr. Phillips argues that the DNA evidence was not automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915 because Ms. Cha-rak\u2019s report was not accompanied by a statement that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>analysis had \u201cbeen validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board,\u201d as required by the Statute. Instead, the report was accompanied by a statement that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s procedures had \u201cbeen validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\u201d Mr. Phillips asserts that this statement of validation is not sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">The State responds that the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under CJP \u00a7 10-915 because Maryland law requires state forensics laboratories to adhere to the QAS for DNA testing. <em>See </em>Md. Code, Pub. Safety \u00a7 2-503(b) (requiring state laboratories to comply with federal standards for inclusion in the Combined DNA Index System). The two entities named in the Statute no longer exist, and the QAS are now the relevant standards. Therefore, the State asserts, a statement of validation that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s procedures had been validated according to the QAS should be sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">The trial court agreed with Mr. Phillips that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s statement of validation was not sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute. Because TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board were no longer in existence at the time the Laboratory performed its analysis, the court found that TWGDAM\u2019s successor, \u201cSWGDAM[,] is now the entity that sets forth the standards for DNA testing.\u201d The trial court then interpreted the Statute by \u201csubstituting\u201d SWGDAM for TWGDAM, and held that compliance with SWGDAM guidelines was required for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915. The court found that SWGDAM had guidelines for interpreting complex DNA mixtures, which the Laboratory did not follow when it performed its analysis. Thus, the trial court held that the Laboratory\u2019s compliance with the QAS was not sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915, and proceeded to conduct a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine whether the DNA evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>could be admitted at trial. The trial court ultimately determined that the DNA evidence was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>and the State introduced Ms. Charak\u2019s report and testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Before the Court of Special Appeals, Mr. Phillips asserted that the trial court\u2019s ruling on the State\u2019s noncompliance with \u00a7 10-915 was correct, but challenged the trial court\u2019s ruling on admissibility under <em>Frye-Reed. </em>In response, the State erroneously asserted that the trial court had found that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s statement of validation was sufficient under the Statute, and therefore the court was precluded from even holding a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. Neither party explicitly addressed how the appellate court should interpret \u00a7 10-915 in light of the fact that the two entities named in the Statute no longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The Court of Special Appeals framed the issue as \u201cde-cid[ing] what to do with a statute that appears to be obsolete.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>226 Md.App. at 3, 126 A.3d 739. The court then presented a lengthy discussion of how to deal with obsolete statutes, <em>id. </em>at 8-12, 126 A.3d 739, an examination of the legislative history of \u00a7 10-915, <em>id. </em>at 12-14, 126 A.3d 739, and a comparison of the current and previous standards-setting bodies for DNA testing. <em>Id. </em>at 14-16, 126 A.3d 739. Following this analysis, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that a DNA analysis would be automatically admissible under \u00a7 10-915 if accompanied by a statement of validation \u201cpursuant to standards promulgated by SWGDAM.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 15, 126 A.3d 739. In contrast, the court concluded that a DNA analysis conducted pursuant to the QAS would not be sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute. <em>Id. </em>at 16, 126 A.3d 739. In other words, the Court of Special Appeals agreed with the trial court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 10-915, and held that the lower court was correct in holding a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence. <em>Id. </em>The Court of Special Appeals then held, in agreement with the trial court, that the DNA evidence was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed. Id. </em>at 22,126 A.3d 739. Mr. Phillips petitioned this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Court to review the lower courts\u2019 rulings that the DNA evidence was admissible under <em>Frye-Reed. </em>The State filed a conditional cross-petition, seeking review of the lower courts\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 10-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\n<em>B. Mootness</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">After we granted certiorari on Mr. Phillips\u2019 petition and the State\u2019s cross-petition, Mr. Phillips filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s cross-petition as moot. Mr. Phillips argues that this Court need not decide whether the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation of \u00a7 10-915 is correct, because the version of the Statute that that court interpreted is no longer in effect. During the 2016 Legislative Session, the General Assembly passed an amendment to CJP \u00a7 10-915 so that the Statute now references the QAS, in addition to TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board, as providing the DNA testing standards that must be followed for automatic admissibility. <em>See </em>2016 Md. Laws, ch. 570. These changes to the statutory language were adopted directly in response to the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 opinion below. The State maintains that its cross-petition is not moot because there is still an existing controversy between the parties\u2014namely, whether the State\u2019s DNA evidence was automatically admissible at Mr. Phillips\u2019 trial under the previous version of \u00a7 10-915. In addition, the State notes that the amended Statute applies only prospectively to offenses committed on or after the effective date of October 1, 2016, <em>see id. </em>so this Court\u2019s resolution of how to interpret the previous version could potentially affect \u201cmany, many other pending cases\u201d involving DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">\u201cA case is moot when there is no longer any existing controversy between the parties at the time that the case is before the [C]ourt, or when the [Cjourt can no longer fashion an effective remedy.\u201d <em>Green v. Nassif, </em>401 Md. 649, 654, 934 A.2d 22 (2007) (quoting <em>In re Kaela C., </em>394 Md. 432, 452, 906 A.2d 915 (2006)). The Court does not issue advisory opinions, and thus moot cases are generally dismissed \u201cwithout a decision on the merits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655, 934 A.2d 22 (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Human Res., Child Care Admin, v. Roth, </em>398 Md. 137, 143, 919 A.2d 1217 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Here, there is still an existing controversy between the parties. The controversy is whether the DNA evidence qualified for automatic admissibility at Mr. Phillips\u2019 trial pursuant to the previous version of \u00a7 10-915. Because \u00a7 10-915 was recently amended to make explicit that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility, the parties\u2019 dispute over whether the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s compliance with the QAS was sufficient in this case would already be resolved if the offense had been committed on or after October 1, 2016. However, because the 2016 amendments to the Statute apply only prospectively, we still must determine whether the Laboratory complied with the previous version of the Statute, which was in effect at all times relevant to this proceeding: when the charged offenses occurred, when the Laboratory performed its analysis, during the <em>pre-Frye-Reed </em>hearing, and during Mr. Phillips\u2019 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">Additionally, this Court can fashion an effective remedy by deciding the proper interpretation of the previous version of the Statute, and either affirming Mr. Phillips\u2019 convictions or reversing them and remanding the case for a new trial (if we were to also decide that the DNA evidence was not otherwise admissible, and that any error in admitting it was not harmless).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">Because there is still an existing controversy between the parties, and the Court can fashion an effective remedy, we hold that the State\u2019s cross-petition, regarding the proper interpretation of \u00a7 10-915 before it was amended in 2016, is not moot. Accordingly, Mr. Phillips\u2019 motion to dismiss the State\u2019s cross-petition as moot is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">\n<em>C. Compliance with CJP \u00a7 10-915</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">Next, we address the merits of the State\u2019s contention that the lower courts erred in determining that the DNA evidence introduced against Mr. Phillips did not meet the requirements for automatic admissibility under the DNA Admissibility Stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ute. As set out above, CJP \u00a7 10\u2014915(b) provided that \u201c[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board is sufficient to admit a DNA profile under this section.\u201d The Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s analysis was accompanied by a statement that its procedures had \u201cbeen validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories.\u201d We must determine whether this statement of validation satisfies the requirement of \u00a7 10-915(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Mr. Phillips maintains that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s statement of validation is insufficient because it does not explicitly state that the Laboratory\u2019s analysis had been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board. In fact, Mr. Phillips asserts, the Laboratory\u2019s analysis could not possibly include such a statement because neither TWGDAM nor the DNA Advisory Board were in existence when the Laboratory performed its analysis in June 2011. The State counters that since TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board went defunct, state and federal law have required forensics laboratories to adhere to the QAS. Therefore, the State concludes, although the DNA Admissibility Statute does not explicitly mention the QAS, the Laboratory\u2019s compliance with those standards should be deemed sufficient for automatic admissibility of the DNA evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">The trial court found as a matter of fact, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board were no longer in existence when the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory performed its analysis in June 2011. <em>See Phillips, </em>226 Md.App. at 8, 15, 126 A.Sd 739. The trial court also found as a matter of fact, and the Court of Special Appeals agreed, that the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods, or SWGDAM, is the successor entity to TWGDAM. <em>Id. </em>at 14, 126 A.3d 739. Then, after examining the legislative history of the DNA Admissibility Statute, the Court of Special Appeals determined \u201cthat the legislature intended to create a statute that would track cutting-edge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>DNA science and ensure automatic admissibility only if the DNA techniques complied with the standards promulgated by the most rigorous standards-setting body available.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Next, the Court of Special Appeals compared SWGDAM guidelines for DNA testing to the QAS, just as the trial court had done. <em>Id. </em>The intermediate appellate court noted that while SWGDAM guidelines represent \u201crigorous standards for cutting-edge DNA technology,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 15, 126 A.3d 739, the QAS are simply \u201colder protocols that are \u2018good enough.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16, 126 A.3d 739. The Court of Special Appeals then concluded (as had the trial court) that while a DNA analysis conducted in accordance with SWGDAM guidelines would be sufficient for automatic admissibility under the Statute, one that was conducted in accordance with the QAS was not. <em>Id. </em>at 15-16, 126 A.3d 739. Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals held that the Laboratory\u2019s statement of validation was not sufficient under CJP \u00a7 10-915(b). <em>Id. </em>at 16,126 A.3d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">The arguments from both Mr. Phillips and the State, as well as the conclusions of the trial court and the intermediate appellate court, appear to be premised on a misunderstanding of the evolution of TWGDAM, SWGDAM, the DNA Advisory Board, and the QAS, and the relationship between these entities and the DNA Admissibility Statute. In order to resolve this confusion, we will examine the interrelated histories of these standards-setting bodies, and view them in the context of the legislative history of the DNA Admissibility Statute. In doing so, we begin by setting forth this Court\u2019s well-established rules of statutory construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">This Court provides judicial deference to the policy decisions enacted into law by the General Assembly.

Rather than continually relitigating whether DNA evidence had achieved \u201cgeneral acceptance in the relevant scientific community\u201d under <em>Frye-Reed, </em>\u00a7 10-915 provided that DNA evidence is automatically admissible, so long as certain conditions are met. <em>Id. </em>at 58, 673 A.2d 221. The 1991 version of the Statute specifically allowed for the automatic admissibility of DNA evidence that was analyzed according to the restriction fragment length polymorphism (\u201cRFLP\u201d) method. CJP \u00a7 10-915 (1991) (amended 1997). But by 1997, the RFLP method had become outdated, and was superseded by a new technique called the polymerase chain reaction (\u201cPCR\u201d) method. Jud. Proc. Comm., <em>Bill Analysis: House Bill JpH </em>(1997). Because the 1991 Statute specified only that DNA evidence analyzed using RFLP was automatically admissible, state\u2019s attorneys seeking to admit PCR DNA evidence were once again forced to establish its admissibility under <em>Frye-Reed </em>on a case-by-case basis. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">The General Assembly again sought to eliminate the need for <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearings for every piece of DNA evidence by amending the Statute to reflect the advancements that had occurred in the field of DNA analysis. <em>Id. </em>Initially, the legislature proposed to do this by simply inserting the PCR method into the Statute alongside the RFLP method, such that an analysis conducted utilizing either method would qualify for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>automatic admissibility. <em>See </em>House Bill 414\u2014First Reading, 1997 Leg., 411th Sess. (Md. Jan. 24, 1997) (\u201c\u2018DNA profile\u2019 means an analysis that utilizes the restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis OR POLYMERASE CHAIN REACTION of DNA resulting in the identification of an individual\u2019s [patterned] chemical structure of genetic information.\u201d (capitalization in original to show addition to existing law) (brackets in original to show deletion from existing law)). Before the bill was passed, however, it was amended to define \u201cDNA profile\u201d as \u201can analysis of genetic loci that have [sic] been validated according to standards established by ... (I) ... TWGDAM; or (II) The DNA Advisory Board.\u201d House Bill 414, 1997 Leg., 411th Sess. (Md. 1997). Additionally, a statement from the testing laboratory that the analysis had been validated accordingly would be sufficient for automatic admissibility. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Thus, rather than replace the RFLP method with PCR or any other specified method of analysis, the General Assembly chose to delegate the power to approve new DNA analysis techniques to two national standards-setting bodies: TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board. While the Bill File for House Bill 414 (1997) does not expressly state the reasoning behind these amendments, we infer that, given the Statute\u2019s history, legislators had realized that the science of DNA analysis was rapidly evolving, and any attempt by the legal system to keep up would inevitably fall short. In effect, the General Assembly decided that if a new technique was good enough for approval by one of these two entities, then it was good enough for automatic admissibility in Maryland courts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">TWGDAM was a group of private and public sector forensic scientists convened by the FBI in 1988 to establish guidelines for DNA testing in forensic laboratories throughout the country.

This legislation also provided that, \u201c[u]ntil such time as the advisory board has made recommendations to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director has acted upon those recommendations, the quality assurance guidelines adopted by the technical working group on DNA analysis methods [(TWGDAM)] shall be deemed the Director\u2019s standards.\u201d \u00a7 14131(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Pursuant to this legislation, the FBI Director established the DNA Advisory Board, which began developing standards for DNA testing in 1996.

In 1999, TWGDAM was renamed the Scientific Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods, or \u201cSWGDAM.\u201d SWGDAM, <em>History &amp; Evolution of DNA QA Standards, supra </em>at 3. In December 2000, the DNA Advisory Board expired at the end of its statutory term and transferred its responsibility for recommending revisions to the QAS to SWGDAM. <em>Id. </em>at 22; see <em>also </em>\u00a7 14131(b)(4) (\u201cThe board shall cease to exist on the date 5 years after the initial appointments are made to the board .... \u201d). Thus, by December 2000, both of the standards-setting bodies named in the DNA Admissibility Statute had ceased to exist, at least under the names specified in the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Recognizing this discrepancy in the statutory language, the General Assembly twice attempted to amend CJP \u00a7 10-915 between 2000 and 2015. In 2001, House Bill 857 proposed to amend the Statute by simply replacing all references to \u201cTWGDAM\u201d with \u201cSWGDAM.\u201d House Bill 857, 2001 Leg., 415th Sess. (Md. 2001).

The DNA Identification Act requires all DNA laboratories that are federally funded or operated, or participate in the National DNA Index System, to demonstrate compliance with the QAS. FBI, <em>Combined, DNA Index System (CODIS).</em><footnotemark><em>16</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The FBI monitors laboratories\u2019 compliance with the QAS through its annual audit process. Every other year, forensics laboratories must undergo an external audit to ensure that their procedures comply with the QAS. During in-between years, the laboratories are permitted to undertake an internal audit, where the laboratories\u2019 own scientists evaluate their procedures for compliance with the QAS. At the pre-<em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing in this case, Ms. Charak testified that the National Forensic Science Technology Center performed an external audit on the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory in July 2010, and determined that the Laboratory was in compliance with the QAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Also during this time, SWGDAM continued its duty of periodically recommending revisions to the QAS to reflect scientific and technological advancements in DNA testing. SWGDAM, <em>About Us, supra. </em>In 2007, SWGDAM submitted to the FBI Director its recommendation for substantial revisions to the QAS. The FBI Director adopted these recommendations and issued the first revised QAS in October 2008, with an effective date of July 1, 2009.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> SWGDAM, <em>History &amp; Evolution of DNA QA Standards, supra </em>at 31. In 2011, SWGDAM submitted its recommendation for additional, minor revisions to the QAS, which were approved by the FBI Director with an effective date of September 1, 2011. <em>Id. </em>at 38-39. Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>2007 version of the QAS were the relevant standards when the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory performed its analysis in this case (in June 2011), and when it was audited by the National Forensic Science Technology Center (in July 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">This history makes pellucid that the lower courts were correct in finding that TWGDAM and the DNA Advisory Board did not exist under those names at the time the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory received its statement of validation, or at the time the analysis in this case was performed. However, that finding is not dispositive of whether the Laboratory\u2019s analysis satisfied the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b). All that is required for automatic admissibility under that provision is \u201c[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board.\u201d \u00a7 10-915(b). The Statute does not require that either of these entities remain in existence at the time the procedures are validated, or when the analysis is performed. As long as the laboratory\u2019s procedures have been validated by standards previously established by one of these entities, and the analysis is performed in accordance with those validated procedures, then the analysis qualifies for automatic admissibility under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">Although the QAS are not explicitly mentioned in the DNA Admissibility Statute (before the 2016 amendments), they are literally \u201cstandards established by ... the DNA Advisory Board.\u201d As described above, the QAS are two sets of standards for DNA testing and databasing promulgated by the DNA Advisory Board in 1998 and 1999, respectively. And while the FBI Director revised the QAS in 2007 at the recommendation of SWGDAM, we do not believe that these subsequent revisions, by an entity not explicitly named in the statute, transform the 2007 QAS into something other than \u201cstandards established by ... the DNA Advisory Board.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Furthermore, we view the General Assembly\u2019s decision not to amend the Statute between 2000 and 2015, despite multiple proposals, as an indication that legislators did not view the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>Statute as \u201cobsolete\u201d or ineffective. To the contrary, this inaction illustrates that the previous version of the Statute continued to serve its purpose of allowing for the automatic admissibility of DNA evidence without the need for <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearings. It was not until the Court of Special Appeals interpreted the Statute as \u201cobsolete\u201d that the General Assembly decided to amend the Statute for clarification. The 2016 amendments made clear that, although the standards-setting bodies named in the Statute no longer exist under those names, the standards they promulgated remain in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Therefore, we hold that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s statement of validation, that the DNA analysis in this case was \u201cdetermined by procedures which have been validated according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Quality Assurance Standards for Forensic DNA Testing Laboratories,\u201d satisfies the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">\n<em>D. Adequacy of the QAS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Alternatively, Mr. Phillips argues that even if compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915, it should not be sufficient to admit the particular DNA analysis performed in this case because the QAS do not have standards pertaining to complex, low-template DNA. The State responds that while the QAS do not specifically address complex, low-template DNA, they also do not preclude analyses of this category of DNA evidence. Therefore, the State asserts, because the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory followed all applicable QAS when performing its analysis, the DNA evidence qualifies for automatic admissibility under CJP \u00a7 10-915.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-8\">At the <em>pre-Frye-Reed </em>hearing, Ms. Charak\u2014testifying for the State\u2014and Dr. Charlotte Word\u2014testifying for Mr. Phillips\u2014generally agreed that the QAS do not specifically address complex, low-template DNA. Dr. Word testified that the QAS do not distinguish between \u201ctwo-person mixture[s], three-person mixtures, four-person mixtures, good quality DNA, [or] low quality DNA.\u201d Ms. Charak, when asked if she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>was \u201caware of a standard that has been generally accepted within the scientific community for reliably interpreting complex mixtures of low template DNA,\u201d responded, \u201cA standard? There is no such standard.\u201d Additionally, the trial court found that there were SWGDAM guidelines \u201cin place as of 2009\u201d that dealt with complex DNA mixtures, but these guidelines had not yet been adopted by the FBI Director and incorporated into the QAS. The trial court also found that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory was not following the SWGDAM guidelines, and that it did \u201cnot have specific protocols as it relates to the complex mixtures that are addressed in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">The trial court\u2019s findings that the QAS did not address complex, low-template DNA and that the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory did not have any protocols for analyzing this category of DNA, are not clearly erroneous; however, those findings are not relevant to the admissibility of DNA evidence under CJP \u00a7 10-915. All that is required for admissibility under the Statute is \u201c[a] statement from the testing laboratory setting forth that the analysis of genetic loci has been validated by standards established by TWGDAM or the DNA Advisory Board,\u201d and compliance with the notice requirements. As we stated above, the Laboratory satisfied these requirements with respect to the DNA evidence admitted against Mr. Phillips. Therefore, the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">In essence, Mr. Phillips argues that mere compliance with the DNA Admissibility Statute is not good enough for automatic admissibility when the DNA analysis at issue is not covered by any applicable standards. However, the legislative history detailed above and the recent amendments to the Statute make clear that CJP \u00a7 10-915 was not intended to be a \u201cbest practices\u201d statute. In 2006, both OPD and the MSBA opposed amending the Statute to state that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for automatic admissibility. Both organizations asserted that SWGDAM was the proper standards-setting body because their guidelines reflect ongoing scientific development, whereas the QAS do not. <em>See </em>OPD, <em>Position on </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number><em>Proposed Legislation\u2014House Bill 274, supra; </em>MSBA, <em>Position on House Bill 274, supra. </em>Similarly, at the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee hearing on the 2016 proposed amendments to the Statute, Stephen Mercer, Chief Attorney of the Forensics Division of OPD,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> testified that the Statute should be amended such that compliance with SWGDAM guidelines is required for automatic admissibility. Evidence\u2014 <em>Admissibility of DNA Profile\u2014Definition and Validation of DNA Profile: Hearing on Senate Bill 637 Before Senate Committee on Judicial Proceedings, </em>2016 Leg., 436th Sess. (Md. 2016) (statement of Stephen Mercer, Chief Attorney, Forensics Division, OPD).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Mr. Mercer noted that the SWGDAM guidelines apply to \u201ccutting-edge\u201d DNA technology, while the QAS do not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">Despite these objections, the General Assembly passed and Governor Hogan signed Senate Bill 637, which made explicit that compliance with the QAS is sufficient for the automatic admissibility of DNA evidence. <em>See </em>2016 Md. Laws, ch. 570. The current Statute does not mention SWGDAM. We view this as an indication that CJP \u00a7 10-915 was not intended to be a \u201cbest practices\u201d statute, such that only DNA evidence that has been analyzed in accordance \u201cwith the standards promulgated by the most rigorous standards-setting body available\u201d would qualify for automatic admissibility. <em>See Phillips, </em>226 Md.App. at 14, 126 A.3d 739. Instead, the DNA Admissibility Statute allows for the admission of any DNA evidence, both cutting-edge and traditional, without the need to establish its general acceptance and reliability under <em>Fry e-Reed, </em>so long as the analysis was performed in accordance with the minimum requirements promulgated by the FBI. The Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s analysis complied with these minimum requirements; that the federal standards do not specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>address analyses of complex, low-template DNA samples is immaterial to admissibility under the Statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">That the DNA evidence was automatically admissible under the Statute does not mean that Mr. Phillips was entirely unable to challenge such evidence. Mr. Phillips could have attacked the weight to be given the DNA evidence based on the lack of an accepted standard for analyzing complex, low-template DNA samples by either cross-examining Ms. Charak at trial or calling a rebuttal expert as he did at the pretrial hearings. In fact, defense counsel did cross-examine Ms. Cha-rak regarding her qualifications to perform this type of analysis and questioned the legitimacy of some of the methodologies she employed. However, Mr. Phillips did not present his rebuttal expert, Dr. Word, to fully explain the alleged issues with the analysis that Ms. Charak performed. As the Court of Special Appeals noted, \u201c[w]e find it telling that [Mr.] Phillips chose not to do so.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 23, 126 A.3d 739.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">We hold that the statement of validation that accompanied the Prince George\u2019s County Laboratory\u2019s analysis of the DNA evidence introduced against Mr. Phillips satisfied the requirement of CJP \u00a7 10-915(b), and therefore the DNA evidence was automatically admissible. The trial court erred in conducting a <em>Frye-Reed </em>hearing to determine the admissibility of the DNA evidence, but that error was harmless because the trial court ultimately reached the correct conclusion that the DNA evidence was admissible.
