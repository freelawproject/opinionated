The petition requested that Tollgate be permitted to construct a Wawa on an 8.51 acre property known as 10609 Reisterstown Road (\u201cthe property\u201d). The property is zoned as BL-AS, or Business Local with Automotive Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The property is bordered by Reis-terstown Road, Groff Lane, and the Gwynns Falls stream.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">The Office of Administrative Hearings (\u201cOAH\u201d) conducted a hearing in which the Applicants appeared in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>grant of the Special Exception. Petitioners in this Court, Afshin Attar, Ashkan Rahmanattar, Malik Imran, and Perry S. Crowl (collectively \u201cProtestants\u201d) attended in opposition. Witnesses for the Protestants testified at the hearing as to how the proposed Wawa would cause traffic congestion, a harmful environmental impact, and a detrimental effect upon the economic stability of the neighborhood. In its Opinion and Order dated October 31, 2013, OAH found that \u201cthese are impacts that are inherent in the operation of a gasoline/convenience store[,]\u201d and granted the Petition with conditions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">The Protestants appealed to the Board of Appeals for Baltimore County (\u201cthe Board\u201d), which approved the conditions for the Special Exception after a <em>de novo </em>evidentiary hearing. The Board noted that Tollgate</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>decided to proceed with the request for a Special Exception before receiving County approval for the proposed road relocation and approval for the flood plain relocation from [the Federal Emergency Management Agency]. Under the BCZR this approach is not prohibited and therefore the grant of a Special Exception has no bearing on the approval o[r] non-approval of the foregoing matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">The Board granted the Special Exception \u201cwith the same conditions as those imposed by the Administrative Law Judge below.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">The Protestants appealed for judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The circuit court found that the Board\u2019s findings: \u201cwere both reasonable and supported by substantial evidence in the record[]\u201d and \u201cwere premised upon the proper application and conclusions of law[.]\u201d The circuit court accordingly affirmed the decision of the Board on December 19, 2014. Thereafter, the Protestants appealed to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion dated December 28, 2015, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court. We granted the Petition for Writ of Certiorari filed by the Protestants. 447 Md. 297, 185 A.3d 416 (2016). Protestants present two questions for our review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-7\">1. Whether Maryland\u2019s special exception jurisprudence requires the Baltimore County Board of Appeals to define the boundaries of the neighborhood of the proposed special exception before approving that special exception and, if so, whether the Board of Appeals\u2019 opinion satisfied Maryland\u2019s minimum requirements for articulating the facts found regarding the neighborhood\u2019s boundaries.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-8\">2. Whether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that the Applicant met its burden of proof, as articulated by the concurring opinion in <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Baltimore County, et al. v. Loyola College in Maryland, </em>406 Md. 54, [956 A.2d 166] (2008).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">We conclude that the Board\u2019s description of the neighborhood impacted by the special exception was precise enough to enable a party or appellate court to comprehend the area that the Board considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>Secondly, we conclude that while an applicant for a special exception bears both the burden of persuasion and production, the coexistent presumption in favor of an applicant is not a mutually exclusive evidentiary burden. The Board correctly determined that the Protestants failed to sufficiently rebut the presumption of validity of a special exception. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">An appellate court reviews the decision of an administrative agency \u201cunder the same statutory standards as the [circuit [c]ourt,\u201d meaning \u201cwe reevaluate the decision of the agency, not the decision of the lower court.\u201d <em>Gigeous v. Eastern Correctional Inst., </em>363 Md. 481, 495-96, 769 A.2d 912, 921 (2001) (citation and footnote omitted). In reviewing the decision of an agency, our role \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d <em>United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. 569, 577, 650 A.2d 226, 230 (1994). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Md. State Police v. Warwick Supply &amp; Equip. Co., Inc., </em>330 Md. 474, 494, 624 A.2d 1238, 1248 (1993) (citation omitted). Further, we may not substitute our judgment for that of the Board of Appeals unless the agency\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence or were premised on an error of law. <em>Stansbury v. Jones, </em>372 Md. 172, 182, 184, 812 A.2d 312, 318, 319 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">I. The Board\u2019s Opinion Referenced Ample Evidence of Record Which Sufficiently Enables Us to Comprehend the Area the Board Considered. Thus, the Board Sufficiently Defined the Neighborhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The Protestants argue that the Board erred when it failed to define the boundaries of the Wawa\u2019s neighborhood. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>support, Protestants urge that an applicant for a special exception must establish the boundaries of the neighborhood, and the zoning tribunal\u2019s written decision must satisfy Maryland law\u2019s minimum requirements for articulating the facts found regarding the neighborhood\u2019s boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">Under BCZR \u00a7 502.1(A), a special exception use is prohibited if it is \u201cdetrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the locality involved.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Schultz v. Pritts, </em>we held that an applicant for a special exception \u201cdoes not have the burden of establishing affirmatively that his proposed use would be a benefit to the community. If he shows to the satisfaction of the Board that the proposed use would be conducted <em>without real detriment to the neighborhood </em>... he has met his burden.\u201d 291 Md. 1,11, 432 A.2d 1319,1325 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">We further held in <em>Montgomery County v. Butler, </em>\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018detriment to the neighborhood\u2019 implies necessarily that the Board\u2019s task is to determine if there is or likely will be a detriment <em>to the surrounding properties.\u201d </em>417 Md. 271, 305, 9 A.3d 824, 844 (2010) (emphasis added). Thus, we held that, within the context of a special exception, the \u201cneighborhood\u201d means \u201cthe surrounding properties.\u201d <em>Id. See also Montgomery v. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s Cty., </em>263 Md. 1, 5, 280 A.2d 901, 903 (1971) (holding that, in the rezoning context, \u201c[t]he concept of a neighborhood is a flexible one, and will vary according to the geographical location involved[.]\u201d); <em>Woodlawn Area Citizens Ass\u2019n v. Bd. of Cty. Comm\u2019rs for Prince George\u2019s Cty, </em>241 Md. 187, 198, 216 A.2d 149, 156 (1966) (holding that, in the rezoning context, \u201cwhat constitutes a neighborhood ... is not and should not be precisely and rigidly defined[.]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">In <em>Alviani v. Dixon, </em>we considered whether the Anne Arundel County Board of Appeals erred when it granted variances<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> to enable applicants to satisfy criteria for a special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>exception, regarding the construction of an automotive service station. 365 Md. 95, 775 A.2d 1234 (2001). The protestants in <em>Alviani </em>specifically \u201callege[d] that the Board failed to properly define the relevant neighborhood that was considered when the Board found that the variances would not affect the neighborhood.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117, 775 A.2d at 1247. We disagreed and found, \u201cafter examining the record, that the Board established the relevant neighborhood!!,]\u201d as the Board\u2019s description was \u201cprecise enough to enable a party or an appellate court to comprehend the area that the Board considered when deciding to grant the variances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117,119, 775 A.2d at 1247,1248.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\"><em>Lucas v. People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cty. </em>involved a petition for a special exception for an \u201cairport\u201d zoning special exception on a farm zoned for agriculture, located within a National Historic District in Baltimore County. 147 Md.App. 209, 216-17, 807 A.2d 1176, 1180 (2002), <em>disapproved of on other grounds by People\u2019s Counsel for Balt. Cty. v. Loyola Coll, in Md., </em>406 Md. 54, 956 A.2d 166 (2008). In <em>Lucas, </em>the Honorable James A. Kenney, III employed the standard outlined in <em>Alviani, </em>and found that the Board\u2019s definition of the relevant area was insufficient, as it relied on only amorphous descriptions of the area to be considered:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-6\">The Board relied on testimony regarding the adverse effect of the airport on the \u201cland around Helmore Farm,\u201d on \u201cthe horse industry in the area,\u201d on the \u201chistorical district,\u201d and on \u201cGreenspring Valley.\u201d The Board\u2019s definition of the relevant area does not provide the precision required for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>party or an appellate court to comprehend the adversely affected area and to determine if the neighborhood reasonably constitutes the immediate environment of the subject property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">147 Md.App. at 241, 807 A.2d at 1195.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">In accord with our precedent in <em>Alviani, </em>in conjunction \u2022with the special exception jurisprudence reflected by <em>Schultz, </em>Butler, and <em>Lucas, </em>we hold that the description of the neighborhood impacted by the special exception must be precise enough to enable a party or appellate court to comprehend the area that the Board considered. Precision is determined through a review of the evidence in the record describing the impact on the surrounding properties, as referenced within the Board\u2019s opinion. <em>See also Critical Area Comm\u2019n for Chesapeake &amp; Atl. Coastal Bays v. Moreland, LLC, </em>418 Md. 111, 135,12 A.3d 1223, 1238 (2011) (holding that meaningful judicial review is possible when the Board summarizes substantial evidence in support of its findings).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">In the case at bar, the Board\u2019s opinion stated in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">The [Applicants] offered into evidence the testimony of Ken Schmid, of Traffic Concepts, Inc,, who was admitted as an expert in the fields of Traffic Engineering and Transportation Planning. Mr. Schmid opined that the proposed use will not create congestion of the roads, streets or alleys in the area of the subject property. The proposed relocation of Groff Lane to create a four way signalized intersection, according to Mr. Schmid, will create a safer and more convenient pattern of traffic circulation for the subject property and the surrounding area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-8\">\u215d\u215c*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-9\">The [Applicants] called Mr. Rick Richardson, of Richardson Engineering, who was offered and accepted by the Board as an expert in the fields of civil engineering, zoning and development.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAmq\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>Mr. Richardson testified that the proposed fuel service station is not ... located within a mile radius of any-abandoned fuel service station(s).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-5\">***</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">The Protestants called to testify John Seitz, of Transportation Resource Group, Inc. who was accepted by the Board as an expert in the area of Traffic Engineering. Mr. Seitz testified that as a part of his investigation of the proposed use of the subject site he evaluated the potential truck turning radius for fuel delivery trucks entering the proposed site using a computer based traffic modeling program and determined that a fuel delivery truck attempting to turn into the proposed site would cause potential congestion and traffic difficulty of Groff Mill Road because of the wide turning angle required for such trucks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAY_\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-7\">The Protestants next called Andrew Miller, PhD who was admitted as an expert in hydrological studies. Dr. Miller testified concerning the Flood Plain Study prepared by the [Applicants]. According to Dr. Miller the subject area contains a portion of the existing flood plain which will be filled in to facilitate construction of the site.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">The Board\u2019s opinion references ample evidence of record for us to appreciate the area considered by the Board. The Board referenced testimony concerning the roads and intersections surrounding the subject property, including: Tollgate Road, Reisterstown Road, Groff Lane, and Reisterstown Road\u2019s intersection with Owings Mills Boulevard. The Board referenced testimony regarding the commercial development surrounding the property. In accordance with BCZR \u00a7 405.3,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Board referenced testimony regarding an exhibit which depicted the five gas stations contained within a one-mile radius from the property. The Board referenced testimony regarding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>the flood plain surrounding the property. Unlike in <em>Lucas, </em>there was ample evidence presented to the Board regarding the immediate environs of the proposed Wawa, which the Board referenced in its opinion. Here, the evidence presented to the Board regarding the area impacted by the special exception, as referenced in the Board\u2019s opinion, was precise enough to enable a party or appellate court to comprehend the area that the Board considered. Thus, we will not disturb the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">The Protestants further contend that we require a delineation of the neighborhood in rezoning matters, and accordingly, this same requirement should be extended to apply in special exception cases. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">Rezoning cases are inapposite to our analysis because of the respective burdens in rezoning and special exception matters. We have stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-7\">[T]here is a strong presumption of the correctness of original zoning and comprehensive rezoning and that to sustain a piecemeal change therefrom there must be produced strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning and comprehensive rezoning and that to sustain a piecemeal change therefrom there must be produced strong evidence of mistake in the original zoning or else evidence of a change in conditions resulting in a substantial change in the character of the neighborhood.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-8\"><em>Heller v. Prince George\u2019s Cty., </em>264 Md. 410, 412, 286 A.2d 772, 773 (1972) (citation omitted); <em>see also Border v. Grooms, </em>267 Md. 100, 110, 297 A.2d 81, 86 (1972) (holding \u201cthat which reasonably constitutes the neighborhood of the subject property is one of the basic facts to be established by an applicant for rezoning, <em>and because of its fundamental involvement in any case resting on a contention of a change in the character of the neighborhood </em>it must be satisfactorily shown upon the record.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">Given the heavy burden upon the party seeking a rezoning, and the strong presumption in favor of the original zoning, \u201csome delineation of the general boundaries encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>passed\u201d is an apt evidentiary element in the rezoning context. <em>Border, </em>267 Md. at 110, 297 A.2d at 86; <em>see also Heller, </em>264 Md. at 412, 286 A.2d at 773 (holding that, in the rezoning context, \u201cthere is a strong presumption of the correctness of the original zoning\u201d and \u201c[t]he burden of proof, of course, is quite onerous and it rests squarely on the one seeking the reclassification.\u201d). There is an inverse evidentiary presumption, however, in the special exception context. A special exception is presumed to be in the interest of the general welfare, and therefore a special exception enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>Schultz, </em>291 Md. at 11, 432 A.2d at 1325. Given these conflicting presumptions, our requirement for a precise definition of the neighborhood within rezoning matters does not extend to special exception cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">II. The Burden of Proof Was Not Inappropriately Assigned to the Protestants</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The Protestants argue that the Board of Appeals erred when it assigned the burden of proof to the Protestants and concluded that the Protestants\u2019 evidence did \u201cnot rebut the presumption of validity of the Special Exception use in this case.\u201d We disagree. A special exception in Baltimore County is granted pursuant BCZR \u00a7 502.1, which provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">Before any special exception may be granted, it must appear that the use for which the special exception is requested will not:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">A. Be detrimental to the health, safety or general welfare of the locality involved;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">B. Tend to create congestion in roads, streets or alleys therein[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">In <em>Schultz </em>we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">[T]he appropriate standard to be used in determining whether a requested special exception use would have an adverse effect and, therefore, should be denied is whether there are facts and circumstances that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use irrespective of its location within the zone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">291 Md. at 22-23, 432 A.2d at 1327. We further held that a special exception is presumed to be in the interest of the general welfare, and therefore a special exception enjoys a presumption of validity. <em>Id. </em>at 11, 432 A.2d at 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">It is undisputed that \u201cboth the burden of production and the burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the special exception should be granted[]\u201d fall on the applicant, whereby the applicant must persuade the Board \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the special exception will conform to all applicable requirements.\u201d <em>Loyola Coll, in Md., </em>406 Md. at 109, 956 A.2d at 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">The Protestants, however, assert that the Board \u201cassigned the burden of proof to the Protestants[ ]\u201d when it stated: \u201cThe Protestants\u2019 concerns taken from the available evidence do not rebut the presumption of validity of the Special Exception in this case.\u201d Directly prior to this finding, however, the Board articulated the <em>Schultz </em>standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Asq\">there is a presumption under Maryland Law that a Special Exception is in [] the general interest of the jurisdiction and therefore valid and that a Special Exception is properly denied only when there are facts and circumstances showing the adverse impacts of the use at the particular location in question would be above and beyond those inherently associated with the Special Exception use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">The Board\u2019s opinion did not improperly assign the burden of proof to the Protestants. While an applicant for a special exception bears both the burden of persuasion and of production, the concurrent presumption in favor of a special exception applicant is not a mutually exclusive evidentiary burden. As the Honorable Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. explained within the context of presumptions of civil actions under Maryland Rule 5-301 (a):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-9\">[A] presumption does not necessarily shift the burden of persuasion. Rather, it merely satisfies the burden of going <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>forward on a fact presumed and <em>may </em>satisfy the burden of persuasion if no rebuttal evidence is introduced by the other side. ... Stated differently, the party favored by the presumption is not relieved of the requirement of presenting evidence to establish a prima facie case as to those issues for which he bears the burden of proof if the adverse party sufficiently rebuts the presumption. In such instances, the presumption merely enhances the probative value of other evidence adduced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b317-5\"><em>Anderson v. Litzenberg, </em>115 Md.App. 649, 564, 694 A.2d 150, 157 (1997), Here, the Protestants did not set forth sufficient evidence to indicate that the proposed fuel service station would have any adverse effects above and beyond those inherently associated with such use under the <em>Schultz </em>standard. 291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327. Thus, the Board simply stated that, in light of the Applicants having presented sufficient evidence demonstrating compliance with BCZR \u00a7 502.1 and the general presumption of validity enjoyed by special exception uses, the evidence as a whole did not warrant denial of the petition for the special exception.. <em>See Anderson, </em>115 Md. App. at 564, 694 A.2d at 157. The Board\u2019s opinion did not inappropriately assign the burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">III. The Evidence Presented by the Protestants Was Not Sufficient to Rebut the Presumption of the Validity of a Special Exception.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">The Protestants next argue that they presented evidence generating a genuine question of fact as to whether the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>exception will create congested roads per BCZR \u00a7 502.1(B), and that it will have detrimental environmental and economic impacts per BCZR \u00a7 502.1(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">\n<em>A. Road Congestion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">BCZR \u00a7 502.1(B) requires that a special exception not \u201c[t]end to create congestion in roads, streets or alleys therein[.]\u201d At the hearing before the Board, the Applicants called Ken Schmid of Traffic Concepts, Inc. as an expert in the fields of Traffic Engineering and Transportation Planning. Mr. Schmid testified that the proposed use will not create congestion in the roads, streets, or alleys. Mr. Schmid testified that he and his company submitted two Traffic Impact Studies on behalf of the Applicants to the Maryland State Highway Administration in support of the planned relocation of Groff Road. On cross-examination, Mr. Schmid acknowledged that the planned road relocation had not yet received approval. The Board ultimately conditioned the grant of the Special Exception upon approval and issuance of all necessary permits by the State Highway Administration. In addition, the Applicants presented the testimony of Mr. Rick Richardson, who was accepted by the Board as an expert in the fields of civil engineering, zoning and development. Mr. Richardson testified that the Wawa will meet or surpass the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>BCZR \u00a7 502.1. In rebuttal, Protestants provided testimony from John Seitz of Transportation Resource Group to support their contention that the proposed Wawa would result in potential congestion and traffic difficulty off Groff Mill Road as a result of turning fuel delivery trucks.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The <em>Schultz </em>special exception test considers whether the proposed use will have a greater impact here than one would ordinarily expect. The Protestants did not present \u201cfacts and circumstances [pertaining to congestion in the roads, streets, or alleys] that show that the particular use proposed at the particular location proposed would have any adverse effects <em>above and beyond those inherently associated with such a special exception use[.]\u201d </em>291 Md. at 15, 432 A.2d at 1327 (emphasis added). Thus, the Protestants did not sufficiently rebut the presumption of validity under <em>Schultz.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">\n<em>B. Floodplain Relocation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The Protestants provided evidence that the Gwynns Falls floodplain may be impacted by the construction of the Wawa. The Board, however, did not render a factual conclusion on this issue: \u201cThe possibility of a negative impact upon the flood plain by [the Applicants\u2019] plans will be determined separately by way of the investigation by State and Federal authorities and pursuant to Baltimore County Code (Section 32-8-101 <em>{et </em>seq.]) will only be granted when there is no adverse effect upon the safety and welfare of the citizenry.\u201d Tollgate is not prevented by the BCZR from proceeding with the request for the Special Exception before receiving approval for the proposed floodplain relocation. Because the Board did not render, nor was it required to make, a factual conclusion on this issue, and we cannot arrive at such a conclusion, there was no error from the Board for us to review. <em>See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. People\u2019s Counsel, </em>336 Md. at 577, 650 A.2d at 230 (stating that our role \u201cis limited to determining if there is substantial evidence in the record as a whole to support the agency\u2019s findings and conclusions, and to determine if the administrative decision is premised upon an erroneous conclusion of law.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>\n<em>C.

Protestants argued in their reply brief that the issue of whether there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Board's conclusions is not before this Court.

This Court granted certiorari on the question of whether the Court of Special Appeals erred when it held that the Applicants met their burden of proof, as articulated in the concurring opinion in <em>People\u2019s Counsel for Balt.

We find that the sufficiency of the evidence in this matter is a necessary facet of the burden of proof issue, on which this Court granted certiora-ri. Moreover, the Protestant's Petition for Writ of Certiorari argued that the Board erred because it failed to address the fact the record contained genuine questions of fact regarding the Wawa\u2019s effect on traffic congestion, the Gwynns Falls stream and its flood plain, and the economic stability of the neighborhood.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b320-13\">.
