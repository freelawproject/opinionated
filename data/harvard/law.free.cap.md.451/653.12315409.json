Phillips. The Petition alleged violations of Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct (the \u201cRules\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 3.1 (Meritorious Claims and Contentions); 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants); 5.4 (Professional Independence of a Lawyer); 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law); 7.5 (Firm Names and Letterheads); 8.1 (Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters); and 8.4 (Misconduct). Respondent\u2019s professional misconduct stems from his ratification of the unauthorized practice of law by a non-attorney, followed by a series of material falsehoods made to Bar Counsel, refusal to provide information requested by Bar Counsel, and other obstruction during the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>Pursuant to Maryland Rules 16-752(a) and 16-757, this Court transmitted the case to the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County and designated the Honorable Sean D. Wallace to conduct an evidentiary hearing and make findings of fact and conclusions of law. The hearing was held on April 27, 2016. Respondent testified and presented evidence on his behalf. On May 19, 2016, the hearing judge issued written findings of fact and conclusions of law, concluding that Respondent violated Rule 3.1, 5.3(c), 5.4(d), 5.5(a), 7.5(d), 8.1(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"AV1\">No exceptions were filed. Respondent made no written recommendation regarding sanction; Petitioner recommended disbarment. On October 13, 2016, we heard oral argument, at which only Petitioner appeared. On October 14, 2016, we issued a per curiam order disbarring Respondent. <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Phillips, </em>450 Md. 246, 147 A.3d 858 (2016). We explain in this opinion the reasons for that action. On November 28, 2016, Respondent filed a paper titled \u201cRespondent\u2019s Opposition to the Per Curiam Order filed by the Court of Appeals.\u201d We have treated the paper as a motion for reconsideration of the Order of Disbarment and, upon review of the motion, we hereby deny it.</p>\n<p id=\"Ajb7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">We summarize here the record and the hearing judge s findings of fact and conclusions of law, supported by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"Aum\">\n<em>A. Initial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALs\">Respondent Dalton Phillips was admitted to the Maryland Bar in May 1981. He practiced law for over 35 years. His son, Solon Phillips, graduated from law school in 2008 and in 2011 sought admission to the Maryland Bar. He has not been admitted to the Bar in Maryland or any other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"AgE\">In August 2009, Solon Phillips caused Articles of Organization to be filed with the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation establishing a law firm titled Phillips, Phillips <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>and Dow LLC, to include Respondent, Solon Phillips, and a friend of Solon\u2019s, Anthony Dow. It is unclear from the record whether Mr. Dow, evidently a practicing lawyer in Georgia, knew that his name was listed as a member of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">Solon Phillips discussed the formation of the firm with Respondent. Solon Phillips created a law firm insignia; hired an answering service for the firm; reserved a domain name; and created and ordered letterhead that included the firm name, Solon Phillips\u2019s home address, the phone number associated with the answering service, and the firm website. He also ordered business cards for himself using the firm insignia and the suffix \u201cEsq.\u201d. Respondent agreed to be a member of the firm and reviewed the firm logo prepared by Solon Phillips.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">At some point, Solon Phillips met Crystal Meehan through a Facebook support group for individuals experiencing marital discord and became Facebook friends with her. Crystal Mee-han is a resident of Indiana. Solon Phillips and Crystal Mee-han corresponded in May 2014 regarding unwanted communications that Crystal Meehan had been receiving from her ex-husband\u2019s current wife, Abigail Meehan. Solon Phillips prepared for Crystal Meehan a cease and desist letter ordering Abigail Meehan to discontinue all communications with Crystal Meehan, alleging that Abigail Meehan\u2019s communications constituted harassment, and threatening legal action. He corresponded over e-mail with Crystal Meehan, provided her with a draft of the letter signed \u201cSolon Phillips JD/MBA\u201d, and received her approval of the letter. He then printed the letter on Phillips, Phillips and Dow, LLC letterhead. The content of the final letter was altered in only one regard\u2014Solon Phillips signed Respondent\u2019s name to the letter, not his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Abigail Meehan received the letter and began attempting to contact the firm. On May 19 and 20, 2014, Abigail Meehan called the number listed in the letter. Someone answered the phone and advised her that, although the attorney was unavailable, she should comply with the letter. On May 20, Solon Phillips e-mailed Crystal Meehan informing her that Abigail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>Meehan had called the firm\u2019s number and asked why a Maryland firm would send a cease and desist letter to her in Indiana. The e-mail exchange between the two included Solon Phillips advising Crystal Meehan that, \u201c[i]f [Abigail Meehan] continues you can go to the police and press charges in IN,\u201d specifically, a charge of harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">The hearing judge found: \u201cMeanwhile, Abigail Meehan, growing increasingly suspicious of the firm, conducted online searches and eventually obtained the Respondent\u2019s phone number.\u201d On May 28, Abigail Meehan called and spoke with Respondent for a few minutes regarding the letter. Respondent told her that he knew nothing about the letter and stated that Phillips, Phillips and Dow, LLC was his son\u2019s law firm. Following the conversation, Abigail Meehan e-mailed Respondent an image of the letter and its envelope, and requested an e-mail confirming that Respondent did not represent Crystal Meehan.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">On May 29, 2014, Respondent e-mailed Abigail Meehan the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-6\">Dear Ms, Meehan:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-7\">Greetings! I am responding to your email regarding a Cease and Desist letter you received from the law firm of Phillips, Phillips and Dow, LLC (the Law Firm). As I had advised you during our brief telephone conversation on May 28, 2014, I was unaware of the Cease and Desist letter you received from the Law Firm. I have been able to confirm, however, that the Law Firm does in fact represent Ms. Crystal Meehan. A junior attorney for the firm sent out the letter you received without advising me of the Law Firm\u2019s representation of Ms. Meehan or discussing the letter with me. This is contrary to our practice, which requires my review of every correspondence written on the Law Firm\u2019s letterhead and under my name.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b692-8\">Even though the letter was issued without my knowledge, the fact remains that Ms. Crystal Meehan is a client of the Law Firm. If Crystal Meehan is so disturbed by your alleged communications that she hired an attorney to dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>courage them, in the interest of peace and harmony, I believe that you should seriously consider not contacting her. If you are a person of peace, as I believe you are, you would demonstrate good judgment and wisdom by simply avoiding attempts at correspondence or communication with Crystal Meehan; no good ever evolves from unwelcomed communications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-4\">Understandably, you were upset by the contents of the letter. I suggest that you ruminate on the matter for a few days before doing anything. Sometimes, the most powerful action is no action at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-5\">Sincerely,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-6\">Dalton P. Phillips, Esquire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">On June 17, Abigail Meehan replied in an e-mail to Respondent\u2019s May 29 e-mail. She wrote: \u201cSince your firm is representing Ms. Crystal Meehan, I will need you[r] address so that I can send you documents.\u201d The e-mail was sent to Respondent and copied Solon Phillips. A few minutes later, Solon Phillips replied to Abigail Meehan\u2019s e-mail, copying Respondent and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-8\">Our firm is not representing Ms. Crystal Meehan. Furthermore, your attempts to continue to contact members of our firm is inappropriate and borders harassment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">This e-mail is to demand all communications with our firm to cease immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-10\">Thank you for understanding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">\n<em>B. The Complaint and Bar Counsel\u2019s Investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b693-12\">On or about June 8, 2014, Abigail Meehan filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission regarding Respondent\u2019s conduct and enclosed the cease and desist letter and Respondent\u2019s May 29 e-mail. She stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-13\">This attorney sent me a cease and desist letter claiming to represent my husband\u2019s ex-wife. When I called him, he told me he had no knowledge of this then later he emailed me telling me someone sent it from his firm and she is repre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>sented. How is he sending me legal letters if he isn\u2019t licensed to practice in Indiana!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">By letter dated June 19, 2014, Bar Counsel forwarded a copy of the complaint to Respondent and requested a response. On June 23, 2014, Respondent replied by letter stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-5\">After seeing the Firm\u2019s name and symbol on the envelope in which the letter was mailed, I wrote Ms. Abigail Meehan the polite email that she has attached to her complaint.... After sending the email, I had an opportunity to review the letter that Ms. Abigail Meehan alleged I had sent to her husband\u2019s ex-wife and also speak to a member of our law firm.... I have learned also that our Firm does not represent Ms. Crystal Meehan and no one in the Firm seems to have heard of her prior to this incident.... After I had sent that single email to Ms. Abigail Meehan, for example, I learned that she has contacted our Firm about the matter on several occasions, despite having been told that the firm does not represent Ms. Crystal Meehan. After she persisted in contacting the Firm, she was advised that legal action would be taken against her if she continued her unwelcomed communications. In persistently contacting our Firm, she evinces a remarkably consistent modus operandi.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">Bar Counsel wrote Respondent on August 7, 2014. That letter states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">In the email enclosed with the original complaint, dated May 29, 2014, you state \u201cI have been able to confirm, however, that the Law Firm does in fact represent Ms. Crystal Meehan. A junior attorney for the firm sent out the letter you received without advising me of the Law Firm\u2019s representation of Ms. Meehan or discussing the letter with me.\u201d Provide the name of the junior attorney you reference in your email to Ms. Meehan.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">In a letter dated August 12, 2014, Respondent replied to Bar Counsel\u2019s letter. Respondent refused to supply the name of the person he had \u201cassumed\u201d was the person who wrote the letter, stating that he had been wrong in making that assump<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>tion: \u201cI was mistaken when I stated that a junior attorney wrote the letter.... No one with whom I am associated knows Ms. Meehan. I am not going to compound my error by naming the person I wrongly suspected.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Respondent added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-4\">You have also asked how many attorneys are employed with my law firm. In preparation for my retirement from Federal service at the end of this year, I am in the process of establishing a law firm. It is in the developmental stage and no attorneys have been employed at this time. I regret that the Commission is asking me to spend time responding to something of which I know nothing and on a Complaint that on its face do [sic] not allege any type of violation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">After receiving this communication, Bar Counsel informed Respondent by letter dated September 24, 2014, that the Attorney Grievance Commission had docketed a complaint against him and Bar Counsel would be investigating. The letter requested Respondent\u2019s availability for a meeting the week of October 20, 2014, and reminded Respondent that Rule 8.1 requires a lawyer to respond to lawful demands for information by a disciplinary authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">Respondent never replied to this letter with his availability, and Bar Counsel was forced to begin a lengthy and arduous process to get Respondent to talk to her. On October 8, 2014, Bar Counsel called Respondent to request his availability for a meeting, but Respondent refused to provide any dates before January 2015. Bar Counsel asked again following some conversation, and Respondent again refused. When Bar Counsel stated that she would issue a subpoena if necessary and select a date, Respondent evidently hung up the phone. Bar Counsel followed the conversation with a letter to Respondent memorializing their phone call of earlier that same day and again requesting his availability to give a statement under oath. She stated that if she did not receive a response by October 10, she would choose a date unilaterally.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>Respondent replied to Bar Counsel on October 8, 2014, by letter attached to an e-mail. In that October 8 letter, Respondent stated that he had never alleged to anyone that he represented Crystal Meehan, although he acknowledged in the same letter that he \u201chad been mistaken\u201d when he wrote in the May 29, 2014 e-mail he sent to Abigail Meehan \u201cthat the Firm represents Ms. Crystal Meehan.\u201d Respondent further stated that he did not understand what Bar Counsel was investigating as misconduct on his part, accused Bar Counsel of failing to apprise him of the nature of the investigation in violation of the Commission\u2019s guidelines, accused Bar Counsel of bias, and stated that he would not correspond with her again until she explained the nature of the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">That same day, October 8, Bar Counsel e-mailed Respondent explaining that she was investigating the truthfulness of statements he had made to Abigail Meehan and Bar Counsel, his failure to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information, and whether he had assisted Solon Phillips in the unauthorized practice of law. Bar Counsel identified the Rules this conduct could violate and again requested dates for Respondent to provide a statement under oath. Although Bar Counsel waited a week, Respondent did not reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">On October 16, 2014, Bar Counsel e-mailed again requesting dates and offering to begin as early as 7:30 AM to avoid interfering with Respondent\u2019s work schedule. On October 17, Respondent replied with two e-mails and an attached document denying any wrongdoing and threatening suit against the Commission and Bar Counsel individually. Respondent did not provide any dates of availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">Bar Counsel e-mailed twice more, requesting dates of availability and offering to obtain Respondent\u2019s statement in Bowie, Maryland, closer to his residence. Respondent did not reply to those e-mails. On October 20, 2014, after obtaining permission from the Chair of the Attorney Grievance Commission, Bar Counsel issued a subpoena requiring Respondent to appear at a court reporter\u2019s office in Bowie on November 20, 2014, at 10:00 AM to make a statement under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"AvaU\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>On November 8, 2014, Respondent filed a motion to quash the subpoena arguing that the Commission had refused to advise him of the alleged misconduct that was the subject of the investigation. Bar Counsel opposed the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Although Respondent did not have a protective order and had been served with a subpoena, he did not appear for the statement under oath that was scheduled for the morning of November 20, 2014. That same afternoon, a judge of the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County denied the motion, stating: \u201cThe court does not find good cause or reason to quash the subpoena or grant a protective order.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Upon learning on the afternoon of November 20, 2014, that the motion to quash had been denied, Bar Counsel e-mailed Respondent later that same afternoon requesting dates and providing four potential dates in December. Respondent again refused to provide dates before January and specifically alleged a conflict on December 17, but refused to give the nature of the conflict; instead he offered dates in January. Bar Counsel accepted January 7 and scheduled the statement under oath to be taken in Bowie.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">\n<em>G. The Statement Under Oath</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b697-7\">Respondent appeared for the statement under oath. He replied to many questions that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d or did not know, including questions asking when Solon Phillips graduated from law school and the nature of his employment. Bar Counsel requested Solon Phillips\u2019s phone number from Respondent. Respondent stated that he did not know the number and, unless Solon Phillips granted him permission to provide it, he would not give it to Bar Counsel. Bar Counsel then requested contact information for Anthony Dow (the third named individual on the firm\u2019s letterhead), and Respondent stated that he did not have it and would not ask Solon Phillips for the information. Respondent stated that he did not know who had written and sent the cease and desist letter. Respondent initially denied ever seeing the June 17 e-mail from Solon Phillips to Abigail Meehan that copied Respondent. After Bar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Counsel pointed out that he was copied, he altered his response to a statement that he did not \u201crecollect seeing it.\u201d Respondent also stated he did not know the corporate structure of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The hearing judge made the following findings concerning Respondent\u2019s statement under oath:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">The Court finds that the Respondent knowingly and intentionally testified falsely during his statement under oath. Specifically, the Court finds the Respondent testified falsely that he did not know the corporate structure of the law firm. The undisputed evidence is that, as of May 29, 2014, the Respondent knew that the firm was a limited liability company and that he had supervisory authority over the \u201cjunior\u201d associate(s). The Court finds that the Respondent testified falsely that he \u201cdid not recall\u201d and did not \u201cknow\u201d that the firm ever had any client and that he \u201cwas not involved.\u201d The undisputed evidence is that, as of May 29, 2014, the Respondent knew as he stated in his email that the firm represented Crystal Meehan, that he had supervisory authority over the junior associate(s) and that there was an established protocol for the communications from the firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-6\">The Court finds that the Respondent testified falsely that he did not receive or review the June 17, 2014 email from Solon Phillips to Abigail Meehan that was cc\u2019d to him. The undisputed evidence is that, as of June 23, 2014, the Respondent knew that Solon Phillips had advised Abigail Meehan \u201cthat legal action would be taken against her if she continued her unwelcomed communication [with the firm].\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-7\">Finally, the Court finds incredible and rejects Respondent\u2019s testimony that he was unaware that his son was not admitted to practice law in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">(Internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">\n<em>D. The Hearing Judge\u2019s Conclusions of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AYR\">Based upon the record and the above-summarized findings of fact, the hearing judge concluded, by clear and convincing evidence, that Respondent violated MLRPC 3.1, 5.3(c), 5.4(d), 5.5(a), 7.5(d), 8.1(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d).</p>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>\n<em>E. Aggravating Factors</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AGez\">The hearing judge found that four among the list of aggravating factors enumerated in the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> existed in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Auo\">The Respondent has engaged in bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding by intentionally failing to comply with repeated requests for information, and by making misrepresentations during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation. Factors (5) and (6). The Respondent has shown a complete lack of remorse and refusal to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. Factor (7). Finally, the Respondent has substantial experience in the practice of law having been admitted 35 years ago.

Respondent persisted in refusing to provide dates before January 2015, and Bar Counsel, after receiving the necessary approval from the Commission, issued the subpoena on October 20, compelling Respondent\u2019s presence to provide a statement under oath on November 20, 2014.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">The hearing judge concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b702-5\">Respondent violated Rule 3.1 when he filed a frivolous Motion to Quash Subpoena and Request for a Protective Order in the Circuit Court for Prince George\u2019s County on or about November 8, 2014. The [mjotion was not supported by fact or law and the evidence supports the conclusions that the Respondent\u2019s only purpose in filing the motion was to obstruct Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation and delay his statement under oath until January 2015.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">We agree with the hearing judge. The record and the hearing judge\u2019s findings of fact reflect that Respondent did not raise a good faith argument, based in fact or law, in the motion to quash. Respondent\u2019s motion to quash the subpoena, rather than setting forth reasons why the subpoena was unsupported by fact or law, argued instead that Bar Counsel had not fairly apprised Respondent of the misconduct being investigated; he had not engaged in any wrongdoing; and he had spoken truthfully in all prior communications with Bar Counsel. The facts found by the hearing judge do not support those arguments. Regardless, more to the point of the charged Rule 3.1 violation, nowhere in the motion to quash does Respondent lay out an argument, based in fact or law, to support why Bar Counsel was without the authority to issue the subpoena in furtherance of investigating Abigail Meehan\u2019s complaint. Rather, as the hearing judge found, Respondent filed the motion to quash for the sole purpose of obstructing the investigation and delaying his having to make a statement under oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>Given that the motion to quash was not supported by a good faith argument based in fact or law, Respondent filed it in violation of Rule 3.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">\n<em>Rule 5.S: Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer Assistants</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AqTT\">Rule 5.3(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-5\">With respect to a nonlawyer employed or retained by or associated with a lawyer:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pA2O\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-6\">(c) a lawyer shall be responsible for conduct of such a person that would be a violation of the [Rules] if engaged in by a lawyer if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-7\">(1)the lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific conduct, ratifies the conduct involved[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">The hearing judge concluded that Respondent violated this provision. The hearing judge reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-9\">Solon Phillips was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. The Respondent had actual knowledge of the unauthorized practice of law at the time Abigail Meehan emailed him a copy of the cease and desist letter. In his email to Abigail Meehan on May 29, 2014, the Respondent ratified Solon Phillips\u2019 unauthorized practice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">We agree and conclude, as did the hearing judge, that Respondent violated Rule 5.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">\n<em>Rule 54: Professional Independence of a Lawyer</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ACQ\">Rule 5.4(d) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-12\">(d) A lawyer shall not practice with or in the form of a professional corporation or association authorized to practice law for a profit, if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-13\">(1) a nonlawyer owns any interest therein... ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-14\">(2) a nonlawyer is a corporate director or officer thereof or occupies the position of similar responsibility in any form of association other than a corporation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b703-15\">(3) a nonlawyer has the right to direct or control the professional judgment of a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>The hearing judge found that Respondent formed a law firm with Solon Phillips, a nonlawyer; represented to Abigail Meehan in his May 29, 2014 e-mail that, in effect, he was the senior member of the firm and that Crystal Meehan was a client of the firm; and affirmed that the cease and desist letter had been sent by the firm to Abigail Meehan. Based on those findings, we conclude, as did the hearing judge, that Respondent violated Rule 5.4(d),</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">\n<em>Rule 5.5: Unauthorized Practice of Law; Multijurisdictional Practice of Law</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">Respondent assisted Solon Phillips in the unauthorized practice of law, in violation of Rule 5.5(a). That rule states: \u201cA lawyer shall not practice law in a jurisdiction in violation of the regulation of the legal profession in that jurisdiction, <em>or assist another in doing so.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). We conclude, as did the hearing judge, that, for the same reasons Respondent violated Rule 5,3, he also violated Rule 5.5(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">\n<em>Rule 7.5: Firm Names and Letterheads</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">Rule 7.5(d) requires that \u201c[l]awyers may state or imply that they practice in a partnership or other organization <em>only when that is the fact.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added). The hearing judge found the following with respect to his rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b704-10\">On May 29, 2014, the Respondent emailed Abigail Meehan and stated that he was a member of the law firm of Phillips, Phillips and Dow. The evidence admitted at trial is clear\u2014 the Respondent did not practice law in association with Solon Phillips or Anthony Dow. His statements to Abigail Meehan violated Rule 7.5(d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">We have difficulty concluding, as did the hearing judge, that, because Respondent \u201cdid not practice law in association -with Solon Phillips or Anthony Dow,\u201d he violated Rule 7.5 by suggesting to Abigail Meehan that he did practice with one or both men. Certainly, there is no evidence that Respondent practiced law with Anthony Dow. Perhaps a case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>could be made that Respondent was a member of the firm in name only, and that his connection with the firm was limited to allowing Solon Phillips to use Respondent\u2019s name on the firm\u2019s letterhead and later attempting to provide \u201ccover\u201d for his son\u2019s unauthorized practice of law. Yet, the hearing judge found that Respondent informed Abigail Meehan in his May 29, 2014 e-mail, in effect, that he was the senior attorney in the firm; Crystal Meehan was a client of the firm; and one of the \u201cjunior attorneys\u201d had prepared and sent the cease and desist letter to Abigail Meehan on behalf of Crystal Meehan. We further note that, in her opening statement to the hearing judge, Bar Counsel represented to the hearing judge that the Rule 7.5 charge was brought as an alternative theory\u2014an \u201ceither or\u201d\u2014to the charged violations of Rules 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">Given that Respondent violated Rules 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5, we do not conclude that Respondent also violated Rule 7.5.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">\n<em>Rule 8.1: Bar Admission and Disciplinary Matters</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">Rule 8.1 requires that a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-7\">(a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b705-8\">(b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b705-9\">We conclude, as did the hearing judge, that Respondent committed a number of violations of subsections (a) and (b) of this rule. He failed to respond to Bar Counsel\u2019s repeated efforts to schedule the statement under oath, and he refused to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s request on August 7, 2014, that he identify the \u201cjunior attorney\u201d he had referenced in his May 29 e-mail to Abigail Meehan. Moreover, as later found by the hearing judge, Respondent knowingly made numerous false statements to Bar Counsel when responding to questions during the statement under oath. Respondent testified falsely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>that he did not know who had written the cease and desist letter and was unaware of either the corporate structure of the firm or the identity of the \u201cjunior attorney\u201d. Respondent testified falsely that he did not receive or review the June 17, 2014 e-mail Solon Phillips sent to Abigail Meehan, on which Respondent was copied, and that he did not know that Solon Phillips was not admitted to the practice of law in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">\n<em>Rule 84: Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AWp8\">Rule 8.4 provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-5\">It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-6\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Maryland Lawyers\u2019 Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pApnV\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-7\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b706-8\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Respondent\u2019s false statements to Bar Counsel and failure to provide information upon Bar Counsel\u2019s request constituted dishonest and deceitful conduct, in violation of Rule 8.4(c). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kahl, </em>436 Md. 617, 623-24, 632, 84 A.3d 103 (2014) (attorney\u2019s failure to provide banking records to Bar Counsel and false statements regarding this failure was dishonest and deceitful conduct). In refusing to speak with Bar Counsel and filing a frivolous motion to quash his subpoena, Respondent obstructed Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation in a manner prejudicial to the administration of justice, and his conduct as a whole brings the legal profession into disrepute, in violation of Rule 8.4(d). <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Blum, </em>373 Md. 275, 302, 818 A.2d 219 (2003) (attorney\u2019s conduct making false statements and filing motion to quash bar counsel\u2019s subpoena violated Rule 8.4(d)); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Kremer, </em>432 Md. 325, 337, 68 A.3d 862 (2013) (attorney\u2019s failure to cooperate with Bar Counsel violated Rule 8.4(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Here, each violation of the Rules discussed above is a separate violation of Rule 8.4(a). Respondent\u2019s assistance to Solon Phillips in the unauthorized practice of law by ratifying his conduct is also a violation of Rule 8.4(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">\n<em>The Sanction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Disbarment is the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s multiple violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct. Here, as in all such matters, \u201c[w]e are guided by our \u2018interest in protecting the public and the public\u2019s confidence in the legal profession.\u2019 \u201d <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Consequently, \u201cour purpose in deciding the appropriate sanction is not to punish the lawyer, but to protect the public, and \u2018deter other lawyers from engaging in similar misconduct.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Pennington, </em>387 Md. at 596, 876 A.2d 642).</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">Respondent violated numerous Rules of Professional Conduct, including, among other violations, assisting his son, Solon Phillips, in the unauthorized practice of law; engaging in an ongoing effort to obstruct Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation; filing a frivolous motion to quash the subpoena demanding his appearance for a statement under oath; and making numerous false statements under oath, much of which qualifies as prejudicial to the administration of justice. Even were we to put aside his other numerous violations of the Rules, Respondent\u2019s intentional and repeated falsehoods when testifying at the statement under oath alone would warrant disbarment. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Peters-Hamlin, </em>447 Md. 520, 547-49, 136 A.3d 374 (2016) (restating the proposition that disbarment ordinarily is the sanction for an intentional violation of MLRPC 8.4(c) (dishonesty)). When added to his violations of MLRPC 3.1, 5.3(c), 5.4(d), 5.5(a), 8.1(a) and (b), and 8.4(a), (c), and (d), disbarment is demanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>It is all the more appropriate that we impose the most severe sanction given the multiple aggravating factors found by the hearing judge and with which we agree: Respondent is an experienced attorney, having practiced law for 35 years; he engaged in bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding; he made numerous misrepresentations during Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation; and he has refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct. Respondent\u2019s pattern of obstruction in the disciplinary process here, in particular, aggravates his misconduct. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Allenbaugh, </em>450 Md. 250, 272-73, 280, 148 A.3d 300 (2016) (attorney aggravated his misconduct through bad faith obstruction of the disciplinary proceeding when he refused to comply with Bar Counsel\u2019s requests for information and otherwise failed to cooperate in discovery); <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

Because we judge Respondent\u2019s conduct against the extant law at the time of his actions, we refer to the MLRPC throughout.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b695-7\">. During his testimony before the hearing judge, Solon Phillips admitted to drafting the letter and signing Respondent\u2019s name to it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"AfcQ\">. We regularly look to the ten aggravating factors enumerated by the American Bar Association Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions in determining the appropriate sanction. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v.
