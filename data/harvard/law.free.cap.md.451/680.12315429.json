The Court of Special Appeals held that after respondent, Tyshon Leteek Jones, was acquitted in jury trial number one of first-degree premeditated murder, second-degree specific-intent murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and robbery, he could not be tried in a subsequent trial for felony murder based upon first-degree assault because the re-trial was barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Jones v. State, </em>222 Md.App. 600, 619, 114 A.3d 266, 267 (2015).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We granted the State\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari, <em>State v. Jones, </em>444 Md. 638, 120 A.3d 766 (2015), and following briefing and argument on January 12, 2016, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>our own initiative, we asked the parties to brief and argue the following additional question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cIn deciding this case, should the Court re-consider its holding in <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 226-36, 867 A.2d 1095, 1100-6 (2005), as to whether first-degree assault may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtA6\"><em>State v. Jones, </em>No. 52, 2016 Md. LEXIS 296 (May 20, 2016). We shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals, overrule <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005), and hold that first-degree assault may not serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder when that assault is not collateral to the lethal act. We therefore reach the same result as the Court of Special Appeals, but not on the basis of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"A0mC\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">The Grand Jury for Montgomery County indicted Tyshon Leteek Jones with the offenses of first-degree premediated murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence or felony. He proceeded to trial before a jury and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the charges of first-degree premeditated murder, second-degree specific-intent murder, robbery with a dangerous weapon, and robbery. The jury was unable to agree as to first-degree felony murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence or felony, and the court declared a mistrial as to those counts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thereafter, the State sought to prosecute Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. Respondent interposed a plea of double jeopardy, which the court denied. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>Respondent noted an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Special Appeals, which reversed on double jeopardy grounds. <em>Jones, </em>222 Md.App. at 619, 114 A.3d at 267. We granted the State\u2019s petition for certiorari,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and as indicated above, determined to re-reconsider our holding in <em>Roary v. State, </em>which is the foundation and predicate for petitioner\u2019s charge for second-degree felony murder based on first-degree assault. Inasmuch as petitioner was acquitted in his jury trial of first-degree intentional murder, and second-degree intent to inflict serious harm murder, the only basis remaining for the State to proceed in a second prosecution was on second-degree felony murder based upon first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"AA4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-4\">We adopt the facts as set out by the Court of Special Appeals, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b717-5\">\u201cShortly before midnight on August 20, 2010, Julian Kelly was beaten, robbed, and shot by a group of men while on his way home from work. This criminal episode began when, according to witnesses, Kelly was surrounded by \u2018maybe ... five\u2019 men who began \u2018kicking and punching\u2019 him, upon his refusal to surrender his backpack and necklace. After he was knocked to the ground, one of Kelly\u2019s assailants stood over him and shot him five times, three times in the torso and twice in the head, wounds from which Kelly died several weeks later.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b718-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Identified as one of Kelly\u2019s assailants, Jones was tried before a jury, in the Montgomery County circuit court, for his purported participation in Kelly\u2019s robbery and murder. At trial, the State advanced two different theories of the role Jones played in the perpetration of those crimes. The first theory alleged that Jones, although not a participant in the robbery and the beating, shot Kelly after mistaking him for someone else. The second suggested that Jones had, in fact, participated in both the robbery and the beating and had shot Kelly when Kelly had refused to relinquish his belongings. In response, Jones, who did not testify at trial, attempted to establish through the testimony of several witnesses that he had merely been a bystander to the incident and that it had been one of Kelly\u2019s assailants, not he, who had fired the fatal shots.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">At the close of evidence, the court instructed the jury on first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, second-degree murder with the <em>intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>armed robbery, robbery, and the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. With respect to first-degree felony murder, the court instructed the jury that, in order to convict Jones of that offense, it must find that Jones murdered Kelly \u2018during the commission\u2019 of an underlying felony and that, here, the underlying felony could have been either armed robbery, robbery, or assault in the first degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">Section 2\u2014201(a)(4) of the Criminal Law Article states that a murder \u2018is in the first degree\u2019 if it is \u2018committed in the perpetration of or an attempt to perpetrate\u2019 a number of enumerated felonies. Although robbery and armed robbery, two of the three offenses the court below included in its instructions, could underlie a finding of first-degree felony murder, first-degree assault cannot. Thus, both Jones and the State agree that that portion of the circuit court\u2019s instructions was an incorrect statement of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-7\">The jury found Jones not guilty of first-degree murder, second-degree murder <em>with the intent to inflict serious bodily harm, </em>robbery, and armed robbery. But, as previous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>ly noted, it was unable to reach a verdict on the charges of first-degree felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. When Jones moved for a mistrial with respect to those charges, the court granted that motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">The State then informed Jones of its intention to retry him on the two verdictless counts, that is, first-degree felony murder and the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony or a crime of violence. Jones responded by moving for a judgment of acquittal as to the first-degree felony murder charge, asserting that, since first-degree assault was not a \u2018predicate felony\u2019 for a charge of first-degree felony murder, his acquittal on the charges of robbery and armed robbery meant that there was no felony that could serve as the underlying offense for the charge of first-degree felony murder. While conceding in its opposition to Jones\u2019s motion that it could not retry Jones on first-degree felony murder, the State insisted that it could retry him on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault </em>because, though first-degree assault is not an underlying felony for a charge of first-degree felony murder, it can serve as an underlying felony for a charge of second-degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">After the court, at the hearing that ensued on Jones\u2019s motion, granted a judgment of acquittal as to first-degree felony murder, it turned to the State\u2019s request to retry Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder based on <em>first-degree assault. </em>Jones asserted that the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy barred the State from proceeding on such a charge. The circuit court, however, flatly rejected that claim. It stated that second-degree felony murder based on first-degree assault was a \u2018viable\u2019 charge as it arose \u2018out of the facts of this case\u2019 and because Jones had \u2018not been acquitted\u2019 of it or of the underlying offense of first-degree assault. Consequently, the court declared that \u2018double jeopardy would not bar the prosecution\u2019 of Jones on the charge of second-degree felony murder <em>based on first-degree assault.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"AtVN\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number><em>Jones, </em>222 Md.App. at 606-08, 114 A.3d at 269-60 (internal footnotes omitted).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Akq\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"ASm\">We address first the State s jurisdictional argument presented in its supplemental brief, asserting that this Court does not have jurisdiction to reconsider <em>Roary v. State </em>in this case because this appeal comes before the Court pursuant to the collateral order doctrine as an interlocutory appeal. As such, the State argues, we are restricted narrowly in considering that Order, which does not include re-considering <em>Roary v. State, </em>and that a question outside of our interlocutory jurisdiction cannot be appended to one that is within the Order.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV8\">Respondent argues that this Court has jurisdiction to reconsider <em>Roary v. State </em>because the question of whether second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is a cognizable crime in Maryland underlies\u2014and its abrogation would solve\u2014the double jeopardy question <em>sub judice. </em>In other words, the double jeopardy issues in this case exist because <em>Roary v. State </em>created them; whether assault with a firearm can serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder is an issue of first impression; the question of whether to overrule <em>Roary v. State </em>is integral to the double jeopardy question; and its abrogation would resolve the double jeopardy issues that conferred jurisdiction in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">We hold that this Court has jurisdiction to decide the issue embodied in the supplemental question raised by the Court: Should this Court reconsider the holding in <em>Roary v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number><em>State? </em>This Court has fundamental jurisdiction to overrule a prior decision of the Court, and has the <em>inherent authority </em>to consider an issue that is inextricably intertwined to the issue before it. <em>See Wynn v. State, </em>388 Md. 423, 431-39, 879 A.2d 1097,1102-07 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">As we noted in <em>Wynn, </em>\u201c[t]he concept of inherent authority, thus, is grounded in the understanding that courts possess certain powers in order to function as courts. Similarly, inherent authority is necessary to protect the role of the judiciary within the constitutional separation of powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 433, 879 A.2d at 1103. The notion that a court is powerless to correct a prior legal principle and must decide a case based upon a principle it disagrees with is inconsistent with the inherent power the court possesses to review and to correct prior analyses as well as the development of the common law. The common law method is subject to judicial reappraisal and modification. Overruling a prior decision of this Court is likewise inherent in the common law method that is open to reappraisal. Under the circumstances presented herein, where the issue was created by <em>Roary v. State </em>and is <em>inextricably intertwined </em>with the appeal issues, this Court has the <em>inherent power </em>to overrule <em>Roary v. State, </em>a prior decision of this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">The Supreme Court of Wisconsin described the power that inheres in courts as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201cIn order to accomplish the purposes for which they are created, courts must also possess powers. From time immemorial, certain powers have been conceded to courts because they are courts. Such powers have been conceded because without them they could neither maintain their dignity, transact their business, nor accomplish the purposes of their existence. These powers are called inherent powers .... <em>\u2018The inherent power of the court is the power to protect itself, the power to administer justice .,the power to promulgate rules for its practice; and the power to provide process where none exists. It is true that the judicial power of this court ivas created by the Constitution, but upon </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number><em>coming into being under the Constitution, this court came into being with inherent powers.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-5\"><em>State v. Cannon, </em>196 Wis. 534, 221 N.W. 603, 603-04 (1928) <em>(quoting In re Bruen, </em>102 Wash. 472, 172 P. 1152, 1153 (1918)) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The State relies on <em>Rush v. State, </em>403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008), for the proposition that this Court does not have jurisdiction to reconsider <em>Roary v. State </em>in this interlocutory-appeal. In <em>Rush, </em>the State noted an interlocutory appeal when the suppression court granted Rush\u2019s motion to suppress a statement taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). <em>Rush </em>involved the limits of the State\u2019s statutory right to an interlocutory appeal under \u00a7 12-302(c)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, while the appeal <em>sub judice </em>is based upon the common law collateral order doctrine. The distinction is of consequence as the strictures of the statute are far more definite and finite than the doctrine applied here. The scope of the jurisdiction conferred is different. Beyond that fact, <em>Rush </em>involved an evidentiary matter, which raises different considerations, as we noted in <em>Neal v. State, </em>272 Md. 323, 322 A.2d 887 (1974):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7M\">\u201cWe do not share the view that a determination that double jeopardy does or does not exist involves an exercise of discretion. To us, the defense of double jeopardy is <em>a liminal constitutional issue, </em>raised at the outset, before there is a trial. <em>It can in no way be compared to a finding that a defendant is not in fact indigent. Neither can it be analogized to questions involving the admissibility of evidence, raised during trial, even though constitutional issues are involved.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b722-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 326, 322 A.2d at 889 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">The cognizability of the charge of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is part of the double jeopardy issue raised in Respondent\u2019s appeal. Respondent, by his double jeopardy question, raises a collateral issue to the merits of the underlying case, \u201ccontesting the very authority of the Government to hale him into court to face trial on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>charge against him.\u201d Ordinarily, a question of whether the crime alleged is cognizable is independent of the merits of the case against respondent. For the double jeopardy question before us, however, whether the crime alleged is cognizable is <em>not </em>independent of the issue we must decide and it is inextricably intertwined with the double jeopardy question.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-4\">We analyze an <em>autrefois acquit </em>double jeopardy question using the <em>Blockburger </em>test\u2014whether the elements of one crime are the same as those in another crime. <em>See Blockburger v. U.S., </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 182, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). The <em>Blockburger </em>analysis requires evaluation of the similarity of the elements of two criminal offenses. <em>State v. </em>Ferrell, 313 Md. 291, 298, 545 A.2d 653, 656 (1988). We break down a criminal charge to its elements and consider it in that form. <em>Id. </em>A question of whether one of those crimes, or sets of elements, is cognizable or not under the law, is essential to the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis. If we evaluate one of the crimes and determine that it should not be a criminal offense in Maryland, then the test is completed and the threat of double jeopardy is relieved. If, as a result of our analysis, we reconsider whether or not a criminal offense should be allowed to proceed at all, that outcome is part of our double jeopardy analysis, and also stands.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">This analysis is <em>sui generis </em>and will not open the floodgates, as the State suggests, to interlocutory appeals of all motions to dismiss based on grounds that a particular crime is not cognizable. Here, as noted, the issue we must decide is inextricably intertwined with the double jeopardy issue. The question of whether assault in the first-degree may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder as a cognizable crime is an integral part of the double jeopardy question before us. Petitioner\u2019s right to challenge the State\u2019s right to try him against being twice put to trial for the same offense includes inherent consideration of whether the offense alleged is one which could support the felony murder charge, particularly whether first-degree assault with a firearm may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-4\">Both certiorari questions are predicated upon this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005), holding that first-degree assault is a proper underlying felony to support a second-degree felony murder conviction. We held the following in <em>Roary v. State:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">\u201cWe hold, that an assault in the first-degree, when committed in a manner inherently dangerous to human life, as in this case, may be a predicate felony for second-degree felony-murder. Thus the trial court did not err in submitting to the jury second-degree felony murder based upon an assault in the first degree. We recognize that our relatively strict adherence to the common law felony-murder doctrine is not favored by a number of other States as explained supra; nothing in our case law or research, however, has persuaded us that the rule in Maryland should be otherwise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 236, 867 A.2d at 1106.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">We take this opportunity to re-examine <em>Roary v. State, </em>to overrule it and to adopt the so-called \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d in Maryland.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> A common limitation of the application of the felony-murder doctrine is the merger doctrine. The merger doctrine, first conceived in the nineteenth century, bars the application of the felony-murder doctrine whenever the underlying felony is an integral element of the homicide. In other words, to support a charge of felony murder, the underlying felony must be independent of the homicide. <em>See Barnett v. State, </em>783 So.2d 927, 930 (Ala. Crim. App. 2000); <em>State v. Essman, </em>98 Ariz. 228, 403 P.2d 540, 545 (1965) (en banc); <em>People v. Chun, </em>45 Cal.4th 1172, 91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425, 434-35 (2009); <em>People v. Ireland, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, 75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 590-91 (1969) (en banc); <em>State v. Clark, </em>204 Kan. 38, 460 P.2d 586, 590 (1969); <em>State v. Shock, </em>68 Mo. 552, 561-62 (Mo. 1878); <em>State v. Hanes, </em>729 S.W.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>612, 617 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987); <em>People v. Moran, </em>246 N.Y. 100, 158 N.E. 85, 36 (1927).</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">Thus, because second-degree felony murder based upon first-degree assault, where the killing does not arise separate from the assault, cannot be a predicate for second-degree felony murder, we do not address whether trying respondent in a successive prosecution for second-degree felony murder based upon first-degree assault violates his protection embodied in the Double Jeopardy Clause of the United States Constitution, or the Maryland common law doctrine of <em>autre-fois acquit </em>or <em>autrefois convict.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It goes without saying that we need not address respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or whether first-degree assault is an inherently dangerous felony <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>capable of serving as a predicate felony for second-degree felony murder, or whether first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury is a lesser included offense of second-degree intent to inflict grievous bodily harm murder, because first-degree assault can no longer serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder when that assault arises out of the homicidal act causing the death of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">We hold that, if the assaultive act causing the injury is the same act that causes the victim\u2019s death, the assault is merged into the murder and therefore cannot serve as the predicate felony for felony-murder purposes. We realize that this view is inconsistent with <em>Roary v. State. </em>We therefore overrule that case, insofar as it holds that the assaultive act constituting willful injury and also causing the victim\u2019s death may serve as a predicate felony for felony-murder purposes. The rule of law we announce today in this case regarding the use of willful injury as a predicate felony for felony-murder purposes shall be prospective only and applicable to this case and those cases not resolved finally on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">At common law, a person\u2019s conduct bringing about an unintended death in the commission or attempted commission of a felony was guilty of murder, Wayne R. LaFave, <em>substantive criminal law </em>\u00a7 14.5(a) 444 (2nd ed. 2003). That rule is known as the felony-murder rule, intended to \u201cdeter dangerous conduct by punishing as murder a homicide resulting from dangerous conduct in the perpetration of a felony, even if the defendant did not intend to kill.\u201d <em>Fisher, </em>367 Md. at 262, 786 A.2d at 732. Underlying the doctrine is the recognition that in society\u2019s judgment, a felony committed intentionally that causes the death of another person is qualitatively more serious than an identical felony that does not. <em>See </em>David Crump <em>&amp; </em>Susan Waite Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine, </em>8 Harv. J.L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y 359, 363 (1985). To obtain a conviction for felony-murder in Maryland, the State must prove the underlying felony and that the death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>occurred during the perpetration or in furtherance of the felony. <em>Newton v. State, </em>280 Md, 260, 269, 373 A.2d 262, 267 (1977). \u201cWithout proof of the underlying felony, there can be no conviction for felony murder.\u201d <em>Hook v. State, </em>315 Md. 25, 32, 553 A.2d 233, 236 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">Maryland Code Ann., Crim Law \u00a7 2-201 (2002; 2012 Repl. Vol, 2016 Supp.)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> provides that certain forms of murder shall be murder in the first-degree. More particularly, \u00a7 2-204 provides in pertinent part, \u201ca murder that is not in the first-degree under \u00a7 2-201 of this subtitle is in the second-degree.\u201d Maryland Code Ann., Crim Law \u00a7 2-204 (2002; 2012 Repl.

Concluding that child abuse of the character and degree described in the evidence of that case is inherently dangerous, we held that \u201cthe acts and omissions constituting the statutory felony of child abuse, proscribed by \u00a7 35C, but not included in \u00a7\u00a7 408 through 410, are the basis, <em>under the circumstances of this case, </em>for applying the felony-murder doctrine.\u201d <em>Id, </em>at 226, 786 A.2d at 710 (emphasis added).

In that case, Michael Roary and his three friends chased the victim, and dropped a boulder on his head twice. <em>Roary, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>385 Md. at 222, 867 A.2d at 1097.

We held that first-degree assault may serve as a predicate felony for a second-degree felony murder conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 236, 867 A.2d at 1106. We expressly declined \u201cto modify the common law of this State to adopt the so-called \u2018merger\u2019 doctrine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 222, 867 A.2d at 1098.

The instant case raises squarely the unintended and undesirable consequences of assault as a predicate for felony murder and calls out for this Court to reconsider the adoption of the merger doctrine, which we shall do.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Chief Judge Cardozo\u2019s discussion in <em>People v. Moran, </em>246 N.Y. 100, 158 N.E. 35, 36 (1927), of the necessity for an independent underlying felony has been cited and quoted often in the New York Court of Appeals and other discussions of the \u201cmerger doctrine.\u201d Moran was convicted of murdering a police officer. <em>Id. </em>at 36. The only theory presented to the jury for the murder charge was felony murder. In reversing, the court held that the felonious assault resulting in the death could not be the underlying felony for felony murder. <em>Id. </em>In an oft-quoted passage, the court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b730-8\">\u201cHomicide is murder in the first degree when perpetrated with a deliberate and premeditated design to kill, or, without such design, while engaged in the commission of a felony. To make the quality of the intent indifferent, it is not enough to show that the homicide was felonious, or that there was a felonious assault which culminated in homicide. <em>Such a holding would mean that every homicide, not justifiable or excusable, would occur in the commission of a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number><em>felony, with the result that intent to kill and deliberation and premeditation would never be essential. The felony that eliminates the quality of the intent must be one that is independent of the homicide and of the assault merged therein, </em>as, <em>e. g., </em>robbery or larceny or burglary or rape.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2Q\"><em>Id. </em>at 36 (internal citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">The Supreme Court of California addressed the issue of whether assault with a deadly weapon could serve as the predicate felony for a felony-murder conviction in <em>People v. Ireland, </em>70 Cal.2d 522, 75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580 (1969) (en banc). Ireland was charged with shooting and killing his wife. <em>Id., </em>75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d at 582-83. Applying the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d and requiring an independent felony, the court explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-6\">\u201cWe have concluded that the utilization of the felony-murder rule in circumstances such as those before us extends the operation of that rule \u2018beyond any rational function that it is designed to serve.\u2019 To allow such use of the felony-murder rule would effectively preclude the jury from considering the issue of malice aforethought in all cases wherein homicide has been committed as a result of a felonious assault\u2014a category which includes the great majority of all homicides. This kind of bootstrapping finds support neither in logic nor in law. <em>We therefore hold that a second degree felony-murder instruction may not properly be given when it is based upon a felony which is an integral part of the homicide and which the evidence produced by the prosecution shows to be an offense included in fact within the offense charged.\u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b731-7\"><em>Id., </em>75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d at 590 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added). The California Supreme Court explained later the development of the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b731-8\">\u201cPrior to our decision in Ireland, the \u2018merger\u2019 doctrine had been developed in other jurisdictions as a shorthand explanation for the conclusion that the felony-murder rule should not be applied in circumstances where the only underlying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>(or \u2018predicate\u2019) felony committed by the defendant was <em>assault. </em>The name of the doctrine derived from the characterization of the assault as an offense that \u2018merged\u2019 with the resulting homicide. In explaining the basis for the merger doctrine, courts and legal commentators reasoned that, because a homicide generally results from the commission of an assault, every felonious assault ending in death automatically would be elevated to murder in the event a felonious assault could serve as the predicate felony for purposes of the felony-murder doctrine. Consequently, application of the felony-murder rule to felonious assaults would usurp most of the law of homicide, relieve the prosecution in the great majority of homicide cases of the burden of having to prove malice in order to obtain a murder conviction, and thereby frustrate the Legislature\u2019s intent to punish certain felonious assaults resulting in death (those committed with malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as murder) more harshly than other felonious assaults that happened to result in death (those committed without malice aforethought, and therefore punishable as manslaughter). (See Note, <em>The Doctrine of Merger in Felony-Murder and Misdemeanor-Manslaughter </em>(1960) 35 St. Johns L. Rev. 109, 117; see also Crump &amp; Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine </em>(1985) 8 Harv. J. L. <em>&amp; </em>Pub.

One commentator explains that the merger rule applied to assaults is supported by the policy of preserving some meaningful domain in which the Legislature\u2019s careful graduation of homicide offenses can be implemented. (Crump &amp; Crump, <em>In Defense of the Felony Murder Doctrine, </em>op. cit. supra, 8 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol\u2019y. 359, 379.).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b732-5\"><em>People v.

In <em>Fisher v. State, </em>120 Kan. 226, 243 P. 291 (1926), the Kansas Supreme Court rejected assault with a deadly weapon as a basis for a felony-murder conviction and embraced the merger rule, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b733-6\">\u201cThis contention cannot be sustained. The effect of it would be to make any homicide, not excusable or justified, which by our statute, is defined to be manslaughter in any of the degrees or murder in the second degree, to constitute murder in the first degree. In other words, there could, under this interpretation of the statute, be no such thing as any lower degree of homicide than murder in the first degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b733-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 293; <em>see also State v. Branch, </em>244 Or. 97, 415 P.2d 766, 767 (1966) (en banc) (observing that in order to preserve the distinctions between degrees of murder and manslaughter, courts have held that assault merges with the killing and cannot be the predicate for felony murder).</p>\n<p id=\"b733-8\">In the years since <em>Moran, Ireland, Fisher, </em>and <em>Branch, </em>many states considering this issue have adopted some version of the merger rule for first-degree assaults resulting in the death of the victim. <em>See Garrett v. State, </em>573 S.W.2d 543, 545 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978) (noting that applying the felony-murder rule in such instances \u201chas been rejected in the vast majority of jurisdictions throughout the United States where it is held that a felonious assault resulting in death cannot be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>used as the felony which permits application of the felony-murder rule to the resulting homicide.\u201d). <em>See generally </em>Robert L. Simpson, <em>Annotation, Application of Felony-Murder Doctrine Where The Felony Relied Upon Is an Includible Offense with the Homicide, </em>40 A.L.R.3d 1341.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">In <em>Roary v. State </em>we rejected the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d and held that first-degree assault with the intent to inflict serious physical injury was a viable predicate for second-degree felony murder. <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 222, 867 A.2d at 1098. Today, we overrule <em>Roary v.

Much, not only of legislation, but of judicial decision, is based upon the broad ground of public policy, and this latter must not be lost sight of.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Adi\"><em>Adkins v.

Atkinson, </em>370 U.S. 195, 82 S.Ct. 1328, 8 L.Ed.2d 440 (1970), is persuasive, noting that the Court is correct in overruling erroneous precedent and echoing Justice Frankfurter\u2019s belief that wisdom should not be discarded merely because it comes late. <em>Boys Market, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770, </em>398 U.S. 235, 255, 90 S.Ct. 1583, 1595, 26 L.Ed.2d 199 (1970) (Stewart, J., concurring).

Powell, Jr., <em>Stare Decisis and Judicial Restraint, </em>47 Wash. &amp; Lee L. Rev. 281, 286 (1990). There is much scholarly support for the idea that it is better to correct an erroneous precedent than to perpetuate error. Richard Wasserman, in in his book on <em>stare decisis, </em>explained as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-6\">\u201cThe liberal rule ... is one which therefore allows for flexibility and growth; under its dictates precedents need not always be followed. The doctrine ... allows for both definite expectation and innovations .... And if the judge should conclude that the prior cases were wrongly decided\u2014that the precedents are incorrect\u2014then the cases should be openly overruled. For if the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>demanded that precedents be followed regardless of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>amount of good or harm produced in society by so doing, then this rule might be open to the objection that certainty is being procured at too great a price.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">Richard A.

State, </em>which held that first-degree assault was a viable predicate for second-degree felony murder. <em>Roary, </em>385 Md. at 222, 867 A.2d at 1098. The holding of <em>Roary v. State, </em>that assault in the first-degree may serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder is wrong in that it expands unwisely felony murder and elevates practically all shooting deaths in Maryland to second-degree felony murder, thereby effectively eliminating the crime of manslaughter. The instrumentality of death in <em>Roary </em>was a boulder. The instrumentality here is a gun. Hence, we overrule it before that case creates more undesirable consequences for the criminal law in Maryland, as pointed out in the dissent in <em>Roary. Id. </em>at 255, 867 A.2d at 1117 (Raker, J., dissent). We join the large majority of our sister states and conclude that the better and more legally sound approach is to adopt the \u201cmerger rule\u201d and require that for second-degree felony murder, the inherently dangerous predicate felony must be one that is independent of the homicide. We arrive at this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">Time has shown us that <em>Roary v. State </em>was decided wrongly for several reasons. It was contrary to our own jurisprudence which has stated often that the felony-murder rule should not be expanded. <em>See Campbell, </em>293 Md. at 451-52, 444 A.2d at 1042 (stating that \u201c[w]e are persuaded that the felony-murder doctrine should not be extended beyond its traditional com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>mon law\u201d and expressly declining to extend the felony-murder doctrine to situations involving lethal acts of non-felons because such an extension would not achieve the purpose of the rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">Further, contrary to the trend around the country, and established Maryland jurisprudence limiting the scope of felony murder, \u201cthe court\u2019s decision [in <em>Roary v. </em>State] unwisely and unnecessarily extends the scope of second-degree common-law felony murder in Maryland.\u201d Marcia J. Simon, Note, <em>An Inappropriate and Unnecessary Expansion of Felony Murder in Maryland, </em>65 Md. L. Rev. 992 (2006). Shortly after <em>Roary </em>was announced by this Court, the decision was criticized strongly in the Maryland Law Review. Marcia J. Simon pointed out the flaws and errors in the Court\u2019s reasoning, noting as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-5\">\u201cIn reaching its decision, the court rejected the merger doctrine, which precludes felonious assault as a predicate for felony murder. Instead, the court mistakenly relied on a deterrence rationale that emphasized conduct rather than intent. The court\u2019s deterrence justification was flawed, however, because it incorrectly presumed that rejecting the merger doctrine would deter dangerous assaults. Moreover, by focusing on conduct rather than intent, the court failed to consider individual culpability and proportionality, two cornerstones of modern criminal law. This misguided approach renders the statutory punishment scheme for homicide largely ineffective and will, as it did in <em>Roary, </em>lead to illogical, disproportionate punishments. Finally, the court\u2019s decision to allow assault as a predicate to felony murder permits prosecutors to circumvent the requirement to prove intent to kill and subsumes much of Maryland\u2019s second-degree murder and manslaughter law into felony murder.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">The court should have instead followed the lead of a number of other states and adopted the merger doctrine to preclude assault as a predicate for felony murder. In doing so, the court would have imposed a reasonable limitation on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>felony-murder doctrine while preserving an appropriate punishment scheme for homicide in Maryland.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b738-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 992-93 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\"><em> </em>VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">As we have noted, second-degree felony murder is an unlawful killing in the course of the commission of a felony that is inherently dangerous to human life but is not included among the felonies enumerated in \u00a7 2-201. This Court has recognized that felony murder should not be enlarged and we have, in fact, restricted its application. In <em>Fisher, </em>we noted that <em>\u201cin order to ameliorate the harshness of the strict common law felony murder doctrine, many jurisdictions limit the predicate felonies to those that are dangerous to human life\u201d </em>367 Md. at 254, 786 A.2d at 727. In order to maintain the integrity of the different levels of culpability of murder and manslaughter and to ameliorate its perceived harshness, today we adopt the \u201cmerger doctrine\u201d and we hold that first-degree assault that results in the victim\u2019s death merges with the homicide and therefore cannot serve as an underlying felony for the purposes of the felony murder rule. <em>Roary v. State, </em>385 Md. 217, 867 A.2d 1095 (2005), is overruled. First-degree assault, either intent to inflict serious physical injury or assault with a firearm, cannot, as a matter of law, serve as the underlying felony to support felony murder. The assaultive act merges into the resultant homicide, and may not be deemed a separate and independent offense that could support a conviction for felony murder.

The State contends that this Court lacks jurisdiction to overrule Roary because the collateral-order doctrine does not permit an appeal for failure to state an offense prior to final judgment in a case. The State explains that, if Jones had moved to dismiss in the circuit court on the ground that second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault was not a crime\u2014 <em>ie., </em>if Jones had moved to dismiss for failure to state an offense\u2014then the issue of overruling Roary would not be \u201ccollateral\u201d; instead, the issue would go to the heart of guilt or innocence. In other words, the State asserts that the collateral-order doctrine is inapplicable because the denial of a motion to dismiss on such a <em>ground\u2014ie., </em>the allegation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>the Indictment failed to properly charge an offense\u2014is reviewable only after a final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">Jones counters that this Court has jurisdiction to reconsider Roary because according to Jones, Roary is the cause of the double jeopardy issue in this case, and overruling Roary would resolve this case\u2019s double jeopardy issues. Both parties appear to agree that the appeal on the double jeopardy issue arose under the collateral-order doctrine. Simply put, with respect to the issue of Court\u2019s jurisdiction to overrule Roary, I agree with the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Cts. <em>&amp; </em>Jud. Proc. (\u201cCJP\u201d) \u00a7 12-301, generally, an appellate court has jurisdiction only over a final judgment. See Harris v. State, 420 Md. 300, 312, 22 A.3d 886, 892 (2011) (\u201cGenerally, in Maryland[,] appellate jurisdiction may arise only after entry of a final judgment.\u201d (Citing CJP \u00a7 12-301)). \u201cThere are three well-identified, but infrequently sanctioned, limited exceptions to the final judgment rule\u201d; where one of these exceptions applies, an appellate court has jurisdiction over an interlocutory <em>order\u2014i.e., </em>an order that is not a final judgment. Id. at 312-14, 22 A.3d at 893-94 (citation and ellipsis omitted). The three exceptions are: (1) appeals that a statute other than CJP \u00a7 12-301 expressly allows; (2) appeals of orders that trial courts enter pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-602, not disposing of the entire action; and (3) appeals pursuant to the common-law collateral-order doctrine. See id at 313-14, 22 A.3d at 893-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">I agree with the parties that the only basis for the instant appeal is the common-law collateral-order doctrine.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>stant appeal does not arise out of a final judgment. Jones has not been convicted of any crime. Two charges remain pending against Jones: second-degree felony murder and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence or felony.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury hung on, and the circuit court declared a mistrial as to, these two charges. Accordingly, there was no final judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Under the collateral-order doctrine, an appellate court has jurisdiction over an order that: (1) conclusively determines the disputed question; (2) resolves an important issue; (3) resolves an issue that is completely separate from the merits of the action; and (4) would be effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. See Harris, 420 Md. at 316, 22 A.3d at 895. This Court has stressed that \u201c[t]he collateral order doctrine is a very narrow exception to the final judgment rule, and each of its four requirements is very strictly applied in Maryland. In particular, the fourth prong, unre-viewability on appeal, is not satisfied except in extraordinary situations.\u201d Id at 316, 22 A.3d at 895 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">In this case, if Jones\u2019s motion to dismiss had been based on the argument that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault\u2014ie., the argument that Roary is no longer good law\u2014then the denial of the motion to dismiss would not have satisfied the collateral-order doctrine. First, the Roary issue would not have been completely separate from the merits of the action; indeed, if there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault, then Jones is necessarily not guilty of that charge. Second, in stark contrast to the double <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>jeopardy issue, the Roary issue does not implicate a right to be free from a second trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">Stated otherwise, raising the Roary issue in the motion to dismiss would have been the equivalent of moving to dismiss the indictment for failure to state an offense; and, significantly, in Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 663, 97 S.Ct. 2034, 52 L.Ed.2d 651 (1977), the Supreme Court concluded that such a motion to dismiss does not satisfy the collateral-order doctrine for two reasons:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-7\">First, an order denying a motion to dismiss an indictment for failure to state an offense is plainly not \u2018collateral\u2019 in any sense of that term; rather it goes to the very heart of the issues to be resolved at the upcoming trial. Secondly, the issue resolved adversely to [the defendant] is such that it may be reviewed effectively, and, if necessary, corrected if and when a final judgment results.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">The double jeopardy issue does not encompass the Roary issue. It would be wrong to hold otherwise. When a court decides a double jeopardy issue, the court decides whether two crimes are \u201cthe same offense\u201d for purposes of double jeopardy. The court does not inquire as to whether one of those crimes is actually a crime in the first place. To the contrary, a double jeopardy analysis presumes that the two crimes are, indeed, crimes. If there is a challenge to the existence or propriety of one crime, that challenge does not constitute a double jeopardy issue. Indeed, a double jeopardy issue like the instant one can arise only if the State charges the defendant with at least two crimes and engages in at least two consecutive prosecutions. By contrast, a defendant\u2019s claim that there is no such thing as a particular crime can arise even if the State charges the defendant with only one crime in only one prosecution. The double jeopardy issue clearly does not encompass the question of whether second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is actually a crime or whether Roary should be overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>In short, the two questions are distinct. To use algebraic terms, the question of \u201cAre X and Y the same?\u201d does not encompass the question of \u201cDoes X <em>exist?\u201d\u2014i.e., </em>the first question does not include the second question.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">In this case, the double jeopardy question is: \u201cIs second-degree specific-intent murder the same offense as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault?\u201d The Roary question is: \u201cIs there such a crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault?\u201d The double jeopardy question asks whether Jones should be tried again for the same offense; the Roary question does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">It would be incorrect to hold that the double jeopardy question depends on the answer to the Roary question. Assuming hypothetically, purely for argument\u2019s sake, that Roary was wrongly decided, and that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault, then the result is not that double jeopardy bars a new trial of Jones on that charge. Indeed, the reason why a new trial would not occur in that circumstance has nothing to do with double jeopardy; the reason is not that Jones has already been acquitted of a crime, but instead that the offense in question is not a crime at all, and thus could be neither properly charged nor the subject of any trial\u2014whether it is Jones\u2019s first trial, second trial, or whichever number trial. In other words, the outcome of the Roary question has nothing to do with double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">Although the motion to dismiss would not have satisfied the collateral-order doctrine if it had been based on the Roary issue, the reality is that the motion to dismiss was, in fact, based on the double jeopardy issue; thus, the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss satisfied the collateral-order doctrine. Accordingly, the issue becomes: May this Court, on its own initiative, append the Roary issue to a properly-taken appeal, where that issue could not have been the subject of a properly-taken appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">The State is correct in advocating that Rush v. State, 403 Md. 68, 939 A.2d 689 (2008) is instructive on this issue. In</p>\n<p id=\"A6H\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>Rush, id. at 74, 939 A.2d at 692, this Court held that a criminal defendant \u201cdid not have the right to cross-appeal, [but] she did have the right, in the State\u2019s appeal, to defend the ruling of the trial court on alternative grounds.\u201d Law enforcement officers had arrested the defendant, Mirandized her, and interviewed her. See id. at 74-78, 939 A.2d at 692-94. During the interview, the defendant made inculpatory statements. See id. at 78, 939 A.2d at 694. The defendant moved to suppress the inculpatory statements on two alternative grounds: (1) that the advisements that a law enforcement officer provided to her did not comport with Miranda; and (2) the statements were involuntary because the law enforcement officer obtained them through threats and inducement. See Rush, 403 Md. at 78, 939 A.2d at 694-95. The trial court granted the motion to suppress only on the ground that the advisements that the law enforcement officer provided to the defendant did not comport with Miranda; the trial court expressly noted that it was not granting the motion to suppress on the ground of involuntariness. See id. at 79, 939 A.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">The State appealed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress pursuant to what is now CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)(i), which states in pertinent part that, in certain criminal cases, \u201cthe State may appeal from a decision of a trial court that excludes evidence offered by the State or requires the return of property alleged to have been seized in violation of the Constitution of the United States, the Maryland Constitution, or the Maryland Declaration of Rights.\u201d See Rush, 403 Md. at 80, 939 A.2d at 695. The defendant noted a \u201ccross-appeal,\u201d and argued on appeal that the circuit court erred in ruling that her statements should not be suppressed on the ground of involuntariness. Id. at 80, 939 A.2d at 695.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">The Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress, holding that the advisements that the law enforcement officer provided to the defendant comported with Miranda. See Rush, 403 Md. at 80, 939 A,2d at 695-96. The Court of Special Appeals held that it had jurisdiction to consider the voluntariness issue that the defendant raised in her \u201ccross-appeal,\u201d and concluded that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>dant\u2019s statements were involuntary. See id. at 80, 939 A.2d at 696. The defendant filed a petition for a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>and the State filed a cross-petition for a writ of <em>certiorari', </em>this Court granted the petition and the cross-petition. See id. 80-81, 939 A.2d at 696.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Addressing the Miranda issue first, this Court agreed with the Court of Special Appeals that the advisements that the law enforcement officer provided to the defendant comported with Miranda. See Rush, 403 Md. at 89, 939 A.2d at 701. Turning to the voluntariness issue, this Court noted that the threshold question was whether the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction to consider the defendant\u2019s \u201ccross-appeal.\u201d See id. at 95, 939 A.2d at 705. We observed that, in previous eases, we had \u201cnarrowly construed any grant of appellate authority\u201d and had \u201cstrictly construed the right to appeal[.]\u201d Id. at 98, 939 A.2d at 706 (citations omitted). This Court concluded that what is now CJP \u00a7 12\u2014302(c)(4) \u201cdoes not confer appellate jurisdiction to hear a defendant\u2019s cross-appeal. Rather, the statute clearly limits the right to appeal from an interlocutory order to the State; the defendant is free to appeal from the final judgment.\u201d Id. at 101, 939 A.2d at 708.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">That said, this Court went on to determine that, \u201c[although [the defendant] could not file a \u2018cross-appeal,\u2019 she was entitled to raise the voluntariness issue in the State\u2019s appeal, in order to defend the suppression ruling on an alternative ground raised by [the defendant] and ruled on by the\u201d trial court. Id. at 103, 939 A.2d at 709. This Court ultimately concluded that the record was inadequate to make a determination as to whether the defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary. See id. at 104, 939 A.2d at 710. This Court remanded the case to the Court of Special Appeals with instructions to reverse the grant of the motion to suppress and remand to the trial court for further proceedings. See id. at 104, 939 A.2d at 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">Notably, not every member of this Court agreed with the holding that the defendant could raise the voluntariness issue in the State\u2019s appeal. In a concurring and dissenting opinion, Judge Irma S. Raker agreed with the Majority that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>advisements that the law enforcement officer provided to the defendant comported with Miranda; however, Judge Raker disagreed with the Majority as to the appealability of the voluntariness issue. See Rush, 403 Md. at 105, 939 A.2d at 710 (Raker, J., concurring and dissenting). Specifically, Judge Raker stated that she \u201cagree[d] with the State that [the defendant could ]not appeal the [trial cjourt\u2019s finding that portions of her statement were voluntary.\u201d Id. at 105, 939 A.2d at 710 (Raker, J., concurring and dissenting). Judge Raker explained: \u201cThe ruling was interlocutory, and because there exists no statute or right to appeal such an order, her claim may be raised in an appeal from a final judgment, and not within the State\u2019s appeal.\u201d Id. at 105, 939 A.2d at 710 (Raker, J., concurring and dissenting). In other words, contrary to the position taken in this case, Judge Raker would not have permitted the appending of the issue of voluntariness to the State\u2019s appeal of a trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress on the basis of a failure to comply with Miranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Rush provides no support for the idea that this Court may address the Roary issue in this appeal. In Rush, the defendant moved to suppress on two grounds, and the trial court granted the motion to suppress on one of those grounds. The State was empowered by statute\u2014specifically, what is now CJP \u00a7 12-302(c)(4)\u2014to appeal the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress. Significantly, this Court held that the defendant was entitled to argue in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress on both of the grounds that the defendant raised in the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">This appeal is vastly different. Here, Jones moved to dismiss the charge for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault on the ground of double jeopardy. Jones did not, in the motion to dismiss, contend that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. In other words, Jones did not raise the Roary issue in the motion to dismiss. The circuit court denied the motion to dismiss, and Jones appealed. Jones was empowered by the collateral-order doctrine to appeal the circuit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismiss only because the motion to dismiss was based on double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">The distinction between the double jeopardy issue and the Roary issue is crucial, and materially distinguishes this appeal from Rush. In Rush, regardless of whether the trial court granted the motion to suppress on the Miranda issue, the voluntariness issue, or both, the State would have had a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress. By contrast, here, Jones had a right to appeal the trial court\u2019s denial of the motion to dismissed only because Jones moved dismiss on the ground of double jeopardy. If Jones had raised only the Roary issue in the motion to <em>dismiss\u2014ie., </em>simply argued that there is no such crime as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault\u2014then Jones would have lacked a right to appeal, because the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress would not have satisfied the collateral-order doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Also significant is the fact that, in Rush, this Court concluded that the <em>defendant\u2014ie., </em>the appellee, the non-appealing party, in whose favor the trial court ruled\u2014was entitled to argue in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s grant of the motion to suppress on- both of the grounds that the defendant raised in the motion to suppress. By contrast, here, Jones is the appellant\u2014the appealing party, whose motion to dismiss the circuit court denied. In contrast to the defendant in Rush, Jones is not seeking to uphold a trial court\u2019s ruling. To the contrary, Jones seeks reversal of the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">The reason why this fact is important is demonstrated by the following quotation in Rush, 403 Md. at 103, 939 A.2d at 709: \u201c[A] reviewing court may uphold the final judgment of a lower court on any ground adequately shown by the record[.]\u201d (Emphasis added) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Although neither Rush nor this appeal involves a final judgment because both cases arise out of interlocutory appeals, this quotation from Rush shows that an appellate court may uphold a trial court\u2019s ruling on any ground that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>record shows. The quotation from Rush is conspicuously silent on whether an appellate court may reverse a trial court\u2019s ruling on any ground that the record shows.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">This is appropriate, given that, generally, appellate courts consider whether to reverse a trial court\u2019s ruling only on the grounds that are raised by the appealing <em>party\u2014ie., </em>the party who is aggrieved by the trial court\u2019s ruling. Appellate courts do not comb the record, looking for grounds for reversal that the appellant did not raise. Or, as Judge Charles E. Moylan, Jr. once so eloquently put it: \u201c[AJppellate courts do not range forth, like knights errant, seeking flaws in trials. Their quest is far more modest. They monitor a trial for the limited purpose of seeing if the trial judge committed error.\u201d Austin v. State, 90 Md.App. 254, 265, 600 A.2d 1142, 1147 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Jones attempts to distinguish Rush on the ground that Rush arose out of an interlocutory appeal that a statute allowed, whereas this case arises out of an interlocutory appeal that the collateral-order doctrine allows. Jones fails to explain why this difference in procedural histories leads to the result that Rush is not instructive here or that the distinction matters at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">Equally unpersuasive is Jones\u2019s reasoning that this Court has jurisdiction to consider the Roary issue because overruling Roary would obviate the need to consider the double jeopardy issue. As discussed above, appellate jurisdiction is not automatic; it must arise from one of the four specific bases for appealability, such as the collateral-order doctrine. Jones provides no case law, and I know of none, that stands for the proposition that, where Issue A is properly before an appellate court, the appellate court may consider a different legal question, Issue B, solely by virtue of the circumstance that resolving Issue B in a certain way would render Issue A moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-8\">Even more troubling is the circumstance that this Court, not Jones, raised the Roary issue by <em>sua sponte </em>ordering the parties to brief it. Just as the parties cannot confer appellate jurisdiction on an appellate court by agreement, nor can an appellate court confer upon itself appellate jurisdiction to consider a particular issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>The Majority relies on Wynn v. State, 388 Md. 423, 879 A.2d 1097 (2005) for the proposition that this Court has the inherent authority to \u201cconsider an issue that is inextricably intertwined to the issue before it.\u201d Maj. Op. at 691, 155 A.3d at 498. Despite the Majority\u2019s reliance on it, Wynn, in actuality, stands for the opposite proposition\u2014that this Court lacks such authority. In Wynn, 388 Md. at 424-25, 879 A.2d at 1098, this Court held that a trial court erred in dismissing charges in response to the State\u2019s violation of a pre-trial scheduling order. The trial court declared a mistrial as to certain charges due to a deadlocked jury, and gave the State thirty days to decide whether to reprosecute the defendant. See id. at 426, 879 A.2d at 1099. The State did not file anything to indicate that the State planned to reprosecute the defendant. See id. at 427, 879 A.2d at 1100. Forty-five days after the trial court declared a mistrial, the trial court conducted a status conference, at which the defendant moved to dismiss. See id at 426, 879 A.2d at 1099. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss on the ground that the State failed to file a line. See id at 427-28, 879 A.2d at 1100. The State appealed, and the Court of Special Appeals reversed, holding that the trial court lacked the authority to dismiss the charges. See id. at 428, 879 A.2d at 1100. This Court agreed and affirmed. See id at 425, 879 A.2d at 1098.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">This Court rejected the defendant\u2019s contention that, based on a trial court\u2019s inherent authority to control its docket, the trial court in Wynn had the power to dismiss the charges based on the State\u2019s failure to comply with the scheduling order. See id. at 430-31, 879 A.2d at 1101-02. Significantly, this Court explained: \u201cInherent authority should be applied only when necessary to the performance of the judicial function.\u201d Id. at 429, 879 A.2d at 1100-01. This Court also observed: \u201cCourts across the country, including this Court, have maintained that inherent authority should be recognized and yet employed rarely.\u201d Id. at 435, 879 A.2d at 1104. This Court held that a trial court\u2019s inherent authority to control its docket does not outweigh the State\u2019s discretion to determine whether to prosecute. See id. at 443, 879 A.2d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Wynn establishes that a court may not invoke its inherent authority except in the rare instance that it is necessary to do so, and Wynn does not address at all an appellate court\u2019s use of inherent authority to confer jurisdiction upon itself. This Court\u2019s holding in Wynn concerning inherent authority does not in any way support the Majority\u2019s decision to append the Roary issue to the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Although the Majority states that this Court has the inherent authority to consider Roary because the Roary issue is \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with the issues that the parties raised on appeal, as explained above, the Roary issue is not interwoven with the double jeopardy issue; the question of whether two crimes are the same offense for purposes of double jeopardy is not the same as the question of whether one of those crimes is really a crime at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">In sum, given that Jones would have been unable to appeal the circuit court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress under the collateral order doctrine had the motion been based on the ground that second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault is not an offense, this Court lacks jurisdiction over the issue. The Roary issue and the double jeopardy issue are not the same issue, and jurisdiction for the appeal is not conferred by the inherent authority of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Application of the Principle of <em>Stare Decisis </em>to Roary</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">Although I would hold that this Court lacks jurisdiction to overrule. Roary, I will, nonetheless, address the merits of the Majority\u2019s decision with respect to Roary. \u201cUnder [the principle of] <em>stare decisis, </em>absent extremely narrow exceptions, an appellate court does not overrule its precedent.\u201d Thompson v. UBS Fin. Servs., Inc., 443 Md. 47, <em>57-58, </em>115 A.3d 125, 181 (2015) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). There are two such extremely narrow exceptions. The first is that \u201can appellate court need not adhere to [the principle of] <em>stare decisis </em>where the appellate court\u2019s precedent was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles.\u201d Id. at 58 n.5, 115 A.3d at 131 n.5 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The second is that an appellate court need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>adhere to the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>where the appellate court\u2019s \u201cprecedent has been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving events.\u201d Id. at 58, 115 A,3d at 131 (brackets, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">Neither of the exceptions to the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>applies to Roary. Significantly, in his supplemental brief, Jones explicitly concedes that the first exception to the principle of <em>stare decisis\u2014ie., </em>that the precedent in question was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles\u2014does not apply to Roary. Specifically, Jones states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b751-6\">[Jones] does not believe that <em>Roary </em>is clearly wrong or contrary to established principles. Although [Jones] agrees with the <em>Roary </em>dissent and maintains that this Court should adopt the merger doctrine to resolve the problems [that] <em>Roary </em>has created in his case, the <em>Roary </em>decision was not legally incorrect. In <em>Roary, </em>the Court considered an issue of first impression in Maryland. Additionally, the <em>Roary </em>Court issued its decision amongst many different approaches to the merger issue in many different States, and Maryland ultimately joined a minority of [S]tates in rejecting the merger doctrine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">(Emphasis added) (citations omitted). Jones is absolutely correct in conceding that Roary was not clearly wrong. The Majority, however, takes just the opposite approach, and concludes that Roary \u201cwas decided wrongly.\u201d Maj. Op. at 706, 155 A.3d at 507. It speaks volumes that Jones does not endorse the same basis for overruling Roary as adopted by the Majority.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">In describing the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>the Majority quotes a f\u00edfty-two-year-old case from West Virginia, Adkins v. St. Francis Hosp. of Charleston, 149 W.Va. 705, 143 S.E.2d 154, 163 (1965). See Maj. Op. at 704-05, 155 A.3d at 505-06. In Adkins, 143 S.E.2d at 162, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia stated that a case may be overruled \u201cwhen it clearly is apparent that an error has been made o[r] that the application of an outmoded rule, due to changing conditions, results in injustice^]\u201d But, in Adkins, the Supreme Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>Appeals of West Virginia does not apply the same standard that this Court has used\u2014that a case may be overruled where the case was clearly wrong and contrary to established principles, or has been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving events. See Thompson, 443 Md. at 58 &amp; n.5, 115 A.3d at 131 &amp; n.5. Significantly, the language from Adkins that the Majority quotes does not contain the terms \u201cclearly wrong\u201d or \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d but instead simply speaks of whether a case is merely \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cincorrect.\u201d See Maj. Op. at 704-05, 155 A.3d at 505-06; Adkins, 143 S.E.2d at 163 (\u201cThe benefit to the public in the future is of greater moment than any incorrect decision in the past.\u201d); id. (\u201c[I]t becomes the duty as well as the right of the court to consider [precedent] carefully, and to allow no previous error to continue, if it can be corrected.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b752-5\">Immediately after quoting Adkins, the Majority relies on other non-binding sources, such as law review articles and books. See Maj, Op. at 704-06, 155 A.3d at 506-07, As to the principle of <em>stare decisis, </em>the Majority uses citations of Maryland law in only two instances. First, the Majority provides a string cite of Maryland cases after the sentence: \u201cCourts recognize the power to decline to follow the doctrine [of <em>stare decisis] </em>when persuaded the prior decision is wrong.\u201d Maj. Op. at 704, 155 A.3d at 506. This sentence fails to indicate that the standard for overruling a case is not whether the case is merely \u201cwrong\u201d; rather, the standard is whether the case is \u201cclearly wrong and contrary to established principles.\u201d The Majority\u2019s only other citation of Maryland law as to the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>is a citation of Unger v. State, 427 Md. 383, 417, 48 A.3d 242, 261-62 (2012) after the sentence: \u201cNonetheless, every court recognizes that the rule of <em>stare decisis </em>is not ironclad or absolute.\u201d Maj. Op. at 704, 155 A.3d at 506.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-6\">Ultimately, as to overruling Roary, the Majority states: \u201cWith these considerations in mind, we find good and sufficient cause in favor of overruling <em>Raary[.]\u201d </em>Maj. Op. at 706, 156 A.3d at 507. The phrase \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d appears nowhere in the Majority\u2019s discussion of the authorities it relies upon to def\u00edne the concept of <em>stare decisis. </em>Thus, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>unclear from what source the Majority has drawn the phrase \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d as the standard for overruling Maryland case law. What is clear is that this Court has never used \u201cgood and sufficient cause\u201d as a standard for overruling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">In sum, applying the principle of <em>stare decisis </em>established in Maryland case law leads to the conclusion that Roary was not clearly wrong and contrary to established principles; and, in the past twelve years, there has not been a societal change that has rendered archaic the principle that second-degree felony murder can be predicated on first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">This court\u2019s holding in Roary was based on sound principles of law, and is as valid today as it was in 2005. In Roary, 385 Md. at 222-23, 867 A.2d at 1097-98, the defendant and multiple co-conspirators beat a person; during the beating, two of the defendant\u2019s co-conspirators dropped a boulder on the person\u2019s head, and the person died as a result of his injuries. A jury convicted the defendant of, among other crimes, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. See id. at 224, 867 A.2d at 1099. On appeal, the defendant urged this Court to adopt a \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, under which second-degree felony murder could not be predicated on first-degree assault because the murder theoretically \u201cmerges\u201d with the assault. See id at 225, 232-33, 867 A.2d at 1099, 1103-04.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">This Court noted that it had previously been established that second-degree felony murder could be predicated on a felony that is \u201csufficiently dangerous to life[,]\u201d as \u201cdetermined by the nature of the [felony] or by the manner in which [the felony] was perpetrated in a given set of circumstances.\u201d Id. at 229, 867 A.2d at 1101 (quoting Fisher v. State, 367 Md. 218, 263, 786 A.2d 706, 733 (2001)) (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted). In Fisher, 367 Md. at 263, 786 A,2d at 733, this Court held, among other things, that a felony could serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder if: (1) the felony was inherently dangerous to human life; or (2) under a particular case\u2019s circumstances, the defendant committed the felony in a manner that was dangerous to human life. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>Fisher, id. at 226, 786 A.2d at 711, two defendants were convicted of second-degree felony murder predicated on child abuse. On appeal, the defendants challenged the convictions\u2019 validity on three alternative grounds. See id. at 246-47, 786 A.2d at 728-24. First, the defendants contended that, under Maryland law, there was no such crime as second-degree felony murder, as no statute provided for such a crime\u2014in contrast to first-degree felony murder, for which certain statutes enumerated the possible predicate felonies. See id. at 246-47, 786 A.2d at 723. Second, the defendants argued that, even if second-degree felony murder was cognizable under Maryland law, only common law crimes, as opposed to statutory ones, could serve as predicate felonies. See id. at 247, 786 A.2d at 728. Third, the defendants asserted that, even if statutory crimes could serve as predicate felonies, only crimes that were inherently dangerous to human life could serve as predicate felonies. See id. at 247, 786 A.2d at 723-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">In Fisher, id. at 247, 263, 786 A.2d at 724, 733, this Court rejected all three of the defendants\u2019 contentions. This Court held that second-degree felony murder is cognizable under Maryland law because the statutes that enumerated the predicate felonies for first-degree felony murder simply established that a murder that was committed during one of those felonies was first-degree murder; the statutes did not supersede the common law felony-murder doctrine. See id. at 250-61, 786 A.2d at 725-26. This Court held that statutory crimes could serve as predicate felonies for second-degree felonies because few courts, if any, had limited felony murder to common law predicate felonies, and this Court was \u201cnot persuaded to adopt\u201d such a limitation. Id. at 253-54, 786 A.2d at 727. This Court held that a felony could serve as a predicate for second-degree felony murder if: (1) the felony was inherently dangerous to human life; or (2) under a particular case\u2019s circumstances, the defendant committed the felony in a manner that was dangerous to human life. See id. at 263, 786 A.2d at 733. Accordingly, this Court concluded that the convictions for second-degree felony murder predicated on child abuse were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>valid. See id. at 263, 786 A.2d at 733. To the extent that this Court overrules Roary, the Court essentially overrules Fisher.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">In Roary, this Court also observed that, in Deese v. State, 367 Md. 293, 296, 786 A.2d 751, 752 (2001), this Court had repeated the principle that second-degree felony murder could be predicated on \u201cany ... inherently dangerous felony [that is] not enumerated in the first[~]degree murder statute[.]\u201d Roary, 385 Md. at 228, 867 A.2d at 1101. This Court issued Deese, 367 Md. 293, 786 A.2d 751, on the same day on which this Court issued Fisher, 367 Md. 218, 786 A.2d 706. In Deese, 367 Md. at 296, 786 A.2d at 752, as in Fisher, 367 Md. at 246-47, 786 A.2d at 723-24, the defendant was convicted of second-degree felony murder predicated on child abuse, and argued on appeal that second-degree felony murder was not cognizable under Maryland law. Citing Fisher, this Court reaffirmed that second-degree felony murder is cognizable under Maryland law. See Deese, 367 Md. at 296, 786 A.2d at 752.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">In Roary, 385 Md. at 230, 867 A.2d at 1102, turning to the issue before it, this Court held: \u201cBased on the standard [that] we enunciated in <em>Fisher </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Deese, </em>first-degree assault is a proper underlying felony to support a second-degree felony-murder conviction.\u201d (Footnote omitted). This Court concluded that first-degree assault not only was inherently dangerous in the abstract, but also was committed in a dangerous way under the circumstances of Roary. See Roary, 385 Md. at 230, 867 A.2d at 1102 (\u201c[F]irst-degree assault is dangerous to human life. The nature of the crime ..., ... which \u2018creates a substantial risk of death,\u2019 is undoubtedly dangerous to human life. Furthermore, the manner in which the crime was committed in this instance ... is also clearly dangerous to human life.\u201d). Thus, this Court expressly declined to adopt the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine. See id. at 225, 867 A.2d at 1099.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-7\">This Court acknowledged that courts in other States had adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, but noted that \u201cMaryland is unique in that[,]\u201d since colonial times, felony murder has remained a common law crime, as opposed to a statutory one. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Id. at 231-32, 867 A.2d at 1102-03. This Court also observed that, in Maryland, \u201c[t]he harshness of the [felony-murder] rule has been ameliorated by limiting its application to those felonies that are dangerous to human life[,] either because of their inherent nature or by the manner in which the felony is perpetrated[.]\u201d Id. at 231, 867 A.2d at 1103.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">After a review of cases in which courts in other States had adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, we \u201crecognize[d] that our relatively strict adherence to the common law felony-murder doctrine [was] not favored by a number of other States[,] as explained supra; nothing in our case law or research, however, [] persuaded us that the rule in Maryland should be otherwise.\u201d Id. at 236, 867 A.2d at 1106. We concluded that, instead of \u201climit[ing] the scope of the [felony-murder] doctrine\u2019s application to only those underlying felonies that are independent of the resulting death[,]\u201d \u201cthe better policy is for the law to provide an additional deterrent to the perpetration of felonies [that], by their nature or the attendant circumstances, create a foreseeable risk of death.\u201d Id. at 236, 867 A.2d at 1106 (citing Fisher, 367 Md. at 256, 786 A.2d at 728-29). Thus, when deciding Roary, we were aware that courts in other States had adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, but we determined that adopting the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine in Maryland would be at odds with both our precedent and the goal of deterring felonies that are dangerous to human life.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">In addressing the scope of second-degree felony murder in Roary, this Court was not required to interpret a constitutional provision, but instead was required to interpret the common law\u2014which the General Assembly has the power to supersede by statute at any time. See Polakoff v. Turner, 385 Md. 467, 481-82, 869 A.2d 837, 846 (2005) (\u201c[C]ertain statutory enactments may alter the common law.\u201d); see also Julian v. Buonassissi, 414 Md. 641, 677, 997 A.2d 104, 126 (2010) (A statute \u201cis not intended to change the common law absent an express, specific declaration to do so.\u201d (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). It has been twelve years since this Court issued Roary, yet, notably, the General Assembly has not amended CR \u00a7 2-204 (Murder in the Second Degree) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>provide that second-degree felony murder cannot be predicated on first-degree assault. In Pye v. State, 397 Md. 626, 635, 919 A.2d 632, 637 (2007), this Court unequivocally stated: \u201c[Consistent with the [General Assembly]\u2019s awareness of our cases, we have been reluctant to overrule our prior decisions where it is likely that the [General Assembly], by its inaction, indicates its adoption, or at least acceptance, of the interpretation reflected in the opinion[.]\u201d (Citation omitted). Given that the General Assembly has not exercised its authority to supersede Roary by statute, it is especially inappropriate for the Majority to overrule Roary here.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Judge Cathy Cochran of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, made a cogent point in Lawson v. State, 64 S.W.3d 396, 396-97, 400-01 (Tex. Crim. App. 2001) (Cochran, J., concurring), in which Judge Cochran agreed with the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas that an assault may serve as a predicate for felony murder. In a concurring opinion, joined by three other judges, Judge Cochran explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b757-6\">The concern [behind the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine] was that every aggravated assault that resulted in a death would then be subject to prosecution as a murder. True enough, if the actor commits an act clearly dangerous to human life which causes the person\u2019s death. That is precisely the rationale of the felony murder rule. But unlike involuntary manslaughter, not every aggravated assault results in death. If manslaughter could constitute the underlying felony in a felony murder, then every single manslaughter case would be automatically upped to felony murder. The offense of manslaughter itself would be obviated. That is neither logical nor legal. But not every instance of aggravated assault, injury to a child, criminal mischief, etc. ends in death. Not every instance of these offenses is the result of an act that is clearly dangerous to human life. Not every instance of these offenses would automatically be upped to felony murder. Use of these offenses as the basis of a felony murder prosecution do not pose the same logical and legal problem of merger that involuntary manslaughter has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>always been recognized, both at common law and in felony murder statutes, as posing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Id. at 400-01 (Cochran, J., concurring) (emphasis added) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b758-7\">Echoing the concern that was discussed in Lawson, 64 S.W.Bd at 400 (Cochran, J., concurring), here, the Majority is concerned with the idea that, under Roary, potentially every first-degree assault that results in the victim\u2019s death would be a felony murder, and, according to the Majority, this is not a desirable outcome. See Maj. Op. at 729-30, 155 A.3d at 520-21. In Roary, 385 Md. at 236, 867 A.2d at 1106, however, this Court made a deliberate policy decision to recognize second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault to deter violent assaults that result in death. Nothing in Maryland has changed with respect to violent assaults in the twelve years since Roary except, perhaps, that such assaults occur more frequently, and that, with a new constituency of the Court, the Majority holds differently on the question of whether to recognize second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault as a valid offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-8\">Interestingly, although conceding that Roary was not clearly wrong and contrary to established principles, Jones contends that Roary has been superseded by significant changes in the law or facts because applying Roary to deaths by shooting would remove the distinction between felony murder and specific-intent murder. As we explained in Michelle L. Conover v. Brittany D. Conover, 450 Md. 51, 66 <em>&amp; </em>n.10, 146 A.3d 433, 442 &amp; n.10 (2016), the principle that an appellate court may overrule precedent that \u201chas been superseded by significant changes in the law or facts\u201d is synonymous with the principle that an appellate court may overrule precedent that \u201chas been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving events.\u201d (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In his supplemental brief, Jones essentially contended that Roary is archaic, but was not clearly wrong and contrary to established principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>At oral argument, however, in response to questions about whether his position was that Roary was clearly wrong or that Roary was archaic, Jones\u2019s counsel repeated his concession that Roary had been not decided incorrectly. Jones\u2019s counsel argued that, although Roary was not wrong in that it was contrary to another law, Roary has a \u201cfundamental flaw\u201d in that it allows \u201cevery murder to be a felony murder.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Jones\u2019s counsel theorized that this Court should overrule Roary because the case is \u201cnot practical.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">Jones\u2019s counsel\u2019s request to overrule Roary because it is not \u201cpractical\u201d is unfounded in law. In several cases, this Court has repeated the well-established principle that, under the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>we may overrule our precedent only if at least one of the following circumstances exists: (1) our precedent is clearly wrong and contrary to established principles; or (2) our precedent has been rendered archaic and inapplicable to modern society through the passage of time and evolving <em>events\u2014ie., </em>our precedent has been superseded by significant changes in the law or the facts. See Thompson, 443 Md. at 58 <em>&amp; </em>n.5, 115 A.3d at 131 <em>&amp; </em>n.5; Waine, 444 Md. at 700, 122 A.3d at 299; Conover, 450 Md. at 66 <em>&amp; </em>n.10, 146 A.3d at 442 &amp; n.10; DRD Pool Serv., Inc. v. Freed, 416 Md. 46, 64, 5 A.3d 45, 55-56 (2010). It is simply not the law that we may overrule our precedent on the ground that we believe our precedent not to be \u201cpractical.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>To the extent that Jones argues that Roary is archaic, nothing could be further from the truth. Roary\u2019s specific purpose was to deter violent assaults that result in death. Today\u2014twelve years after this Court issued Roary in 2005\u2014 deterring violent assaults that result in death is more important than ever. According to the Baltimore Sun, in 2015, Baltimore had more homicides per capita than ever before. In 2016, Annapolis, our State\u2019s capital, had more homicides than ever before.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Far from archaic, Roary is more beneficial to the public interest than ever before\u2014yet, the Majority elects to overrule Roary and strip the State of an important tool in prosecuting homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">Indeed, the Majority essentially adopts the dissenting opinion in Roary\u2014of which the majority of this Court in Roary was necessarily aware, and declined to follow. The Majority does not rely on any changed societal circumstance in support of the Majority\u2019s decision to overrule Roary, nor does the majority establish that the holding in Roary was clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">Respectfully, a review of the majority opinion demonstrates that it is simply a rewrite of the dissenting opinion in Roary. In their respective discussions of the subject of the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine, both the majority opinion and the Roary dissent discuss People v. Moran, 246 N.Y. 100, 158 N.E. 35, 36 (1927), People v. Ireland, 70 Cal.2d 522, 75 Cal.Rptr. 188, 450 P.2d 580, 582-83, 590 (1969) (en banc), State v. Fisher, 120 Kan. 226, 243 P. 291, 293 (1926), State v. Branch, 244 Or. 97, 415 P.2d 766, 767 (1966) (en banc), Garrett v. State, 573 S.W.2d 543, 545 (Tex. Crim. App. 1978), and Robert L. Simpson, Annotation, Application of Felony-Murder Doctrine Where The Felony Relied Upon Is an Includible Offense with the Homicide, 40 A.L.R.3d 1341 (2004). See Maj. Op. at 700-04, 155 A.3d at 503-05; Roary, 385 Md. at 251-53, 867 A.2d at 1114-16 (Raker, J., dissenting). Thus, the majority opinion is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>not based on any new authorities or developments in the law that would lead to a determination that Roary was clearly wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The Majority cites the Roary dissent after the sentence: \u201cHence, we overrule [Roary] before that case creates more undesirable consequences for the criminal law in Maryland, as pointed out in the dissent.\u201d Maj. Op. at 706, 155 A.3d at 507. Both the Majority and the Roary dissent state that most other jurisdictions to consider the issue have adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine. See Maj. Op. at 706-07, 155 A.3d at 507-08; Roary, 385 Md. at 253, 867 A.2d at 1115. Both the Majority and the Roary dissent assert that Roary constitutes an improper extension of the felony-murder doctrine. See Maj. Op. at 706-08, 155 A.3d at 507-08; Roary, 385 Md. at 250, 867 A.2d at 1114. Thus, the rationale used by the Majority to overrule Roary was known by this Court at the time it issued Roary, but the Court declined to follow the dissent\u2019s view.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The Majority reasons that Roary was \u201ccontrary to our own jurisprudence which has stated often that the felony-murder rule should not be expanded.\u201d Maj. Op. at 706, 155 A.3d at 507. After this sentence, the Majority cites Campbell v. State, 293 Md. 438, 451, 444 A.2d 1034, 1042 (1982), in which this Court stated: \u201cWe are persuaded that the felony-murder doctrine should not be extended beyond its traditional common law limitation.\u201d As the Majority notes, in Campbell, id. at 451, 444 A.2d at 1042, this Court made this statement in the context of holding that the felony-murder doctrine does not apply where a defendant commits a lethal act that is neither a felony nor \u201cin furtherance of a common design.\u201d (Footnote omitted). Campbell does not stand for the proposition that it was improper for this Court to hold in Roary that assault can serve as a predicate for felony murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">The Majority approvingly cites, and quotes a length, a 2006 Maryland Law Review Article that was critical of Roary. See Maj. Op. at 706-08, 155 A.3d at 507-08 (quoting Marcia J. Simon, Note, An Inappropriate and Unnecessary Expansion of Felony Murder in Maryland, 65 Md. L. Rev. 992-93 (2006)). At that time, the law review article\u2019s author was a law student. In any event, it is not a basis for overruling a case that someone, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>perhaps even another judge, expresses disagreement with the case\u2019s outcome. Otherwise, anytime an opinion of this Court were criticized, it would be subject to being overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">At oral argument, Jones\u2019s counsel asserted: \u201cNothing is lost if Roary is overruled. The other theories of second-degree murder already cover what Roary proscribes.\u201d This argument is circular\u2014and, indeed, meaningless\u2014because it is premised on the assumption that Jones is correct about the ultimate issue before the Court\u2014whether second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault are the same offense. If, in fact, second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault are different offenses\u2014and they are, because, as discussed below, our precedent establishes that \u201csubstantial risk of death\u201d is not synonymous with death being \u201cthe likely result\u201d\u2014then the State is losing the ability to prosecute defendants for deaths that arise from conduct that does not rise to the level of second-degree specific-intent murder. For example, a defendant may use a knife to stab a victim in the toe, and the victim may bleed to death as a result of the wound. Under such circumstances, it could be argued that the defendant did not commit second-degree specific-intent murder because: (1) the defendant did not intend to kill the victim; and (2) death is not \u201cthe likely result\u201d of stabbing someone in the toe, which does not contain a vital organ. Certainly, however, the defendant committed second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, as the defendant created a substantial and foreseeable\u2014but not necessarily likely or very probable\u2014risk of death. Thus, contrary to Jones\u2019s assertion, the State does \u201close\u201d the ability to obtain convictions for certain violent assaults resulting in death by virtue of overruling Roary.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">The Majority spends much time discussing cases in which courts in other jurisdictions have adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine. See Maj. Op. at 700-04, 155 A.3d at 503-05. However, when this Court decided Roary, it was aware that \u201cmost [SJtates considering this issue have adopted some version of</p>\n<p id=\"AceF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>the merger rule for first degree assaults resulting in the death of the victim.\u201d Roary, 385 Md. at 253, 867 A.2d at 1115 (Raker, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">The Majority does not mention that there are also States that rejected the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine. For example, in State v. Harris, 69 Wash.2d 928, 421 P.2d 662, 664 (1966) (en banc), the Supreme Court of Washington concluded: \u201cIn light of the distinctions made in our own statutes, we see no reason why we should adopt the ... \u2018merger rule[ J \u201d Later, in State v. Thompson, 88 Wash.2d 13, 558 P.2d 202, 205 (1977) (en banc), the Supreme Court of Washington declined to overrule Harris, observing that the legislature had not superseded Harris in the ten years since the Court issued it. And, in State v. Wanrow, 91 Wash.2d 301, 588 P.2d 1320, 1320-21 (1978) (en banc), the Supreme Court of Washington again declined to overrule Harris, observing that adopting the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine \u201cwould be an unwarranted and insupportable invasion of the legislative function in defining crimes.\u201d Decades after Thompson, 88 Wash.2d 13, 558 P.2d 202, in In re Pers. Restraint of Andress, 147 Wash.2d 602, 56 P.3d 981, 982 (2002), as corrected (Oct. 29, 2002), as amended on denial of reconsideration (Mar. 14, 2003), in a 5-4 decision, in light of an amendment by the State\u2019s legislature to the second-degree felony murder statute, the Supreme Court of Washington adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine and held that assault cannot serve as a predicate for felony murder. It is worth observing that it has been twelve years since this Court issued Roary, and the General Assembly has not superseded it by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-6\">Another case that is apropos here is State v. Trott, 289 A.2d 414, 419 (Me. 1972), in which the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine declined to adopt the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine. The Court acknowledged that it had \u201cfound favor in some jurisdictions[,]\u201d but observed that the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine had \u201cnever been adopted or even considered in\u201d Maine. Id. Ultimately, the Court \u201cdecline[d] to consider such an abrupt departure from our prior decisional law[.]\u201d Id. (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b764-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>In Johnson v. State, 4 S.W.3d 254, 258 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999), the Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas decided against adopting a general \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine; adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine only to the extent that manslaughter could not serve as a predicate for felony murder; and concluded that assault may serve as a predicate for felony murder. Later, in Lawson, 64 S.W.3d at 401 (Cochran, J., concurring), Judge Cochran explained that allowing assault to serve as a predicate for felony murder does \u201cnot pose the same logical and legal problem of merger that involuntary manslaughter has always been recognized, both at common law and in felony murder statutes, as posing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">That other States may or may not have adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine is not a basis for overruling Roary. This Court was aware that there were other States that had adopted the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine when it decided Roary. Simply put, as Jones has conceded, Roary is not clearly wrong. In refusing to adopt the \u201cmerger\u201d doctrine in Roary, far from making a clearly wrong decision, this Court made a well-grounded decision about the law concerning felony murder in Maryland, and nothing has changed in the last twelve years to undermine the soundness of that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Merits</p>\n<p id=\"b764-7\">Having discussed the lack of any basis to overrule Roary, I will address the issue that this Court was asked to decide: whether, where a jury acquits a defendant of second-degree specific-intent murder and hangs on first-degree felony murder, and the trial court declares a mistrial as to first-degree felony murder, the prohibition on double jeopardy bars the State from prosecuting the defendant for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. Faced with this issue, I would conclude that the State may prosecute Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault. Specifically, I would conclude that second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury does not have all of the same elements as second-degree specific-intent murder, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not have all of the same elements as second-degree specific-intent murder, as the former has the unique element of use of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">Required Evidence Test: Second-Degree Specific-Intent Murder and Second-Degree Felony Murder Predicated on First-Degree Assault</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">In Abeokuto v.

State, 397 Md. 704, 919 A.2d 678 (2007), leads to the conclusion that the two forms of murder share only one element: that the defendant\u2014 or, as to second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, the defendant or a co-participant\u2014caused the victim\u2019s death. The mental state that is required for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury is subsumed by second-degree specific-intent murder\u2019s unique element of intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result. In short, second-degree specific-intent murder has all of the elements of first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, plus a unique element: intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result. Accordingly, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury is a lesser-included offense of second-degree specific-intent murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Although the elements of one offense are included in the other, the intent elements of second-degree specific-intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury are different. Second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury requires merely that the defendant \u201cintentionally caused serious physical injury[,]\u201d which is \u201cinjury that creates a substantial and foreseeable risk of death.\u201d MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2(A). By contrast, second-degree specific-intent murder requires that the defendant have \u201cthe intent to kill or [ ] the intent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result.\u201d MPJI-Cr 4:17(B). It is possible for a defendant to have an intent to cause injury that creates a substantial and foreseeable risk of death without having an intent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-5\">I disagree with the position of Jones and the Court of Special Appeals, see Jones, 222 Md.App. at 618, 114 A.3d at 266, that \u201cintent to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result\u201d is the equivalent of \u201cintent to cause injury that creates a substantial and foreseeable risk of death.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Contrary to the interpretation of Jones and the Court of Special Appeals, \u201csubstantial risk of death\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cdeath would be the likely result.\u201d \u201cLikely\u201d means <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>\u201chaving a high probability of occurring!!,]\u201d or \u201cvery probable!!.]\u201d Likely, Merriam-Webster, http;//www.merriamwebster. com/dictionary/ likely [https://perma.ee/A7EQ-4AJV].

In other words, the defendant intends to cause a serious, but non-life-threatening, injury to the victim. Accordingly, the defendant uses a knife to stab the victim in the toe. The victim bleeds to death as a result of the wound. Under such circumstances, it could be argued that the defendant did not commit second-degree specific-intent murder because: (1) the defendant did not intend to kill the victim; and (2) death is not \u201cthe likely result\u201d of stabbing someone in the toe, which does not contain a vital organ. Certainly, however, the defendant committed second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury, as the defendant created a substantial and foreseeable\u2014but not necessarily likely or very probable\u2014risk of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">This conclusion is compelled by Thornton, 397 Md. at 709-10, 919 A.2d at 680-81, in which this Court held that a trial court erred at a bench trial at which second-degree specific-intent murder was at issue by presuming as a matter of law\u2014 as opposed to merely inferring\u2014that, because a defendant thrust a knife into a victim, the defendant intended to inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result. In Thornton, id. at 720, 919 A.2d at 687, the defendant contended that the trial court erred by \u201cequating intent to do [serious] bodily harm (second-degree [specific-intent] murder) with intent to do serious physical injury (first-degree as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>sault)[.]\u201d This Court agreed with the defendant\u2019s premise that \u201c[t]he requisite mental state for [second-degree specific-intent murder] is distinct from the requisite mental state for [first-degree] assault[.]\u201d Id. at 728, 919 A.2d at 692. This Court explained the difference between the two mental states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201c[S]erious physical injury\u201d means injury [that] \u201c[c]reates a substantial risk of death.\u201d \u201cSerious physical injury\u201d constitutes a broad statutory concept that[,] by definition^] covers physical injury that may or may not cause a victim\u2019s death. This differs from [second-degree] murder, and not only in the ultimate result where the victim dies. A person is guilty of [second-degree] murder <em>only </em>if he or she has the requisite intent (and malice) to cause such severe harm that death would be <em>the </em>likely result, not merely a possible result.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">Id. at 730, 919 A.2d at 693 (bolding added) (italics and third alteration in original). In Thornton, id. at 730, 919 A,2d at 693, this Court illustrated the difference between the two mental states with the following hypothetical, which is similar to the above hypothetical that involves a knife: \u201c[A defendant] directs a knife at the victim\u2019s finger, intending to inflict serious bodily harm[;] the finger is severed[;] and, unknown to the [defendant], the victim is a hemophiliac,[<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>] and bleeds to death[.]\u201d (Citation omitted). This Court indicated that, under such circumstances, the defendant commits second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault, but not necessarily second-degree specific-intent murder.

By contrast, \u201cusing a deadly weapon directed at a vital part of the body may give rise to an inference of an intent to commit [serious] bodily [harm] or an intent to kill[,]\u201d and thus lead to a conviction for second-degree specific-intent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>murder.

The Court of Special Appeals determined that second-degree specific-intent murder is a lesser-included offense of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm. See Jones, 222 Md.App. at 619, 114 A.3d at 266 (\u201c[S]econd-degree felony murder [predicated on first-degree assault ... require[s] proof of an additional element, that is, that the defendant committed or attempted to commit ... first-degree assault, either by causing or attempting to cause serious physical injury to another or by commit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>ting an assault with a firearm.\u201d). In its brief, the State contends that \u201csecond-degree felony murder [predicated on first-degree assault [with a] firearm [] should not demand foreseeability of death as an additional element beyond the very use of the\u201d firearm. The State argues that, \u201c[i]f a felony is inherently dangerous ..., what the defendant did or did not subjectively foresee is irrelevant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">At trial, the circuit court instructed the jury on both forms of first-degree assault: the \u201cintent to cause serious physical injury\u201d form and the \u201cfirearm\u201d form. Without specifying the form of first-degree assault, the prosecutor announced the State\u2019s intent to prosecute Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">With respect to first-degree assault with a firearm, the Majority concludes only that \u201c[flirst-degree assault, either intent to inflict serious physical injury or assault with a firearm, cannot, as a matter of law, serve as the underlying felony to support felony murder.\u201d Maj. Op. at 708, 155 A.3d at 508. The Majority makes no distinction between first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury and first-degree assault with a firearm. This is wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">Addressing the elements of felony murder, MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2(B) provides, as to second-degree felony murder predicated on the \u201cinherently dangerous manner in which [the] felony was perpetrated\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">[T]o convict the defendant of second[-]degree felony murder, the State must prove: (1) that [[the defendant] [another participating in the crime with the defendant]] [[committed] [attempted to commit]] (identify the crime), a felony; (2) that the way in which (identify the crime) was committed or attempted, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death; (3) that[,] as a result of the way in which (identify the crime) was committed or attempted, (name) was killed; and (4) that the act resulting in the death of (name) occurred during the [commission] [attempt<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>ed commission] [escape from the immediate scene] of the (identify the crime).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">(Some brackets in original) (paragraph breaks and underlining omitted). The \u201cNotes on Use\u201d accompanying MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2 state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-6\">Use Part A of this instruction if the defendant is charged with second[ ]degree felony murder and the predicate felony is first[-]degree assault under [CR] \u00a7 3\u2014202(a)(1)[, <em>ie., </em>first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-7\">Use Part B of this instruction if the defendant is charged with second[ ]degree felony murder and the predicate felony is one that is inherently dangerous to human life because of the way in which it was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">In other words, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm, although not covered by MPJI-Cr 4:17.7,2(A), is covered by MPJI-Cr 4:17.7.2(B), as the Court of Special Appeals recognized. The Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction on first-degree assault states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-9\">[T]o convict the defendant of first[-]degree assault, the State must prove all of the elements of second[-]degree assault[,] and also must prove that: (1) the defendant used a firearm to commit assault; or (2) the defendant intended to cause serious physical injury in the commission of the assault.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-10\">MPJI-Cr 4:01.1 (paragraph breaks omitted). In turn, the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instruction on the battery form of second-degree assault states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-11\">[T]o convict the defendant of [the battery form of second-degree] assault, the State must prove: (1) that the defendant caused [offensive physical contact with] [physical harm to] (name); (2) that the contact was the result of an intentional or reckless act of the defendant and was not accidental; and (3) that the contact was [not consented to by (name) ] [not legally justified].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b772-12\">MPJI-Cr 4:01(C) (some brackets in original) (paragraph breaks and underlining omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>Synthesizing the relevant parts of the Maryland Criminal Pattern Jury Instructions on second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm <em>(ie., </em>second-degree felony murder predicated on a felony that was perpetrated in an inherently dangerous manner), first-degree assault, and the battery form of second-degree assault reveals that the elements of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm are as follows. To convict the defendant of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm, the State must prove that: (1) the defendant committed a first-degree assault with a firearm; (2) the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death; (3) the defendant killed the victim; and (4) the act that resulted in the victim\u2019s death occurred during the first-degree assault with a firearm. To convict the defendant of first-degree assault with a firearm, the State must prove that: (1) the defendant used a firearm to cause physical harm to the victim; (2) the physical harm was the result of an intentional or reckless act of the defendant and was not accidental; and (3) the physical harm was not consented to by the victim or legally justified.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">As the Court of Special Appeals did, I would determine that the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed in this case, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death. Indeed, as the Court of Special Appeals concluded: \u201c[A] first-degree assault is committed in a manner that is \u2018dangerous to life\u2019 and \u2018made death a foreseeable consequence\u2019 when it is committed by using a firearm to shoot the victim multiple times, including twice in the head.\u201d Jones, 222 Md.App. at 616, 114 A.3d at 265 (citations omitted). Nonetheless, that is not the end of the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">Comparing the elements of second-degree specific-intent murder to the elements of second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm yields the unavoid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>able determination that second-degree specific-intent murder has the unique element of intent to kill or inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result, and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm has the unique element of use of a firearm. And, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not have the same intent element as second-degree specific-intent murder, as second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not require that the defendant intend to cause a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death, but rather requires that the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances, created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death or of serious physical injury likely to result in death.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">In other words, the reasonable foreseeable risk of death is an element that depends on the way in which the first-degree assault with a firearm was committed, under all of the circumstances; the defendant need not have intended to create a reasonable foreseeable risk of death, or, as is required for second-degree specific-intent murder, intended \u201cto kill or ... inflict such serious bodily harm that death would be the likely result[.]\u201d MPJI-Cr 4:17(B). Second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm, while encompassing the element that the use of the firearm created a reasonably foreseeable risk of death, does not require that the defendant have had the requisite intent for second-degree specific-intent murder, and includes the unique element that the offense be committed with a firearm. Thus, second-degree specific-intent murder and second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm do not have the same elements and are not the same offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Double Jeopardy</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">I would conclude that, if a jury acquits a defendant of second-degree specific-intent murder and hangs on first-degree felony murder, the Double Jeopardy Clause does not bar the State from prosecuting the defendant for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>In sum, the State prosecuting Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury does not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because that form of murder is a lesser-included offense of second-degree specific-intent murder; in other words, here, the jury acquitted on a greater-inclusive offense (namely, second-degree specific-intent murder) and hung on a lesser-included offense (namely, second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with the intent to cause serious physical injury). And, the State prosecuting Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault with a firearm does not implicate the Double Jeopardy Clause because its elements are not the same as those of second-degree specific intent murder. For the reasons above, I would conclude that the State may prosecute Jones for second-degree felony murder predicated on first-degree assault.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-4\">For the above reasons, respectfully, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Judge Greene and Judge Battaglia have authorized me to state that they join in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b740-8\">. The instant appeal cannot be based on the two exceptions to the final judgment rule other than the collateral-order doctrine.
