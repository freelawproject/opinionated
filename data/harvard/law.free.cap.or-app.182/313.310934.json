ORS 475.992. He assigns error to the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress evidence of methamphetamine found in a cellular telephone case in defendant\u2019s possession where police opened the case under the purported authority of an inventory ordinance and police department policy. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">While on patrol in February 1998 in Bend, Officer Hayes recognized a car as one associated with armed suspects in a drug investigation. Hayes stopped the car after observing an equipment violation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She approached the driver and asked for identification. As Hayes received the identification, she recognized defendant in the passenger seat. A third person was in the back seat. Officers Carney and Stone saw Hayes stop the car, and they pulled in behind her. Because of the reports of weapons, the officers ordered the occupants out of the car while Hayes checked their identifications. After discovering that none of the occupants in the vehicle had a valid driver\u2019s license and that the vehicle was uninsured, the officers impounded the vehicle and called for a tow.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Bend Police Department policy (BPD policy), implementing a city ordinance, requires officers to conduct an inventory of the contents of an impounded vehicle. As they waited for the tow, the officers began the inventory. A black leather case with a Motorola insignia was among the items they found. Hayes removed and examined the contents of the case, including a plastic bag containing what proved to be methamphetamine that she found tucked inside the case. The case also contained a charging cord and a handset base for the phone.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Defendant'was arrested and charged with possession of a controlled substance. He moved to suppress the evidence found in the cell phone case, arguing that its discovery resulted from a warrantless search that was impermissible under Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. At the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>hearing on defendant\u2019s motion, Hayes testified about the discovery of the case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-4\">\u201c[HAYES]: [Officer Stone] pulled out from the floor a black Motorola cell phone bag.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">\u201cQ: And is this it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-8\">\u201cQ: And do you recall how tightly shut it was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201cA: I don\u2019t recall exactly how tightly shut it was, but the lid was closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-10\">\u201cQ: But you could see in from both ends?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-12\">* * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-13\">\u201cQ: When the cell phone was pulled out from underneath the seat like that what happened?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-14\">\u201cA: It was opened. The case was opened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-15\">\u201cQ: Why was it opened? The flap was opened. I mean it\u2019s kind of an open container it\u2019s not closed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-16\">\u201cA: I opened the flap, and we took the handset off of the phone to check for a serial number to run it to make sure it was not a stolen phone.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-17\">\u201cQ: Okay. Did you also check that phone to make sure that it was in fact a phone?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-18\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-19\">\u201cQ: Now according to the policy and procedures that you do when you are doing an inventory search, what are you supposed to be checking for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-20\">\u201cA: Items of value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-21\">\u201cQ: Is a cell phone an item of value?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-22\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-23\">\u201cQ: And what are you supposed to do when you find an item of value?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-24\">\u201cA: Oftentimes we will either give it to the owner, or we will place it in our evidence or property room for safe keeping.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>The Bend inventory ordinance and the BPD policy were then received in evidence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hayes testified that she had followed the ordinance and the BPD policy with respect to removing and examining the contents of the phone case. On cross-examination, defendant\u2019s attorney focused on the status of the phone case when Hayes began examining it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-4\">\u201cQ: When you first got the case, it was closed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">\u201cA: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">\u201cQ: It was dark?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cA: It was over.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-8\">\u201cQ: It was closed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-9\"><em>\u201cA: </em>Um hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">\u201cQ: Did you flash * * * your flashlight into the sides, these open sides [the prosecutor] referred to?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-11\">\u201cA: We had our flashlights. I don\u2019t know that we specifically looked inside the ends before opening it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motion to suppress in a written order that included the following determinations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-13\">\u201cThe cellular phone bag was found pursuant to a lawful inventory search pursuant to the impound of [defendant\u2019s] vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>\u201cThe cellular phone bag was not closed at the time that it was observed by [Hayes].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">Defendant waived a jury and was convicted in a trial to the court. The court imposed a probationary sentence, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">Defendant contends that the trial court erred in determining that the cell phone case was not a closed container at the time it was observed by Hayes. He argues that the officer opened the case and examined its contents in contravention of the BPD policy and the city ordinance and, accordingly, that the police conducted a warrantless search in violation of Article I, section 9, of the Oregon Constitution. Defendant also contends that the inventory was unlawful because, while conducting it, Hayes also was looking for evidence of criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">\u201c[E]xcept in a few carefully defined classes of cases, a search of private property without valid consent is unreasonable unless it has been authorized by a valid search warrant.\u201d <em>State v. Atkinson, </em>298 Or 1, 4, 688 P2d 832 (1984) (internal citations, quotation marks omitted). One of those exceptions is an inventory of a lawfully impounded vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 4-5.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-7\">\u201cWhen governmental authorities have lawful \u2018administrative\u2019 custody of personal property, then they may take a series of reasonable steps which, depending upon the purpose of the custody, can include a detailed \u2018inventory\u2019 of the property\u2019s contents. In such a context, there is no \u2018search\u2019 for predictable \u2018things to be seized\u2019 that could be \u2018particularly described\u2019 as the warrant requirement of Article I, section 9, contemplates <em>.\"Id. </em>at 8.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-8\">In this case, the state has the burden of proving the lawfulness of the inventory. ORS 133.693(4). <em>State v. Marsh, </em>78 Or App 290, 293, 716 P2d 261, <em>rev den </em>301 Or 320 (1986). In determining the validity of a purported inventory of a vehicle impounded by police, \u201cthe first step is to determine the source of the authority for custody.\u201d <em>Atkinson, </em>298 Or at 9. For example, politically accountable officials may enact an ordinance that authorizes the inventory. <em>Id. </em>at 6. Second, the officer conducting the inventory cannot deviate from the procedures established in the inventory policy. <em>Id. </em>at 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>The state implicitly concedes that, if the cell phone case was a closed container, the officer opened it in violation of the ordinance and the BPD policy. Those sources of authority only permit, respectively, the opening of closed containers that obviously contain \u201chazardous material\u201d or whose \u201cpackaging announces the contents as contraband.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The state does not contend that either provision authorized the officer to open defendant\u2019s cell phone case if it was a closed container.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant, in turn, does not contend that the ordinance and policy did not authorize the officer to remove and examine the contents of the case if it was not a closed container.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">The parties\u2019 disagreement thus ultimately centers on two issues: (1) whether the trial court properly determined that the cell phone case was not closed before Hayes removed its contents and observed the methamphetamine; and (2) whether, in any event, the officer\u2019s belief that she might find evidence of a crime impermissibly tainted the inventory.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The resolution of the first issue depends primarily on what the drafters of the inventory ordinance intended by the term \u201cclosed\u201d container. The ordinance does not define the term. In construing the ordinance, we give undefined words their plain, natural and ordinary meaning. <em>See Lincoln Loan Co. v. City of Portland, </em>317 Or 192, 199, 855 P2d 151 (1993) (\u201cThe same rules that govern the construction of statutes apply to the construction of municipal ordinances.\u201d); <em>see also PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 611, 859 P2d 1143 (1993) (describing statutory construction methodology). \u201cClosed\u201d ordinarily refers to a container that is \u201cstructurally enclosed\u201d or \u201ccovered over.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary, </em>426 (unabridged ed 1993). That definition appears to exclude containers such as the phone case at issue here, because it is undisputed that it had openings on both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>sides, so that the officers could see in from both ends. That evidence establishes that the case was not \u201cstructurally enclosed\u201d or \u201ccovered over\u201d when found by the police and, therefore, was not closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">In arguing that the trial court erred in making that determination, defendant cites several cases in which this court regarded various objects as closed containers. <em>See, e.g., State v. May, </em>162 Or App 317, 322, 986 P2d 608 (1999), <em>rev den </em>330 Or 375 (2000) (cloth wrapped object); <em>State v. Jones, </em>158 Or App 118, 972 P2d 1217, <em>rev den </em>329 Or 287 (1999) (folded tissue); <em>State v. Myers, </em>156 Or App 561, 967 P2d 887 (1998) (folded brown paper). However, in each case the containers did not have openings that potentially exposed <em>any </em>of their contents to view. Defendant cites no authority for the proposition that \u201cclosed container\u201d is a legal term of art that generally is understood to encompass containers that are partially unenclosed so that some \u2014 but not necessarily all\u2014 of the contents are exposed to view when first encountered by police. Because there is no basis to infer that the promulgators of the ordinance and BPD policy had such a definition in mind in using the term \u201cclosed container,\u201d the trial court did not err in determining that the cell phone case was not closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Nothing we have said should be taken to suggest that the police lawfully may be authorized, by an inventory ordinance or policy, to rifle through all of the contents of any container <em>simply because its lid may be open. See Atkinson, </em>298 Or at 10 (holding that the degree to which inventorying officers may scrutinize items is constitutionally limited). However, as noted, defendant does not contend that the ordinance and policy did not lawfully authorize the removal and examination of the contents of the cell phone case if it was not a closed container. Nor does defendant assert that the scope of intrusion authorized by the ordinance and policy exceeded constitutionally permissible bounds. Accordingly, we do not consider those issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">We turn to defendant\u2019s argument that the officers could not remove and examine the contents of the cell phone case because they had an investigative purpose. That argument is refuted by <em>Atkinson. </em>There, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b359-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>\u201cIf initial impoundment is valid under the rules stated in the text of this opinion, and if an inventory is conducted pursuant to and consistent with a properly authorized administrative program, that is, the inventory would be conducted in any event, <em>the fact that the officer also looks for evidence of criminal activity would not invalidate the inventory..\u201d </em>298 Or at 11 n 7 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">An inventory, if lawfully conducted, does not violate its fundamental purpose of safeguarding property merely because the police believe that evidence of a crime might come to light in the process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-8\"> Defendant does not challenge the propriety of the stop.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b355-14\"> Bend Ordinance No. NS-1621 authorizes inventories \u201cto identify ownership [ ] and safeguard property.\u201d Section 2(3) of that ordinance provides that \u201c[c]losed containers shall not be searched unless it is obvious that a hazardous material is present.\u201d The BPD policy also includes a section entitled \u201cInventory of Vehicle Contents,\u201d which provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AcA\">\u201c46.5.2 All vehicles seized as evidence, impounded or recovered stolen will be inventoried and all articles not of evidentiary value but of appreciable value (and not installed in the vehicle) shall be taken into custody for safekeeping. All other items will be left with the vehicle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajf\">\u00ab\u2021 sf: <em>ij: </em>sK</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A9i\">\u201c46.5.3 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"a5z-dedup-0\">sj:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ag-dedup-0\">\u201c3. Containers found in vehicles will not be opened during an inventory search. However, if the packaging announces the contents as contraband, seize the container and proceed in accordance with current Oregon law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b357-7\"> The parties do not discuss the apparent inconsistency between the ordinance and the policy. Because it is not material to our analysis, we do not consider it further.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b357-8\"> Nor has the state argued, at trial or on appeal, that the case was not a closed container under the line of cases involving structurally enclosed containers that appear \u201cobjectively to be intended or designed primarily to store valuables in the same manner as a wallet or purse.\u201d <em>See, e.g., State v. Rutledge, </em>162 Or App 301, 305-08, 986 P2d 99 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
