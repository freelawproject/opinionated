The taxpayer, State Bank of Albany, contended in the court below that interest on student loans paid to it by the New York Higher Education Assistance Corporation was exempt from income taxation as \u201cinterest on * * * the obligations of a State * * * or any political subdivision\u201d under Section 103(a) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 103 (a) (1) (1964). The district court, in an opinion reported at 276 F.Supp. 744 (N.D.N.Y.1967), held that the interest was not exempt from taxation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-26\">The facts, which have been stipulated, may be briefly stated. The New York Higher Education Assistance Corporation was created by statute in order to improve the educational opportunities of New York State residents by assisting them to meet the expenses of education. N.Y.Education Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 16, \u00a7\u00a7 650, 651. The Corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>tion is authorized to guarantee student loans, to pay the interest on such loans \u201con behalf\u201d of the student while he is in college, and to pay so much of the interest as is in excess of three per cent per annum thereafter. N.Y.Educ.L. \u00a7\u00a7 653 (1), 653-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">The State Bank of Albany made a number of loans to students which were guaranteed by the Corporation and upon which the Corporation paid a portion of the interest as provided by the statute. In 1962, the tax year in question, the Bank reported interest received from the Corporation as taxable income. Subsequently, a timely claim for refund was filed. Refund having been refused, the Bank brought this suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">The difficulty with the Bank\u2019s position is that the obligation to pay the principal of the loans is not the obligation of the State or a political subdivision thereof; it is the obligation of the students. Therefore the interest on the loans does not constitute \u201cinterest on * * * the obligations of a State * * * or political subdivision\u201d within the meaning of Section 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
