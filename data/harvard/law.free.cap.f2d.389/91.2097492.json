We affirm. Briefly, we note the following undisputed facts:</p>\n<p id=\"b146-18\">W. E. Thompson, Jr., his mother and sister entered into a partnership agreement for the operation of the Thompson Banking Company which provided Thompson was to \u201cconduct, manage and operate\u201d the bank. The other two partners were \u201cpartners in name only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b146-19\">In addition to managing the bank, Thompson owned and operated a general insurance agency in the same town. One of the companies represented by the agency was appellee, Hartford.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-20\">It is undisputed that in August, 1962, Thompson began misappropriating bank funds and continued doing so until February, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-21\">On October 2, 1963, Thompson, as Cashier of the bank, applied through his own insurance agency to Hartford for the Banker\u2019s Blanket Bond now in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-22\">Being Fne-bound in this diversity case and thus applying the law of Georgia, the District Court, after carefully analyzing the undisputed facts and applicable law, found that there was fraud in the application for the bond, attributable to the Banking Company, rendering it void <em>ab </em>initio.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AWs\">Because we agree with the District Court, and the authorities upon which it relied, in this finding, which is dispositive of this case, we find it unnecessary to pass upon the other issues raised upon appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-24\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b146-27\"> Hartford Accident &amp; Indemnity Co. v.
