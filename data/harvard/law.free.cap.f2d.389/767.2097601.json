The trial court absolved Underwriters who had the excess provision<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assessed liability against Fireman\u2019s Fund who had a pro rata provision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The appeal is grounded upon the claim that the trial court\u2019s conclusions of law are erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-23\">The issue presented is whether both insurance carriers, on a risk, must prorate a loss between them when in the \u201cother insurance\u201d clause one has a pro rata provision and the other an excess provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-24\">The facts are stipulated that both policies were in effect when the loss occurred; both policies covered hull damage of an airplane for approximately the same amount; the insured was the same person who was killed when the damage occurred; the loss sustained was $35,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>To extricate themselves from the category of \u201cfortuitous adversaries\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the parties to this action prorated their liability, reserved all rights, and the insured\u2019s estate was paid $35,000.00. The salvage was disposed of and credited to each of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">Fireman\u2019s Fund contends that its \u201cpro rata\u201d provision is inconsistent with the \u201cexcess\u201d provision contained in the previously issued policy of Underwriters, and that under the Oregon rule they would be irreconcilable and repugnant each as to the other, requiring the liability to be prorated. Oregon Auto. Ins. Co. v. United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company, 195 F.2d 958 (9th Cir. 1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">Underwriters, on the other hand, contends that the majority rule disregards the pro rata clause, makes the pro rata policy the primary insurance, and gives full effect to the excess clause. Citizens Mutual Auto. Ins. Co. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 273 F.2d 189 (6th Cir. 1959); Employers\u2019 Liability Assurance Corp., Ltd. v. Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Group, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 350, 262 F.2d 239 (1958); McFarland v. Chicago Express, Inc., 200 F.2d 5 (7th Cir. 1952); Annot., 76 A.L.R.2d 502 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-6\">The trial court adopted Underwriters\u2019 view of the law and grounded its conclusion on St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co. v. Underwriters at Lloyds of London, 365 F.2d 659 (10th Cir. 1966). It is agreed that Oklahoma courts have yet to speak on the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We agree with the trial court\u2019s conclusion that under the St. Paul Mercury case, supra, each company is bound by the language of its policy and its liability cannot be extended beyond its undertaking. Underwriters, by the words used in its \u201cother insurance\u201d provision, obligated itself to be liable only for excess coverage if there was other insurance covering the loss. Fireman\u2019s Fund accepted the primary responsibility by its words and until the limits of its policy were exhausted, Underwriters did not provide valid and collectible insurance within the pro rata provisions of the Fireman\u2019s Fund Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-15\">. \u201cOther Insurance. 13. This Company shall not be liable for loss if, at the time of loss, there is any other insurance which would attach if this insurance had not been effected, except that this insurance shall apply only as excess and in no event as contributing insurance, and then only after all other insurance has been exhausted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-25\">. \u201cOther Insurance. If the Named Insured has other insurance against a loss covered by Part III of this policy, the Company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b822-8\">.
