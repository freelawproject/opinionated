The District Court found the government liable in the amount of $110,000, and awarded Cohen\u2019s attorneys fees of $15,000, under authority of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2678,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> noting \u201cthat the case was aggressively prepared and presented.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In the judgment of date March 29, 1966, the court characterized the fees as \u201ca first priority lien upon said judgment,\u201d and ordered the $15,000 paid directly to the attorneys, \u201cfree and clear of any and all claims which the Internal Revenue Service, the Treasury Department or the United States of America * * * might have or assert against the plaintiff in this case, * * <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">After its motion-to amend the judgment was overruled, the United States appealed, contending here that it has a right to set-off the full amount of recovery, $110,000, against prior tax assessments, reduced to judgments against Cohen in April of 1965,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> *of $393,469.65. The issue here is thus whether the District Court\u2019s power to award attorneys\u2019 fees under Section 2678 of the Federal Tort Claims Act includes the power to allow recovery of such fees superior to the government\u2019s right to set-off.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-23\"> Congress has, from the earliest days of our government, charged the Treasury Department, and since 1921 the General Accounting Office, with the duty of administratively settling the government\u2019s accounts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under the most recent statute, it is the duty of the Comptroller General to withhold payment of a judgment creditor as an offset against the indebtedness of that creditor to the United States.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He does so not only by statutory authority, but also in \u201cexercise of the common right, which belongs to every creditor, to apply the unappropriated moneys of his debtor, in his hands, in extinguishment of the debts due to him.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Like other cred<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>itors, the United States may assert this right to set-off against parties who are claiming rights derivatively from other parties against whom set-off would unquestionably be proper.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Appellee contends, however, that a District Court\u2019s award of attorneys\u2019 fees under the Federal Tort Claims Act is not by way of a derivative right, but a direct award within the discretion of the court under section 2678 of that Act. This was the view taken by the court below, as it made the award directly to \u25a0the attorneys, \u201cas is done in the case of recovery by a minor,\u201d holding that the Federal Set-Off Act<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> would apply \u201conly if the government has a claim against any attorney receiving the award.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">Section 2678 does give the District Court discretion when, and in what amount to award the recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees. It furthermore allows these fees to be paid directly to the attorney. It does not, however, create any rights in the attorneys, nor does this discretion include the power to award such fees, in effect, as a separate judgment against the United States, in favor of the attorneys, superior to and free of any claims the government might have against the primary judgment creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-15\">Of the many Federal Toft Bills introduced, in almost every session from the 68th to the 79th Congress, all but four contained a provision regarding attorneys\u2019 fees similar, except as to the upper limits of such fees, to section 2678.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The legislative history surrounding these provisions reflects only a congressional concern about attorneys\" collecting enormous fees at the expense of their clients.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We. find nothing in either the wording of section 2678, or the legislative history of that section and its predecessors to suggest that Congress intended to establish rights in favor of attorneys, in particular a lien or priority superior to the government\u2019s right to set-off. Section 2678 was intended to be a limitation upon how much an attorney could receive as a fee in Federal Tort cases, enforced by making , it a crime to receive more than the prescribed amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>This construction of section 2678 leaves Cohen\u2019s attorneys\u2019 right to recover the fee, awarded by the court below out of the tort recovery, derivative of Cohen\u2019s right in the recovery, and hence necessarily subject to the government\u2019s right to set-off against Cohen. This interpretation of the attorneys\u2019 right to recover their fees is consistent with prior holdings of this and other courts that an award of attorneys\u2019 fees in connection with a judgment against the United States, pursuant to the government\u2019s consent to be sued, is derivative only and subject to the government\u2019s right to set-off prior debts of the judgment creditor.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Congress has heretofore treated attorneys\u2019 fees as derivative and hence subordinate to the United States\u2019 right to set-off,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and has freed these derivative rights of the government\u2019s superior claim only by express legislative provisions.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> While valid claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act should be brought to trial, we cannot allow the type of recovery contemplated by the court below without some indication from Congress that its waiver of sovereign immunity includes subordination of the United States\u2019 superior right to set-off a prior debt of the claimant against rights derived from his. Appellee has shown us no such indication.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The order of the District Court denying the Government\u2019s motion to alter or amend the judgment is reversed, and the case remanded, with instructions to amend the judgment in conformity herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\">.
