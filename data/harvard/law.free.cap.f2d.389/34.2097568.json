On April 18, 1967 he was sentenced to six years imprisonment on each count, the sentences to run concurrently. On this appeal, appellant claims that the trial court committed reversible error when it denied his application, made on the threshold of the trial, for a continuance for the purpose of retaining new counsel and when it directed that the trial should go forward with counsel of record without expressly advising appellant of his right to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-25\">At the time, the accused represented to the trial court that his reason for changing lawyers was that he had never had an opportunity to confer with his present counsel about the case. The attorney, however, stated that, contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertions, he had thoroughly discussed the case with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>accused on several occasions and as an officer of the court, he was prepared to represent Clausell at the trial, but that the accused had requested him to stall for time, which he refused to do. Under these circumstances the trial court was justified in concluding that the appellant was trying to engage in \u201cendless delays and maneuvers that * * * only [had] a dilatory purpose,\u201d United States v. Ab-bamonte, 348 F.2d 700, 703 (2 Cir. 1965), and did not commit error by denying the continuance. Compare United States v. Bentvena, 319 F.2d 916, 936 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 375 U.S. 940, 84 S.Ct. 345, 11 L.Ed.2d 271 (1963); United States v. Terranova, 309 F.2d 365, 366 (2 Cir. 1962); United States v. Arlen, 252 F.2d 491, 494 (2 Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Concerning the appellant\u2019s claim that he was not advised of his right to proceed <em>pro se, </em>this court has held that \u201c[r]egardless of whether he [the defendant] has been notified of his right to defend himself, the criminal defendant must make an unequivocal request to act as his own lawyer in order to invoke the right.\u201d United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, 348 F.2d 12, 15 (2 Cir. 1965). As we noted in <em>Abbamonte, </em>supra, the \u201cpreferable procedure\u201d would be to inquire whether the defendant wished to continue with his retained counsel or alternatively proceed <em>pro se, </em>348 F.2d at 704, but where, as in both <em>Abbamonte </em>and the present case, the defendant gives no indication that he wishes to defend himself and the trial judge can conclude that the accused\u2019s only dissatisfaction with his attorney is the latter\u2019s refusal to stall the trial, we will not afford the \u201cconvicted criminals * * a ready tool with which to upset adverse verdicts after trials at which they had been represented by counsel.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> United States ex rel. Maldonado v. Denno, supra at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">The appellant also claims that the trial judge erred when he directed that the appellant be tried by a jury after his counsel had informed the court that the accused had said \u201cthat he doesn\u2019t want a jury trial.\u201d Immediately following the attorney\u2019s statement the trial judge asked the accused whether or not he wanted a trial by jury and the accused refused to answer. In any event there is no merit to the appellant\u2019s contention. An accused has no absolute or exclusive right to elect a trial by the court alone without a jury. See Singer v. United States, 380 U.S. 24, 85 S.Ct. 783, 13 L. Ed.2d 630 (1965); Janko v. United States, 281 F.2d 156, 170 (8 Cir. 1960); Rule 23(a) of the Fed.Rules of Crim. Procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">We have considered the additional arguments raised by appellant pro se in his petition to amend brief, dated December 22, 1967, and find them devoid of merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b89-6\">. Counsel for the appellant on this appeal (appellant was represented by other counsel at the trial) stated: \u201cAfter reviewing the trial record, I am constrained to reaffirm my earlier assessment that defense counsel\u2019s representation was, under all the circumstances, adequate, and am unable to point to anything in the record indicating that lie was trying the case less vigorously than he might otherwise have had were it not for the clash between himself and appellant at the opening of the trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
