Like many other cases involving motivation, the finder of fact must draw inferences from the evidence before it. Here we conclude that there is ample evidence to support the findings by the trial examiner, and affirmed by the Board, that the no drinking rule by this beer salesman was not intended to be applied literally and in fact had not been applied literally even as against this employee. The record also contains sufficient evidence to warrant the inference drawn by the examiner and the Board that it is only when Thomann\u2019s active union conduct came to the attention of his employer that the matter of his having drunk \u201ctwo beers\u201d with a customer, when coupled with earlier occasions of drinking which had not been considered by the company as adequate for discharge, became the convenient handle to eliminate a troublesome employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-20\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
