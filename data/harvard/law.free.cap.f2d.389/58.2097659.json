Plaintiff, Sophie Scheidt, seeks damages for injury which she incurred in a softball game at defendants\u2019 Merry Hill Lodge in Cresco, Pennsylvania, allegedly as a result of their negligence while she was a paying guest at the lodge. John Scheidt, her husband, seeks damages for the loss of his wife\u2019s services and society.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-27\">Extraterritorial service of process is authorized by Rule 4(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \u201cunder the circumstances and in the manner prescribed in the statute or rule [of the state in which the district court sits].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> New Jersey appears to have extended its extraterritorial service to the full extent permitted by due process.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Plaintiffs rely on the following facts to sustain the service. Upon reading defendants\u2019 advertisement in the New York Daily News, a New York newspaper which is also circulated in New Jersey, Mrs. Scheidt called defendants at a Pennsylvania telephone number given in the advertisement, and as Mrs. Scheidt avers, \u201ccame to a definite agreement as to our accommodations, date of arrival, length of stay and rate. There was absolutely no condition attached, merely a request that we telegraph a $35.00 deposit, which we promptly did.\u201d Mrs. Scheidt has seen the advertisement both before and since this occasion. After the accident representatives of the defendants and their insurer called on Mrs. Scheidt regarding it.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">These circumstances do not render defendants subject to extraterritorial service of process. Defendants\u2019 advertisements in an out of state newspaper circulated in New Jersey, plaintiffs\u2019 telephone conversation with them at the Pennsylvania number listed in the advertisements, defendants\u2019 receipt of a deposit sent from New Jersey and the visits to New Jersey by representatives of defendants regarding the accident are peripheral occurrences and do not constitute \u201csome act by which the defendant purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> New Jersey therefore did not have the necessary \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to sustain jurisdiction over the person and service of process required by due process,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and service was properly quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b113-12\">.
