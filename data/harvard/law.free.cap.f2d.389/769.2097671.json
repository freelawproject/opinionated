Prior to 1966, a prisoner was not eligible for parole consideration under a sentence for either narcotic or marihuana offenses. In that year, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7237(d) was amended to grant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>parole eligibility to a prisoner held under a sentence for a marihuana offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-4\">The government concedes that the 1966 amendment is applicable to the prisoner. At the time of the oral argument, government counsel presented a certified copy of the prisoner\u2019s \u201cService Data Record\u201d which shows that the Bureau of Prisons recognizes such applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-5\">The district court held that the aggregation of successive sentences is proper for the determination of parole eligibility. We do not take this as meaning that such aggregation destroys the right to parole for the marihuana offenses under the 1966 amendment. The two sentences are considered separately to determine parole eligibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\"> The right of the prisoner to parole consideration does not entitle him to habeas corpus relief. He must exhaust his administrative remedies. See Smoake v. Willingham, 10 Cir., 359 F.2d 386, 387-388. A recognition of the right to parole consideration does not mean that parole must be granted. We leave that for determination by the Board of Parole.</p>\n<p id=\"Amm\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
