Smith wanted a bill telling him the name of the government\u2019s informer.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-19\">In the context of this case, he was entitled to know, although it is not every case where the information must be given. Aguilar v. United States, 9 Cir., 363 F.2d 379. However, two days before trial, the government advised defense counsel of the name of the informer. The informer was called by the defense and testified. Much of the informer\u2019s testimony was favorable to the defendant. How in the sequence there was any prejudice, one cannot find. We find no offense to Roviaro v. United States, 353 U.S. 53, 77 S.Ct. 623, 1 L.Ed.2d 639. See Sorren-tino v. United States, 9 Cir., 163 F.2d 627, and Sartain v. United States, 9 Cir., 303 F.2d 859.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-20\">Error is asserted in failure to grant a continuance. We can\u2019t find that it was ever requested. Requests for recesses were granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-21\">We find no abuse of discretion or reversible error in the instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-22\">The contention of lack of competent counsel at trial is without merit. We cannot say that the representation was a mockery. In fact, we agree with the trial judge that the defendant was well represented. The frequency of this charge on appeals does point out the occupational hazard of defending such cases as this.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-23\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
