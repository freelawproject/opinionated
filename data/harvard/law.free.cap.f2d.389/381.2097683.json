We have withheld decision awaiting the decision of the Supreme Court in Haynes v. United States, 390 U.S. 85, 88 S.Ct. 722, 19 L.Ed.2d 923, which case was decided on January 29, 1968. We are convinced that Haynes requires a reversal in the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">In <em>Haynes </em>(see footnote 1) the motion to dismiss merely asserted \u00a7 5851 was unconstitutional. The Court determined the issue of the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination was properly asserted. In our present case, defendant asserts that the offense charged is in violation of defendant\u2019s rights under the provisions of Amendments Two, Four, Five and Six to the Constitution of the United States. Thus the motion here is somewhat more specific than the <em>Haynes\u2019 </em>motion. Moreover, here as in <em>Haynes </em>the Government does not argue or suggest that the claim of Fifth Amendment privilege was not adequately raised.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">The indictment in <em>Haynes </em>charges a violation of \u00a7 5851 by knowingly possessing a firearm which had not been registered as required by \u00a7 5841. Such indictment differs in no material respect from the indictment in the present ease. In <em>Haynes, </em>the Supreme Court points out the decision has no bearing upon the authority of Congress to regulate the manufacture, transfer or possession of firearms or to tax activities wholly or in part unlawful. It states the narrow issue before it to be \u201cwhether enforcement of \u00a7 5851 against petitioner, despite his assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination, is constitutionally permissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">The Court then states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-12\">\u201cThe questions necessary for decision are two: first, whether petitioner\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 5851 is meaningfully distinguishable from a conviction under \u00a7 5841 for failure to register possession of a firearm; and second, if it is not, whether satisfaction of petitioner\u2019s obligation to register under \u00a7 5841 would have compelled him to provide information incriminating to himself.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">The Court gives the first question above stated a negative answer and the second question an affirmative answer. The Court goes on to say that the hazard of self-incrimination created by the \u00a7 5841 registration requirement \u201ccan thus only be termed \u2018real and appreciable.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">The Court recognizes that there may be uncommon circumstances in which registration is required of one who has not violated the Firearms Act, such as the finder of a lost firearm, and that \u201cthe existence of such situations makes it inappropriate, in the absence of evidence that the exercise of protected rights would otherwise be hampered, to declare these sections impermissible on face.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-15\">The Court holds that \u201ca proper claim of the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination provides a full defense to prosecutions either for failure to register a firearm under \u00a7 5841 or for possession of an unregistered firearm under \u00a7 5851.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>This case was tried in the District Court long prior to the <em>Haynes </em>decision and thus it is understandable that the issue of whether the required registration would be self-incriminating was not decided. The defendant adequately raised the self-incrimination issue and has not waived his privilege against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">We find nothing in the present record which would warrant a finding that \u00a7 5841, registration of firearms, would not be self-incriminating, and we can conceive of no evidence which could be produced to establish the required registration would not be incriminating. In this respect, the factual background is indistinguishable from that presented in <em>Haynes. </em>In that case, the Supreme Court determined that, \u201cIt would be neither just nor appropriate to require the parties and the District Court to commence an entirely needless additional proceeding.\u201d We reach a like conclusion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The judgment is reversed. This case is remanded to the District Court with direction to dismiss the indictment. Mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
