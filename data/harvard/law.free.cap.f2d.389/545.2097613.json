By letter dated April 2, 1965, the Hospital Superintendent informed the court without elaboration of its inquiry or diagnosis that \u201cMr. Blunt is mentally competent for trial * * * [and] is not now or was not * * * suffering from mental disease or defect.\u201d At a hearing held on April 15,1965, 10 months before trial, Dr. Eugene Stanmeyer, Supervisory Clinical Psychologist at Saint Elizabeths, testified that in his opinion Blunt was unable to assist counsel. The court, sua sponte, then interrupted appellant\u2019s ease by calling staff psychiatrist Dr. Strady H. Economon. However, the court refused to permit cross-examination of Dr. Economon about matters to which the Government later stipulated, Dr. Economon\u2019s differences with Dr. Stanmeyer, and the basis for the Hospital\u2019s opinion. Although appellant had been found competent to stand trial, he was afterwards given two mental examinations and competency hearings. He was not present at either of these, and the order following the more recent finds him competent because he had previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>been found competent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant now argues that the trial court abused its discretion in the first hearing, that of April 15, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\">In providing in \u00a7 24-301 (a) for a hearing, Congress set no standards, but it had expressed an interest in \u201cspeed[ing] up procedures without prejudicing accused.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We noted in Hans-ford v. United States that a competency hearing \u201cneed not be a lengthy and involved proceeding. However, as a minimum we think the inquiry must be of record and both parties must be given the opportunity to examine all witnesses who testify or report on the accused\u2019s competence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We had already recognized in Holloway v. United States that \u201cThe judicial determination must, of course, be an informed one.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court has required counsel at the hearing unless meaningfully waived.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> These standards are of little value unless full and scrupulous attention is given to evidence concerning competency. Pate v. Robinson<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> requires such attention at trial whether or not there has been a hearing. No less than the same careful evaluation of an accused\u2019s condition is required of the court during a competency hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-17\">At the April 15 hearing, which was the only contested investigation of competency, appellant first called Dr. Stan-meyer who supervised the scoring and interpretation of a battery of four psychological tests<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> prior to their consideration by Dr. Economon and Dr. Maurice Platkin at a staff conference. Based on his review of the tests, Dr. Stanmeyer testified that appellant scored an I.Q. of 81; could not objectively decide whether to challenge a juror or take the stand; and was unlikely to \u201cfollow the course of a prolonged trial in terms of postulating questions to * * * witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b601-18\">In Jenkins v. United States<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we said that when a psychologist has the requisite training or experience his testimony should be given consideration with that of other experts in the field of mental disorder.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather than evaluate Dr. Stanmeyer\u2019s qualifications, the court disregarded <em>Jenkins </em>and turned the hearing into an inquiry into any psychologist\u2019s competency to make informed observations about Blunt without medical training.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> For example, when Dr. Stan-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>meyer presented his interpretation of the results of the Bender-Gestalt test the following took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-4\">The Court: What does that particular test relate to from the standpoint of your experiment? What is the nature of the experiment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-5\">The Witness: Basically, the test is a test of organic brain pathology. This is the reason that it was devised.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-6\">The Court: You do not presume to testify as to whether there is absence or presence of organic brain pathology, do you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-7\">The Witness : Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">The Court: You have no training in anatomy, have you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-9\">The Witness: I have had training in anatomy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-10\">The Court: I mean you have never done any anatomy, so-called, any gross anatomy? You have never dissected a cadaver, have you?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">And later when counsel sought Dr. Stan-meyer\u2019s evaluation of appellant\u2019s competency in light of the diagnosis in 1952 of psychosis and incompetency, referred to in note 1, <em>supra, </em>the court questioned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Axh1\">The Court: Are you familiar with the different types of schizophrenia?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-21\">The Witness: I am familiar with diagnostic principles.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-22\">The Court: I am not trying to give you a bad time but again I am suggesting you are in a field that is not your own. Schizophrenia is definitely something outside your field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-23\">You may deal with results or manifestations symptomatically but, as far as telling me anything about schizophrenia, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re qualified.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-24\">The Witness: That is our area of specialty in clinical psychology.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-25\">The court erred also in calling Dr. Economon out of turn and restricting the scope of his cross-examination.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel had sought to question Dr. Economon about information to which Blunt\u2019s mother, appellant\u2019s second witness was prepared to testify. This included personal history which was not known by the staff psychiatrists at the conference. Yet the court refused to allow questioning of Dr. Economon about this testimony<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which would have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>before the court had appellant been permitted to proceed with his ease and to which the court later urged the Government to stipulate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Attempts by appellant\u2019s counsel to ask Dr. Economon about the basis for the Hospital\u2019s conclusions also were blocked when the court refused to let the psychiatrist answer.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-3\">Q: You testified he could understand the charges against him and hear testimony. Do you feel that he could participate with counsel in a decision whether he could take the stand or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-4\">A: Yes, by definition. With respect\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-5\">The Court: The answer is yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-6\">Q: Do you feel he could help select a jury in determining whether to challenge a juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-7\">A: What specifically do you mean by challenging a juror?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-8\">The Court: I will exclude that. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-10\">Q: Do you feel he could appreciate the evidence given at the trial and its significance ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-11\">The Court: That is not the question of competency. I will exclude that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-12\">And when counsel sought to identify the areas of difference between the Hospital and Dr. Stanmeyer, the court continued to foreclose meaningful inquiry.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-13\">Q: You disagree personally with this [the psychologist\u2019s] statement although it is in the report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-25\">I neither agree or disagree. I accept it as a psychology test. Like any laboratory test, they are considered when a diagnosis is made by a psychiatrist. This is merely data. It appeared\u2014 A:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-26\">The Court: You have answered Doctor. Thank you very much.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-27\">Q: The statement, I believe, makes a prediction. Do you have an opinion as to whether it is true or false ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-28\">The Court : The witness has answered the question with respect to that. We won\u2019t pursue it any further.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-30\">Q: Do you believe that this defendant would experience unusual tensions or anxiety\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b603-31\">The Court: We have been through that, Mr. Aaronson, and I don\u2019t want you to become repetitive.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b603-32\">While a court need not hold a lengthy or involved proceeding, it must hold a fair and adequate one. The strictures imposed on counsel\u2019s development of relevant evidence so limited the possibility of a full and scrupulous evaluation of appellant\u2019s competency as to leave us unable to say that there was a properly informed judicial determination. Since the finding as to competency was based on a hearing held almost 32 months ago (or 10 months before Blunt\u2019s trial on February 14, 1966), we think Dusky v. United States requires reversal for a new trial rather than remand for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0jF\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b600-14\">. In 1952 appellant Blunt was indicted for five robberies and a housebreaking and larceny. At his arraignment the court ordered a psychiatric examination which resulted in his certification as of unsound mind and suffering from a psychosis. He was subsequently found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to Saint Elizabeths Hospital. In August 1953 he was certified competent to stand trial and in October 1953, without any judicial determination of restored competency, was tried and convicted on three charges of robbery. In Blunt v. United States, 100 U.S.App.D.C. 266, 244 F.2d 355 (1957). we reversed his conviction because of error relating to the issue of insanity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b601-5\">. At the second hearing held October 26, 1965, newly appointed defense connsel agreed to a finding of appellant\u2019s competency. Notwithstanding this agreement, we think that in view of the nature of the testimony adduced at the prior hearing, appellant\u2019s previous history with respect to competency to stand trial and insanity, and the fact that his counsel apparently did not have the benefit of a transcript of the first hearing, a full hearing was required. See Whalem v. United States, 120 U.S.App.D.C. 331, 346 F.2d S12, cert. denied, 382 U.S. 862, 86 S.Ct. 124, 15 L.Ed.2d 100 (1965), where the court recognized that a hearing could be required although no objection was made to certification of competency.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b601-8\">.

Dr. Stanmeyer received a Bachelor of Arts degree from Morris College, Du-buque, Iowa, in 1951, a Masters Degree in Clinical Psychology in 1958 and a Ph.D. in 1961 from the Catholic University of America.

Although a lack of general medical background may affect the weight given a psychologist\u2019s testimony, there was no adequate basis for the treatment accorded Dr. Stanmeyer, especially as contrasted with that given Dr. Economon. For ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>ample, on cross-examination counsel sought to question Dr. Economon about the Saint Elizabeths staff conference which considered Blunt\u2019s case. In particular, he sought to determine the amount of time spent interviewing Blunt by the staff psychiatrist at the conference. The distinction the court was prepared to draw between medical and nonmedical testimony is suggested by the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-14\">Q: At this conference at which you extensively reviewed his history, interviewed him and reviewed his case, how long did that conference last?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AxJ\">A: I would say that the conference lasted perhaps an hour or more.

At the close of Dr. Stanmeyer\u2019s testimony the court said, \u201cI want to call Dr. Economon out of turn. Dr. Economon has been waiting a long time. You have no objection, I take it?\u201d Defense counsel replied, \u201cNo objection.\u201d However, he could not have anticipated that the court would deny him the opportunity to question Dr. Economon about information to which appellant\u2019s second witness would testify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b602-29\">.
