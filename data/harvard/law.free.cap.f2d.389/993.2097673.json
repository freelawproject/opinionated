Gardner, 5 Cir., 1968, 390 F.2d 32, decided this day. Here, however, the Secretary\u2019s decision was bottomed upon an incorrect legal principle that to be \u201cmedically determinable\u201d the impairment must be established by <em>objective </em>medical, clinical or laboratory evidence. In rejecting this test we have said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1048-8\">But the statute does not require that disability or its cause be \u201csubstantiated objectively.\u201d Of course, it must be \u201cby reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment.\u201d But modern medicine is neither so scientific nor so helpless today that it either does, or must, evaluate only objective factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1048-9\">Hayes v. Celebrezze, 5 Cir., 1963, 311 F.2d 648; accord, Ross v. Gardner, 6 Cir. 1966, 365 F.2d 554; Bramlett v. Ribicoff, 4 Cir., 1962, 298 F.2d 858.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-10\">As we pointed out in <em>Daniel, </em>the disability provisions of the Social Security Act have been amended by Section 158 (b) of the Social Security Amendments of 1967, 81 Stat. 821. Disability under the Act must therefore now be determined in accordance with provisions of that statute and not in accordance with the test of disability that we enunciated in Gardner v. Smith, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 77; Bridges v. Gardner, 5 Cir., 1966, 368 F.2d 86 and their progeny.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-11\">It will therefore be necessary for the Secretary to reconsider the medical evidence in the light of the proper legal standard and to reconsider the vocational evidence in light of the Social Security Amendments of 1967.</p>\n<p id=\"b1048-13\">The judgment of the district court is vacated and the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
