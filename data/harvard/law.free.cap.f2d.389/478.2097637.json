The Air Lines acted upon this resignation and considered Kelley\u2019s employment terminated. Thereafter, Kelley contended that the resignation letter was subject to contingencies orally understood between the parties; that the contingencies had not been satisfied and that, therefore, the resignation letter was not effective. Kelley filed his grievance, which was denied at the first two levels, then took his appeals to the System Board of Adjustment, set up under the terms of the Transportation Act. Upon a hearing before that Board, at which testimony was given by Kelley on his behalf and by the Air Lines\u2019 representative at the conversations on behalf of the Air Lines, the Board made the following judgment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOD\">\u201cThis Board finds that we have no jurisdiction over a <em>properly </em>given and <em>properly </em>accepted letter of resignation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-18\">\u201cThe case is therefore dismissed.\u201d (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-19\">Upon this state of the record, it is apparent that the Board must necessarily have made a determination as to the validity of the letter of resignation. It necessarily found that the resignation was \u201cproperly\u201d given and \u201cproperly\u201d accepted in order to enter the order which it promulgated. We, therefore, conclude that there was no alternative for the trial court but to have dismissed the suit for damages, albeit the ground of dismissal is one that was not relied upon by the trial court. See S.E.C. v. Chenery Corporation, 318 U.S. 80, 88, 63 S.Ct. 454, 87 L.Ed. 626 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-20\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
