We conclude that there is no merit in the contentions that there was an adequate ground of defense by entrapment, or that the conduct of the undercover agents violated the constitutional prohibitions against unreasonable search and seizure. See Hoffa v. United States, 385 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 408, 17 L.Ed.2d 374 (1966), and Lewis v. United States, 385 U.S. 206, 87 S.Ct. 424, 17 L.Ed.2d 312 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-19\">It appearing that there was no error in the conduct of the trial, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
