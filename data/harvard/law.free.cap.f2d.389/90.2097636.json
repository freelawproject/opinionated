Moore was convicted by the District Court in a jury-waived trial. He was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>committed to the custody of the Attorney General for concurrent periods of 10 years on each count pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b) for study according to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(c), with the commitment subject to modification as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">On his appeal the questions are Moore\u2019s mental competency to commit the offense and to stand trial. Both points were fully explored by the trial judge and, altogether justifiably, found against the appellant. No ground appears for disturbing the judgment now on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
