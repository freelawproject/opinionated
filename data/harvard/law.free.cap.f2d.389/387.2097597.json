At one time state grievance proceedings were pending against her. They have been dismissed by stipulation. She has a certificate of good standing now. And, the old proceedings are dead.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-30\">Yet, she still pursues a district attorney and members of the state bar committee on various theories for their fruitless efforts. On motion, her complaint was dismissed and she appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-31\">We have reviewed the record and find no ruling of the district court clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-32\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
