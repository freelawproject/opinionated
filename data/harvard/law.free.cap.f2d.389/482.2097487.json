App. \u00a7 462. The district court\u2019s jurisdiction was founded on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231, and our review is sought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291, 1294.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-17\">The record shows that the appellant, Joseph Robert Dugdale, has been registered with the local board of the Selective Service System (Board) since 1961. He completed two classification questionnaires without claiming exemption as a conscientious objector. On two occasions the Board classified him 1-A (available for military service) and notified him of his classification. No appeal was taken. On February 10, 1966, Dugdale was ordered to report for induction on February 23; however, the date of the induction was postponed. Dugdale was subsequently ordered to report for induction on October 18, 1966.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-18\">On October 3, 1966, four days after the induction notice was sent, the Board received from appellant a completed Selective Service Form 150 (a special form for conscientious objectors), claiming exemption from both combatant and noncombatant military service. On October 11, 1966, the local Board noted appellant\u2019s file: \u201cReviewed, no change, 3-0\u201d and two days later informed him of its decision not to reopen his classification. Dugdale reported on October 18, 1966, but refused to take the ceremonial step forward signifying induction. He was indicted, found guilty, and sentenced to the custody of the Attorney General for a period of three years. It is from this conviction the appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>Pursuant to the authority conferred by 50 U.S.C. App. \u00a7 460(b) (l),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the President has promulgated a regulation dealing with requests to reopen the classification of registrants who have been sent their induction notices:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">\u201cThe local board may reopen and consider anew the classification of a registrant * * * upon the written request of the registrant * * * if such request is accompanied by written information presenting facts not considered when a registrant was classified which, if true, would justify a change in the registrant\u2019s classification ; * * * <em>provided the classification </em>* * * <em>of a registrant shall not be reopened after the local board has mailed to such registrant an order to report for induction </em>* * * <em>unless the local board first specifically finds that there has been a change in the registrant\u2019s status resulting from circumstances over which the registrant had no control.\u201d </em>32 C.F.R. 1625.-2. (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">This regulation clearly limits the instances in which the denial of conscientious objector claims may be appealed when such a claim is made after issuance of an induction notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Dugdale contends that the Board should have reopened and made a finding as to the date appellant\u2019s belief matured. The argument relies upon the rationale of United States v. Gearey, 368 F.2d 144 (2nd Cir. 1966), which holds that if a registrant\u2019s conscientious objector views mature after notice of induction is sent but before induction, this is such a \u201cchange of status\u201d resulting from \u201ccircumstances over which [he has] no control\u201d which would qualify him for exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-19\">We do not necessarily accept the rationale of the <em>Gearey </em>case. See Boyd v. United States, 269 F.2d 607 (9th Cir. 1959), and Parrott v. United States, 370 F.2d 388 (9th Cir. 1966). But even if we did we could not reverse Dugdale\u2019s conviction here. It was incumbent upon Dugdale to submit statements and information which, if true, would be a basis for the change in classification. He was required to show a \u201cchange of status\u201d occurring after receipt of the induction notice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-20\">On his special form for conscientious objectors, SSS Form 150, he stated that his views had been acquired through his home life, his contacts with acquaintances and friends, and his reading of literature. These views were demonstrated by comments to friends condemning violence and killing, and his request for classification as a conscientious objector. None of his reasons are consistent with any claim that his views matured or changed after receipt of the induction notice. In his transmittal letter with the form,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> he explained his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>reasons for late filing to be not any change of status, but rather that he would have filed earlier had he known the rules \u2014 a reason effectively negating any contention that he filed the form because his views suddenly changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Looking at Form 150 from the Board\u2019s position on October 11, 1966, there was nothing to show that there was a change of status to be considered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Thus, the action of the Board was the proper one, pursuant to 32 C.F.R. 1625.2, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The only conceivable argument is that the Board should have known, from the filing of the conscientious objector form, that a change of status was being claimed. To hold that a mere filing of a form, regardless of its legal sufficiency, requires the Board to reopen, would seriously disrupt the Selective Service System. This is especially true when the form is not filed until after the induction notice has been received.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b538-9\">. That section provides that the President may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-10\">\u201cPrescribe the necessary rules and regulations to carry out the provisions of this title * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b538-11\">. Even in a situation where SSS Form 150 is submitted prior to mailing of the induction notice, the form must present \u201ca prima facie case for conscientious objector classification,\u201d to require the board to reopen. Stain v. United States, 235 F.2d 339 (9th Cir. 1956); Miller v. United States, Ninth Circuit Dec. 29, 1967, <em>888 </em>F.2d 973. In the present case, SSS Form 150 was submitted after mailing of the induction notice and the board cannot exercise its discretion to reopen unless it can find a \u201cchange of status\u201d as required by 32 C.F.R. 1625.2, supra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b538-21\">.
