The jury returned a verdict of $15,000 for Daniel and the appellee promptly moved for judgment n. o. v.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court granted the motion and directed judgment entered against appellant, Daniel. From this ruling, the present appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-23\"> The rule of law applicable to this case we recently restated in Albergo v. Reading Company, 372 F.2d 83, 85 (3d Cir. 1966):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b977-24\">\u201c[Ojur \u2018appraisal of the proofs * * * is narrowly limited to the single inquiry whether, with reason, the conclusion may be drawn that negligence of the employer played any part at all\u2019 in the occurrence which resulted in the plaintiff\u2019s injury. * * The test * * * 'is simply whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury * * *.\u2019 The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>evidence may be minimal but it must be sufficient \u2018to provide the jury with some rational basis for concluding that some negligence of the railroad\u2019 proximately contributed to the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"awn-dedup-0\">See Rogers v. Missouri Pacific R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 507, 77 S.Ct. 443, 1 L.Ed. 2d 493 (1957); Dessi v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 251 F.2d 149, 150, 78 S.Ct. 1006 (3d Cir. 1958); cf. Zegan v. Central Railroad Company of State of New Jersey, 266 F.2d 101, 102-104, 77 A.L.R.2d 768 (3d Cir. 1959).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">Applying this rule of law to the record in this case, however, is very difficult. The evidence must be examined \u201cin the light most favorable to the prevailing party, resolving all conflicts of testimony in his favor, to determine whether the evidence was sufficient to carry the case to the jury.\u201d See <em>Zegan </em>Case, 266 F.2d supra at 102. Also there was a pronounced language problem because all those who testified, appellant Daniel and all four of the Railroad\u2019s witnesses alike, spoke extremely poor English. In some instances they apparently could not understand the questions asked.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The appellant\u2019s evidence consisted entirely of his own testimony, and brief portions of depositions of two of the Railroad\u2019s employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Railroad\u2019s evidence was similarly confined to testimony in the broken English spoken by the witnesses. Such a record is quite difficult to analyze and perhaps even more than in the usual case, every possible favorable presumption should be given to the jury\u2019s determination since they had the opportunity to understand with the aid of accompanying physical gestures and expressions.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-11\">After careful consideration, we have concluded that there is sufficient evidence on this record for the jury rationally to have found that an accident occurred to Daniel on August 2, 1962 while he was working on a road crew of the Railroad. Daniel was one of seven men, including the foreman, on the crew which was operating a rail-anchor machine weighing approximately 475 pounds.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This machine apparently rolled along the rails and after clamping new rails securely in the proper place, fastened them to the ties with rail anchors. On the day the accident happened, it had become necessary to move this machine from track 23 to the parallel track 24. Daniel, his back toward the machine on track 23 and facing track 24, picked up the \u201cheavy side\u201d of the machine. At the same time, behind him and to either side, the other six men also lifted the machine. In terms of an analogy used by the trial judge during the trial, the arrangement was much like pallbearers, except Daniel was in front, walking forward, and the three men on each side faced the machine and moved sideways.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-12\">Daniel testified that while lifting the machine out of track 23 and moving toward track 24 \u2014 at least a \u201csix foot\u201d distance existing between the two tracks \u2014 , Vittorio Di Santo let his corner (forward, right, behind Daniel) down, caus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>ing the machine to press more heavily against Daniel\u2019s back.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> DiSanto, however, denied that he ever let go or lightened his share of the weight, and the other three witnesses testified that nothing happened other than moving the machine and that no one tripped or stumbled or let his end down. Even though appellant insists that \u201cDiSanto was caused to stumble or otherwise let his end of the machine down\u201d, as to this theory of proximate cause there is no direct evidence that Daniel or anyone else ever saw this happen. Since Daniel faced away from the others,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> he only guessed at the cause of the increased weight of the machine that he felt hurt his back. As the testimony shows by the words \u201c * * * or something. I don\u2019t know. Maybe. * * * \u201d, \u201cI was work straight with the machine in my back\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened to him * * *\u201d,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the appellant at best gave his opinion as to the proximate cause of the accident.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> For the jury to attribute negligence to the Railroad\u2019s agent, DiSanto, and thus to the Railroad, based on this opinion, is a conclusion as to proximate cause without a rational basis in proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-11\">The jury was justified, however, in finding that the injury to Daniel\u2019s back occurred during the effort of moving the machine from track 23 to track 24.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Daniel also testified that the area between track 23 and track 24 (the \u201csix-foot\u201d area) was uneven and not level because the tracks were being raised using this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-12\">\u201cIt no was in good condition because they was raise the tracks. Some place it was high, some place it was low. The gravel just you know a little rough, they raise the track. It was in a bad condition. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-13\">\u201cA. I say happened right there made me to fall, careless in track.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-14\">\u201cQ. In the track where?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b980-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>\u201cA. Yes, in the railroad track the condition not right. It\u2019s not level, got track and ties, you know, the place is six-foot between the one track and the other one and the other place we were working, raise the track, * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABU\">See also testimony referred to at footnotes 6 and 9 supra, including the testimony that the gravel was \u201cloose.\u201d The jury could have found that the terrain over which the machine had to be carried (particularly the \u201csix-foot\u201d area between the tracks) was not level and that the ballast was irregular so that appellant was subjected to an unreasonable risk of harm (See Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 282, comment g (1965)) by appellee\u2019s requiring the operation of manual transfer of the machine from track 23 to track 24 at the particular point.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The jury could rationally have concluded that such negligence contributed in some small part to appellant\u2019s injury. See <em>Zegan </em>Case, supra, 266 F.2d at 102-104; cf. F.A.R. Liquidating Corporation v. Brownell, 140 F.Supp. 535, 539-540 (D.Del.1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">The appellant\u2019s lawyer suggested at the pre-trial conference that, because of the requirement that a machine of 460 pounds and of such size had to be lifted in that type of area and transported by men walking with it over uneven ballast, there was a need to balance the machine while walking in an uneven and thus unsafe place.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Although there was no evidence of irregularity in the \u201cin-track\u201d ballast, on the other hand there was evidence as to the uneven conditions in the general area. This testimony, repeated several times, was that track 23 had been recently raised up. Consequently the machine had to be carried \u201cdown\u201d from track 23 to the \u201c6-foot\u201d, then \u201cup\u201d to the next new track in the yard. A logical and reasonable inference from this evidence is that Daniel felt the sudden weight merely because a heavy machine was moved \u201cdownhill\u201d, as opposed to being moved over level ground. No one would have to slip or stumble or let go in order that Daniel, on the heavy downhill side, would feel extra weight, suddenly and far more than normal. The jury could have found that the injury was caused rather by the peculiar working conditions under which the men were ordered to perform.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Unfortunately the present record does not contain the charge of the trial judge so that we can examine what was submitted to the jury and whether the charge could justify a finding based on liability for an \u201cunsafe method\u201d in an unsafe area under all the circumstances. But since we do know the pre-trial position of the appellant, it is proper on this record to assume that the charge included the theory of \u201cunsafe method\u201d due to dangerous or peculiar work conditions. The jury\u2019s conclusion, therefore, has a rational basis in the evidence for determining that a partial cause of the injury was the appellee\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">The order of the district court granting judgment n. o. v. will be reversed and the case remanded so that the district court may reinstate the judgment for the appellant of January 18, 1967 in accordance with the foregoing opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b977-13\">.

Appellant\u2019s counsel and the court exchanged comments about the lack of comprehension of certain questions by one witness. At one point the judge asked the jury if they understood a witness\u2019 answer, and apparently they did. The appellant, who had only a second grade education in Italy, not only had difficulty expressing himself, but at one point was absolutely unable to understand a question concerning furlough. At 64a, counsel for the Railroad indicated that an accompanying physical gesture indicated that a witness did not understand a question concerning his deposition. In response the court said, \u201cwell, he gave those answers anyway so we will leave it there,\u201d (apparently showing the court was satisfied that the deposition was that of the witness).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b978-14\">.

It should be noted also, that if the jury believed Daniel\u2019s version of the facts, he alone had testified that the machine was lifted out of track 23, set down in the \u201csix foot\u201d, and then, after he changed his position to a \u201cside\u201d lifter, was lifted again and placed on track 24. (See footnote 6, supra). The accident thus, in Daniel\u2019s version, is clearly confined to lifting out of track 23, and he claims he registered an oral complaint directed to DiSanto to pick up his corner before the machine was put down between the two tracks. The Railroad\u2019s witnesses contradicted this story as to the machine ever being put down during the carry, although they agree that at sometime, Daniel complained about someone not lifting his share.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b980-5\">.
