App. \u00a7\u00a7 456(j), 462(a). He appeals on the basis that the government failed to prove affirmatively that the draft board had complied with 32 C.F.R. 1660.20 which provides that a draft board is not to call a conscientious objector before he would have been called had he not been classified 1-0. This issue was recently decided in Greer v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 378 F.2d 931, and Lowe v. United States, 5 Cir., Jan. 3, 1968, 389 F.2d 51, and we affirm on the basis of those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-19\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
