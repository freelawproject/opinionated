Appellant urges that the findings of the Secretary and his hearing examiner are not supported by substantial evidence as required by Section 205(g) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), and that the examiner applied erroneous legal standards to the evidence. Upon review of the whole record we find substantial evidence supporting the examiner\u2019s factual findings, but must reverse the cause for further consideration consistent with correct legal criteria, which the examiner failed to apply to the medical evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-13\">Appellant received a third grade education and testified that he was barely able to read or write, although on previous contacts with the Social Security Administration he claimed that he could read. He worked at hard manual labor from the age of seventeen until July 28, 1962, when, at the age of thirty-seven, he discontinued working as a coal-cutting machine operator in underground mining and has not worked or sought work since. He had worked fourteen years as a miner, the last ten as a cutting machine operator, possibly the most skilled position in the mine. To operate the machine he was required to assume a duck-walking position, guiding the caterpillar-like apparatus into the coal by means of various controls and levers. This job was dangerous. The machine weighed from 1,000 to 3,000 pounds, and its operator was required to be aware of various surrounding conditions of the mine to avoid cave-ins and the like.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-14\">On March 29, 1959, one of these machines threw appellant against a post, injuring his back. This occurrence necessitated a leave of absence of nine months, after which appellant returned to work and continued working until July 28, 1962. He left work at that time, allegedly because of a sprained back, but did not seek medical attention until eighteen days later. No medical evidence was introduced substantiating this second injury. On the contrary, appellant consistently complained to examining physicians over a period of approximately two years that his reason for not working was his old 1959 injury. His claim is that because of severe pain in the spine, radiating into both legs and up the back into his neck, he is unable to engage in any \u201csubstantial gainful employment,\u201d thus meeting the statutory requirement for disability payments, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-15\">1. Substantial Medical Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-16\">The hearing examiner found that appellant was disabled from performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>his old job as a coal-cutting machine operator or other jobs requiring heavy physical labor. But he concluded that appellant would be able to do lighter work available in Huntington, West Virginia, such as factory sanding, buffing and glass products inspection. Appellant contends that his physical and psychological condition render him disabled from performing not only his old coal mining job, but any substantial gainful employment at all.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The medical evidence introduced to substantiate this claim was generally unexceptional, judged in the light of the Court\u2019s experience with similar cases, and can be easily summarized. Various X-rays showed no herniated or ruptured disc or other injurious condition in the back, except the well-healed 1959 fracture of his right sacroiliac joint. No examination disclosed any other disabling orthopedic defects or injuries. Movement around the waist and spinal area as well as such tests as straight leg raising disclosed that appellant\u2019s ability to make gross bodily movements was limited by his assertion of pain. No atrophy of the muscles of the thighs or calves was discovered; ankle and knee joints were normal, as well as the feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">X-rays of the lungs did disclose a slight nodular and reticular pattern; a radiologist commented that this disclosed a \u201ccategory I type of simple pneumo-coniosis.\u201d This is a common disease among coal miners, caused from inhalation of coal dust. It has the effect of limiting the capacity of the lungs in transferring oxygen to the blood. It is significant in this regard that appellant did not quit work in the mines on account of any pulmonary condition, and yet his employment required substantial physical exertion. Nor did he complain to his various medical examiners of any respiratory ailment, although he did testify to shortness of breath.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-6\">Appellant testified that he takes three kinds of pills every four hours, for his heart, his nerves and for pain. He said he spends most of his time in bed to calm his nerves and that he is unable even to do work around the house. The reports of various doctors described his psychological state as \u201cnervous and apprehensive,\u201d \u201csevere anxiety and depression,\u201d and \u201cchronic anxiety state.\u201d Dr. Donald I. George concluded from a psychiatric examination that;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-8\">\u201cHis whole motivation is aimed to convince one of his disability and blame it all on the accident. He is pious, overly religious and is poorly motivated to change. * * * He is competent to handle funds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-9\">\u201cDiagnosis: Psychophysiologic nervous system reaction with some conversion features.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-11\">\u201cComment: This emotional problem is of a moderate degree and is an overlay to the physical problem and the combination of the two does make for a significant disability.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-12\">Dr. William C. Roland, specialist in orthopedic surgery, examined appellant on February 22, 1963, and on May 19, 1964. After the latter examination, he diagnosed \u201cconversion hysteria,\u201d and commented as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-13\">\u201cThis patient was studied February 22, 1963, * * *. My impression at that time was that the patient had some evidence of nerve root irritation and that further diagnostic efforts, such as lumbar myelography, should be carried out. Mr. Whitt\u2019s sympto-matology has changed markedly since his original examination in this office. The functional overlay is particularly marked and makes evaluation of any residual physical impairment most difficult. Upon reviewing my original examination and, again, on reviewing the present findings on examination, it is noteworthy that the complaints of the patient are not verified by abnormal physical findings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-14\">Estimates of appellant's incapacitation ranged from one physican\u2019s diagnosis of \u201ctotally incapacitated,\u201d which he changed upon later examination to \u201cunable to do manual labor,\u201d to \u201cpartial permanent disability of 40 percent,\u201d and Dr. George\u2019s conclusion, noted above, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>that appellant\u2019s physical and emotional difficulties did present \u201ca significant disability.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b963-5\">Upon reviewing the medical evidence of record, we cannot say that the examiner\u2019s decision that appellant was disabled from his coal mining job, but not from performing lighter tasks, is without substantial support. 42 U.S. C. \u00a7 405(g). Neither this Court nor the District Judge consider the evidence de novo. The burden is on the applicant to establish that he is entitled to the benefits of the Act. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 416 (i) and 423(c) (2). Nelson v. Gardner, 386 F.2d 92 (6th Cir. 1967); Justice v. Gardner, 360 F.2d 998, 1002 (6th Cir. 1966); Erickson v. Ribicoff, 305 F.2d 638, 640 (6th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-6\">2. Erroneous Legal Standards Applied to Medical Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b963-7\">In his opinion, the hearing examiner stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-8\">\u201cThe Act requires that the impairment be \u2018medically determinable,\u2019 that is, the existence of an impairment must be established by <em>objective </em>medical, clinical, or laboratory evidence. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ajq-dedup-0\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-9\">\u201cThe <em>objective </em>medical evidence does not support a conclusion that the claimant has a significant physical impairment. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-10\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-11\">\u201cThe <em>objective </em>medical evidence will support only * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-13\">The Act nowhere states a requirement that a claimant establish his disability by \u201cobjective\u201d medical evidence. In a case such as the present one, much of the evidence was subjective in nature, appellant\u2019s primary complaint being that of incapacitation because of extreme pain. This Court, as well as others, has considered the infection of an examiner\u2019s findings by such an erroneous legal standard to be reversible error, no matter what our own view be as to the correctness of his ultimate conclusion. See Branham v. Gardner, 383 F.2d 614 (6th Cir. 1967); Walston v. Gardner, 381 F. 2d 580 (6th Cir. 1967); Ross v. Gardner, 365 F.2d 554 (6th Cir. 1966); Polly v. Gardner, 364 F.2d 969, 972 (6th Cir. 1966); and Miracle v. Celebrezze, 351 F.2d 361, 374 et seq. (6th Cir. 1965). As we said in Ross v. Gardner, supra, 365 F.2d at 558:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-15\">\u201cObviously, the Hearing Examiner in this case, as in other cases coming to our attention, assumed that \u2018medically determinable\u2019 means \u2018supported by <em>objective </em>clinical findings and reports.\u2019 The Act means nothing of the kind.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah5\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4F\">\u201cPain, unaccompanied by any objectively observable symptoms, may be so real and so intense as to be disabling, and will support a claim for disability benefits. Ber v. Celebrezze, 332 F.2d 293 (C.A. 2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-16\">We note that recent amendments to the Social Security Act (see Pub.L. No. 90-248, \u00a7 158 (Jan. 2, 1968) 81 Stat. 868 (36 U.S.L.Week 39, 54 (Jan. 16, 1968) ) have amended Section 223(c), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(c), to read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-17\">\u201c(1) The term \u2018disability\u2019 means\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdR\">\u201c(A) inability to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADjq\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b963-18\">\u201c(3) For purposes of this subsection, a \u2018physical or mental impairment\u2019 is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are <em>demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b963-19\">These amendments are applicable to the instant case, as the present civil action, under \u00a7 158(e) of the amending Act, supra, is a \u201ccivil action * * * commenced under section 205(g) of the Social Security Act * * * and the decision in such civil action has not become final * * We conclude, however, that while these amendments con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>firm the examiner\u2019s requirement that \u201cthe existence of an impairment must be established by * * * medical, clinical, or laboratory evidence,\u201d they do not support his insistence that the medical evidence be \u201cobjective.\u201d Hence our need to reverse is not obviated by these recent amendments to the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">In this connection, we think it appropriate to point out other respects in which the examiner applied criteria which we have recently held to be erroneous. In his evaluation of the psychological evidence, he stated the standards to be applied as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-6\">\u201cFurthermore, in the considered opinion of the Hearing Examiner, to approach and meet the level of severity contemplated by the Act for the type of disorder found in neurosis, there must be findings of unacceptable social behavior, severe persistant depression, gross errors in judgment and reasoning, insomnia, inability to concentrate, marked loss of weight with malnutrition, or other severe somatic manifestation of a <em>deep seated intractable </em>psychogenic disorder.\u201d Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-7\">The examiner also quoted from Social Security Regulations, 20 C.F.R. 404.-1519(c) (2) (ii), and concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"anl-dedup-1\">\u201cThe evidence does not support a conclusion that the claimant as a result of his neurosis had suffered social, personal, or occupational regression of the severity contemplated by the Regulations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">In Branham v. Gardner, supra, we held language identical to that first quoted above from the examiner\u2019s opinion to be reversible error. We said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-9\">\u201cThe foregoing is a completely erroneous statement of what the Act contemplates, since there is no indication in the language of the statute that such findings are necessary.\u201d 383 F.2d at 628.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-10\">We also noted that the mentioned regulation \u201cdoes not state the requirements that must be met * * * but is only advisory or suggestive * * Id., at 627. Likewise, we hold that the examiner in the present case erred in placing undue reliance upon the regulation, and in his above-mentioned requirements relative to neurosis. See Marion v. Gardner, 359 F.2d 175, 181 (8th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b964-12\">3. Other Claimed Errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-13\">We shortly review appellant\u2019s remaining assertions of error. He contends that the Secretary, after finding appellant \u201cno longer able to operate a cutting machine in a coal mine,\u201d did not sustain his burden of showing \u201cthere are job opportunities reasonably available to the applicant in the general area of his residence, which the applicant could perform with his limited capacities. May v. Gardner, 362 F.2d 616, 618 (CA 6, 1966); Massey v. Celebrezze, 345 F.2d 146, 154 (CA 6, 1965).\u201d Nelson v. Gardner, supra, 386 F.2d at 94-95. Appellant cites the ease of Williams v. Celebrezze, 359 F.2d 950 (4th Cir. 1966), which held that the trial examiner\u2019s mere reference to the opinion of a vocational expert with respect to the jobs the claimant could perform, was not a sufficiently definite statement of the examiner\u2019s own findings. The Court said, \u201cWe may not speculate as to his findings.\u201d In the instant case the examiner definitely incorporated the expert\u2019s conclusions as his own. After summarizing the expert\u2019s findings he said: \u201cThe Hearing Examiner * * * finds that the claimant has skills and abilities * * * as stated above * * *.\u201d We find this sufficiently definite. See Newman v. Gardner, 376 F.2d 25, 26 n. 1 (6th Cir. 1967) .</p>\n<p id=\"b964-20\">Appellant also questions the adequacy of the <em>assumption </em>given the expert witness as to the appellant\u2019s existing capacities. The examiner instructed the witness that \u201cthe claimant can no longer work in a coal mine or engage in heavy labor, * * * that he is very nervous.\u201d The expert was also instructed to base his opinion on the testimony and record in the case, and observation of the claimant during the hearing. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>indicated at one point that he also took into account the psychiatrist\u2019s conclusion that appellant had a significant disability due to his combined emotional and physical problems. We think the expert was thereby given sufficient assumption of appellant\u2019s capabilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that jobs available in Huntington, West Virginia, are not within \u201cthe area of his residence,\u201d i. e., Friendly Lick Branch, Martin County, Kentucky. While we do not think the Secretary need have shown jobs to be available in appellant\u2019s home town, see, e. g., Newman v. Gardner, supra, 376 F.2d at 26; Massey v. Cele-brezze, supra, 345 F.2d at 155, we need not consider the question in that the aforementioned amendments to the Social Security Act have clarified the issue by providing that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b965-6\">\u201c(A) an individual * * * shall be determined to be under a disability only if his * * * impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot * * * engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work <em>which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives * </em>* *. For purposes of the preceding sentence * * * <em>\u2018work which exists in the national economy\u2019 means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives </em>or in several regions of the country.\u201d Pub.L. No. 90-248, \u00a7 158(d) (2) (A) (Jan. 2, 1968) (36 U.S.L. Week 39, 54 (Jan. 16, 1968)) (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b965-12\">In this case, we again deal with a young man 37 years of age whose address to us, to the District Judge and to the Secretary, asks that he be found without any useful capacities. See Nelson v. Gardner, supra, 386 F.2d at 94. He argues that he has met his burden in this regard notwithstanding that he has not, since he left his job in 1962 without then reporting any untoward incident, made any effort to find any kind of employment, and his evidence of disabling pain arises from his subjective assertion that it exists. We are of the opinion that there is substantial record evidence from which it could be found that he has not made out a case for recovery. We must reverse, however, because the examiner employed impermissible standards in arriving at his conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-14\">The judgment is reversed, with direction that the matter be remanded for reconsideration by the Secretary, free of the errors noted in this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
