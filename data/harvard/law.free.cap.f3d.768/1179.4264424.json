We dismiss the petitions for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-6\">Butalova, a native and citizen of Slovakia, entered the United States on July 22, 1995, as a nonimmigrant visitor with authorization to remain in the United States until January 21, 1996. Butalova stayed beyond the time permitted. On February 12, 1997, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) issued an Order to Show Cause, stating Butalova was removable under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 241(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(1)(B). Butalova failed to appear at the scheduled hearing; on October 14, 1997, an immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found her removable in absentia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-7\">Over ten years later, on September 28, 2009, Butalova moved to reopen the in absentia decision, because of a lack of notice and for the purpose of seeking an adjustment of status. An IJ denied the motion on October 21, 2009. Butalova appealed; the BIA dismissed the appeal on February 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-8\">On July 1, 2013, Butalova filed a second motion to reopen her removal proceedings and argued she had filed a self-petition for an adjustment to her immigrant status under the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (\u201cVAWA\u201d), Pub.L. No. 103-322, \u00a7 40701(a), 108 Stat.1953-54 (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii)). She asserted she was entitled to relief as a battered spouse, because , her United States-citizen husband had emotionally, physically, and sexually abused her throughout their marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-9\">On August 8, 2013, the BIA denied Butalova\u2019s motion to reopen and held she had failed to establish a prima facie showing she \u201cwas battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty by her spouse,\u201d pursuant to the pertinent regulations. Administrative R. at 28. The BIA further noted Butalova\u2019s self-petition for adjustment of status remained pending with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) and could be pursued independently of her removal proceedings. The BIA further declined to reopen removal proceedings pursuant to its sua sponte authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-11\">On September 6, 2013, Butalova moved for reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s August 8, 2013, decision. She contended reconsideration was warranted, because she had made a prima facie showing she was battered, or was the subject of extreme cruelty, by her United States-citizen spouse. She also argued the USCIS, after considering her evidence, recently found she had established a prima facie case for classification under the self-petitioning provisions of the VAWA. Because the USCIS determined she had established \u201cbattery or extreme cruelty\u201d under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(c)(1), (e)(1), she maintained the BIA had erred by determining her marriage merely had been deteriorating.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-12\">On November 15, 2013, the BIA denied her motion for reconsideration. It determined Butalova had failed to identify any error of fact or law in its August 8, 2013, decision that would warrant reconsideration. The BIA maintained Butalova had failed to make a prima facie showing that she was battered or was the subject of extreme cruelty by her spouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1171-13\">The BIA also treated Butalova\u2019s motion to reconsider as a motion to reopen her removal proceedings, because she had submitted a recently obtained notice from the USCIS to demonstrate a prima facie case of eligibility for relief. The BIA deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1182\">*1182</page-number>mined the USCIS notice showed Butalova\u2019s self-petition was still pending but did not establish a finding of prima facie eligibility for approval of the 1-360 self-petition. Therefore, the BIA denied the motion to reopen. Butalova now petitions for our review of the BIA\u2019s August 8, 2013, decision denying her motion to reopen and its November 15, 2013, decision denying her motion to reconsider and to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-5\">The government argues INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B), deprives us of jurisdiction to review these decisions. It contends the question of whether a petitioner was battered or suffered extreme cruelty by a spouse is discretionary and not subject to judicial review. Butalova has not replied to this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-6\">We review de novo whether we have subject-matter jurisdiction to consider a petition for review. <em>Ruiz v. Gonzales, </em>479 F.3d 762, 765 (11th Cir.2007). Generally, we have jurisdiction to review the denial of a motion to reopen, because the agency\u2019s discretion in denying the motion derives solely from regulations, not statutes. <em>Kucana v. Holder, </em>558 U.S. 233, 247-53, 130 S.Ct. 827, 837-40, 175 L.Ed.2d 694 (2010) (holding actions on motions to reopen, though made discretionary by the Attorney General through regulations, remain subject to judicial review); <em>Ali v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>443 F.3d 804, 808 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Jiang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>568 F.3d 1252, 1256 (11th Cir.2009). The BIA may deny a motion to reopen, if the alien fails to establish a prima facie case. <em>Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-7\">Under the VAWA, an alien may file a petition with the Attorney General for adjustment of immigrant status, if the alien demonstrates her marriage to a United States citizen was in good faith, and the alien \u201chas been battered or has been the subject of extreme cruelty perpetuated by the alien\u2019s spouse\u201d during the marriage. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii). Under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(c)(l)(vi):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1172-9\">[T]he phrase \u201cwas battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty\u201d includes, but is not limited to, being the victim of any act or threatened act of violence, including any forceful detention, which results or threatens to result in physical or mental injury. Psychological or sexual abuse or exploitation, including rape, molestation, incest (if the victim is a minor), or forced prostitution shall be considered acts of violence. Other abusive actions may also be acts of violence under certain circumstances, including acts that, in and of themselves, may not initially appear violent but that are a part of an overall pattern of violence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1172-10\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(c)(l)(vi). When acting on petitions filed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a) (1) (A) (iii), \u201cthe Attorney General shall consider any credible evidence relevant to the petition [and the] determination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence <em>shall be within the sole discretion of </em>the Attorney General.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(J). An alien subject to deportation may file a motion to reopen removal proceedings, if the basis for her motion is to apply for relief under \u00a7 1154(a)(1)(A) as a battered spouse. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iv)(I).</p>\n<p id=\"b1172-11\">We lack jurisdiction to review any BIA decision the INA makes discretionary. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); <em>see Kucana, </em>558 U.S. at 247, 130 S.Ct. at 836-37 (recognizing the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1183\">*1183</page-number>INA bar \u201creview of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute\u201d). When we lack jurisdiction to consider an attack on a final order of removal, we also lack jurisdiction to consider an attack by means of a motion to reopen. <em>Patel v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>334 F.3d 1259, 1262 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-5\">Notwithstanding the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii), we retain jurisdiction to review constitutional challenges and questions of law. INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). An alien, however, does not have a constitutionally protected interest in discretionary forms of relief, such as the granting of a motion to reopen. <em>Scheerer v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>513 F.3d 1244, 1253 (11th Cir.2008). In addition, an argument that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to weigh an alien\u2019s factual scenario presents a \u201cgarden-variety abuse of discretion argument \u2014 which can be made by virtually <em>every </em>alien subject to a final removal order \u2014 [and] does not amount to a legal question under \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).\u201d <em>Alvarez Acosta v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>524 F.3d 1191, 1196-97 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-7\">We have not addressed whether we have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision on a motion to reopen, which asserts for the first time the petitioner \u201chas been battered or has been the subject of extreme cruelty\u201d by the petitioner\u2019s spouse under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(1 )(A)(iii). We have held, however, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen asserting for the first time the petitioner was a battered spouse or subjected to extreme cruelty under a separate statute, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2), cancellation of removal. <em>Guzman-Munoz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>733 F.3d 1311, 1314 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-8\">In <em>Guzman-Munoz, </em>the petitioner, Marina Guzman-Munoz, originally sought relief under the Cuban Refugee Adjustment Act of 1966, Pub.L. No. 89-732, 80 Stat. 1161 (1966) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255 note), based on her marriage to a Cuban national, who was a lawful permanent resident. <em>Id. </em>at 1312. The IJ determined her marriage was a sham and ordered her deported to Peru. <em>Id. </em>The BIA affirmed. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, Guzman-Munoz filed a motion to reopen removal proceedings with the BIA and argued for the first time she was eligible for a special cancellation of removal and adjustment of status as a battered spouse, pursuant to the VAWA and 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). <em>Id. </em>Under \u00a7 1229b(b)(2), the Attorney General may cancel removal of an alien if the alien demonstrates she \u201chas been battered or subjected to extreme cruelty\u201d by her United States-citizen spouse. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2). The BIA denied the motion to reopen and found Guzman-Munoz had failed to establish a prima facie case she was a battered spouse or subjected to extreme cruelty under the VAWA. <em>Guzman-Munoz, </em>733 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-9\">Guzman-Munoz filed a petition for review of the denial of her motion to reopen, but we held we lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s determination she was not a battered spouse. <em>Id. </em>Relying on our earlier decision in <em>Bedoya-Melendez v. U.S. Attorney General, </em>680 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.2012), we decided the BIA\u2019s \u201cbattered-spouse determination\u201d under \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) was a discretionary decision not subject to review under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(i), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i). <em>Guzman-Munoz, </em>733 F.3d at 1313.</p>\n<p id=\"b1173-11\">Although we had \u201conly applied \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(i)\u2019s jurisdiction-stripping provisions for battered-spouse determinations in [the context of petitions for cancel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1184\">*1184</page-number>lation of removal under \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) ], the logical \u2014 indeed, inevitable \u2014 result is to extend it to our review of a denial of a motion to reopen after a petitioner has failed to establish a prima facie case under \u00a7 1229b.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cTo hold otherwise would create an end-run around our holding in <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>because petitioners would be able to obtain appellate-court jurisdiction simply by raising \u00a7 1229b arguments on motions to reopen.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-4\">In view of <em>Guzman-Munoz, </em>we lack jurisdiction to consider the denial of a motion to reopen asserting relief raised for the first time, when the BIA\u2019s resolution of the motion to reopen requires a discretionary determination pertaining to the new relief, distinct from the BIA\u2019s general discretion to deny a motion to reopen. To resolve the jurisdictional issue in this case, we must decide whether the BIA\u2019s determination that Butalova was not battered or subject to extreme cruelty by her United States-citizen spouse under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii) was a discretionary decision not subject to review under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(B)(ii), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-7\">We conclude the BIA\u2019s determination Butalova had not established a prima facie showing she \u201cwas battered by or was the subject of extreme cruelty\u201d by her spouse, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(c)(l)(vi), was a discretionary decision. When acting on self-petitions filed under \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii), the statute states \u201cdetermination of what evidence is credible and the weight to be given that evidence <em>shall be within the sole discretion of the Attorney General.\u201d 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(J) (emphasis added); <em>see R\u00facano, </em>558 U.S. at 247, 130 S.Ct. at 836-37 (noting the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of the INA bar \u201creview of discretionary decisions only when Congress itself set out the Attorney General\u2019s discretionary authority in the statute\u201d). Moreover, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229b(b)(2) and 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii) contain nearly identical language, and \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) does not establish an objective legal standard on which a court may base its review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-11\">In <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>we held the BIA\u2019s battered-spouse determination under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(2) was discretionary, because \u201cbattered\u201d and \u201csubjected to extreme cruelty\u201d were not self-explanatory and reasonable minds could differ as to their meanings. <em>Bedoya-Melendez, </em>680 F.3d at 1325. We also rejected the contention that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 204.2(c)(l)(vi), which was promulgated under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1154, the statute at issue in this case, created an objective legal standard on which a court could review a battered-spouse determination. <em>Id. </em>at 1327-28. Instead, we held the regulation merely suggested how the Attorney General should exercise discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 1328.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1174-12\">Consequently, we lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s August 8, 2013, decision denying Butalova\u2019s motion to reopen, because the BIA\u2019s battered-spouse determination under \u00a7 1154(a)(l)(A)(iii) was discretionary. We similarly lack jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s November 15, 2013, decision denying Butalova\u2019s subsequent motion to reconsider and to reopen. <em>Cf. Patel, </em>334 F.3d at 1262 (recognizing we may not review a decision denying a motion to reopen if we would also lack jurisdiction to review the underlying order of removal).</p>\n<p id=\"b1174-13\">Although we retain jurisdiction over constitutional issues and questions of law under INA \u00a7 242(a)(2)(D), 8 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1185\">*1185</page-number>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D), Butalova has raised no issue that falls within that jurisdiction. <em>See Alvarez Acosta, </em>524 F.3d at 1196-97; <em>Scheerer, </em>513 F.3d at 1253.
