The tenant under each lease, A. E. Investment Corporation, claims that the leases were void under sec. 235.01 (5), Stats. 1969, because they were not countersigned by the corporate secretaries of the respective landlords.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-9\">The issue was tried separately by stipulation of the parties prior to trial on the merits. The trial court\u2019s order determined that the leases were not void for want of compliance with the statute. The order further provided \u201cThis ruling shall not, however, be construed as an interpretation of any rights that may flow from the leases'. . . .\u201d The order is not appealable under sec. 274.33, Stats., and it is not an interlocutory judgment under sec. 270.54. <em>Northland Greyhound Lines v. Blinco </em>(1956), 272 Wis. 29, 74 N. W. 2d 796; <em>Glens Falls Ins. Co. v. Concrete Research </em>(1973), 57 Wis. 2d 744, 205 N.
