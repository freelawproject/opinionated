That the petitioner had a clear, adequate, and complete remedy, by applying to Mr. Justice Brewer, the justice assigned to the eighth circuit, for the approval of the bond.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-6\">Second. That under paragraph 2 of Rule 36 of this court, the matter of admitting to bail and approving the bond was a matter requiring the exercise of judicial power and discretion, involving the decision of questions of law and the ascertainment of facts, and could not be controlled by writ of mandamus.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-7\">Third. That the bond, if given, would be void, because by paragraph 2 of Rule 36 a person convicted and sentenced for crime could only be admitted to bail after citation served.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-8\">Fourth. That the bond would be void, because, by paragraph 2 of Rule 36, Mr. Justice White, not being the justice of this court assigned to the eighth circuit, (according to the last allotment, made April 2, 1894, 152 U. S. 711,) nor a judge of the Circuit Court of that circuit, nor the district judge of any district in that circuit, had no authority to make the order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-9\">Fifth. That paragraph 2 of Rule 36 was void, for want of power in this court, either by the common law, or under any act of Congress, to order bail to be taken after conviction and sentence of such a crime as that of which the petitioner had been convicted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-10\">The District Judge, in concluding his return, submitted the questions involved to the judgment of this court; stated that he would, as a matter of course, enforce by order any decision given by this court in the premises; and prayed to be dismissed without day.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b302-11\">The petitioner demurred to the return.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b302-12\"><em>Mr. William M.

Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 14; 1 Stat. 81, 82; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 716; <em>Stockton </em>v. Bishop, 2 How. 74; <em>Hardeman </em>v. <em>Ande</em>rson, 4 How. 640; <em>Ex parte Milwaukee </em>Railroad, 5 Wall. 188. Under the first judiciary' act, this court had power \u201c to make and establish all necessary rules for the orderly conducting of business \u201d in all the courts of the United States. Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 17; 1 Stat. 83. And successive statutes recognized its power to make rules, not inconsistent with the laws of . the United States, prescribing the forms of writs and other process, at common law, as well as in equity or admiralty, in those courts. Acts of May 8, 1792, c. 36, \u00a7 2; 1 Stat. 276; May 19, 1828, c. 68, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3; 4 Stat. 281; August 23, 1842, c. 188, \u00a7 6; 5 Stat. 518; <em>Wayman </em>v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 27-29; <em>Bank of United States </em>v. <em>Halstead, </em>10 Wheat. 51; <em>Beers </em>v. <em>Haughton, </em>9 Pet. 329, 360; <em>Ward </em>v. <em>Chamberlain, </em>2 Black, 430, 436. Since the act of June 1, 1872, c. 255, \u00a7 5, indeed, the practice, pleadings, and forms and modes of proceeding, in actions at law in the Circuit and District Courts of the United States, are required to conform, as near as may be, to those existing at the time in like causes in the courts of record of the State within which they are held, any rule of court to the contrary notwithstanding. 17 Stat. 197; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 914. But this act does not include the manner of bringing cases from a lower court of the United States to this court. <em>Chateaugay Co., petitioner, </em>128 U. S. 544; <em>Fishburn </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp;c. Railway, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>137 U. S. 60. Under section 917 of the Revised Statutes, therefore, by which (reenacting to this extent the provision of the act of 1842) \u201cthe Supreme Court shall have power to prescribe, from time to time, and in any manner not inconsistent with any law of the United States, the forms of writs and other process,\u201d this court has power to regulate the manner of proceeding, or \u201c mode of process,\u201d in taking bail, upon writs of error from this .court to the Circuit Court or District Court, in civil or criminal cases. Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, \u00a7 33; 1 Stat. 91; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1014; <em>Beers </em>v. <em>Haughton, </em>above cited; <em>United States </em>v. Knight, 14 Pet. 301; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rundlett, </em>2 Curtis, 41.</p>\n<p id=\"AxLb\">By section 4 of the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, the review, by appeal, writ of error, or otherwise, of judgments of the Circuit Courts or District Courts, can be had. only in this court, or in the Circuit Courts of Appeals, according to the provisions of this act. By section ' 5, \u201c appeals or writs .of error' may be taken from \u201d the Circuit Courts or District Courts \u201c direct to \u201d this court \u201c in cases of conviction of a capital or otherwise infamous crime,\u201d as Veil as in certain other classes of cases. 26 Stat. 827. And by section 11, \u201c all provisions of law, now in force, regulating the methods and system of review, through appeals or writs of error, shall regulate the methods and system of appeals and writs of error provided for in this act in respect of the Circuit Courts of Appeals, including all provisions for bonds or other securities to be required and taken on such appeals and writs of error.\u201d 26 Stat; 829. But as to the methods and system of review, through appeals or writs of error, including the citations, supersedeas, and bond or other security, in cases, either civil or criminal, brought to this court from the Circuit Court or the District Court, Congress made no provision in this act, evidently considering those matters to be covered and regulated by the provisions of. earlier statutes forming parts of one system.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">By those statutes, upon writs of error from this court to the. Circuit Courts br District Courts of the United States, as well as upon writs of error \u25a0 from, this court to the courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>the several States, any justice of this court \u2014 not necessarily the justice assigned to the circuit in which the other court is held \u2014 may, in or out of court, allow the writ of error, sign the citation, take the requisite security for the prosecution of the writ of error, and grant a supersedeas when the writ of error does not of itself operate as a stay of proceedings, as it does if filed and security given within sixty day's after the judgment complained of. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 999, 1000, 1002, 1003, 1007; <em>Sage </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>96 U. S. 712; <em>Hudgins </em>v. <em>Kemp, </em>18 How. 530; <em>Peugh </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>110 U. S. 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">In <em>Claasen\u2019s case, 140 U. S. </em>200, it was adjudged, upon full consideration, that by the act of 1891 a writ of error from this court to the Circuit Court, in the case of a conviction of a crime infamous but not capital, was a matter of right, without giving any security; that the citation might be signed by a justice of this court, under Rev. Stat. \u00a7 999; that a supersedeas might be granted, not only by this court, under \u00a7 716, but by a justice thereof, under \u00a7 1000 ; and that, if the justice signing the citation directed that it should operate as a supersedeas, the supersedeas might be obtained by merely serving the writ within the time. prescribed in \u00a7 1007. .Mr. Justice Blatch-ford, in delivering the unanimous judgment of the court accordingly, said: \u201c To remove all doubt on the subject, however, in future cases, we have adopted a general rul\u00e9, which is promulgated as Rule 36 of this court, and which embraces, also, the power to admit the defendant to bail after the citation is served.\u201d 140 U. S. 205, 207, 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">By that rule, which was promulgated May 11, 1891, the same day on which that judgment was delivered, \u201c An appeal or a writ of error from a circuit court or a district court direct to this court,\u201d in the cases provided for in sections 5 and 6 of the act of 1891, \u201c may be allowed, in term time or in vacation, by any justice of this court, - or by any circuit judge within' his circuit, or by any district judge within his district, and the proper security be taken and the citation signed by him, and he may also grant a supersedeas and stay of execution or of proceedings, pending such writ of -error or appeal.\u201d And by paragraph 2 of the sam\u00e9 rul\u00e9, \u201cWhere such writ <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>of error is allowed in the case \u00f3f a conviction of an infamous crime, or in any other criminal case in which.it will lie under said sections 5 and 6, the Circuit Court, or District Court, or any justice or judge thereof, shall have power, after the citation is served, to admit the accused to bail in such amount as may.be fixed.\u201d 139 U. S. 706.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">This court cannot, indeed, by rule, enlarge or restrict its own inherent jurisdiction and powers, or those of the other courts of the United States, or of a justice or judge of either, under the Constitution and laws of the United States. <em>Poultney </em>v. <em>La Fayette, </em>12 Pet. 472; <em>The St. </em>Lawrence, 1 Black, 522, 526; <em>The </em>Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 576, 579. Nor has it assumed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">On the contrary, the rule in question was adopted by this court under and pursuant to its power to make rules, prescribing the forms of writs and process, and regulating the practice upon appeals or writs of error; and was so framed as to give effect to the appellate jurisdiction conferred by the act of 1891, in the manner most consistent with the provisions of the various acts of Congress concerning the same matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">There can be no doubt, therefore, that under the acts of Congress, the decision of this court in <em>Claasen\u2019s </em>case, above cited, and the first paragraph of Rule 36, Mr. Justice White, although not the justice of this court assigned to the eighth circuit, was authorized to allow the writ of error, to operate as a supersedeas, and to sign the citation.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">The next question is of the validity of his order, so far as regards admitting the prisoner to bail pending the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">Recurring once more to Rule 36, and to the decision in <em>Claasen\u2019s </em>case, which were considered and promulgated together, and mutually serve to explain each other, the matter stands thus: The first paragraph of\u2019 the rule, embracing all cases, civil or criminal, of which this court has appellate jurisdiction under the act of 1891, provides that the writ of error may be allowed, in term time or vacation, \u201c and the proper security be taken,\u201d the citation signed, \u25a0 and a supersedeas granted, <em>\u201c </em>by any justice of this court.\u201d In <em>Claasen\u2019s case, </em>it was held that, in the case of an infamous crime, the writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>error was a matter of right, and that no security, such as is necessary in a civil- case, was required. The only \u201c proper security,\u201d then, in a criminal case, is security for the appearance of a prisoner admitted to bail. Within the very terms of the rule, therefore, any justice of this court, although not assigned to the particular circuit, would seem to have the power to permit bail to be taken. But the power rests upon broader grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">The statutes of 'the United States have been framed upon the theory that a person accused of crime shall not, until he has been finally adjudged guilty in the court of last resort, b\u00e9 absolutely compelled to undergo imprisonment or punishment, but may be-admitted to bail, not only after arrest and before trial, but after conviction and pending a writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">The statutes as to bail upon arrest and before trial provide that <em>\u201c </em>bail may be admitted \u201d upon all arrests in capital cases, and <em>\u201c </em>shall be admitted \u201d upon all arrests in other criminal cases; and may be taken in capital cases by this court, or by a justice thereof, or by a circuit court, a circuit judge or a district judge, and in other criminal cases by any justice or judge of the United States or other magistrate named. Rev; Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 1014-1016.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">Under the act-of March 3, 1879, c. 176, upon writs of error from the Circuit Court to review judgments of the District Court upon convictions in criminal cases, the justice of this court assigned to the circuit, or the circuit judge \u2014 that is to say, any member of the appellate court, except the district judge, presumably the judge who rendered the judgment below \u2014 might allow the writ, to operate as a supersedeas, and might take bail for the defendant\u2019s appearance in the Circuit Court. 20 Stat. 354; <em>United States </em>v. Whittier, 11 Bissell, 356. And upon a writ of error from this court to the .highest court of a State to review a decision against a right claimed under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and Avhich lies both in criminal and in civil cases, and operates as a supersedeas under the same circumstances in the one as in the other, bail may be taken pending the writ of error; but, because of the relation between the two governments, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>the court of the State only, it <em>being </em>enacted by <em>the </em>act of July 13, 1866, c. 184, \u00a7 69, in accordance with the practice previously prevailing in some States, that the plaintiff in error, if charged with an offence bailable by the laws of the State, shall not be released from custody until final judgment upon the writ of error, \u201c or until a bond, with sufficient sureties, in a reasonable sum, as ordered and approved by the state court, shall be given; \u201d or, if the offence is not so bailable, until such final judgment. 14 Stat. 172; Rev. Stat. \u00a7 1017; <em>Cohens </em>v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264; <em>Worcester </em>v. Georgia, 6 Pet. 515, 537, 562, 567; <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Bates, </em>12 Allen, 201. By these statutes, bail after conviction was provided for in every class <em>of </em>writs of error pending in the courts of the United States in cases of bailable offences; for, when they were enacted, no writ of error lay from this court to the Circuit Court or District Court in any criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">By the act of February 6, 1889, c. 113, \u00a7 6, it was enacted that final judgments of any court of the United States upon conviction of a crime punishable with death might, upon the application of the defendant, be reviewed by this court \u201cupon a writ of error, under such rules and regulations as said court may prescribeand that every such writ of error should \u201c be allowed as of right, and without the requirement of any security for the prosecution of the same, or for costs; \u201d and should \u201c during its pendency operate as a stay of proceedings upon the judgment, in respect of which it is sued out,\u201d and might be immediately filed in this court; but should not be sued out or granted, except upon a petition filed, with the clerk of the court in which the trial was had, during the same term, or within sixty days after its expiration. 25 Stat. 656.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Although that act expressly recognized the power of this court to make rules regulating the proceedings upon writs of error in capital cases, yet, as by its terms the writ was to be allowed as of right, without requiring any security, and was of itself to operate as a stay of proceedings, no rule upon the subject was considered necessary, and none was made by this court. It can hardly be doubted, however, that Congress intended that the allowance of the writ, of error and stay of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>proceedings, while suspending the execution of the sentence, should neither have the effect of discharging the prisoner from custody, nor of preventing his being admitted to bail, upon sufficient cause shown, pending the writ of error; and, no special provision upon the subject of bail in a capital case after conviction having been made by act of Congress or rule of court, it would seem that it ifiight be taken by the justice or judge who allowed the writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">But, however it may be in a capital case, it is quite clear; in view of all the legislation on the subject of bail, that Congress must have intended that under the act of 1891, in cases of crimes not capital, and therefore bailable of right before conviction, bail might be taken, upon writ of error, by order of the proper court, justice or judge. And we are of opinion that any justice of this court, having power, by the acts of Congress, to allow the writ of error,- to issue the citation,-to take the security required by law, and to grant a supersedeas, has the authority, as incidental to the exercise of this power, to order the plaintiff in error to be admitted to bail, independently of any rule of court upon the subject; and that this authority is recognized in the first paragraph of Eule 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">Having-the authority to order bail to be taken, the same justice might either himself approve the bail bond; or he height order that such a bond should be taken in an amount fixed by him, the form of the bond and the sufficiency of the sureties to be passed upon by the court whose judgment was to be reviewed, or by a judge of that court; or he might leave the whole matter of bail to be dealt with by such court or judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">Upon a writ of error in a civil case, the requisite security is ordinarily taken by the justice or judge who allows the writ and signs the citation. <em>Jerome </em>v. McCarter, 21 Wall. 17. But where the bond taken is insufficient in law, this court, in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction as a court of error, may direct that the writ be dismissed, unless the plaintiff in error gives security sufficient in this respect, to be taken and approved by any justice or judge who is authorized to allow the writ of error and citation. <em>Catlett </em>v. <em>Brodie, </em>9 Wheat. 553, 555; O<em>'Reilly </em>v. Edrington, 96 U. S. 724.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>This court, in the lawful exercise of its power to prescribe the forms of pi\u2019ocess and to regulate the practice upon writs of error, has said, in paragraph .2 of Rule 36, that, in the case of a conviction of an infamous crime, <em>\u201c </em>the Circuit Court, or District Court, or any justice or judge thereof, shall have power, after the citation is served, to admit the accused to bail in such amount as may be fixed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">The necessary consequence is that that part of the order of Mr. Justice White, which required \u201c the defendant to furnish bond in the sum of five thousand dollars, conditioned according to law, subject to approval by the District Judge,\u201d was a. valid exercise of his authority to order bail, in an amount fixed by him, to be taken by the District Judge, leaving the form of the bond, and the sufficiency of the sureties, to be passed upon by the latter.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">A writ of error, allowed out of court, is neither considered as brought, even for the purpose of computing the time of limitation of suing it out, nor does it operate as a supersedeas, until it has been filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the court to which it is addressed. <em>Credit Co. </em>v. <em>Arkansas Railway, </em>128 U. S. 258, 260, and cases cited; <em>Foster </em>v. <em>Kansas, </em>112 U. S. 201. By the order of Mr. Justice White, the allowance of the writ of error, to operate as a supersedeas, was not to take effect until the approval of the bond by the District Judge; and when the bond was presented to the District Judge for approval, the writ of error had been filed in the clerk\u2019s office of the District Court, and the citation had been issued and served. The objection that the petitioner could only be admitted to bail after citation served has therefore no application to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq-\">The discretion of a judge, indeed, in a matter entrusted by law to his judicial determination, cannot be controlled by writ of mandamus. But if he declines to exercise his discretion, or to act at all, when it is his duty to do so, a writ of mandamus may be issued to compel him to act. For instance, a writ of mandamus will lie to compel a judge to settle and sign a bill of exceptions, although not to control his discretion as to the frame of the bill. <em>Ex parte Bradstreet, </em>4 Pet. 102; <em>Ex parte </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>Crane, 5 Pet. 190; <em>Chateaugay Co., petitioner, </em>128 U. S. <em>544, 557. </em>See also <em>Ex parte Morgan, </em>114 U. S. 174; <em>Ex parte Parker, </em>120 U. S. 737; <em>Parker, petitioner, </em>131 U. S. 221; <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Paul, </em>148 U. S. 107, 123, 124.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">If, as suggested in the return, the petitioner is also in custody under a subsequent conviction for another offence, that custody will not be affected by admitting him to bail in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">\u25a0 Were the question here only as to what persons should be accepted as sureties on the bond, or as to their sufficiency, there would be no ground for issuing a writ of mandamus. <em>Ex parte Taylor, </em>14 How. 3; <em>Ex parte Milwaukee Railroad, 5 </em>Wall. 188. But in the case before us, the District Judge has not exercised any discretion in the matter, but has declined to act at all, and has refused to approve the bond, solely because, in his' own words, \u201c it is found by \u201d him that the order of Mr. Justice White was made without authority of law, and that the bond, if approved, would be void.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">As the District Judge, in so refusing to approve the bond, appears to have acted under a misunderstanding of the powers of this court and of its justices, and of his own duty in the premises, and as in his return he expresses his readiness to enforce any decision of this court, it appears to us to be more just to him, as well as more consistent with the maintenance of the rightful authority of this court, to sustain this petition, and enable bail to be taken before him in accordance with the order heretofore made, than to dismiss these proceedings, and to deal with the matter over his head, as it were, by having .the petitioner admitted to bail by this court, or by the justice thereof assigned to the eighth circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">We do not anticipate that there will be any occasion for the actual issue of a writ of peremptory mandamus; but, should it become necessary to do so in order to secure the rights of the petitioner, his counsel may move for the writ at any time. The present order will be</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\"><em>Petitioner entitled to writ of mandamus to the District Judge to admit the petitioner to bail on his giving bond in proper form and with sufficient </em>sureties..</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>Mr. Justice Brewer,</author>\n<p id=\"A4n\">with, whom concurred</p>\n<judges id=\"A_d\">Mr. Justice Brown, dissenting.</judges>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">I am unable to concur in all the views expressed in the \u2022opinion of the court. Agreeing that this court has power to admit to bail in criminal cases pending proceedings in error, I reach this conclusion in a different way, and deduce the right to let to bail solely from the grant of jurisdiction over the proceedings in error. As said in <em>Ex parte Dyson, </em>25 Mississippi, 356, 359 : \u201cThe right of a prisoner to bail, after conviction, is not regulated by the Constitution or by statute, and is governed by the rules and practice of the common law. It seems to be fully and clearly established that the Court of King\u2019s Bench could bail in all cases whatsoever, according to the principles of the common law; the action of that court not being controlled by the various statutes enacted on the subject of bail, but regulated and governed entirely by a sound judicial discretion on the subject. 2 Hale P. C. 129; 4 Co. Inst. 71; 4 Com. Dig. 6, tit. (f. 3;) 1 Bacon\u2019s Ab. 483-493; 2 Hawk. P. C. 170; Cowp. 333. In the exercise of this discretion the court in some instances admitted to bail, even after verdict, in cases of felony, whenever a special motive existed to induce the court to grant it. 1 Bac. Abr. 489-490; 2 Hawk. P. C. 170.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">So, when jurisdiction is given over proceedings in error in criminal cases, that jurisdiction carries with it, by implication, the power to make all orders necessary and proper not merely for bringing up the record, but also for the custody of the defendant pending the hearing of his allegations of error. But that jurisdiction is vested in this court as a court, and not in any single justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">There have been five separate enactments of Congress in reference to the letting to bail and the review of judgments in criminal cases. First, for bail before trial. (Secs. 1014, 1015, and 1016, Rev. Stat.) These sections name' the judicial officers by whom bajl may be taken. Second, in respect to judgments in criminal cases in the state courts, brought here on error. (Sec. 1017, Rev. Stat.) In this section there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>specific provision in reference to the matter of bail. Third, the act of March 3, 1879, c. 176, providing for a review by the Circuit Court of judgments in the District \u2022 Court in criminal cases. 20 Stat. 354. In this act express authority is given for bail, and the officers named by whom such bail may be taken.. Fourth, the act of February 6,1889, c. 113, 25 Stat. 655, granting a writ of error from this court to bring up the judgments of any inferior courts of the United States in capital cases.. Nothing is said in this act in respect to the matter of bail, but the allowance of the writ is made to operate as a stay of proceedings. Fifth, tljp act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, \u2014 the act under which this controversy has arisen \u2014 which provides for a review by this court of the final judgments of Circuit or District Courts in cases of \u201c convictions of capital or otherwise infamous crimes.\u201d In this statute also there is no mention of bail.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">I fail to appreciate the argument that because Congress has made specific provision for bail in criminal cases before conviction, it is to be assumed that it intended that bail should likewise be allowed in all cases after conviction; or that, because in two statutes, contemplating review of judgments in criminal cases, it made like specific provision, in respect to letting to bail, it intended the same grant of power in two other and later statutes granting a right of review \u2014 in which it said nothing in respect to bail. In other words, an omission apparently made <em>ex industria </em>implies the same intention as an express provision fully stated. On the contrary, as I understand it, the logic of' all differences in substantial provisions between earlier and later statutes is indicative of difference rather than identity of purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u201cIndeed, the words of a statute, when unambiguous, are the true guide to the legislative will. That they differ from the words of a prior statute on the same subject, is an intimation that they are to have a <em>different </em>and not the <em>same </em>construction.\u201d <em>Rich </em>v. Keyser, 54 Penn. St. 86, 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">Where the later of two acts upon limited partnerships omitted the infliction, prescribed by the earlier, of a penalty for the omission of certain matters required by both, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>said: \u201cWe must presume that the [earlier] act . . and the decisions Under it were well known to the law makers at the time the [later] act ... . was passed. The omission to prescribe the penalty ... is good reason for concluding that no such liability was intended.\u201d <em>Eliot </em>v. <em>Himrod, </em>108 Penn. St. 569, 573. See Endlich on the Interpretation of Statutes, \u00a7 384.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Neither can I gather from the legislation authorizing bail before trial, or that provision for bail in cases brought to this court from conviction in state tribunals, or that authorizing bail in cases taken from the District to the Circuit Court, the evidence.of a settled policy on the part of Congress that bail should be allowed in all cases, capital or otherwise, brought here on error from a final judgment of the Circuit or District Court. Indeed, with reference to this matter of policy it was well said in <em>Hadden </em>v. <em>The </em>Collector, 5 Wall. 107, 111: \u201c What is termed the policy of the government with reference to any particular legislation is generally a very uncertain thing, upon which all sorts of opinion, each variant from the other, may be formed by different persons. It is a ground much too unstable upon which to rest the judgment of the court in the interpretation of statutes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">Nevertheless, I agree with the majority, that this court has power to prescribe by rule all matters of detail in respect to procedure which are not in terms fixed or denied by statute. It has exercised such power and passed a rule concerning the letting to bail in which, as I have hitherto supposed, it determined the whole matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">It is idle to say that there is no difference between the supersedeas of a judgment and the letting to bail. When a sentence of death is stayed by this court, it does not follow, as a matter of course, that the party sentenced is to be discharged from custody and permitted to go where he pleases; and the same is true in case of a sentence to confinement and hard labor in the penitentiary. The stay of execution simply prevents the hanging or the removal of the party to the penitentiary. But it is unnecessary in view of the language of this court to make any argument to show that the two things are different. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number><em>In re </em>Claasen, 140 U. S. 200, 208, the court said: \u201c We hold, therefore, that the allowance of the <em>supersedeas </em>in the present case was proper, and we deny the motion to set it aside. To remove all doubt on the subject, however, in future cases, we have adopted a general rule, which is promulgated as Rule 36 of this court, (see 139 U. S. 706,) and which embraces, also, the power to admit the defendant to bail after the citation served.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The rule there indicated \"was put into two paragraphs, one of -which provides .among other things for a supersedeas and the other for admitting to bail. This court then, certainly, understood that there was a difference between the two, and did not add a second paragraph to regulate a matter which was fully regulated by the first. It is also true that in the first paragraph provision is made for the taking of security, but taking security is not technically letting to bail, and the provision in reference to security evidently refers to those cases in which the sentence of the trial court directs the payment of a fine. In respect to such a sentence, \u201c security \u201d is an apt and suitable word.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">Now, the idea of a rule is that it makes full provision for everything -within the scope of its general purpose, and when this court, by the second paragraph, named certain judicial officers as the ones to admit to bail, it was a declaration, first, that this court had power to pass such a rule; and, second, upon the principle, <em>expressio unius exelusio </em>alterius, that it had named therein all the judicial officers who were to exercise that particular authority. There is in its language nothing to suggest that it was intended 'to be cumulative, or that in addition to certain officers given by law the right to admit to bail, other officers were by it given the like power. It is well to note the very words of the rule: \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-7\">\u201c 1. An appeal or a writ of error from a Circuit Court or a District Court direct to this court, in the cases provided for in sections 5 and 6 of the act entitled \u2018An act to establish Circuit Courts of Appeals, and to define and regulate in certain cases the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States, and for other purposes,\u2019 approved March 3, 1891, may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>be allowed, in term time or in vacation, by any Justice of this court, or by any Circuit Judge within his circuit, or by any District Judge within his district, and the proper'security be taken and the citation signed by him, and he may also grant a supersedeas and stay of execution'or of proceedings, pending such Avrit of error or appeal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b316-5\">\u201c 2. Where such writ of error is alloAved in the case of a conviction of an infamous crime, or in any other criminal case in Avhich it will lie under said sections 5 and 6, the Circuit Court or District Court, or any justice or judge thereof, shall have power, after the citation is served, to admit the accused to bail in such amount as may be fixed.\u201d \u2022</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">No one can read this rule, and particularly the second paragraph, Avithout understanding that by it this court had named the officers, and the only officers, who should have the power to admit to bail. Certainly such has been the understanding of bench and bar through the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Simmons, 47 </em>Fed. Rep. 723, 724, Judge Benedict says: \u201c The rules of the Supreme Court of the United States (Buie 36) permit persons convicted, when they appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, to be admitted t\u00f3 bail, but leave the question of admitting to bail to the discretion of the court beloAv.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Can there be any doubt as to the meaning of the second paragraph ? It says: \u201c The Circuit Court or\u2019 District Court, or any justice or judge thereof.\u201d Surely, that does not mean any Circuit Court or any District-Court, or any justice or any judoj-e thereof, but the court in Avhich the case was tried. If it was intended by the second paragraph to give to any justice of this court the poAver to admit to bail, Avhy was not the language of the first paragraph repeated, or a mere reference made to the Avords of description therein? Why Avas the careful language used which unquestionably limits t\u00f3 the judicial officers of the circuit in Avhich the case Avas tried? It says \u201cany justice or judge thereof.\u201d Section 605, Bevised Statutes, contains these Avords : \u201c The AAords \u2018 circuit justice \u2019 and \u2018justice of a circuit,\u2019 Avhen used in this title, shall be understood to designate the justice of the Supreme Court who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>is allotted to any circuit.\u201d Did not this court, when it framed this paragraph, understand what the statute had declared to be the meaning of the words \u201cjustice of a circuit?\u201d If the power belonged to all the justices of the court, either independently of the rule or by virtue of the first paragraph, why in this second paragraph mention the justice of the circuit? I confess my inability to see any reason therefor.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Hence I am forced to the conclusion that if the order of Mr. Justice \"White, who was not the justice of the eighth circuit, is to be construed as a command in respect to bail, it was beyond the scope of the rule. I think, however \u2014 and in this I must also differ from the majority \u2014 that, reasonably construed, it may be taken as a supersedeas, the power to grant which is unquestioned, and a reference of the matter of bail to the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">Indeed, the conclusion reached by the court seems to work out this curious result, that one judge, by virtue of his power to allow a writ of error, can command another judge to perform the ministerial duty of approving a bail bond. Suppose a criminal case is tried by a justice of this court while holding the Circuit Court, can it be that the circuit judge, exercising the power given to him by the first paragraph of this rule, can allow a writ of error, anc <em>&gt; </em>ouple with it a command to the circuit justice to approve a bail bond against his judgment of- the propriety of letting to bail, and such command be enforced by a writ of mandamus from this court ? I submit the query without further comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">I am authorized to say that Mr. Justice Brown concurs in these views.</p>\n<judges id=\"b317-8\">Mr. Justice \"White took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
