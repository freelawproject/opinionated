J. Kelly,. Jr., and others, tenants and lessees of Kelly, to recover the land described in the declaration. The defence pleaded not guilty, and also filed two pleas to the jurisdiction of the court. These pleas averred that for ten years prior to the commencement of the action in ejectment the Virginia Coal and Iron Company, a corporation existing under the laws of Virginia and a citizen of Virginia, had been claiming title to the lands of the defendant Kelly described in the declaration; that immediately preceding the commencement of the action the Virginia Coal and Iron Company, its stockholders, officers, and members, organized, under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Mining and Manufacturing Company, to which the Virginia Company conveyed-said land in order to enable the Lehigh Company to institute suit in the Circuit Court, said Lehigh Company being Simply another name for the Virginia Company, being composed of the same parties, and organized alone for the purpose of taking a conveyance of the land from the Virginia Company, and the Virginia Company making the conveyance, fraud\u00falently and collusively, for the purpose of conferring \u25a0 jurisdiction on the Circuit Court. Issue was joined upon the pleas, and on the-30th day of May,. 1894, was tried by the court, Hon. John Paul, District Judge,: holding the Circuit Court, presiding, upon an agreed statement of facts, which recited, among other things, that the Lehigh Company in the month of February, 1893, was organized under, the laws of Pennsylvania by the individual stockholders and officers of the Virginia Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Virginia and a citi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>zen of that State, and that the land in controversy was conveyed by the Yirginia Company to the Lehigh Company; \u201cthat the purpose of organizing said Lehigh Mining and Manufacturing Company, and in making to it said conveyance, was to give to this court jurisdiction in this case, .but that said conveyance-passed to said Lehigh Mining and Manufacturing Company, all of the right, title, and interest of said Yirginia Coal and Iron Company in and to said land, and that since said conveyance, said Yirginia Coal and Iron Company has had no interest in said land, and has not and never has had any interest in this suit, and that it owns none of the stock of the Lehigh Mining and Manufacturing Company and has no interest therein whatever.\u201d The court, being of opinion that \u201c the organization by the individual stockholders- and officers of \u00e1 corporation existing under the laws of one State of a corporation under the laws of another State, for the express purpose of bringing a suit in the Federal court to try \u2022the title to' a tract of land claimed by the former corporation and conveyed to the latter after its organization and before suit brought, will not enable the grantee to maintain a suit in ejectment in such'court;\u201d that the suit, did not really and substantially involve a dispute or controversy properly within the jurisdiction of the court; and that the plaintiff had been collusively made a party to it for the purpose of making a case cognizable in the Federal court, sustained the pleas and dismissed the action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-4\">The judgment of the court was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">\u201c This day came again the.parties by their attorneys, and on motion of the defendants to dismiss this suit, because instituted and \u25a0 prosecuted in fraud of the jurisdiction of the court, by cons\u00e9nt of -the parties the.cause came on to be heard upon the two pleas in writing to the jurisdiction heretofore filed in the case, at the proper time, .and general replication thereto, and the agreed-statement of facts signed by th\u00e9 attorneys and filed therein, the exceptions indorsed thereon ; and the court having fully'considered the said.two pleas, the agreed statement of facts aforesaid, and the exception to a certain paragraph in the said agreed statement of facts, and argument of counsel, doth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>consider that the said exceptions are not well taken and overrule the same.

S. 324, we held that in the instance of an appeal or writ of error from a Circuit Court upon the question of jurisdiction under the fifth section of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, a certificate by the Circuit Court presenting such question for determination was required in order to invoke the exercise by this court of its appellate jurisdiction. The first of the six classes of cases described in that section in which a writ of error or appeal could be taken or brought directly to this court from the Circuit Courts was : \u201c In any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue; in such case the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision.\u201d We were of opinion that the intention of Congress as to the certification mentioned in that section, and also in' section six in relation to the Circuit Courts of Appeals, was to be arrived at in the light of the rules theretofore prevailing in reference to certificates on division of opinion. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 650, 651, 652, 693,697. In reference to such certificates it was provided that the point on which the disagreement occurred should be certified during the trial term, and it is argued that by analogy \u2022the certificate of the Circuit Courts, under the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, must also be made at the term at which the final judgment or decree is entered ; and, moreover, that as, after the close of such term, the parties are out of court and the litigation th\u00e9re at an end, the court has no power to grant such certificate, and cannot certify, <em>mino pro tuno, </em>if no such certificate was made or intended to be made at the term, as was the case here. But it is unnecessary to determine how this maybe, as we think the District Judge was quite right in holding that the question had already been sufficiently certified. The question involved was only the question of jurisdiction, and the judgment not only recited that for reasons in writing, filed as part of the order, the court considered that it had no jurisdiction of the case, and therefore dismissed it for want of jurisdiction ; but the District Judge certified in the bill of exceptions that it was \u201c held that the court did not have jurisdiction of the suit, and ordered the same to be dismissed\u201d; and, in the order allowing the writ of error, certified in effect that it \u2022 was allowed \u201c upon the question of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">We observed in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jahn, </em>155 U. S. 109, 112, that the provision that any case in which the question of jurisdiction is in issue may be taken directly to this court, necessarily extends to other cases than those in which the final judgment rests on the ground of want of jurisdiction, for in them that, would be the sole question, and the certificate, though requisite to our jurisdiction under the statute, would not be in itself essential, however valuable in the, interest of brevity of record. But in such other cases, the requirement that the question of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>jurisdiction alone should be certified for decision was intended to operate as a limitation upon the jurisdiction of this court of the entire case and of all questions involved in it, a jurisdiction which can be exercised in any other class of cases \u2022 taken directly to this court under section five.\u201d If in this case the jurisdiction had been sustained and the defendants had preserved the question by certificate in the form of a bill of exceptions and the cause had subsequently, proceeded, to a final decree against them, it would seem that they could have brought the case, at the proper time, oh the question of jurisdiction solely, directly to this court, although not compelled to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">At all events, where the question is certified as it was here, we think the requisition of the statute sufficiently complied with. <em>Leave denied.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
