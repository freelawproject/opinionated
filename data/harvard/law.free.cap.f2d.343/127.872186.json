This conviction was affirmed by this Court, 335 F.2d 414 (2d Cir.), and a petition for certiorari was denied 379 U.S. 914, 85 S.Ct. 261, 13 L.Ed.2d 185 (1964). In a subsequent proceeding, the defendants obtained an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>FBI agent\u2019s report concerning a Navy psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of Mangual\u2019s mental and emotional state. They claim that this report, together with Mangual\u2019s medical record during his Marine Corps service from 1951 to 1955, would vitiate his testimony and probably would have produced a different verdict if available at the assault trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">The District Court, in denying the requested relief, concluded that; (1) the defendants sought a new trial merely to impeach the credibility of a witness but that this objective had been held to be insufficient for a new trial under the test derived from United States v. Costello, 255 F.2d 876 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 357 U.S. 937, 78 S.Ct. 1385, 2 L.Ed. 2d 1551 (1958) and Berry v. State, 10 Ga. 511, 527 (1851); and (2) under the test of Larrison v. United States, 24 F.2d 82 (7th Cir. 1928), it was not satisfied that the testimony of the witness \u201cwas false in its material aspects\u201d but was convinced that other, evidence (namely, the testimony of six or seven other witnesses) \u201coverwhelmingly!\u2019 established defendants\u2019 guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">The grant or denial of a motion for a new trial is largely within the discretion of the trial court. Furthermore, such motions are \u201cnot favored and should be granted only with great caution.\u201d United States v. Costello, supra, 255 F.2d at 879. In the present case, the trial court correctly formulated the relevant tests for granting a motion for a new trial and properly applied these tests. There is no contention here that the prosecution wilfully or in bad faith suppressed the evidence relied upon. This new evidence consisted of a mere summary by an agent without medical training of the diagnosis of a Naval doctor. In addition, the psychologist later qualified his original diagnosis in an affidavit, presented in response to the motion for a new trial, in which he stated: (1) that he had never interviewed or had even seen Mangual; (2) that he had no information concerning the nine years of Mangual\u2019s life since his discharge from the Corps; and (3) that in his original diagnosis he had stated that he considered Mangual emotionally rather than mentally unstable.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Order affirmed.'</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
