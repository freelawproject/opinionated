Appellee submits on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-10\">The relevant facts of record as found by the board are substantially as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b820-11\">Since on or about September 13, 1937, appellant has continuously used the designation \u201cPOLAROID\u201d as the salient feature of its name and as a trademark for its many products. Beginning as early as 1948 it has used \u201cPOLAROID\u201d as a trademark on a variety of photographic products, such as cameras, films, developers, picture rolls and other accessories of a related nature. Since about October 1, 1951 it has sold the \u201cPOLAROID COPYMAKER,\u201d a device used to photograph and make copies of papers and documents. Since 1957 it has sold the \u201cPOLAROID PRINT COPIER,\u201d a device used with a \u201cPOLAROID\u201d camera to make copies of prints. Since prior to the date of first use alleged by ap-pellee it has sold \u201cPOLAROID\u201d copy filters and copy lenses which are placed over the regular lens of a \u201cPOLAROID\u201d camera to assist in making copies of documents with the \u201cPOLAROID COPY-MAKER.\u201d Since 1951 it has been engaged in research and development work in the document copying field and in 1962 it began selling a \u201cPOLAROID\u201d camera designed for copying photographs, wall charts and x-rays. Appellant operates the \u201cPOLAROID COPY SERVICE\u201d through which it has sold copies, enlargements, and negatives of \u201cPOLAROID\u201d prints and transparencies since 1949. Appellant\u2019s products are sold to industrial and commercial users, governmental agencies and in all fifty states to the consumer directly and through wholesale and retail outlets. Total sales volume of appellant\u2019s products have increased from a sum in excess of $26 million in 1955 to over $100 million in 1961, with more than ninety percent of these amounts attributable, to sales of photographic material; sales of \u201cPOLAROID COPYMAKER\u201d devices from 1957 through 1961 approximate $500,000 and sales of \u201cPOLAROID PRINT COPIERS\u201d during the period of 1958 through 1961 have exceeded $6 million. The products have been advertised on a nationwide scope through various media with promotional expenditures increasing from more than a million dollars in 1955 to a sum exceeding nine million dollars in 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-13\">In association with the mark \u201cPOLAROID,\u201d appellant has also used the mark \u201cPOLACOLOR\u201d for motion picture color prints since \u00cd947, and \u201cPOLAPAN\u201d since April 26, 1955 for sensitized photographic film with substantial sales of its products sold thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-14\">Appellee\u2019s claimed first date of use of \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d is October 20, 1958. The mark was adopted by appellee\u2019s predecessor, Cormac Photocopy Corporation, as a trademark for photocopying machines, photographic developer and photocopying paper. Cormac engaged in extensive advertising, promotion and sales of these products under the mark \u201cPO-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>LYCOPY\u201d during 1958 and through 1960. Following the assignment, appel-lee has continued to advertise and sell these products under the trademark to industrial, commercial and governmental users. It was stipulated that the prefix \u201cPOLY\u201d and the suffix \u201cCOPY\u201d are in common usage in the photocopying industry to designate goods relating to photocopying machines and related products. The stipulation contains a list of fifteen third-party registrations for marks comprising as a portion thereof either the term \u201cPOLY\u201d or \u201cCOPY\u201d for photographic and kindred products as indicative of common usage of these terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-5\">The record supports the finding of the board that appellant and its products have, long prior to appellee\u2019s adoption and use of \u201cPOLYCOPY,\u201d become well and widely known and identified in the trade and by the purchasing public by the mark \u201cPOLAROID\u201d; that appellant\u2019s use of such marks as \u201cCOPYMAKER,\u201d \u201cPOLAROID COPY-MAKER,\u201d \u201cPOLAPAN\u201d and \u201cPOLA-COLOR\u201d also antedates appellee\u2019s use of \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d; that the parties market under their respective marks closely related photographic equipment which is dispensed through similar channels of trade and is intended for and purchased by the same classes of purchasers.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-6\">We have stated the factual situation presented by the record at some length. We find no rational basis therein to serve as a predicate upon which to sustain appellant\u2019s arguments that likelihood of confusion resides here between appellee\u2019s mark and any of the marks of appellant. We think it would require an unwarranted excursion into the realm of surmise to assume, as appellant contends, that purchasers would be likely to refer to appellant\u2019s copy filters and lenses as \u201cPOLACOPY\u201d filters or \u201cPOLACOPY\u201d lenses and to its copy department as \u201cPOLACOPY SERVICE.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-7\">The board set forth its views on the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-8\">\u201cThe issue of likelihood of confusion herein turns therefore on whether or not applicant\u2019s mark is confusingly similar to \u2018POLAROID\u2019 and/or \u2018COPYMAKER,\u2019 \u2018POLAROID COPYMAKER,\u2019 \u2018POLAPAN\u2019 and \u2018POLACOLOR.\u2019 Considering these marks in their entireties, it is our opinion that applicant\u2019s mark \u2018POLYCOPY\u2019 is so clearly distinguishable from each of opposer\u2019s marks in every material respect that purchasers are not likely to ascribe a common origin to the goods sold thereunder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b821-10\">We agree with the board. \u201cPoly\u201d has a meaning well known to the public and it is not the legal equivalent of \u201cPola,\u201d assertedly the distinguishing characteristic of appellant\u2019s mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b821-11\">Appellant contends that appellee\u2019s mark \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d is descriptive of its goods and cannot function as a trademark. In support of this contention, appellant relies on the fact that \u201cPoly\u201d has been adopted by third persons as a portion of marks for photocopying machines and related products; that \u201cpoly\u201d means, among other things, \u201cmany\u201d and that a brochure issued by appellee refers to \u201cPolyCopy \u2014 many copies.\u201d The record supports the finding and conclusion of the board that appellee\u2019s use of the words \u201cmany copies\u201d in the brochure was designed \u201cmerely to indicate the intended suggestiveness of the designation \u2018POLYCOPY\u2019 \u201d; that the term \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d was used throughout the brochure as a trademark to identify goods of appellee\u2019s manufacture; that the designation is not a dictionary term; that the record failed to show that the phrase \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d is or has been commonly used in the trade to describe photocopying machines and allied equipment and that registration of \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d could not preclude appellant and others from employing dictionary words or terminology popular in the trade to describe photocopying equipment as being capable of producing \u201cmany copies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b821-12\">The board concluded, and we agree, that on the basis of the record \u201cPOLY-COPY\u201d is not merely descriptive or lack<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>ing in trademark significance as applied to appellee\u2019s goods.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-4\">In the proceedings below, appellant made of record a copy of one of appellee\u2019s predecessor\u2019s promotional brochures wherein the registration legend is used in association with the mark, \u201cPOLYCOPY\u201d, notwithstanding appellee does not own a federal registration for said mark, which shows a photocopying machine with the notation thereon \u201cCORMAC POLY COPIER\u201d rather than \u201cCORMAC POLYCOPY.\u201d Appellant contends that on the basis of these disclosures alone, the board should have sustained the opposition and refused the registration sought by appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-5\">The board took the position that inasmuch as these matters involved ex parte questions, they could afford no proper basis for entry of judgment in favor of opposer on the inter partes issues of the pending proceeding. The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b822-6\">\u201cIt further may be noted that if, in considering an inter partes case involving an application, facts appear which may render the mark of the applicant unregistrable, the Board under Rule 2.131 can only recommend that if the applicant finally prevails in the proceeding, registration be withheld pending a reexamination by the Examiner of Trademarks in light of such facts. Accordingly and in view of the aforementioned disclosures, should applicant ultimately prevail on the inter partes issues herein, it is recommended that the Examiner of Trademarks reexamine applicant\u2019s right of registration in light thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b822-7\">We do not perceive any error, reviewable by us, relating to the board\u2019s disposition of this issue. In fact, the board has made no appealable determination \u25a0of this specific issue but has simply invoked an applicable administrative rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-8\">Upon consideration of the record before us, the contentions advanced and the argument of counsel, we find no reversible error on the part of the board in dismissing the opposition. The decision of the board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b822-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b820-15\">. Serial No. 62,838, filed November 20,1958.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b822-11\">MARTIN, Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A06q\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b822-12\">One conversant with photography might feel confident that the ordinary purchasers of the goods in question would not be confused. However, I feel that the ordinary purchasers would not be so conversant, and thus there is a likelihood of confusion between the marks when used on the goods of the parties.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
