Harold Jo-vien, individually and d/b/a Four Winds Travel Service, defendants below and ap-pellees here, counterclaimed seeking an accounting, damages and an injunction restraining appellant\u2019s use of its service mark \u201cFOUR WINDS\u201d and name in the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-25\">The District Court denied any relief to either party and dismissed appellant\u2019s complaint and appellees\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-26\">Appellant appeals from the judgmbnt entered by the District Court. No cross appeal was taken by appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-27\">The District Court had jurisdiction under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>Included in the findings of fact, the District Court among other matters found:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Plaintiff has used \u201cFOUR WINDS TRAVEL, INC.\u201d openly, notoriously, and continuously since on or about January 1, 1959 and has not abandoned \u201cFOUR WINDS\u201d in its name.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">Plaintiff\u2019s name, FOUR WINDS TRAVEL, INC., has never acquired any secondary meaning in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">Defendants\u2019 name, FOUR WINDS TRAVEL SERVICE AND PERSONALITY TOURS, has never acquired any secondary meaning in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">Neither plaintiff nor defendants established prior use of or secondary meaning to a name incorporating the words \u201cFOUR WINDS\u201d in the Southern California area.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">As conclusions of law the District Court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">\u201c1. This Court has jurisdiction over the subject matter of this action and of the parties hereto.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">\u201c2. Plaintiff has not established the exclusive right to incorporate in its trade name \u2018FOUR WINDS\u2019 within the Southern California area.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">\u201c3. Both plaintiff and defendants have the right to use in Southern California the term \u2018FOUR WINDS\u2019 in the names of their respective travel agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">\u201c4. Both the Complaint and the Counterclaim be dismissed and neither plaintiff nor defendants shall take anything by reason of their said Complaint or Counterclaim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-14\">The judgment entered by the District Court is as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-15\">\u201cORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECLARED that:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">1. Plaintiff is free to use its name, FOUR WINDS TRAVEL, INC., in the advertising, promotion, and conduct of its business anywhere in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">2. Plaintiff is free to advertise, promote, offer for sale, and sell its travel agency services under its mark \u2018FOUR WINDS TRAVEL, INC.\u2019 anywhere in Southern California.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">3. Defendants are free to advertise, promote and conduct their travel agency business under the name of \u2018FOUR WINDS TRAVEL SERVICE AND PERSONALITY TOURS.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">4. Plaintiff\u2019s complaint is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-20\">5. Defendants\u2019 counterclaim is hereby dismissed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-21\">It is to be noted in the findings of fact, conclusions of law and judgment entered by the District Court, that it gave no consideration to the validity of, or what protection, if any, appellant may be entitled to in respect to its service mark \u201cFOUR WINDS\u201d, in promoting and advertising its travel service business. The material findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the judgment entered by the District Court, relate only to the respective names under which each party respectively conducts its travel service business.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-22\">The validity of appellant\u2019s service mark \u201cFOUR WINDS\u201d was clearly an issue before the District Court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The failure of the District Court to pass upon this is<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>sue requires a reversal of the judgment appealed from and a remand of the cause to the District Court with instructions to grant appellant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">It is so ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-13\">. It was apparently because of lack of evidence that the trial court concluded as a fact that neither appellant\u2019s actual name or a name incorporating the words \u201cFour Winds\u201d had acquired a secondary meaning in Southern California. The record reveals, however, that throughout the trial, the District Court proceeded upon the theory that resolution of the dispute would rest upon a determination of the sole factual question as to which litigant first employed the use in Southern California of the words \u201cFour Winds\u201d in connection with the travel agency business. The District Court repeatedly discouraged appellant from producing evidence bearing upon the existence of secondary meaning and yet, at the close of the trial, determined that such was an issue upon which a finding of fact was required.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
