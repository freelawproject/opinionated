After appellant filed his brief in this court, the Government moved to remand for a judicial determination of appellant\u2019s competency at the time of his trial over a year ago, that determination to be made after a mental examination.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government argues that, if appellant is now found to have been competent when tried, he \u201cwas not prejudiced by denial of the motion for mental examination.\u201d The Government thus implicitly concedes, and we agree, that denial of the pre-trial motion for a mental examination was error. Mitchell v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 353, 316 F.2d 354 (1963); Lloyd v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>States, 101 U.S.App.D.C. 116, 247 F.2d 522 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">We must decide -whether correction of that error requires a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>hearing or a new trial. The Supreme Court rejected the Solicitor General\u2019s request<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for a similar <em>nunc pro tunc </em>determination in Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). The Court held that because of the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-6\">difficulties of retrospectively determining the petitioner\u2019s competency as of more than a year ago, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the judgment of conviction, and remand the case to the District Court for a new hearing to ascertain petitioner\u2019s present competency to stand trial, and for a new trial if petitioner is found competent. [362 U.S. at 403, 80 S.Ct. at 789.]<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">We think that <em>Dusky </em>applies here. In the present case, the difficulties of retrospective determination in <em>Dusky </em>are compounded. Unlike Dusky, Holloway had no mental examination. Thus, there are no records and recollections contemporary with his trial to aid a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>hearing. Where the issue is raised on direct appeal, as here, this court has several times held that an erroneous failure to grant a motion for mental examination must be corrected by remanding for a new trial, with opportunity for determination of the accused\u2019s competency to stand trial. Kelley v. United States, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 267, 221 F.2d 822 (1954); Wear v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 325, 218 F.2d 24 (1954); Perry v. United States, 90 U.S.App.D.C. 186, 195 F.2d 37 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">The judgment is reversed and the case remanded for a new trial if Holloway is judicially determined to be presently competent to stand trial. See Watson v. United States, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 221, 223, 234 F.2d 42, 44 (1956); Cooper v. United States, 119 U.S.App.D.C.-, 337 F. 2d 538 (decided April 9, 1964) (Judge Wright, concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">The judicial determination must, of course, be an informed one. It is not likely that the court could make an informed decision from a superintendent\u2019s letter that merely states without supporting information and reasons that an accused is considered competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> See Gunther v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 243, 246, 215 F. 2d 493. 496-497 (1954); Dusky v. United States, 271 F.2d 385, 397 (8th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>1959), reversed on other grounds, 362 U. S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960). -Such a letter would not come within the meaning of the terms \u201creport\u201d or \u201ccertificate\u201d as they appear in D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301, since these terms must be construed compliably with the need for a judicial determination, <em>cf. </em>Gunther, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, it would be necessary for the trial judge to inquire of the examining doctors the basis for their conclusions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> He might do this by requiring a more detailed communication from the hospital or by holding a hearing on his own motion, as the circumstances suggest. In no case, however, could he decide the competency question without information.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">The need for an informed judicial determination also arises from a fact which pervades the administration of criminal justice. That defendants lack the financial and intellectual capacity to pursue and vindicate their rights is the rule rather than the exception. Protection of the rights of defendants unable to assess, challenge or supplement the superintendent\u2019s letter requires that the court be fully informed of the information and reasons upon which the report rests.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">Appellant was originally arrested on January 10, 1963, and was continuously in jail for nearly 17 months thereafter. We admitted him to bail pending appeal on January 17, 1964, but he was not released pursuant to our order. We discovered this when an appeal from his unsuccessful resort to habeas corpus came to this court, and we were then informed that his release on bond had been withheld because, subsequent to his arrest, probation on an earlier offense had been revoked and a one-year sentence imposed. The Government abandoned this justification, and we directed that the writ issue. Since appellant had been in jail almost 17 months, 12 of which occurred after his sentencing the same day on both the present conviction and the probation revocation, and five of which occurred after this court had ordered him released on bond, it seems clear that he will be entitled to credit, either against his present liabilities under the probation revocation or against the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>tence, if any, ultimately imposed on retrial of the present case.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>*</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">Even with such credit, however, this period of incarceration has been substantial and presumably will be taken into account by the District Court in determining what disposition is to be made of appellant pending retrial. We note that D.C.Oode \u00a7 24-301 (a) does not preclude mental examinations being conducted on an outpatient basis if deemed feasible by the hospital authorities. This record shows a refusal by appellant to cooperate in an examination by the Legal Psychiatric Services prior to the first trial, and any persistence in this course would clearly necessitate commitment. In any event, it is for the District Court to examine the situation in all its aspects as it exists upon remand, and to bring its discretion to bear on the facts as they then appear. Whatever the course taken, expedition on the part of all parties is desirable in the light of the history of this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">The Government\u2019s motion for remand is granted in part, in accordance with this opinion. Our disposition necessarily decides the appeal as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\">.

Memorandum for the United States, p. 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b315-15\">. Following <em>Dusky, </em>Judge Weinfeld held in Sullivan v. United States, 205 F.Supp. 545 (S.D.N.Y.1962), that failure judicially to determine the accused\u2019s competence prior to trial was not \u201cmerely a procedural error\u201d which could subsequently be corrected by holding a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>hearing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-16\">\u201cWhen the statute is properly invoked upon compelling facts as in the instant case, an accused has a substantial right to have the issue of his mental competency to stand trial determined in accordance with the procedure therein provided; he is entitled to a contemporaneous determination which normally affords greater accuracy of judgment than one made years after the event.\u201d 205 F.Supp. at 550.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b315-17\">. See Hess &amp; Thomas, <em>Incompetenoy to Stand Trial: Procedures, Results, and Problems, </em>119 Am.J. of Psychiatky 713, 715-16 (1963). a study of incompetency to stand trial in Michigan: \u201c[T]he courts fail to use the physician in his appropriate role. The majority of the psychiatrists\u2019 reports were empty and meaningless, and yet were accepted and acted upon by the courts as if they contained information which could be construed as evidence and, as such, decided upon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-19\">The need for the court, not psychiatrists, to make the ultimate decision on competence to stand trial was recognized also by the Solicitor General in Memorandum for the United States, p. 9, Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960): \u201cA medical determination on competency is not necessarily the same as a legal determination. A doctor can speak as an expert only in terms compatible with his medical training and experience, and psychiatric terminology and legal standards often reflect different concepts to the use of the same words.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b316-5\">. The 1955 amendments to D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 were in part a congressional overruling of that part of our opinion in <em>Gunther </em>which seemed to require a hearing whenever an accused\u2019s competency to stand trial was in issue. As the legislative history reveals, Congress chiefly feared that hearings in every case would consume too much of the doctors\u2019 time. Congress evidenced no quarrel with the <em>Gunther </em>statement that competency is in every case a matter for <em>judicial </em>decision: in treating the situation in which no objection is made by a party to a statement by the hospital superintendent, it did not <em>require </em>but merely <em>\u25a0permitted </em>judicial action on the basis of that statement. Moreover, Congress assumed that the hospital reports to be filed under the statute would be such as would provide a basis for informed judicial decision. Thus it was stated in support of the amendment to D.C.Code \u00a7 24-301 (b) that a rule requiring a hearing in every case, even where not requested, \u201cunnecessarily consumes a great deal of time of hospital authorities in coming to court to testify in person to matters <em>adequately covered by their written re</em>port.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 892, 84th Cong., 1st Sess. 12 (1955) (emphasis supplied). In requiring a hospital to supplement a bald statement of psychiatric conclusion as to competency, a trial judge would be enforcing the understanding of Congress, and would not risk bringing about the effects which the amendatory legislation was intended to prevent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"Aaj\">. <em>Cf. </em>Ragsdale v.
