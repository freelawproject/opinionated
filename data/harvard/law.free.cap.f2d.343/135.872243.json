The- District Court denied the application without a hearing upon the grounds that appellant\u2019s contention that his confession had been improperly admitted into evidence during the state trial stated an issue that had been fully heard and found to be without merit in a prior habeas corpus proceeding lodged as an original action in that federal district court. The order of denial stated the trial court\u2019s satisfaction that the ends of justice would not be served by further inquiry upon the issue. This appeal follows the order of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The record clearly shows that appellant's contentions were fully considered in his prior application and our consideration of the earlier proceedings (which include a review of the entire state court proceedings) indicates no abuse of discretion upon the part of the trial court in refusing further inquiry. The case falls squarely within the contemplation of the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 224-4.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
