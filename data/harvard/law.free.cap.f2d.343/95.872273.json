Their testimony relevant to the search and seizure was as follows: In September 1963, a man known to be engaged in narcotics traffic between Los Angeles and New York City checked in at a Los Angeles hotel under the assumed name of \u201cMartinez.\u201d The airline companies were asked to advise the authorities of any reservations made in that name. On September 17, American Airlines informed the Customs Service that such a reservation had been made for an evening flight to New York City. The Customs agent and the police officer stationed themselves near the check-in counter. Shortly before the scheduled departure time of the flight a car drove up to the adjacent curb and .both appellants alighted. The Customs agent recognized DeOca as a person he had investigated earlier for possible involvement in narcotics traffic. DeOca took two suitcases from the car trunk, set them on the curb, returned to the car, and drove off. A porter took the bags to the check-in counter and set them on the scale. Cipr\u00e9s followed. The Customs agent observed that the bags weighed 140 pounds, and heard Cipr\u00e9s ask for a reservation in the name \u201cMartinez.\u201d The officers identified themselves to Cipr\u00e9s, told her they were conducting a narcotics investigation, and wished to talk with her. In response to their questions, she told them her name was Cipr\u00e9s, but that she sometimes used the name Martinez in traveling. She said the bags contained clothing, but added, in explanation of their weight, that they also contained cosmetics. The officers told Cipr\u00e9s they suspected the bags contained marihuana. She denied it. They asked if they could search the bags. She answered, \u201cYes, I have nothing to hide,\u201d but added that she had left the keys in New York City. They examined the bags and found them unlocked. The Customs agent opened the \"bags, discovered the marihuana, and arrested Cipr\u00e9s.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">Cipr\u00e9s denied consenting to the search. She testified that the officers accosted her and inquired about the contents of the bags. She asked if they had a search warrant, but they simply proceeded to open the bags. The officers admitted that Cipr\u00e9s asked if they had a search warrant, but only after the Customs agent had opened the bags with \"her .permission and discovered the marihuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">The district court treated the issue as simply whether or not Cipr\u00e9s told the officers they might search the suitcase. Seeing \u201cno reason why I should disbelieve the testimony of the two officers,\u201d the court admitted the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">But the issue the court was required to decide was much broader, and could not be resolved simply by weighing the credibility of Cipr\u00e9s against that of the officers. The issue was whether Cipr\u00e9s had waived her constitutional immunity from unreasonable search and seizure. Waiver, in this context, means the \u201cintentional relinquishment of a known right or privilege.\u201d Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938). Such a waiver cannot be conclusively presumed from a verbal expression of assent. The court must determine from all the circumstances whether the verbal assent reflected an understanding, uncoerced, and unequivocal election to grant the officers a license which the person knows may be freely and effectively withheld.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We recently sustained a district court finding that such waiver was lacking despite an express verbal consent,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and such cases are common.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 3 **They rest not only upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>the nature of waiver itself, but also upon a recognition that the purpose of the exclusionary rule is not only to discourage overreaching by police officers, but also, and primarily, to protect the rights-of-the citizen. The crucial question is whether the citizen truly consented to the search, not whether it was reasonable for the officers to suppose that he did.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">Giving full credit to the officers\u2019 testimony that Cipr\u00e9s orally consented to the search, a substantial question still remained as to whether she waived her constitutional privilege. A number of circumstances suggest that her assent may have reflected less than a free, deliberate, and unequivocal decision to permit the officers to open the luggage: it was obtained \u201cunder color of the badge\u201d and was therefore presumptively coerced ; <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it was coupled with the statement that the bags were locked and the keys unavailable, which on its face would have rendered the consent ineffectual; <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> it was accompanied by assertions that Cipr\u00e9s was innocent and that the suitcases contained innocuous articles, and not marihuana, assertions certain to be exposed as</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">false the moment the bags were opened;<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and admittedly Cipr\u00e9s asked if the officers had a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">Because of the overly narrow view which the district court apparently took of the question presented, it did not explore and determine the issue of waiver in the light of these and other circumstances surrounding the arrest. We remand the case so that this may be done, either on the present record or after such further hearing as the court may deem appropriate.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">As we have noted, Cipr\u00e9s was arrested immediately following the discovery of the marihuana. The government urges that the arrest was valid, and that the search should be upheld as incident to it. We have held that a prior search may be valid as incident to a substantially contemporaneous arrest without a warrant if the arresting officers had probable cause for the arrest at the time of the search, and the circumstances suggested that immediate search was necessary to preserve material subject to seizure.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Thus the inquiry would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>be whether at the moment the bags were searched<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the officers had reasonably trustworthy information of facts sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing that Cipr\u00e9s was committing an offense,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and that removal of the evidence was threatened.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> But these also are questions of fact to be decided initially by the district court. That court has not yet done so; having found that Cipr\u00e9s \u201cconsented\u201d to the search, the district court thought it unnecessary to determine whether the search might have been valid upon any other ground. Unresolved factual issues were likewise raised by the government\u2019s contention that the search was justified by 19 U.S. C.A. \u00a7 482.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To avoid a further multiplication of hearings and appeals, these issues should be resolved by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b147-15\">The appellants\u2019 remaining specifications of error are insubstantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-16\">1. It is true, of course, that proof of mere proximity to the drug would be insufficient to establish actual or -constructive \u201cpossession\u201d within the meaning of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 176a.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the testimony regarding Cipr\u00e9s\u2019 responses to the officers\u2019 inquiries as to contents of the bags, plus the natural inferences from the evidence as to the placement and movements of Cipr\u00e9s and the suitcases, afforded an adequate basis for the jury\u2019s determination that the luggage was in Cipr\u00e9s\u2019 immediate physical custody or subject to her dominion and control. Indeed, she testified to as much at the trial, offering an innocent explanation of a possession she did not deny.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>2. No argument was offered in support of Cipr\u00e9s\u2019 specification of error asserting an insufficiency of proof of knowledge that the bags contained-marihuana. Nonetheless, we have satisfied ourselves that the jury could properly infer guilty knowledge from evidence of record which, in the circumstances, we will not pause to detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">3. Read in context, the trial court\u2019s comments upon the evidence, which Cipr\u00e9s suggests were inaccurate, were of minor importance. The court carefully instructed the jury that it was the sole judge of the facts and that the court\u2019s comments might be disregarded. No exception was taken at trial to the portions of the charge which Cipr\u00e9s now attacks. \u201cWe can find no plain error therein affecting the substantial rights of the appellants, nor can we find any error which would result in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d Gilbert v. United States, 307 F.2d 322, 327 (9th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">4. We find no plain error in government counsel\u2019s closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">5. Finally, appellant DeOca\u2019s argument that evidence concerning a second seizure of marihuana should have been suppressed as the product of the assertedly illegal prior seizure discussed above cannot he sustained. There is nothing in the record to indicate that the two seizures were related.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Appellant DeOca made no suggestion in the trial court that they were. No request was made of the trial court that the evidence be suppressed or excluded as tainted by the earlier seizure, or for any other reason.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b145-5\">.

The Supreme Court has reserved the question. Ker v. State of California, 374 U.S. 23, 42-43, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>(1963) . See also Stoner v. State of California, 376 U.S. 483, 84 S.Ct. 889, 11 L.Ed.2d 856 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">It has been suggested that since the rule has been applied only where there were reasonable grounds to believe that imminent destruction or removal of material subject to seizure was threatened (prior to the searches in Busby and Haley the officers saw, and in Fernandez smelled, probable contraband in temporarily stopped automobiles; in Dickey, a probable possessor of narcotics was moving toward a bathroom), and hence is merely an application of the accepted principle that the Fourth Amendment does not preclude a search without a warrant in such \u201cexigent circumstances.\u201d Manwaring, 16 Stan.L.Rev. 318, 344 (1964) . See also Mosco v. United States, 301 F.2d 180, 187-188 (9th Cir. 1962). The \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the general rule requiring a search warrant is independent of that permitting a warrantless search incident to a valid arrest (United States v. Ventresca, 85 S.Ct. 741 n. 2 (March 1, 1965); United States v. Jeffers, 342 U.S. 48, 51, 72 S.Ct. 93, 96 L.Ed. 59 (1951); Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 14, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948)), and if applicable it would be immaterial that the arrest followed the search, or that there was no arrest at all. The only relevant inquiry would be whether it was probable that contraband was both present and threatened with imminent removal or destruction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b147-19\">. Of course, nothing disclosed by the search could be considered to justify the arrest. United States v. Di Re, 332 U.S. 581, 595, 68 S.Ct. 222, 92 L.Ed. 210 (1948).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b147-20\">.

The \u201creasonable grounds\u201d to believe that an offense is being committed, authorizing a Customs agent to make an arrest without a warrant under 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7607(2), is the equivalent of Fourth Amendment \u201cprobable cause.\u201d Wong Sun v.
