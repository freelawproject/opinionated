Judge Cooper found that their publication of the song infringed the plaintiff\u2019s valid copyright in an earlier song, \u201cA Thousand Miles Away.\u201d Since we find that the plaintiff does have a valid copyright, we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-23\">The defendant, Keel Music Publishing Co., secured a statutory copyright in the lyrics and melody line of \u201cA Thousand Miles Away\u201d in 1956. Because the song was then unpublished, the copyright was secured under \u00a7 12 of the Copyright Act, which provides statutory copyright protection for unpublished works. Keel as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>signed the copyright to the plaintiff on December 13 of that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">Keel\u2019s principal contention is that the plaintiff forfeited its copyright in \u201cA Thousand Miles Away\u201d by publishing it without the proper notice of copyright. The contention is based on the fact that the plaintiff published the song on December 27, 1956 under a copyright notice bearing its own name but did not record the assignment in the Copyright Office until January 16, 1957. The copyright notice, it is argued, therefore did not bear the name of the.owner of record and thus failed to comply with the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">To secure copyright protection in a published work, a notice of copyright must appear on each copy, 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 10, and, in the case of a printed work, the notice must give the name of the copyright proprietor. 17 U.S.C. \u00a7 29. The dispositive question on this appeal is whether the plaintiff was the \u201cproprietor\u201d of the published version of \u201cA Thousand Miles Away\u201d during the weeks between December 27, 1956 and January 16, 1957.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">Section 32 of the Copyright Act provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-9\">\u201cWhen an assignment of the copyright in a specified book or other work has been recorded the assignee may substitute his name for that of the assignor in the statutory notice of copyright prescribed by this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">The effect of \u00a7 32 is that, where the copyright in a published work is assigned, the assignee becomes the proprietor of the assigned work for purposes of the copyright notice only after the assignment is recorded.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Much of the argument on this appeal has been directed at the question whether \u00a7 32 also applies where the statutory copyright is an unpublished work \u2014 a \u00a7 12 copyright \u2014 is assigned, that is, where the work is published for the first time after the assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">The district court held that \u00a7 32 does not apply in the latter case. Whether this is a proper view of the section\u2019s scope we do not decide, for we conclude that \u00a7 32 was inapplicable here on another ground: Even if we assume for purposes of \u00a7 29 that, prior to recording the assignment, the plaintiff was not the proprietor of the copyright received from Keel \u2014 a copyright in the lyrics and melody line \u2014 it was the proprietor of the copyright in the work which it published \u2014a copyright in the music as arranged for the piano.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">The legal significance of the addition of the piano arrangement stems largely from \u00a7 7 of the Act, which provides that musical arrangements, abridgments,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b247-12\">\u201cor other versions of works in the public domain or of copyrighted works when produced with the consent of the proprietor of the copyright in such works * * * shall be regarded as new works subject to copyright under the provisions of this title; but the publication of any such new works shall not affect the force or validity of any subsisting copyright upon the matter employed or any part thereof, or be construed to imply an exclusive right to such use of the original works, or to secure or extend copyright in such original works.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b247-13\">The effect of the latter, qualifying portion of \u00a7 7 is to preserve the copyright, if any, in the original work as a separate legal entity with its own life span. In the instant case, for example, the copyright in the lyrics and melody line of \u201cA Thousand Miles Away\u201d will, if not renewed, expire 28 years from May 9, 1956 \u2014the date on which they were copyrighted under \u00a7 12. The copyright in the arrangement, on the other hand, will not expire until 28 years from Decem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>ber 27, 1956 \u2014 the date when that copyright was secured by publication with a proper copyright notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">Since the published version of <em>\u201cA </em>Thousand Miles Away\u201d is in part protected by two different copyrights, which could have two different owners and do have two different expiration dates, it might appear that the copyright notice should give the date and proprietor of each. But such has not been the interpretation adopted by this and other courts. In part because of the statutory equation of a derivative work with a \u201cnew work,\u201d it has been held that the notice need give only the date and owner of the copyright in the derivative work, leaving the reader to his own devices in ferreting out this information as to the original. See National Comics Publications v. Fawcett Publications, 191 F. 2d 594, 598 (2 Cir. 1951) (L. Hand, J.), approving the opinion of the district court on this point, 93 F.Supp. 349, 352-353 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1950) (date of copyright) ; West Pub. Co. v. Edward Thompson Co., 176 F. 833, 837 (2 Cir. 1910) (date of copyright); Wrench v. Universal Pictures Co., 104 F.Supp. 374, 378 (D.C.S.D.N.Y.1952) (owner of copyright) .</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">The plaintiff did base the claim which it filed in the Copyright Office on the addition of the arrangement: It indicated that a claim of copyright in part of the work had previously been registered \u2014 although by whom does not appear in its application \u2014 and that it was now claiming a copyright in \u201crevised music.\u201d There is some ambiguity in the district court\u2019s consideration of this claim of copyright. The defendant apparently contended that the claim was made in bad faith since the arrangement was insufficiently original to constitute a new work, cf. McIntyre v. Double-A Music Corp., 166 F.Supp. 681, 683 (D.C. S.D.Calif.1958), and that the plaintiff\u2019s suit should therefore be dismissed on the ground of unclean hands. Judge Cooper quite properly rejected this contention. And, though it is not quite so clear, we think that he did not merely hold that the claim of copyright was made in good faith but that he also sustained the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">Since the record amply supports Judge Cooper\u2019s conclusion, the plaintiff must be regarded as having a separate and valid copyright in the arrangement of \u201cA Thousand Miles Away.\u201d As to this copyright, the plaintiff was the original proprietor ; the only relevance of the assignment was that it amounted to consent from Keel to the plaintiff\u2019s use of the lyrics and melody line. Accordingly, \u00a7 32 does not apply, and the notice of copyright was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">We find the defendants\u2019 other contentions to be without merit, and we affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b247-14\">.
