The defendant filed a motion to dismiss and obtained an order deferring the taking of depositions by the plaintiff pending the disposition of that motion. It is from this order that appellant appeals. This is a -routine procedural step in the normal administration of the case and obviously not the type of order that may be reviewed before the final determination of the case, and 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292(a) (1), upon which the appellant relies, is inapplicable. The appeal will be</p>\n<p id=\"b476-25\">Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
