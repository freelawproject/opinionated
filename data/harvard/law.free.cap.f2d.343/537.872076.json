Coppinger, Jr., was appointed at the time of the arraignment to represent petitioner and the clerk was told to write the attorney and inform him of the appointment and that the trial date had been set for April <em>2k, </em>1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-16\">Thus, altho petitioner alleges that court-appointed counsel was not present when the plea and sentence were entered on April <em>22, </em>1941, it appears from a purported copy of an affidavit by attorney Coppinger, executed on November 12, 1947, that he interviewed petitioner on the morning of April <em>22, </em>1941 in the county jail and advised him to plead guilty; and also that he was present in court on April <em>2k, </em>1941, and petitioner stated that he would plead guilty, whereupon the judge advised petitioner of his rights and he pleaded guilty and was sentenced in the presence of Coppinger; that the latter\u2019s memory regarding the facts had been refreshed by reference to his yearbook and diary and by a conference with Lt. Waller of the Alton Police Department and a reference to that department\u2019s records and files.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-17\">In the district court, by his petition for habeas corpus petitioner charged that attorney Coppinger testified in a 1945 habeas corpus proceeding <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that he did not represent petitioner at his original trial, because the trial date had been set for April 24, 1941 and his reason for not being there was that the court had changed the date to April 22, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-18\">Petitioner relies on the affidavit of Mable Pappas, a resident of Aurora, Illinois, who swears that, on April 22, 1941, she attended the trial in question and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>that no one spoke in behalf of Baldridge and he therefore had no attorney in court to represent him; that he was entirely without counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">In view of the foregoing, we are not satisfied that the finding of the district court that \u201cthe State court records which affirmatively show that counsel was appointed to represent petitioner\u201d can be considered as a determination that petitioner was represented by that counsel or any other attorney when he entered a plea of guilty. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). In view of all that we have referred to in this opinion, we are convinced that justice requires that the order from which this appeal was taken must be reversed and this cause remanded to the district court for a hearing at which all relevant evidence be heard, including the testimony of petitioner and such witnesses as he and his counsel may deem necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">We appointed attorney Morrie Much of the Illinois bar to represent petitioner in this court. We commend and thank Mr. Much for the able service he has rendered on behalf of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-11\">. The notice of appeal appears on its face to have been made and executed on petitioner\u2019s behalf by the clerk of the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b586-12\">. This is corroborated by the record of the Illinois court, according to a copy of its mittimus attached to the original petition for habeas corpus herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b586-21\">. Said proceeding seems to have been filed in an Illinois state court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
