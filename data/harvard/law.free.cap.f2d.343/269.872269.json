The testimony of an expert, like that of any other witness, may be excluded if it reports mere opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>ion, unsupported by \u201cunderlying facts.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In its discretion, a trial court may require an expert witness to amplify his conclusions with an explanation of the basis for them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This discretion should be exercised where evidence of either sanity or insanity appears inadequate. True, it is difficult to draw the line between underlying facts and conclusions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> On the issue of responsibility, moreover, the psychiatric conclusion that a man is or is not mentally diseased has evidentiary worth. A jury which must decide the issue of responsibility is aided by knowing whether qualified psychiatrists think there is some recognized psychiatric disorder to which the defendant\u2019s symptoms are referable. Yet the jury must make a determination of responsibility, not a clinical evaluation of disease. McDonald v. United States, 114 U. S.App.D.C. 120, 312 F.2d 847 (1962). Thus, the conclusion of the psychiatrists that a man is \u201cnot mentally diseased\u201d may not be enough in any particular case to meet the Government\u2019s burden of proving sanity beyond a reasonable doubt. The Government can best meet its burden by bringing forth from psychiatric witnesses both the conclusion of \u201cno mental illness\u201d and a full explanation of the dynamics of the defendant\u2019s personality.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b319-12\">In the instant case, the jury\u2019s verdict was not against the weight of the evidence and, subject to the condition noted in Part II, we affirm the robbery conviction. However, the frequent failure to adequately explain and support expert psychiatric opinion threatens the administration of the insanity defense in the District of Columbia. We think it important to explicate this problem further, by reference to the trial record here and in Kimble v. United States, No. 17836, a pending appeal presenting similar issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>Rollerson and Kimble are not unusual cases. Both defendants had ninety-day mental examinations in St. Elizabeths Hospital at public expense. Both had court-appointed counsel who raised the insanity defense with what evidence was available in light of reports from St. Elizabeths that the defendant was sane at the time of the crime and the crime was not a product of mental disease. Indigents like Rollerson and Kimble are largely dependent on the resources of the public system. But in both their cases, the public system has produced records in which the expert testimony is entirely conclusory, the questions perfunctory, the lay testimony unfocussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-4\">Rollerson\u2019s counsel raised the insanity defense by offering a letter he wrote to the jail authorities claiming they were trying to poison him and that \u201cvoices\u201d were protecting him, a jail record showing that a sharpened object was found in his cell, and the testimony of a jail official that he had been placed in the maximum security part of the jail, \u201cwhere we put the men who are a little off.\u201d In rebuttal, the Government offered two psychiatrists who testified that he \u201cwas not suffering from a mental illness or disorder\u201d at the time of the crime and that \u201che could distinguish right from wrong\u201d and \u201cwas able to exercise control over his actions and behavior.\u201d The Government also put on a third psychiatrist who felt that \u201che has * * * a severe character disorder.\u201d \u201cIt is not a psychosis or neurosis, but it is considered as a mental disorder in that the individual \u2014it is listed, shall we say \u2014 listed in the gray book of the nomenclature, and that also since 1957 was considered by St. Elizabeths as a mental disorder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">Kimble\u2019s counsel offered the defendant\u2019s father and sister who testified that over a period of three years, he had exhibited peculiar behavior, \u201crocking and reeling,\u201d \u201claughing to hisself,\u201d unaware of anyone around him. Dr. Dabney, a psychiatrists from St. Elizabeths, testified that a majority of the staff conference denoted him \u201ca paranoid personality,\u201d that this was a mental disease, and that in his opinion the crime was a product of the disease. In rebuttal the Government put on Dr. Platkin, the head of the pavilion for the criminally insane at St. Elizabeths, who testified that \u201ca paranoid personality\u201d was not in his opinion usually a mental disease.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b320-9\">No one hearing this testimony or reading these records could understand why either Rollerson or Kimble acted as he did. We know nothing of their childhood, their emotional structure, the major events of their lives, their day-to-day behavior, their personalities, their own explanations for their behavior. As it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>stands, the testimony does little to help the jury answer the question whether either defendant has \u201cany abnormal condition of the mind which substantially affect [ed his] mental or emotional processes [or] substantially impair [ed his] behavior controls.\u201d McDonald v. United States, <em>supra, </em>114 U.S.App.D.C. at 124, 812 F.2d at 851.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Nor do we know what the psychiatrists who testified knew about the defendants. The only effort in either case to explain conclusions was Dr. Dabney\u2019s outline in <em>Kimble </em>of a paranoid personality: \u201coverly sensitive in relationships with other people\u201d ; \u201chis conclusions about things are way out of proportion to actually what is happening around him\u201d ; he \u201cactually does not want to exist in the social world * * But cross-examination enmeshed the psychiatrist in this typical dialogue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-6\">\u201cA [Dr. Dabney] I said that [Kim-ble] has extreme sensitivity in his relationships with other people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-7\">\u201cQ What do you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-8\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-9\">\u201cA In other words, in his daily living, a word, an innocent remark from someone else in the form of a joke, or kidding) may be interpreted by this individual as a gross insult.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-10\">\u201cA pat on the back, a gentle shove in the person\u2019s bowel may be impressed upon this man as an assault of his person.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-11\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-12\">\u201cQ Can you tell us * * * whether he could distinguish between right and wrong ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-13\">\u201cA I think that he can distinguish between right and wrong. He has a value set of what is right and what is wrong, but, due to his mental disorder, they are distorted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-14\">\u201cI mentioned, before you asked this question, that if someone kids him, he may interpret it as an insult. He is aware that to insult someone is wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-15\">\u201cHe is aware that to push someone around is wrong, or to badger someone is wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-17\">\u201cBut in his interpretations of things which influence his reactions to a particular situation, he tends to magnify it way out of the actual reality of the situation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-18\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-19\">\u201cQ You stated, sir, that he is capable of distinguishing between right and wrong; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-20\">\u201cA Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-21\">\u201cQ Would you say, then, in being able to distinguish between right and wrong he can embrace the right and resist the wrong?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-22\">\u201cA I am saying that by his mental disorder, by his distortions of thinking, that even though he knows right from wrong he inevitably does what is considered the wrong thing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-23\">\u00abQ * * * [C]an he embrace one and reject the other?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-24\">\u201cA In his value system that depends on what he feels is right and wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-25\">\u201cQ You stated a moment ago that he knows it is wrong, I believe you stated, to push somebody; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-26\">\u201cA Or to inflict harm. Everyone has a sense of right and wrong.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-27\">\u201cQ I am not talking about everybody; I am talking about him. You said that \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b321-28\">\u201cA Well, in his value system, to shove someone is wrong. To harm someone is wrong. He is aware of this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b321-29\">One difficulty is that the psychiatrist was at least as interested in how Kimble viewed acts others did to him as in how he viewed acts he did to others. The prosecutor\u2019s questions went only to the latter issue, so that the answers are clouded in ambiguity. The deeper difficulty is that the psychiatrist was trying to say that Kimble\u2019s ability to assess right and wrong responses was impaired by his hypersensitive reaction to what was done to him. Thus, in the midst of testifiying that Kimble could \u201cembrace the right and reject the wrong,\u201d the psychiatrist was perhaps saying the opposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-30\">The doctors in both cases arrived at their conclusions on the basis of \u201cthe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>usual personal interviews and the physical examination, * * * a psychological examination which is a battery of tests designed to find out something about his degree of intelligence, * * * learning something about his aptitudes, feelings and personality <em>characteristics.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark><em> A </em>doctor testified that he saw Rollerson about twice a week on \u201cward rounds.\u201d In each case, all the doctors who testified had been present at an hour\u2019s staff conference at which the defendant was interviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">We are not told how many personal interviews of the defendant were conducted. We are not told the extent or content of the staff observations. We are told nothing about the tests the defendants took \u2014 what they were, what they are designed to show, how useful they are considered to be.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are not told the men\u2019s scores on the intelligence or aptitude tests, much less what those scores mean. In Rollerson\u2019s case we are told nothing about the details of the staff conference \u2014 -who was present, what questions were asked, what impression he made. We do not know what \u201cward rounds\u201d are or how much time is involved on a typical ward round.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">The basic tool of psychiatric study remains the personal interview, which requires rapport between the interviewer and the subject. Gill, Newman &amp; Red-lich, The Initial Interview in Psychiatric Practice (1954). See also Fine-singer, <em>Psychiatric Interviewing: Principles and Procedure in Therapy, </em>105 AM.J.Psychiat. 187 (1948). More than three or four hours are necessary to assemble a picture of a man. A person sometimes refuses for the first several interviews to reveal his delusional thinking, or other evidence of mental disease. Menninger, A Manual for Psychiatric Case Study, ch. 1-4 <em>passim. </em>(2d ed. 1962) (hereafter cited as Menninger). See Noyes &amp; Kolb, Modern Clinical Psychiatry, ch. 7 (with bibliography); Knight, <em>Borderline States, </em>17 Bull. OF Menninger Clinic 1, 8 (1953). Paranoid patients particularly may be able to guard against revealing their disorder with extraordinary skill. Menninger 64-65. See Noyes &amp; Kolb, Modern Clinical Psychiatry 112-13. From hours of interviewing, and from the tests and other materials, a skilled psychiatrist can construct an explanation of personality and inferences about how such a personality would react in certain situations.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And he can explain his findings in nontechnical terms to a jury. The records here do not show how many interviews were conducted with these defendants or who conducted them. An<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>other basic tool is the collateral study of those close to the subject. See Men-ninger 26 <em>et seq. </em>The record does not show whether there were any interviews of Rollerson\u2019s family, or any studies of his background. The psychiatrists seemed unaware of the existence of the information which Kimble\u2019s relatives told the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">It is axiomatic that a witness must explain the \u201cobservational basis\u201d of his <em>testimony </em>\u2014 i. <em>e., </em>what opportunity he has to observe, what tests he has performed \u2014 in order to' meet even the test of admissibility. 2 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 562. \u201c * * * [I]f the trier believes [\u2018the expert\u2019s opinions\u2019] are logically arrived at, they are accepted; if not, they are rejected. It is precisely because the conclusions of the experts must be weighed in this fashion that it is necessary to probe their bases.\u201d United States v. Amburgey, 189 F.Supp. 687, 695-696 (D.D.C.1960). \u201cTime and resources may not permit taking the psychosocial history of each person committed for a 90-day examination, or engaging in extensive personal interviews, or making a collateral investigation. * * * But [the psychiatrists] should advise the court when they have been unable to make the kind of examination required by proper clinical standards because of lack of time, facilities or knowledge.\u201d Jackson v. United States, No. 18225, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 336 F.2d 579, 583; decided Aug. 7, 1964 (separate opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">As far as the psychiatric testimony was concerned, Rollerson and Kimble might as well have been tried <em>in absentia. </em>They were not present in the conclusion-ary labels of the psychiatrists or in the perfunctory leading questions of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">We do not intend to imply that the breakdown of meaningful presentation of evidence is the fault alone of the psychiatrists. Lawyers seem not to ask questions which would elicit meaningful responses. They should approach psychiatric witnesses with the same probing skill with which they question doctors about whiplash injuries or with the attention to detail which they apply to \u201cthe chain of possession\u201d when some piece of physical evidence is introduced.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>paucity and poverty of the psychiatric testimony in these and other cases may be a result of the difficulty of the\u2019concept of insanity, and the relative recency in this jurisdiction of a rule which allows a wide range to psychiatric testimony. The failure to explore the issue of responsibility may also be the result of inadequate resources. See Jackson v. United States, No. 18225, 118 U.S.App.D.C. 341, 336 F.2d 579, decided Aug. 5, 1964; Adams v. United States, 119 U.S.App. D.C.-, 337 F.2d 548, decided Sept. 21, 1964 (dissenting opinion); Criminal Justice Act, P.L. 88-455, Aug. 20, 1964, 78 Stat. 552. Where the community fails to supply \u2014 for those who cannot \u2014 the effort and resources required for an adequate exploration of the issue, the trial becomes a facade of regularity for partial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">During the trial, Rollerson threw a water pitcher which struck the prosecutor on the shoulder. After the jury returned a guilty verdict on the robbery charge, the court found appellant guilty of criminal contempt for throwing the water pitcher and sentenced him to serve an additional year, consecutive to the robbery sentence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">The court tried the contempt under the summary provisions of Rule 42(a), Fed.R.Crim.P.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In Panico v. United States, 375 U.S. 29, 84 S.Ct. 19, 11 L.Ed. 2d 1 (1963), the Supreme Court reviewed a contempt conviction arising from Panico\u2019s conduct during his narcotics trial. The Court agreed that Panico\u2019s conduct was contumacious if he was responsible for his conduct. But there had been conflicting expert testimony about Panico\u2019s competency to stand trial for the narcotics offenses; and shortly after the contempt conviction, he was found to be suffering from schizophrenia and committed to a mental hospital. The Supreme Court held that \u201cthe fair administration of federal criminal justice requires a plenary hearing under Rule 42 (b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to determine the question of the petitioner\u2019s criminal responsibility for his conduct.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We think the same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>Perhaps the mere fact that Rollerson presented enough evidence to raise a jury question about his responsibility for the robbery in July would not require a Rule 42(b) hearing for the contempt committed in February. But the insanity testimony presented by the defense related to incidents in the prison which occurred within a month or two before trial. And the diagnosis at St. Elizabeths Hospital, upon which Dr. Dabney based his conclusion that Rollerson was insane, was made between October and December. Thus there was a substantial issue of Rollerson\u2019s responsibility for his conduct at trial, and the contempt conviction must be reversed for new proceedings under Rule 42(b).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">The question of Rollerson\u2019s responsibility for his courtroom conduct affects our disposition of his robbery conviction as well. As we have noted, the jury\u2019s verdict is sustained by the evidence. However, Rollerson\u2019s conduct at trial was sharply prejudicial to the jury\u2019s consideration of his defense. If his acts resulted from mental illness, they suggest that he was unable at the time to assist in his defense. Thus, a serious question would arise whether he was also incompetent to stand trial. On the facts of this case, we think that the District Court, if it determines that Rollerson\u2019s .acts thus resulted, must vacate his conviction and order a new trial, which should be held only after it has been judicially determined that Rollerson is competent to stand trial.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Since Rollerson\u2019s contempt conviction, a majority of the Supreme Court has indicated in United States v. Barnett, 376 U.S. 681, 84 S.Ct. 984, 12 L.Ed.2d 23 (1964), that the punishment which may be imposed after a non-jury contempt conviction is limited to that provided for petty offenses. The Supreme Court did not specify further, but we think we may take our guide from the D.C.Code provision governing trial by jury.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> D.C.Code, \u00a7 ll-715a, whose constitutionality was upheld in District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 57 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937), allows the Court of General Sessions to proceed without a jury in criminal cases where the offense carries a penalty of up to ninety days, but guarantees a right to jury trial for all offenses which may be punished by imprisonment for more than ninety days. Accordingly we think it proper to instruct the District Court that if on remand it proceeds without a jury, it can impose no greater imprisonment than ninety days.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">So ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">WILBUR K.

Appellant also claims the insanity instructions on the robbery charge gave the erroneous impression that the defendant bore the burden of proving insanity, contrary to the holdings in Davis v.

This is a good example of \u201cconclusory testimony.\u201d The psychiatrist testified flatly that he did not consider \u201cparanoid personality\u201d a mental disease. <em>No </em>one asked him and he did not volunteer any reasons or any explanation for this position. Yet it is a complicated position. The American Psychiatric Association\u2019s <em>Diagnostic and Statistical Manual </em>classifies \u201cparanoid personality\u201d as a mental disorder. Standard texts treat it as a personality pattern disturbance requiring treatment. See Ewalt &amp; Farns-worth, Textbook of Psychiatry, Oh. 10 (1963). This authority says \u201cDynamic Psychiatry believes that these disturbances have their roots in the interaction between a person\u2019s biology, psychological development, and milieu (especially parents). The circumstances are such that he does not become psychotic, but lives his life defending against illness, in a kind of \u2018brinksmanship.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 126. Other authorities classify \u201cparanoid personality\u201d as a step on a continuum to full paranoia. See Noyes &amp; Kolb, Modern Clinical Psychiatry, Ch. 26, Psychotic Disorders. It seems that paranoid personality is a mental condition which does not greatly disorganize a man. Thus, Dr. Platkin was probably testifying that a paranoid personality should be held responsible for his acts, not that he was free in an absolute sense from mental disease. The testimony was therefore \u201cconclusory\u201d in two senses: the witness was apparently testifying to a legal conclusion, <em>i. e., </em>the defendant is responsible, rather than a medical opinion; and he stated his conclusion, <em>i. e., </em>paranoid personality is not a mental disease, without explanation of its basis. He was thus performing a jury function, McDonald v. United States, <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. Dr. Platkin, when asked the basis for his conclusion that Kimble was sane, said: \u201c[A]t the time he came in he gave us something of a history of his life, as well as he could recall, from certain collateral information. We also had some history about his background. Certain tests were made. Certain observations were made. And all of this information put together was such that in my opinion there was no present mental illness * * *_\u2019&gt;</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b322-7\">. The only test discussed in any detail in either case was the electroencephalogram, or EEG. While useful to detect organic brain damage, it appears that the EEG is not completely accurate for that purpose and has no relation at all to serious mental diseases not resulting from or accompanied by organic abnormality.

Karl' Menninger describes the ideal diagnostic summary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-10\">\u201cFinally, it is necessary to explain as well as we can how [the patient\u2019s mental condition] came about. This explanation should be written with a minimum of technical jargon and should endeavor to interpret the illness as seen in the light of background and environment in some logical way. It is not enough to say that a patient has a schizophrenic syndrome; why does this patient have the symptoms of that syndrome at this particular time, and what can we expect? This is what relatives and referring physicians and judges and others want to know * * *. The emphasis will differ in different cases, but the object is in all cases to explain as welt as possible the relations of the various kinds of data to each other.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b322-12\">Menninger at 94.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">. See the suggested questioning in Flan-nery, <em>Meeting the Insanity Defense, </em>51 J.Cbim.L. 309, 315 (1960); Goldstein &amp; Fine, <em>The Indigent Accused, the Psychiatrist, and the Insanity Defense, </em>110-U.Pa.L.Rev. 1061, 1064-65 (1962), describe the relationship between the psychiatrist and the defense counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">\u201cIt is far easier to agree on the importance of the psychiatric witness to the defense than on the functions he should perform. All to often it is assumed that he is needed only to examine the accused before trial and to appear as a witness at the trial. Yet if the issues are to be clearly defined and developed by the parties in the manner contemplated by an adversary system, it will be necessary for him to do much more. Expert testimony does not arise full-blown. It must be prepared with a sensitive concern for the context in which it is to be presented. Problems of communication must be met and overcome. Stereotypes entertained by lawyer and expert must be dispelled. Assumptions and workways must be explored and understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201cThe very first contact between lawyer and psychiatrist, the request that a mental examination be performed, provides a useful illustration. Unless each has some sense of the purpose of the examination, it will not be satisfactory one. [sic] If, for example, that purpose is to ascertain competence to stand trial, it may call for different procedures than if the purpose is to determine sanity at the time of the crime or to determine whether civil commitment is presently warranted. The length and nature of the interviews, the need for psychological and neurological tests, the gathering of the defendant\u2019s life history \u2014 all will depend upon the degree to which the lawyer understands where the psychiatrist\u2019s competence ends and that- of psychologists, neurologists, and other specialists begins, and the degree to which psychiatrists understand enough about a trial to appreciate their limited role in it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-14\">\u201cIdeally, this preparation will make clear to the psychiatrist that his testimony is merely one stage in a series of phased presentations of material; that the ultimate objective of his testimony and of the rules of evidence which control its presentation is the portrayal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>of this defendant and his act in terms meaningful to judge and jury. In pursuit of that objective, he must not be tempted to out-lawyer the lawyers. He is not obligated to manipulate concepts to attain objectives he thinks desirable; nor is he obligated to offer his opinion on matters of which he has no knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">\u201cIf this exploration of issues does occur before the psychiatrist conducts his examination, it will inevitably educate the lawyer in some of the intricacies of psychiatry so that he will be better equipped to perform his role. The lawyer who is unfamiliar with the point at which knowledge of mental life slides over into conjecture can hardly be expected to examine his own witness skillfully, much less his adversary\u2019s, or to make intelligent decisions about the kinds of witnesses he needs to prove or disprove various illnesses. He must be familiar with the usage of terms like \u2018schizoid\u2019 or \u2018paranoid,\u2019 their relation to the psychoses of schizophrenia or paranoia, the distinction between an acute state and a state of remission, the psychotic\u2019s often rational behavior, and the manner in which hallucinations and delusions differ from daydreams and firm convictions.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b324-13\">.

Appellant claims the water pitcher incident so prejudiced the jury\u2019s consideration of the robbery charge that there should have been a mistrial. In the alternative he argues that if he was not entitled to a mistrial because the prejudice was his own fault, then he will be entitled to a mistrial if in the <em>P\u00e1nico </em>hearing it is found he was not responsible for his courtroom conduct. Whether in either circumstance a mistrial was in order, defense counsel did not request one. Rather he agreed to the court\u2019s suggestion that the jury be charged to ignore the incident except as it might shed light on Rollerson\u2019s insanity defense. In these circumstances, we think the court\u2019s failure to declare a mistrial is not error. However, if the <em>P\u00e1nico </em>hearing results in a finding that appellant was not responsible for his courtroom conduct, we think for other reasons a new trial must be granted, note 15 <em>infra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b325-12\">.
